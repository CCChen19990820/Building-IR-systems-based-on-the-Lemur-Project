&gt; I thought that [garage door] openers operated in the microwave range;
&gt; isn't this power level of transmission unhealthy?

Most garage door openers that I've encountered operate in the 380MHz range.
Water resonates at 2.4GHz.  Besides, the power level is only a few tens of
milliwatts.

Marc Mengel ... exactly illustrates why this is a gray area.  Suppose that they
didn't pick out the letters but were distributing the whole page?  Cleary a
violation of copyright.  Individual columns?  Still a clear violation.
Indiviual pixels?  Clearly permitted, but only because they used no NYT
information content.  Why bother digitizing the NYT to get bits in simple
patterns when you can generate them yourself?  Somewhere in between (around the
word or letter level) lies a gray area.

My (moral) conclusion is that if its worth copying something then there is
value in whats being copyied.  If the value derives from effort that is not
required to make the copy then there ought to be a way to protect that effort.

I am currently (re)writing our Univ. policy on "computer misuse".  Rather
than reinvent the wheel, I ask anyone who has access to an enforceable, yet
comprehensive policy statement to please share it with me.  My research
to date has shown many universities to be behind in their written-published
policies.  I believe courts will find that policies written before
networking and viruses are of little value.  I will be glad to post the

Incoming-call ID is a difficult problem.  Still, doesn't a person, in the
privacy of Home, have the right to an "electronic peep-hole" to control his/her
privacy?

This is a larger issue than screening out the vendors who call at dinnertime.
The police and telecos simply are ineffective at dealing with persistent,
harrasing and/or obscene callers.  Their methods are cumbersome and
non-responsive to the harrassment.

Any caller can protect his/her privacy by calling from a work phone (which is a
very common practice, prohibitions notwithstanding) or from a pay phone.

Incidentally, what is the "scope" of Incoming Call-ID?  Does it identify only
calls from the same central office?  local calling area? area code?  or
country?  A function similar to Incoming Call-ID is how our teleco gathers
"evidence" on harrassing phone calls.  The harrassed plaintiff keeps a
date/time log of objectionable calls; the teleco may be able to tell the
originating phone number.  However, in our case, it could resolve only phone
numbers in the same central office as the harrassee and, perhaps, a small
number of other, specified, central offices.

I'm a firm believer in privacy, too.  But that includes my right to privacy in
my own home.

In discussing "Risks of telephone access to your bank account," Michael
McClary relates the identifying information required to transfer funds
by telephone, then observes:

&gt; Now combine that with cellular phones that:
&gt;  - are not scrambled,
&gt;  - don't switch channels enough to break up a conversation,
&gt;  - can be rec[ei]ved on the high end of an old TV set's UHF dial
&gt;  - are generally owned by busy people with money
&gt; and you've got the makings of some nasty surprises.

Get the word out, folks:  CELLULAR PHONE IS NOT "TELEPHONE."  IT'S
BROADCAST RADIO!  DON'T SAY ANYTHING ON CELLULAR PHONE THAT YOU WOULDN'T
SAY ON YOUR LOCAL RADIO STATION!

Some years back, when ATMs were first coming out, I signed up for a card at my
bank.  The first time I used it was a memorable experience.  The machine was
very primitive.  Instead of a CRT, it had colored buttons with messages like
"Insert card" or "Enter your PIN" which were illuminated to instruct the user.
I dutifully inserted my card and followed the instructions.  "Clickety click!"
responded the machine, and then told me to enter my PIN.  After each action on
my part, there was a noticeable pause and more "clickety clicks" from the
machine.  I soon decided that the clicks were there to keep me, the poor dumb
user, occupied while the machine communicated with the host.  This struck me as
terribly funny, and I began to chuckle.  Each set of clicks made me laugh
harder, and people were beginning to stare.  The best part was yet to come:
when the machine finally spit out the money, it was crisp and new - and WARM,
as if it had just been printed! It was all I could do not to roll around on the
floor laughing; I grabbed the money and my card and left.

A couple of years later, one of the bank's systems programmers explained the
machines to me.  "Oh," he said very seriously, "the clicks really had a
purpose.  The machine had no link to the bank; instead it had a ticker tape
inside, and it recorded every transaction (hence the clicks.)  A technician
came around every day, collected the tape (which was keyed into the bank's main
computer) and refreshed the money supply."  And as for the crisp new bills?
"Well, those machines were so cantankerous that they would jam if anything but
new money was used."

As usual, there was a logical reason for everything the computer did.  I think
I liked my interpretation better.

The moral is, these machines were vulnerable to the kind of attack mentioned in
RISKS 8.37.  They depended on the cooperation of the user not to go around and
collect $300 from each machine.  Security via ignorance....

&gt;"The adoption of an identity card, at least on a voluntary basis, which would
&gt;carry such numbers - name, date of birth, nationality, signature and perhaps
&gt;blood group - would surely be an advantage for everybody...

Of course, "voluntary" is likely to mean "compulsory" very quickly, unless
this is specifically illegal.  I have neither an age-of-majority card (the
only legal proof of drinking age here) nor a driver's licence, and you'd
be surprised at the looks this sometimes gets me.

Blood group, eh?  How soon before AIDS-test status gets included?

&gt;... GIVEN THAT TECHNOLOGY SHOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGE THEM,
&gt;such cards could quickly establish one's bona fide. . . ."

This runs into the same problem that (I understand) Germany ran into after
WW2.  There were many people with little or no identification in the chaos
that followed Germany's defeat.  Some of them were wanted men.  There was
felt to be a need for one solid form of ID, something sufficiently well-
researched to be definitive.  The obvious choice was the passport.  What
this meant, in practice, was that if one could get a forged passport (not
easy, but not impossible), nobody would ever question one's new identity.

From The Boston Globe, Thursday, March 9, 1989:

  Most workers in survey think employers use electronic means to spy on them

By Ronald Rosenberg, Globe Staff

     A survey said that 75 percent of mostly unionized workers in Greater
Boston feel ``spied on at their jobs'' by electronic monitoring.

     The survey, conducted by the Massachusetts Coalition on new Office
Technology, which represents over 40 unions and women's organizations, has
filed state legislation that would require notifying employees in advance of
any monitoring or surveillance.  A legislative hearing on the measure is
scheduled Monday at the State House.

     Several insurance firms, banks, airlines and industry groups oppose the
legislation, saying it is unnecessary and violates an employer's right to
monitor how employees work.

     At issue is the use of computerized or electronic monitoring systems to
keep track of an employee's work performance and activities.  This kind of
surveillance includes computer monitoring where the computer counts keystrokes,
error rate, time to complete each task and break time.

     Another way checking [sic] on employee productivity is service observation
where supervisors listen into conversations between employees and customers.

     A third form, known as telephone call accounting, monitors the time,
length and destination of all calls dialed from each extension but does not
record the conversation.  It is used by telemarketing firms and large sales
organizations.

     ``There have been clear abuses of electronic monitoring and it violates a
person's right of privacy and right of due process,'' said Lisa Gallatin, the
coalition's executive director.

While "faking" electronic mail may be easy, it's not as easy as faking
"physical" mail.  More specifically, getting some company or university
letterhead (or having some printed, for that matter) and typing up a letter
requires less specific knowledge than hacking some system's SMTP mailer,
for example.

However, people perceive computers as being reasonably secure entities, and
therefore they assume that electronic mail generated by a computer system
is genuine.

While an organization such as NSF, which is accepting reviews of proposals
via electronic mail, should be concerned about the authenticity of reviews
it receives, reviews sent by electronic mail are, in the long run, no more
or less likely to be bogus than those sent by surface mail.

&gt; &gt; Walter Roberson in <A HREF="/Risks/8.27.html">RISKS-8.27</A>
&gt; &gt;How about the
&gt; &gt;other way around: how much danger is there that someone can spoof mail in
&gt; &gt;order to receive messages destined for someone else?
&gt; 
&gt; The only way I know of doing this is if your machine is on the path for
&gt; the mail in the first place, in which case you can look at everything
&gt; that passes through anyway.

All it takes is a published "mysite  uunet(LOCAL), att(LOCAL)".
Now that most sites on the net use automated routing with pathalias,
a sysadmin with long-term general spying goals need only show very fast
connections to major sites in the system's official UUCP map entries.
Within a few months a lot of mail from nearby sites will be coming
through.  Keeping a copy of everything that passes through is as
trivial as setting a #define in smail.

Recently, while watching my kids watch Saturday cartoons, I noticed a "Computer
Minute" public service type add from the network. In it, the father, who was
portrayed as clueless, was trying to organize his towering stack of papers. His
son, Hacker, tried to tell dad all about Data Base Management Systems. Why,
even sister had her (girl stuff) on the computer, and gee, mom had her
recipies. Hacker had his (boy stuff) on it as well. Having only seen one, I
don't know for certain, but given the girl's name (which I don't remember, but
wasn't computer-oriented), and the son's name, it seemed to perpetuate the
young male as the hacker stereotype.

Relationship to risks? Well, I've seen discussions on the term "hacker," and on
comics and computing.

In view of all the postings a while back about runaway software projects,
I found very interesting these excerpts from GOVERNMENT COMPUTER NEWS, 
Feb. 20, 1989, p. 59:

ARMY TO CONVERT `CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM' TO ADA by Karen D. Schwarz

The Army issued a request for information last month to convert its
All Source Analysis System (ASAS) to Ada code.  ...  ASAS is being 
developed by the Joint Tactical Fusion Program Management Office (JTFPMO)
on behalf of the Army and the Air Force.  It has been in development for more
than 10 years. ...

More than 800,000 lines of code have been written in FORTRAN 77 so far.
The project is expected to begin using Ada code in fiscal 1991.  By that
time, more than 1 million lines of FORTRAN 77 code also will have been 
written.

A document detailing JTFMPO's major programs refers to ASAS as the "central
nervous system" guiding field commanders in battle.  ASAS is a key component
of the Army Command and Control System and will automate command and control
of intelligence/electronic warfare operations.  ASAS will fuse raw battlefield
data into intelligence for analysis on a workstation.  The services can then
distribute resulting information to battlefield commanders, fire support
elements and the Air Force to help control electronic warfare equipment. ...

The project is scheduled to be completed sometime after the year 2000. 
Although he would not estimate the total costs of the program, deputy
for plans and integration at JTFPMO Bennet Hart said software costs alone
might exceed $100 million over the life of the contract. ...

The JTFPMO has received many replies to the request for information, Hart 
said.  "Response from industry has been very good.  No one is conspicuous by
their absence."

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., currently holds a 
contract for the first phase of the project.

Here are excerpts from ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING TIMES, Feb. 20 1989, p. 28:

High-integrity uP wins first big order: Railroad signals go-ahead for Viper
by Roger Woolnough

Worcester, England --- In the first significant order for the chip, the
Australian National Railways Commission has placed a contract for signaling
systems incorporating Viper to control two long-distance rail routes.  ...

Viper is a 32-bit RISC device designed to overcome the shortcomings of
conventional microprocessors, which can be unreliable in safety-critical
applications because they can perform in unpredictable ways.  The design
of Viper was undertaken using formal mathematical methods and was then
subjected to a series of formal proofs to ensure that the implementation
conforms to the design specification. ... 

In Australia, the contract to develop and supply railroad signaling equipment
using Viper was won by Teknis Systems (Australia) Pty. Ltd.  Support was
provided by Charter Technologies Ltd. (the British Viper specialist), and
the two companies believe that proposing Viper as the system processor was
a major factor in Teknis being chosen against strong competition.

The contract is to design and supply signaling for automatic crossing sections
on the Trans Australian and the Central Australian rail routes, operated
by the Australian National Railways Commission, a federal government statutory
authority. ...

The installations will include trackside equipment, systems on board trains,
radio links and a computer-controlled center in Adelaide. ...

Formal methods will be used throughout the development. ... Charter
Technologies is sponsoring a study by the Department of Engineering in the
University of Warwick, England, into the use of formal methods for railroad
signalling. ...

Railroad signalling systems around the world are based on concepts of
interlocking and routing which have developed over the past 150 years.  The
first-class safety record of railroads is due to a large extent to the rigor of
the regulations.

The aim of the joint study by Charter Technologies and Warwick University is to
consider whether the well-established rules can be formulated in a mathematical
way, so as to suit the increasing use of computer-controlled interlocking and
routing.  ... It will consider the application of the specification language
HOL developed at the University of Cambridge, England; programming in subsets
of computer languages such as Pascal; and the use of Viper. ...

The Finnish Post and Telepohone office was March 6 changing call-routing
specifications in one of three main computer-controlled switches at Helsinki,
the capital of Finland. Some of necessary changes was forgotten.  To this end
traffic via the switch was broken for two hours. The error was located and
corrected in six hours. Domestic calls were turned to go via two correctly
functioning switches. But some international calls, for example, to Canada,
Portugal, Iran, Turkey and Cyprus were totally hindered.

As a remedy to prevent similar errors in the future systems analysts propose a
programmed checking for implementation of all the necessary changes.

I just sat through a user's group demo of a new shareware package called
BackMail, which is a background electronic mail package for MS-DOS.  It is a
slick program with many fine features for supporting local and long-distance
mail networks.  The authors were leery of the standard shareware registration
procedure.  Quoting from the BackMail Newsletter:

	"The problem was that the whole process of payment
    was so cumbersome.  If only there was a simple way to
    communicate one's payment... Hold it!  Communication is
    just what BackMail was about.  We had the first program
    that could be used to _literally_ pay for itself!
	And so TeleWare was born."

Yes, your copy of BackMail is registered by filling in a screen
with your credit card information and the program automatically
calls an 800 number to deliver the information.  And most users
will register ($30), since BackMail asks you to register on every
fourth access of the program's main functions, and complains for
twenty seconds if you don't register.

The risks of this scheme for freely redistributable shareware are
obvious, from simply patching the stored 800 number to saving the
credit card information and making one "extra call" at the
program's convenience.

The specific incident may not have been mentioned in RISKS, but the general
technique is widely enough known that it is casually mentioned in the hacker
periodicals (such as the magazine "2600") when they run an article of tips for
beginners.  If you are having trouble getting into someone's system, call up
their consulting office and act like you are authorized but encountering
unexpected trouble logging in; often someone there will give you just the clues

Backround:
A bill to require all major football (Soccer) grounds in the UK to require
a valid machine readable membership card before admitting a spectator is
currently going through Parliament. The clubs will be given lists of people who
should not be admitted; the object is to stop violence in the grounds. 

Several objections have been raised - 
Civil Liberties:
 People object to having to carry the cards, and to having football clubs 
 provided with information about them.
Practicalities:
 The card readers, turnstiles, or the computer controlling them may fail,
 leaving thousands of angry fans outside. 

Last month New Scientist carried an item describing a proposed solution, 
remotely readable and writeable smart-cards. (In this case the card has to be 
writeable to prevent it being passed over the fence and used again.) The cards
are made by Plessey and  the read/write range is quoted as about a meter;
power is taken from the signal. 

Consider the risks: the card can be read (AND WRITTEN) without you knowing and
without your control. Obviously the card could check that it was being 
interrogated by a legal reader using some kind of validation (public key 
challenge and response?) but there will be a limit to how much processing
the card can do and as the reader has to broadcast to activate the card, it
may be very easy to record a dialog and spoof either the card or reader.

&gt; From msb Fri Feb 24 06:40:01 1989
&gt; To: utzoo!attcan!uunet!csl.sri.com!risks
&gt; Subject: Re: so-called multi-gigabuck theft of information
&gt; Bcc: hcr!mike

There appeared in Risks 8.23 my summary of a newspaper item I'd noticed
about what was said to be a "theft" of highly valuable computer data.
A followup newspaper article, which I summarized in Risks 8.28, provided
a good deal more information and placed a much lower value on the data,
but while it identified the victim (HCR Corp., of Toronto), it did not
identify the "stolen" data.

So I was surprised to see Jeff Makey assert in 8.26, which I read after
submitting my second item, that what was taken was a copy of the UNIX source.
I emailed him and he replied in part:

&gt; I heard it *somewhere* during the last few months (it seems like
&gt; it was before Christmas, which is why I said it wasn't news).

Since the HCR case was much more recent, Jeff had to be talking about
a different one.  In fact, with that hint I remember the one he had in
mind; the confusing thing is that it happened to also have occurred in
the same geographical area.  (Toronto: Canadian computer crime capital?)

The earlier case hasn't been mentioned in Risks before. [???]  What happened,
as I recall, was that someone bought a used computer at auction, found a copy
of the UNIX source on its disks, and claimed all rights (!) to use the source,
thus making the newspapers.  AT&amp;T of course disagreed, and I believe the case
dropped out of the news before it was resolved.

Someone I was chatting about this with conjectured that the $4 billion
(Canadian) valuation that appeared in the first newspaper article might
have resulted from a reporter also confusing the two cases and assuming
that because HCR has UNIX source then that must be the valuable thing in
question, and then taking the highest possible valuation.  Such a speculation
would also explain why the second article suddenly started talking about
AT&amp;T, which had not been mentioned in connection with the case.  Simple
press speculation/sensationalism.

Of course, there's more than one way to value copyable things like computer
programs or data.  It's correct to say that the UNIX source is worth kilo-
bucks because you can buy a copy for your own use for that much.  It's also
correct to say that it's worth gigabucks, if that's how much money AT&amp;T
earns from it over the lifespan of the system.  In addition, one must
distinguish between theft and illegal copying.  The former, I think, would
be better defined as involving loss to the owner of one or more copies of the
original.  (Of course, the newspapers prefer to use the more dramatic word.)
Anyway, if ALL copies were stolen in this sense, then the value of the
loss to the owner suddenly becomes much greater.

Also since submitting to Risks the second newspaper article, I have spoken
to Mike Tilson, president of HCR, who was quoted in it.  He confirmed
that the first article was "wildly inaccurate" and the second one was
substantially, though not entirely, correct.  (He noted that Risks readers
ought to be aware of the risks of believing what they read in the paper...)
He also confirmed that HCR was not saying what was taken, only that they had
regained complete control of it.

So I think that wraps up this case as far as Risks is concerned.

An AI friend of mine told me recently that most expert systems have a
relatively short useful lifespan.  It seems that if you assign a human
to operate the system, the human will soon stop using the ES, and do a
better, faster job without it.  The ES makes an excellent training
system, however, and creating it does a good job of recording what the
job entails, information which is often lost when people change jobs.

The following appeared in the March 13 Wall Street Journal:

Human Meter Readers Step Toward Extinction

Meter readers' jobs are being threatened by technology.

Boston Gas Co. recently became the firsr utility in the country to commit
itself to installing a radio-based automated meter-reading system for all its
customers.  It plans to install the AccuRead system, made by Enscan Inc. of
Minneapolis, in some 400,000 homes at a cost of over $20 million.  The system
will eliminate most of the utility's 100 meter readers who make an average of
$28,000 a year.

The AccuRead system ... uses a cigarette-pack-sized radio receiver and
transmitter that is attached to the gas meter.  The device counts the number of
times the dials spin.  Once a month, a computer-equipped van cruises the
streets nearby and sends out a "wake-up" signal to the reader device, which
then transmits the gas consumption. the devices have 10-year batteries and a 32
year meantime between failures, Enscan says.

Boston Gas says the remote readings have a number of pluses.  Homeowners don't
have to be in for readings; unlike humans, THE DEVICES DON'T MAKE MISTAKES, and
the information can be sent automatically from the van to the billing computer
without retyping.

Moreover, says a spokesman: " It will elimimate estimated bills which
are the biggest complaint we have...."

....no doubt the devices are as reliable as the average garage door opener.

While "everybody knows" or should know that electronic mail is not secure in
that its contents can be read en route, the reason people generally trust 
their email as being authentic is because it usually is; that is, there has 
been very little email forgery hence it hasn't been much of a problem, thus
people tend to regard their email as being genuine.  When it starts to become 
a problem, people will stop trusting it, at least when it's important.

It seems that faking comments on a grant proposal would be prosecutable as
fraud.

As for security from interception, a DES encryption program that is free of 
U.S. export controls (as it was written and distributed from outside the
country) was recently posted to one of the Usenet source groups.  By using
this and something like uuencode (a common program on Usenet that reversibly 
maps unprintable characters to printable ones) on one's text, one can keep 
their mail private from the prying eyes of most individuals.

The security of one's electronic mail from decryption by the National
Security Agency is a different matter, and one that I hope is merely
academic to most RISKS readers.  As to whether or not they can relatively
easily decrypt DES-encoded material, let me say that I would not expect
such a group to widely promote an encryption scheme that they were incapable
of breaking and that, from a national security standpoint, doing so would
not be such a good idea.

Within the Internet, it is my understanding that the steering committee has
endorsed the RSA encryption scheme for email.  This addresses both the
privacy and forgery issues.  I think we will see further movement toward 
routine encryption of email, and it is high time that we do so.

Cellular phone data encryption is a relatively simple matter as well.  I don't
think we'll see any movement in that area until the users demand it, and the
government isn't likely to push heavily for it, a few strong proponents of
personal privacy in the legislature nonwithstanding.

This (including threats to take over the ship) has already happened on
Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Data was playing Sherlock Holmes in a
computer-generated simulacrum, but since he had memorised all existing
Holmes plots, the computer was asked to come up with a new one, involving
an enemy "capable of defeating Data."  Because Data, unlike Holmes, lives
in the "real" world, this one-word slip produced an opponent also capable
of affecting the "real" world, which attempted to take over the ship.

It was portrayed more as a question of sentience (the conclusion was that
the created personality was stored until technically feasible to give it
corporeal existence), but we had a computer program, in this case
inadvertantly created (grave RISK indeed!), attempting to control the ship.

I suspect that treating the problem directly, the writres will massacre
the issues.  But I may just be overly pessimistic.

I hope I am not the only one to notice the irony in the parallel
discussions regarding, on the one hand, concern about the possibility of
spoofing source addresses in Internet mail (most often done in practice
to gain anonymity), and other hand, privacy concerns about calling party
identification in the telephone network.

Two things seem clear to me.

1. As a telephone subscriber, I should have the right to demand
identification from anyone ringing my phone.

2. As a telephone subscriber, I should have the right to remain
anonymous when making a call if I so choose.

The obvious solution to these conflicting requirements is to have the
telephone system arbitrate a negotiation between the caller and called
parties. If a caller wishes to remain anonymous, he should be able to
say so when he dials his call. If the called party has chosen to demand
identification, then the network should refuse to complete the call and
explain why to the caller -- without ringing the called party's phone.

If the calling party has not requested anonymity, there is no reason to
deny the called party this information.  I see no reason to condemn a
promising new service like Caller ID when a relatively simple
enhancement could satisfy the privacy concerns of both parties.

(This is my personal view, and is not necessarily the view of my employer). Phil

I think Brint Cooper underestimates the technological possibilities
when he(?) writes: 
  Incoming-call ID is a difficult problem.  Still, doesn't a person, in the
  privacy of Home, have the right to an "electronic peep-hole" to control
  his/her privacy?

We can have our cake and eat it, too.  As I understand it, it is
possible to have the originating caller notified of the ID process,
and given the opportunity of aborting the call rather than being
identified.  BUT only if your local phone company gets enough requests
for this service.

This seems like the ideal compromise:  you have to be willing to be
identified to reach someone, but you are informed that they are
tracing you, and can deny them that service.

The source for this was a WSJ article.  I'm afraid I've forgotten the
exact citation.  If anyone has it, it would probably be of interest to
all the list:  it discussed which phone servers were going to provide
the incoming-call ID service, and which were and weren't going to
install the out I've mentioned above.

The discussion on the pros and cons of incoming-call identification
reminds me of the Confidential Phone service in Northern Ireland.
By calling a widely-advertised number, people in Northern Ireland
can use an answering machine to report information about terrorist
activity to the police/army. The line is supposedly unmonitored,
not traced, and completely confidential.

Some years ago, a popular pastime for bored teenagers was to call the number
from a public phone and start to record some juicy information. They would then
make a noise as if they'd just been stabbed or attacked in some way, and hang
up. It would come as no surprise when a police or army patrol arrived on the
scene within a minute or two. Naturally, the patrol could do nothing, since any
action on their part would expose the "confidential" nature of the system!

I truly hesitate to bring the ANI-wars to risks (they're already a couple of
weeks old on telecom now), but ...  First, this argument is VERY common in this
debate and strikes me as fundamentally off the mark:

&gt; Incoming-call ID is a difficult problem.  Still, doesn't a person, in the
&gt; privacy of Home, have the right to an "electronic peep-hole" to control 
&gt; his/her privacy?

Without going into this at length, I'll just assert that the *correct*
parallel here should be the use of an answering machine to screen your
calls.  The answering machine does EVERYTHING the peephole does and
more (it allows you the privacy of having the person-you're-screening
not even KNOW if you're there doing the screening or not: like
simultaneously having a closed-circuit-TV (which doesn't let the caller
know if you're looking at the monitor or not) *with* an old-style
"chain" that lets you open the door a crack and ask the person who the
hell they are and give them an opportunity to explain what they're up
to, while STILL denying them access to your house.  ANI has nothing to
do with any of this, and by contrast, just a "peephole" is a lot closer
to just answering the phone (the doorbell rings, you have to go to the
door, open the peephole, and choose whether to go farther or not, not
much different than answering the phone and hanging up).

&gt; This is a larger issue than screening out the vendors who call at dinnertime.
&gt; The police and telecos simply are ineffective at dealing with persistent,
&gt; harrasing and/or obscene callers.  Their methods are cumbersome and
&gt; non-responsive to the harrassment.

You made a leap from "privacy" to "harrassment" here.  You can have
more than adequate (IMHO) protection from "harrassment" just by having
*telco* use the ANI machinery on your behalf [as has been suggested:
telco keeps the information about calling parties and releases it ONLY
to folks with a "need to know"].

Regarding incoming-call identification, for this to be usable by most people,
different information than the phone number of the caller must be sent.
Specifically, some kind of logical ID should be at least included, or sent
in place of, a physical ID.  

Consider that if one was restricting incoming calls to a specific set of 
numbers, one could not receive an emergency call from a loved one.  Few 
families would be willing to take this risk, so one the good aspects of 
incoming-call identification, screening calls, would be lost to them.
For incoming call screening to be useful in this case, one would have to
forward a logical ID.  "This is a call from your daughter" rather than
"This is a call from (713) 438-5018."

Similarly, phone solicitors would be required to forward a special ID
indicating that they were calling you with an unsolicited sales pitch.
Thus they could be explicitly excluded.  I think there should be a bit
in the header to indicate whether the call was being handled entirely by 
automatic equipment as many people (myself included) find those calls 
particularly offensive and choice targets for elimination.

The ID would be sent by entering additional digits or by using something
like a credit card with a magnetic stripe.  One must already identify 
oneself by one of these methods when using long distance carriers from 
remote phones.  Cellular phones already identify themselves uniquely as 
well.

Note that similar capabilities are already available in certain high-end
answering machines and corporate voice mail systems whereby one can give
IDs out to people and dispatch calls based on the IDs entered.

To the extent that incoming-number forwarding increases privacy (and implicitly,
honesty) I think it is a good thing.  To the extent that it decreases privacy
(use of it to catch whistle blowers, perform arbitrary surveillance, etc), I
think it is a bad thing.  Simply forwarding the telephone number of the caller
does little to advance the privacy of the individual and is of more use to
business and government, would would have the resources to look up the number
and determine the True Name of the caller, on-line.

In the last issue of Risks, one of the contributors wondered about the
mechanics of Incoming Call ID.  Now, from what I have seen in my intracompany
readings, Incoming Call ID in its most basic form is just a pass through of
standard Central Office ANI functionality, so it would be capable of handing a
complete number of format NPA-NXX-XXXX to the user.

I'm still not sure I fully understand the dynamics of this latest uproar.  The
capability of number ID has been widely touted as a major initial feature of
ISDN for several years now, so I find it interesting that when a telco moves
the notion from business applications to a more home-oriented use the
proverbial balloon finally goes up...

I agree with Brint Cooper in support of incoming-call ID.  Our area will
be getting this service in a few months, and we intend to order it and
buy the $60-70 gadget.  Why?  We have a peculiar, repetitive telephone
number, with the pattern XYY-ZZZZ (we didn't ask for it:  telco assigned
it to us), and we get a large number of unwanted calls in the following
categories:
  1:  "Stutter" wrong numbers.  Somebody wants XYY-ZZZA, ZZAB, or ZABC,
and either the finger stutters on the Touch-Tone pad or the pad
stutters; one or more extra Z's are generated, the extra digits get
thrown away, and they reach me.  Sometimes they're polite ("Oh, I'm
sorry"), sometimes they're rude.
  2:  Crank callers.  For reasons I omit here, our number attracts even
more cranks than you would expect from what I've stated here.
  3:  Prank callers.  I refer here to the deliberate nuisance calls that
come from my daughter's seventh-grade classmates being seventh-graders.
  4:  "Not her father!" calls.  A classmate calls my daughter, hears my
voice (or my wife's), and instead of asking for my daughter simply hangs
up without saying anything.
  5:  Business wrong numbers.  The same XYY-ZZZZ number evidently
belongs to at least two commercial accounts:  in different area codes,
of course, but one of those area codes is the next one over, and another
differs from ours in only one digit.  I know because we've been getting
responses to their newspaper ads.
  6:  Oh, I almost forgot:  random wrong numbers, the same kind as
anybody else gets incoming.

I think that covers it.  Now, incoming call-id won't affect all these
categories, but it WILL give us a tool to use against types 2, 3, and 4.  If we
didn't have the peculiar problems raised by our particular number, I don't know
if we'd bother (though 4, and probably 3, would still be there); but the total
volume of wrong numbers is enough to make us willing to put in the money and
effort to achieve the reduction we expect to get.

Caller-ID recently became available in my exchange in Northern New
Jersey (area code 201). I asked the customer service rep about the
coverage of this service. The answer, somewhat reluctantly divulged
after a bit of prodding, is that the display works only for calls from
other phones in the 201 region, and then only those phones on "suitably
equipped" exchanges (presumably the right kind of ESS's).

This seemed a bit restrictive for a $6/mo service, so I've decided to wait. Phil

I find myself in hearty disagreement to David Albert's stridently stated
position.  This disagreement stems from my opinions about anonymity.  The
anonymity that he seems to be promoting/preserving -- the ability to initiate
and carry on a dialog with either or both parties ignorant of the identities of
the other -- very new social concept.  Even in its current form, it is illusory
at best.

As little as 100 years ago in this country (and currently in much of the world)
in order to talk to someone you have to be in fairly close physical proximity.
This fact makes anonymity almost impossible.  It is not a grave flaw in
societies where this is the case.

It should be pointed out that in societies where "anonymity" is not technically
ensured, it is ensured by trust.  Even now in our society, the real assurance
that no one will find out who you are is that no one will look.  (In most
modern phone networks your veil of anonymity is tissue paper.)  For all of the
institutions that David feels are threatened by technology, trust will suffice.
If any of those institutions violates that trust, it will find itself unused.
If unused, unfunded.  Either the service proves itself worthy of trust or it
disappears.

Where's the RISK?  Looking for and believing in hardware solutions to purely
"wetware" problems.  If trust is the problem, it must be fixed in people (their
attitudes and organizations) not in their appliances.  Machines may make
humankind more powerful but machines do not make them more trustworthy.

BTW - I will take David's advice and write to the people he mentions.
I will write in support of the concept that, on my discretion, to talk 
to me you must surrender your anonymity.

[ From the Montreal Gazette, 21 March 1989 ]

OUTDATED CODES MADE U.S. MISSILES USELESS

WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The White House said yesterday obsolete electronic-launch
codes were fed into an unspecified number of US land-based nuclear missiles
several years ago, making them temporarily useless.

"In 1986, a few of the missiles in one squadron at Malstrom Air Force Base were
found to contain outdated codes.  The actual number of missiles involved in the
incident remains classified; however, the ...  [sic] alert rate remained above
98 per cent," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  The base Fitzwater referred to
is a Strategic Air Command installation in west-central Montana.  He said the
outdated codes, which would have kept air force personnel from launching the
missiles in the event of war, were discovered during an annual code change.
The presidential spokesman said launch codes for the 1000 US Minuteman
strategic missiles are changed every year, as are codes at the country's 100
launch centres.  "Presumably, the situation has been corrected," he said.

Fitzwater's comments were prompted by a report in the Washington Times, a
right-wing newspaper with strong ties to the White House, which said it
confirmed the error after an eight-month investigation.  While Fitzwater said
the exact number of missiles found to be inoperable is secret, he said: "There
weren't very many of these missiles involved."  The newspaper reported five of
the 1000 US land-based missiles, each armed with three nuclear warheads, were
temporatilily disabled but it said the incident raises questions about the
security and safeguards of all of them.

DYING BATTERIES CALL THE POLICE  [ From the Montreal Gazette, 21 March 1989 ]

CLEVELAND (Reuter) -Dozens of calls to police and fire-emergency lines have
been traced to cordless telephones that short-circui and dial 911 as their
batteries start to die, officials said yesterday.  One suburban police
deparment said it received as many as 25 such calls a day.  A Cleveland police
communications expert said it appears failing batteries caused the devices to
emit pulses that sometimes duplicated a 911 call.

[ Aside from the obvious nuisance factor, there is clear risk if emergency
personel are accustomed to receiving many such calls - they may attribute the
next inexplicable call to a faulty phone.  			Henry Cox ]

The following item, reproduced in its entirity (without permission) from
the 20 March issue of Digital Review (a DEC-oriented weekly) is both
relevent to security discussions and funny to boot (pun intended).

  COMPANY "SAW" SECURITY PROBLEM FOR MICROVAXES

  You neven know what people are going to do next with a MicroVAX.

  System managers at London's Midland Bank, one of Great Britain's largest
  clearinghouses, originally felt that their MicroVAXes should be located
  in the wholesale systems department.

  But the folks who run MIS at Midland decided that this solution was not
  secure enough, and that the company's computer room would provide a 
  safer location.

  The security of the computer room, however, was called into question one
  weekend afternoon.

  "On a Saturday, one of my guys went into the computer room and saw a 
  carpenter in the process of modifying the room," said Jamie May, project
  manager for the wholesale systems department at Midland.  This carpenter
  was using two of the MicroVAXes as a kind of workbench to try and balance
  the wood he was sawing.

  "The dealers can sometimes be animals, but the computers would have been
  a lot better off and secure in the dealing room," May added.

dramatic statement that shocked me:  he claimed that cellular phones were
extremely hazardous and probably highly carcinogenic.

This is completely outside my area of expertise, so I can only repeat what he
said.  He claimed that the frequency wavelengths used for cellular phone radio
transmissions were just about equal to the diameter of the human brain cavity.
This, he claimed, accelerated by the fact that the receiver is always held up
against the human skull, sets up highly dangerous conditions within the human
brain.  He said that ten years or so from now we're going to see an explosive
increase in brain tumors among cellular phone users.  He also claimed that some
cellular units were far more hazardous than others, but that ALL of them are
carcinogenic.  He said he won't even work on them, and wouldn't wish a cellular
phone on his worst enemy.  This guy is rather eccentric at times, but his
knowledge of electronics is legendary.  His co-workers seemed to share his
opinions; one of their technicians was severely injured some years back by
climbing on a transmission tower during a high-intensity transmission.  Whether
this guy knows anything about human physiology is another question.  Is this
nonsense, an urban myth, or is this actually a matter of risk?

An article by Kim Murphy in the 16 March 1989 'Los Angeles Times' reports on
the disposition of the case against Kevin Mitnick, "who prosecutors said was as
dangerous with a keyboard as a bank robber with a gun."  [See RISKS 7.95 and
8.3 for earlier reports.]  Edited excerpts from the latest article:

   Mitnick pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud and one count of
   possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes.  He admitted
   penetrating a DEC computer in Mass., secretly obtaining a copy of a
   sophisticated computer security program which the company had spent 
   $1 million to develop.  The program, said Mitnick's attorney, was 
   designed to alert companies when their computers had been penetrated 
   by hackers like Mitnick.  Mitnick never attempted to sell or distribute 
   the program, he said.  Mitnick also admitted possessing 16 unauthorized
   MCI long-distance codes than enabled him to make long-distance telephone
   calls without charge.  A prosecutor said Mitnick used the codes to make
   connections to computers.

   Mitnick faces one year in prison.  Under a plea agreement with the
   government, he must also submit to three years' supervision by probation
   officers after his release from prison.  Prosecutors said they agreed to
   a 12-month sentence because the amount of financial damage was relatively
   low.  DEC lost about $100,000 to $200,000 in computer "down time" 
   investigating the security program theft.  As part of the plea agreement,
   prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional counts charging Mitnick with
   illegally accessing the Leeds Univ. computer in England and separate 
   charge related to the DEC computer program.

Brint Cooper makes the point that cellular phone isn't "telephone", it's radio.
True enough, the braindamaged ECPA notwithstanding. But even calls placed
between conventional telephones can, on occasion, be almost as easily
intercepted.

To demonstrate:

1. Obtain or set up a standard TVRO (Television Receive Only) satellite
earth station. The receiver should have a "composite video" output jack
(now pretty much standard, since VideoCipher descramblers need them).

2. Connect the aforementioned composite video jack into the RF input of
a garden variety "shortwave" (HF) communications receiver set for single
sideband (SSB) reception.

3. Aim the satellite dish at one of the AT&amp;T Telstar satellites and find
a transponder that doesn't seem to be carrying video.

4. Tune around below 6 MHz or so with the SSB receiver.

Rumor has it that dedicated circuits belonging to travel reservation services
have been heard in this manner.   Phil

INTERNET COMPUTER NETWORK TO USE CODE TO ENSURE PRIVACY
By VIN McLELLAN, c.1989 N.Y. Times News Service

   BOSTON -- Officials of Internet, the computer network that ties together
hundreds of academic, government and corporate networks, are planning to begin
a program that will permit users to send messages to one another in what is
intended to be an unbreakable code.  At present, users communicating over the
network have little privacy. Sophisticated users can easily intercept and read
messages.  This lack of security has increasingly worried computer experts as
the use of the networks has spread.
  For many scientists and engineers, the networks have become a
mainstay in their communications, used to exchange research results
as well as carry on conversations that would otherwise occur over
the telephone.
  Under the new system, not only can an encrypted message be sent but the
message will carry concealed information that will leave no doubt for the
recipient that the person who says he sent the message did indeed send it.  The
recipient will also know with certainty that the message has not been altered.
  Developers of the technology say the encryption will provide users with
``digital envelopes'' that cannot be opened except by the addressee, and the
contents will have ``digital signatures'' that cannot be forged.
  The encryption will be offered to 400 computer networks that are tied by the
Internet network.  The system will be based on one devised by RSA Data Security
Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., that uses ``public key encryption'' techniques
developed in the late 1970's by federally financed researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
  PKE, as the encryption technique is known, involves two ``keys,'' one public
and one secret. Each user has a secret key and a public one that is published
in a directory, just as phone numbers are. Someone uses the recipient's public
key to send a message and the recipient uses his secret key to decode it.
  The Internet proposal comes just as RSA and the Digital Equipment Corp. of
Maynard, Mass., have agreed to give Digital full access to the same technology
that Internet proposes to use.
  DEC is expected to announce the agreement today. Digital officials said they
expected to integrate RSA's technology into a broad array of software and
hardware products.  ``The events of the past two years have shown that security
has now become a necessary aspect of reliable distributed computing,'' said
Robert Schleelein, manager of strategic relations for Digital's network and
communications group.  He was referring to numerous recent cases in which
intruders have entered computer networks.
  The agreement between Digital and RSA could give Digital a competitive edge
in providing future computer equipment to users of the networks who want to
take advantage of its new encryption technology.  It will also probably mean
that RSA's public key encryption technology, which is proprietary, could become
the encryption standard on computer networks.
  ``Those of us who are involved in setting standards don't like to include in
a standard anything that is a proprietary technology,'' noted Dr. Stephen Kent,
chairman of the Internet Task Force on Privacy.  ``Adopting RSA, we have
violated that rule of thumb, but we've done it with the full knowledge that we
were doing it, and because we felt there were no other viable alternatives.''
Kent, chief scientist at BBN Communications Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., said the
Internet standard was the result of more than two years of joint efforts by
representatives from BBN, the Mitre Corp., the Xerox Corp., Digital, Texas
Instruments Inc., University College in London, the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and the Commerce Department's Institute of Standards and Technology.
  Digital's adoption and explicit endorsement of the RSA technology is itself a
``tremendous advance in information security,'' said John O'Mara, executive
director of the Computer Security Institute, an association of 3,000 corporate
data security officers.

Has anyone else been receiving complaints about lots of duplicate messages from
people at particular sites?  Some of these poor victims are getting on the
order of 25 copies of one message.  I've done some queue-watching and it
appears that the SMTP dialog in these cases flies right along, no problem,
until the . after the DATA, whereupon the remote host just sits there
[ostensibly trying to deliver the message], and my end times out and requeues
the message.  Meanwhile the foreign end, not particularly caring that the
sender nuked the connection, finally figures out what it was doing and delivers
the message.  While (stuck) repeat...

We've been having some network problems down here over the past couple of days,
but one would think that once the connection is open and the dialog is running,
you wouldn't get an inordinate delay *ONLY* after the DATA is sent.  What's
going on with these sites?  Below I have included a list of offenders I could
find on the Security list.  Any ideas?  I'm running regular ole sendmail, and
everything's working fine otherwise; it's just that these hosts refuse to
acknowledge receipt of the message.  They are running a bunch of different
mailers, as well, so it isn't a problem with a particular type of mailer
[although I've seen that sort of thing in the past].

Recently, in Atlanta, Georgia (GA), I was stopped and given three (!)
traffic citations, when it was obvious that I was guilty of none:

  "Offense":                            Reality:
  ---------------------------------     -------------------------------
  Turning where posted No Left Turn     Not posted
  Driving without valid license         Gave officer valid license
  Driving without insurance             Gave officer proof of insurance
  ---------------------------------     -------------------------------

I gave the officer my plastic Minnesota (MN) license, which indicated that it
had just been renewed (MN clips the corner of the plastic card when a new one
is ordered) and the temporary paper license that MN issues to cover the 45 day
period it takes to make a new plastic card.  The officer refused to accept this
documentation! He said his computer did not show that I had a valid license.
When I suggested that he retry his computer query (he may have made a mistake
in typing, the GA or the MN computer or the connection between them could be
having problems), he refused to do so!

His rationale for giving me a citation for no insurance was that I had signed
the collision damage waiver for the National car I was renting.  Apparently, he
doesn't know that most major car rental companies are fully self-insuring for
liability and he also doesn't know the difference between collision and
liability insurance.  He also refused the proof I had in hand that I also was
covered by American Express, AND Honeywell, AND my personal MN liability
insurance.  I guess that none of this paper would stand up against his
computer, which would only show GA insurance registration.  Being quadruply
insured with documents to prove it didn't help me at all.

The next day I saw an Atlanta newspaper article by Bette Harrison entitled "The
Bureaucracy Zone" (in the style of the "Twilight Zone") about foul-ups in GA's
handling of auto insurance information.  The article tells how the GA Highway
Patrol visited a man's house and confiscated his driver's license because of a
clerical error.  After explaining that GA insurance companies must inform the
Department of Public Safety (DPS) of any policy changes, the article records
the following conversation between the man's insurance agent and the DPS:

   Agent:  Look, if I send my policyholder down there with a letter from us
   indicating his policy didn't cancel, a copy of his insurance company's
   reinstatement notice, and a completed copy of your form O.C.G.A. 33-34-11
   which we completed and and returned to you on Nov. 10, 1988 and he is
   stopped, what will happen?

   DPS:  He'll be arrested and his car will be impounded.   

   Agent:  You've got to be kidding.

   DPS:  That is our procedure.

   Agent: This is a clerical error and he is coming with the proof.  Why
   should you penalize someone for a clerical error?

   DPS:  That is our procedure.

   Agent to reporter:  See, the machine that sits on their desk has become
   their God!  They believe because the computer says it's right, it is.
   . . . There are three issues here: the penalization of the American public
   due to our dependency on computers; the bureaucratic attitude that we
   experience at every level; and a system that doesn't have safeguards to
   prevent the innocent from being victimized along with the real violators.

I can confirm what the agent said.  GA gave me two options, plead guilty or go
to court.  Pleading guilty to three moving violations (yes, in GA license and
insurance are also moving violations) would mean loss of my license when GA
forward the guilty info to MN.  MN suspends licenses for 3 moving violations in
6 months.  This happened on a Thursday.  The officer said he only appeared in
court on Mondays.  But next Monday was too soon.  It seems that GA's computer
system can instantly accuse me of crimes, but it takes more than four days to
get information from the police department to the courts!

Just before I left GA on the following Wednesday (almost a week later), I went
to the Traffic Court to see if I could straighten things out.  The citation
information hadn't gotten there yet! I told the clerk my story, and said that I
had, with me, the proof of license and insurance.  She said, "OK, give me your
copy of the citation and the fine and we can process it."  Fine?  She thought I
was pleading guilty.  Bringing in proof of license and insurance (if you have
them) is required to plead GUILTY! Not only must a driver have both, but also
must have them in the car when driving.  Bringing them in later is no proof of
not being guilty.

I spent all of that afternoon convincing the Court to let me see a judge and to
plead not guilty.  The majority of the cases I witnessed while waiting for the
judge were license and insurance citations.  In the first concession to
reasonableness I had seen in this affair, I got the license and insurance
citations dropped.  However, the judge said I would have to come back for the
No Left Turn citation.  I had to be in California the next Monday, so I asked
if I could do it by deposition through the mail.  No, I had to appear in
person.  So one can be accused by remote information by cannot use the same
process for defense.  Not being able to be in Atlanta, I have pleaded nolo
contendere under duress.  I nolo plea HAS to be handled through the mail and
can be accepted or rejected by a judge.  I am still waiting for the outcome.

The moral:  When in GA, watch out, that caricature of southern justice may now
have silicon help.

P.S.  You would think that Atlanta, which is trying to be a major convention
city, would have special provisions to make things easier for out of state
visitors.  Because just the opposite appears to be true, I will stay clear of
Atlanta.  Also the conventions and meetings that I have influence over will
also not be in Atlanta.

   [In the old days -- 40s, 50s, maybe even 60s -- Georgia was famous for its
   speed traps, e.g., 15 mph (poorly marked) for a few yards in the middle of a
   stretch of 45 mph, with squad cars and a judge sitting there waiting for
   unsuspecting out-of-staters.  Apparently "Poli want a Cracker" is NOT the
   operative principle -- except maybe for Floridians.  PGN]

From the 6 March 1989 _PC Week_:

  Like every other U.S. airport, San Francisco International always charged a
monthly fee to the rental-car and hotel courtesy vans that sweep through its
terminal areas to pick up customers.
  But the flat rate became problematic.  Courtesy vehicles, free to swarm
through ground-transportation areas as often as they liked, jammed up the
limited space in passenger pick-up areas.  Airport managers even began
suspecting courtesy vans were driving into passesnger areas "more for
advertising than for carrying people," said Sheldon Fein, airport manager of
traffic control.
  Now, the airport is pioneering a PC-based system it hopes will relieve
traffic congestion and help it bill courtesy providers for every time they
cruise by.
  The airport is requiring vehicle [sic] to mount radio-frequency
identification tags on the roof of each vehicle.  Each electronic tag, made by
General Railway Signal Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., emits a unique ID code that's
logged automatically by overhead receiving boxes every time a vehicle drives
into a ground-transportation area.
  The receivers link by modem to a back-office PC AT, where custom-developed
software help bill vehicle operators accurately and report on driver activity.
  Now, instead of $50 to $100 a month, vehicle operators pay 35 cents a trip.
The fee will hit $1 next January.  Fein believes this will reduce traffic jams
and create an airport profit center.

[There are other vendors for such systems, as well.  I wonder what the reset
time is for a sensor?  If I drove my (slightly-modified) personal vehicle
slowly beneath a sensor, could I enrich the Airport with hundreds of my
competitors' dollars?  Could I trigger every sensor in the area?  Would they
receive an appropriately itemized bill?  Would anyone (except Cliff Stoll) even
notice?]

Several colleagues have been kind enough to tell me about the message sent to
the Risks Forum by Randall Neff of Stanford University concerning my recent
seminar talk on the VorTeX project.

In this note, I hope to set the record straight and to clear up Mr Neff's
misunderstandings.

1. As Mr. Neff indicated, the VorTeX group implemented an interpreter to
display PostScript on our workstations.  Adobe has given us a license to use
their PostScript commands in this software.

2. It is also the case that in order to preview output, we needed outline
fonts.  When we inquired about the use of Adobe fonts, we were told that they
were not available (at any price).  I attempted to obtain fonts from Bitstream,
but their price of $85,000 plus royalties was beyond our means for research
software.

Mr. Neff's quotations are erroneous.  I never objected to Adobe's refusal to
let us use their fonts.  That is their right.  I did express concern that
commercial interests were forming an impediment to research in document
processing.

3.  In the US, type faces may not be copyrighted (although their names may be
trademarked).  It has always been perfectly legal to measure or photograph
characters appearing in a book, for example, and to use those measurements or
images for the type face of some other manuscript.  In our case, we wrote
Postscript code that measured the characters of various fonts, and then used
curve fitting to reconstruct approximations to the shapes of the original
characters.  As I indicated in my talk and others have discussed in this forum
our methods were legal and proper.  It is unfortunate that Mr Neff thought we
were trying to put one over on Adobe.  He alleges that we acquired Adobe's
product.  This is certainly incorrect.  In particular, we did not try to
extract the "hints" that make low-resolution rendering possible, although
others done so.

4. Once we had devised this approach, which seemed to solve our problem, I
phoned a senior staff member at Adobe to report what we had done and to find
out if Adobe had any problems with it.  After telling me that he knew a faster
way to do what we were doing (but not indicating what it is!), he said that he
would report it to management and that I should expect a call.  A day later, I
received a call from the Adobe general counsel requesting only that I obtain a
license for the use of the PostScript instruction set.  We honored that
request.

Thus not only do I see nothing unethical about our behavior, Adobe has
registered no objection.

5. Finally, let me mention that there was a formal question/answer session at
the end of my seminar.  I stayed around afterwards talking with people.  After
that, there was a dinner to which all interested parties were invited.  Mr Neff
had ample time to raise ethical or any other issues with me had he chosen to do
so.

This latest controversy [about UCB "reverse engineering" Adobe fonts] smells
suspiciously like the incident several years ago in which another UC campus
duplicated and distributed around the campus multiple copies of a CAD package.
When sued by the owners of the CAD package, the successful defense was that the
Regents of the University of California *are* the State of California, as so
far as the law is concerned; and, under the Constitution, a State may only be
sued with its consent and the Regents did not consent to be sued.

This suggests that under current case law, there is a significant commercial
risk in selling (or, far worse, allowing to be sold) intellectual property, or
anything containing significant intellectual property, to, at least, anyone
involved with the UC system. Since it appears UC is not bound by the usual
"fair use" rules of copyright, we may now start to see strange restrictions in
the "shrink wrap" agreements as companies and their lawyers attempt to protect
their products.

An item that could be encoded on the magstripes in credit cards that would pose
little privacy risk while enhancing protection for the consumer would be a
digital image of the credit card holder.  When they apply for their card they
send in a picture, and their card's stripe is encoded with a compressed image,
say 100 * 100 * 8 bits.  A display terminal would be small and reasonably cheap
in mass production, and would end a great deal of credit-card fraud.  I see no
disadvantage to the consumer.  Of course, if they just laminated the photograph
on the credit card in the first place...  but perhaps using the stripe would be
easier since it requires no time-consuming human intervention in the card
fabrication process, and the company could store your digitized image along
with your account information.  (Which provides new possibilities for verifying
your identity over the telephone: "So, sir, do you still have that wart on the
left side of your nose?" "What wart?" "That's what I wanted to hear.  How may I

The bill I believe only requires ENGLISH and WELSH football clubs to enforce
the card ID scheme. Scotland is EXEMPT from this scheme, probably for much
the same reasons as ENGLISH and WELSH teams were banned from playing on the
continent (and still are), whereas Scottish teams ARE NOT.

Please use the term `English and Welsh' instead of UK, when the bill does
not apply to Scotland (I don't know the exact situation in NI). Scotland has
it's own laws, and is proud to remain separate from its southern companions.

Why is writability necessary for anti-passback?  Seems to me that remembering
what cards have been used is more than sufficient.

Putting writable cards in the hands of the public and trusting what they say
would be just "asking for trouble" in this country, and likely so in other
countries.  The one thing you probably want to be able to say to a card is
"please, card #1234, don't squawk for ten seconds", so the electronic turnstile
could make sense out of a crowd.  But even this is probably unnecessary with
careful design.

There seems to be an implicit assumption here, and in other discussions on
RISKS, that simple possession on my credit card number is all of the
authorization that one needs to charge me.  It should be noted that all of the
ethical people with whom I do business by credit card do have my number.  They
do not re-use it for the simple reasons that they are ethical AND that I can
disown the transaction.  You see, not only must you have my number, you must
also have my consent.  While it is true that possession of the number transfers
the burden of action to me, the burden is still on you to prove that you have
my consent.  In the absence of some other evidence on your part (such as a
receipt for the delivery of goods), a simple assertion on my part that you do
not have my consent is sufficient.
                                                                   
Note that in the credit card system, my right to disown the        
transaction  persists even after you have received your money.     
This is a much better remedy than is available to me if you have   
gotten your money by currency or check.

Many of the control problems that are suggested here will be dealt with through
the application of digital envelopes (to prevent the disclosure of the credit
card number) and digital envelopes (to demonstrate your intent to pay for the
software and to enable you to disown any transactions not so signed.)

However, two other innovative methods for distributing and collecting for
software are being used by companies engaged in selling crypto products.  For
example, EnigmaLogic, who sells one-time password software, has a license fee
that is based upon the number of users that you employ it for.  If you want to
change the number, you call them.  They give you a one-time password that can
be used to adjust the software and they adjust your bill accordingly.

RSA Security Inc. market public/private key software.  They will freely
distribute the software, but charge you a license fee for it only when you wish
to register your key.

A computer software glitch at Wells Fargo Bank has caused a delay in
depositing payroll funds for 12,000 to 15,000 workers at about 70 companies,
mostly in Northern California.  (The delay of a day or weekend apparently
affects only people whose paychecks are deposited automatically on a weekly

about 1.5 million payroll accounts each month.  SFB promised to cover any
overdraft charges.)  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 25 March 1989, p. B4]

            COMPUTER VIRUS STRIKES MICHIGAN HOSPITAL
            Records Altered or Scrambled but Patients
                       Were Not Endangered

     BOSTON, March 22 - Computer viruses, which have disrupted university,
newspaper and government systems, have spread to hospital computers.
     Officials at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., said two
viruses altered or scrambled patient information in a computer that creates
high-quality pictures for diagnosing diseases.
     The viruses, according to a report in the New England Journal of
Medicine Thursday, also created non-existent patients and spread to two
other medical facilities.
     Dr. Jack E. Juni and Richard Ponto of the Beaumont Hospital said
patients were not endangered by the virus because original copies of the
records were not stored in the infected computer.
     A computer virus is a malevolent computer program designed to spread
itself surreptitiously throughout a computer system and, before anyone
realizes it is present, destroy or alter stored information.
     The new case is being reported as doctors and hospitals are developing
growing reliance on all-purpose computers far more vulnerable to infection
by viruses.
     Ponto and Juni said the Beaumont virus was discovered when the
hospital's new image-display station, which creates pictures for heart
studies, stopped responding to commands.  Then nonexistent patients and
garbled names appeared on the patient directory.
     When officials investigated, they discovered that seven of 10 programs
had been altered and that the virus had created many new files.
     Juni said the virus was on a hard disk manufactured by CMS Enhancements
of Tustin, Calif.
     CMS spokesman Ted James said a virus, inadvertently put on 600 such
disks last October, had contaminated a program used to format the disks.
The virus apparently entered the company's plant on a hard disk returned for
servicing.
     James said the virus was "as harmless as it's possible to be."  It
inserted a small piece of extra computer code on hard disks but did not
reproduce or tamper with other material on the disk.

  "To quickly and accurately process the large volume of orders that we

That last line was in italics, and there followed the alphabet and numbers as

&gt; ... I see no disadvantage to the consumer.

I do.  Once this starts up, it will be only a matter of time before they start
taking digitized images of you ("cheap line-scanning monochrome cameras!") each
time you attempt to use the card.  The bits of this "current" image will then
be electronically compared to the bits of the "original" image.  If the
match-up is less than, say, 99%, or maybe 95%, or maybe even 90%, it's "sorry,
charge not approved..."  Who decides the percentage of match-up allowed?

Even assuming the digitized image is only "one-way," that is, only appears on a
screen for a clerk to compare to your face as you stand there with hat in hand,
there are serious potential problems.  In either case, consider the following
scenarios:  Two or three times a year, I drastically change my facial hair
(clean shaven, mustache only, mustache plus beard, etc.).  And what of folks
who have plastic surgery, either by choice or because of disfiguring accident?
And those who have accidents and can't afford surgery?  Men going bald?  Women
(and men!) who drastically change their hair styles?  Differences in makeup
application?  The basic aging process?  Are we all to be locked into one
appearance?

And what of the complexities of the individual human face?  By slightly flexing
a few facial muscles, anyone can transform their face into something new.
Meryl Streep is an extreme example.  What of the guy who has his original photo
taken the day after he is married, and then applies for some credit the day
after his wife informs him she is filing for divorce?  You know that any
digital representation of his face will have considerable bit differences.

Will this image exclude any clothing that appears below the neck (collars,
ties, etc)?  If not, you'd better be sure to wear exactly the same thing every
time you use your credit card ("uh, wait, lemme try tying my tie a little
differently...").  And what of differences in light and shadows?

Many will argue, "but those same problems COULD exist with any photo ID, but
there are no such problems in real life."  Absolutely true.  But once something
has been "computerized" it takes on God-granted status.  In the last issue of
RISKS, Kevin Driscoll treated us to the bizarre story of how the Georgia
Department of Public Safety is completely unwilling to correct errors entered
into their computers, even when they know about those errors.  Try explaining
to an 18-year-old clerk that she shouldn't worry about the fact that you "look
different" from your computerized image ("I'm sorry, sir, but that's what's in
the COMPUTER...").  People can adjust for changes in a photograph, such as
those on most driver's licenses.  But that image on the "computer screen" may
as well be carved in granite.
  
&gt; ...  "What wart?" ...

I find such personal inquires repugnant, and would have a hard time avoiding
slamming down the phone.  But on a more important topic, is there any empirical
evidence to suggest that credit card fraud could be significantly reduced by
facial images, either true photographs or digitized images?  I am reminded of
the controversy in New York State a few years back, when we became the last of
50 states to place a photo ID on driver's licenses.  Some enterprising
reporters actually went so far as to talk to law enforcement officials about
the value of photo IDs.  The consensus, even among the sometimes
over-enthusiastic State Troopers, was that there was no real law enforcement
use for photo IDs.  Alternative methods of investigation are far more useful.

It is fairly well established that exposure to high relative power densities
of UHF and higher RF frequencies can cause significant health problems.
Parts of the body that are the most sensitive to heat effects are the most
vulnerable to RF effects, with the eyes being the most sensitive of all.
There have been cases of police departments having problems with officers
who developed cataracts apparently relating to their use of hand-held UHF
(e.g. 450 Mhz) transceivers.

Hand-held cellular phones are probably even worse.  Like police
transceivers, these units almost always have the antenna in very
close proximity to the user's head, putting the head (and eyes of
course) in a quite strong relative field (while the absolute power
may only be a few watts, the relative power density near the antenna
is quite high).  Also, cellular units operate at around twice the 
frequency of police transceivers (i.e., cellular operates around
800 Mhz and higher) and the higher the frequency, the worse the risk.

Another factor is that while police transceivers are half duplex and
only transmitting when the officer has something to say, cellular
transceivers are transmitting continuously when a conversation is
occurring (since they are full duplex) so the overall exposure is far
higher in most situations.

It would appear that a real risk may exist.

Note that the farther you get away from the antenna, the better off you are,
since the inverse square law applies.

    From: miket@brspyr1.brs.com (Mike Trout)
    Subject: Possible Cancer Risks from Cellular Phones?

    I recently had a discussion with a major electronics guru for a local
    television station.  We were talking about microwave transmitters (radar
    speed guns, garage door openers, that sort of thing), when he made a
    dramatic statement that shocked me:  he claimed that cellular phones were
    extremely hazardous and probably highly carcinogenic.

Sorry, but this is extremely unlikely.  Human flesh is very poor at
absorbing (or affecting in any way) radio waves.  Because of this, possible
resonance effects between the skull and the transmissions are very unlikely.

There are three ways that electro-magnetic radiation can harm living tissue:
(1) electric-current burns.  This is what gets people who touch or come very
close to high-power antennas.  (To be precise, however, this effect is due
to inductive or capacitive coupling with the antenna, rather than absorption
of E-M radiation.)  (2) thermal heating due to resonance absorption (usually
by water molecules).  This is how microwave ovens heat things.  However,
this effect can happen only at certain specific frequencies of radiation,
all of which are much higher frequencies than are normally used for cellular
phones.  [These first two effects cause problems only at high power levels,
because the human body can take a significant amount of current flow and
heating without any damage at all -- at low power levels, they are lost in
the noise of biological currents and heat generation.]  (3) direct
modification of molecules.  This happens only with high-energy E-M
radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.  [This is the only one of the three damage
mechanisms that can cause cancer.]

As you can see, it is unlikely that a cellular phone will harm you via
any of the three mechanisms, much less cause you cancer.

I'm not particularly astonished that this fellow is worried that pressing a
radio transmitter to your head might be harmful, although he should have
done a bit of research before spreading groundless warnings.  I am
astonished that he thinks they cause cancer.  I can see no reason for even
an uninformed person thinking this, other than the "Everything bad causes
cancer" scare-mentality that seems to be popular.

I once read an article noting that over the last 10 years there were several
dozen alleged risks to human health that had achieved enough newspaper
coverage to seriously scare people, and it noted that while a few of them
were indeed serious health risks, most of them were, in practice, harmless.
It also noted that the information presented in newspapers was almost
useless for distinguishing these two categories.  I wonder what will happen
when "cellular phones cause brain tumors" hits the papers?

The RISKS of needless and wasteful regulation of non-threats (not to mention
of hardening people to the point that they fail to be concerned about
genuine health risks) are, as people say here, obvious.  When will some
sanity be injected into the subject?

Cellular phones operate in the 800 MegaHertz band. This is in the middle of the
UHF band, directly below the microwave band. Microwaves, as we all know, are
used for making popcorn and cooking turkeys.

800 MHz puts the full wave right at 14.8 inches or a half wave at 7.4 inches
which is a little long to resonate inside the skull cavity. This doesn't mean
that it can't cause real damage, though.  An example has been showing up since
civic police forces have started switching up from the VHF to the UHF bands for
local communications. The advantages of using higher frequencies are more
bandwidth, less interferrence, and better audio quality.  The RISKS, however,
are starting to show up.

The problems were first noticed in officers making extensive use of hand held
(walkie-talkie) units with built-in "Stubby-Duck" antennas. These antennea are
identified by have a length of around 2 - 4 inches, a diameter of about a
quarter inch, and made usually with a black rubber coating.  When held in the
talking position, the antenna is positioned in close proximity to one of the
eyeballs.  That's when the glaucoma started showing up.  Essentially, the UFH
waves were frying the aqueous humor... turning what should have been the
consistency or Jello brand gellatin desert into the consistency of 3 day old
oatmeal.

So the local P.D.s decided to move the radios away from the face and strap them
onto the officer's belt. The interaction is through a hand-held speaker/mic.
Great solution! Now the officers get it in the spleen instead of the face!

So, back to cellular phones.  Hand-held units with built-in antennas are
obviously the greatest risk.  Antennas placed on the roof of the car, shielded
by the cars sheet metal, are best.  This assumes that the installation was
competently made by a knowledgeable RF technician (NOT a stereo installation
jocky), the connectors are "low loss", and the coax itslf is "low loss".  The
most common cellular phone coax is cheap RG-58/U. This is "thin ethernet"
cable.  A much safer connection is made the thicker coax (I think RG 59/U, but
I don't remember).  The thin stuff is used more because it is cheaper and MUCH
EASIER to install.

I am very interested to see what further studies are being conducted relative
to the long term effects of exposure to RF. I am worried about the unrestricted
saturation we receive 24 hours a day on all frequencies. How free of effect are
the "safe" frequencies (VHF, HF)?

One fine *cold* day in February I transported a floppy from location
A to location B.  I thought nothing about placing the floppy in the
passenger chair.  It was positioned vertically against the chair back,
wedged gently behind an empty child seat.  The trip took about 30 minutes.
Then I tried to read the floppy and could not:  the machine couldn't even
find track 0.  I tried about a half-dozen or so machines before I gave up.

It was an old floppy so I guessed that it just couldn't hold the bits
anymore, so I got a few new ones and was going to try again when the real
cause of the problem dawned on me:  I own a 1985 SAAB with the *heated*
front seats.  I guessed that since the heating element was electrical it
might be puting out enough of a magnetic field to scramble the data.  So I
experimented:  I made about 5 copies of the floppy and placed some of them
on the floor and one of them on the seat as before, drove for about 30
minutes (again on a cold day) and then tried to read them.  The floppy
placed like the first one was unreadable.  Those on the floor were fine.

I'd sure like to get a instrument and measure the magnetic field near that
chair when the heater is working.  I'd like to know why the magnetic stripe
on the credit cards in my wallet still work...

     A few nights ago a minor incident occurred which typifies how computer
risks can be worse than those of other technologies and why people get
upset.  At about 2:00am, my toddler woke up demanding nourishment so I put
250ml of milk in the microwave to heat.  It was dark and I wasn't too well
coordinated with the result that I spilled the milk.  Most went on the
kitchen counter, some on the touch pad and a few drops went into the door
latch mechanism.  I cleaned the mess, heated more milk and all was fine. 
     The next morning was not quite so fine: the microwave worked normally
except that it turned on when the door was open! A small amount of milk had
seeped (I suspect through the door latch) into the electronics causing a
bizarre and highly unsafe failure.  I was especially disturbed because a
microwave hazard is invisible.
     My point is that a very important safety requirement - the magnetron
must not be on when the door is open - had been implemented in logic with
other routine functions.  An old design would have used a mechanical switch
to disable the magnetron when the door was open.  Computerized logic systems
allow inexpensive implementation of a broad range of features by treating
all functions and all signals uniformly.  Unfortunately, such uniformity
does not normally permit special safeguards for critical functions.  A
robust design would use separate systems for activation and safety.

For the record ...

... the New York Times article by Vin McLellan on March 21st (Volume 8,
Issue 43) regarding the "Internet Security Plans" incorrectly included Texas
Instruments (TI) Inc. in the list of representatives responsible for the
Internet standard.  In fact, Trusted Information Systems (TIS) Inc.  a small
privately-owned computer and communications security consulting firm based
in Glenwood, Maryland is one of the representatives responsible for the
Internet standard.  Furthurmore, Dartmouth College was inadvertently
ommitted from the list of representatives.

I should also mention that the article fails to point out that the Internet
mail messages themselves are actually protected using the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and that RSA is only used to protect and distribute the DES
keys.

The Air Force temporarily grounded its fleet of B-1B bombers yesterday after
the wings on one of the planes malfunctioned just before a training
flight...  The crew could not get the plane's wings to move back and forth
in tandem and, at one point, the left wing apparently moved too far forward
and punctured a fuel tank inside the fuselage.  The wings are normally swept
back for high-speed attack runs and forward for takeoffs and landings...
The B-1B still has problems with its radar-jamming gear...  [San Francisco

A $140 million Star Wars Satellite [launched on 24 March] failed one of its
first tests...  The satellite was meant to observe the firing of a nearby
rocket in space but was unable to do so because a lens cap blocked its view.
The lens cover stayed on a sensor too long, blocking it from tracking the
second-stage engine as it drifted away in space.  As a result, the satellite
was pointed in the wrong direction to view the longer of the second-stage
firings.  [San Francisco Chronicle, 28 March 1989, p. A10]

  I test-drove a Dodge Spirit last week.  It had Chrysler's new 4-speed
overdrive automatic transmission, which is controlled electronically.
  As we were sitting in the car before beginning the test drive, the salesman
folded down his sun visor, noted the vanity mirror built into it, and said,
"Illuminated mirrors! How nice!" So I folded down _my_ visor, lifted the cover
on the mirror, and noticed that the lights didn't light.  "How did you make
yours light?"  I asked.  "They won't, until we connect a connector under the
hood," said he, "we disconnect things that might drain the battery if left on
inadvertently."  I resolved to check the mirror illumination later.
  So I drove out from the dealer's lot, accelerated gently to about ten miles
per hour, and notice that the transmission had not yet shifted up.  "Shift,
you!" said I.  The salesman then started to laugh embarrassedly and remembered
that the transmission controller needed "that connector" reconnected.
  This time the Spirit wasn't quite willing.

Edited excerpts from a feature article by Jeffrey Rothfeder in 'Business
Week' magazine April 3, 1989:

           USING THE LAW TO REIN IN COMPUTER RUNAWAYS  
     MORE UNHAPPY BUYERS ARE TAKING SYSTEMS SUPPLIERS TO COURT
  
  Geophysical Systems Corp. hired a Raytheon Corp. subsidiary, Seismo-
  graph Service Corp., to build a $20 million computer system to process
  sonar-generated data.  The system couldn't do it.  Geophysical's clients
  canceled their contracts, and Geophysical entered bankruptcy.  Last 
  December, a Los Angeles jury awarded Geophysical Systems Corp. $48.3 
  million from to cover computer-system costs and lost profits, although 
  the judge has ordered a new trial to review the size of those damages.
  
  Geophysical had claimed that the Seismograph system couldn't meet its
  complex computation requirements -- and that Seismograph knew this 
  before it started building the system.  By finding for his client, says
  Geophysical's attorney, "the court is saying that if we wanted a computer
  unable to handle our data we could have gone to Toys 'R' Us and been
  out $20 instead of $20 million."
     
  As computer runaways -- systems that are over budget, installed late,
  or don't work -- become endemic, fed-up customers are fighting back.
  And they're using the law to do it.  In 1988 the American Arbitration
  Assn. took on 190 computer disputes, most of them concerning defective
  systems, totaling $198 million in claims.  That was up from 123 cases
  in 1984, representing claims of $31 million.  Dozens of law firms now
  specialize in high-tech matters.
  
  [More tales of (smaller) cases.]  When a customer sues, it loses its
  computer supplier.  It may take years to find a replacement and build
  a new system -- not to mention win the original suit.  Because of this,
  says one attorney, "when you sign a contract for a computer system, 
  you're locked in a deadly embrace with the supplier that you not be able
  to, or want to, get out of."  The boilerplate agreement that suppliers
  typically offer includes numerous so-called exclusions of warranty that
  limit the supplier's liability for system failures or delays.  Also, 
  the contract usually states that nothing in it is binding unless
  specifically spelled out.
  
  A former Price Waterhouse senior consultant recalls telling customers
  that it will take "only 72 hours for a crucial software project.  But 
  we wouldn't put this into the contract.  Then when it took us two months
  to do the job, we simply explained that the project now costs more
  because the extra work we did was out of the scope of our agreement."
  
  The State of New Jersey reached a settlement with Price Waterhouse over
  a bungled system to handle licensing and traffic violations for the Motor
  Vehicles Dept.  During nearly two years of negotiations,  the accounting
  firm fixed the system.  New Jersey got the system for $1.2 million less
  than the contracted price, and Price Waterhouse swallowed approximately
  $2 million in additional project costs.
  
  Many customers are starting to demand contract clauses providing for
  binding arbitration of disputes, and for acceptance tests before the 
  customer pays.
  
  Surprisingly, the new legal aggressiveness of customers isn't particu-
  larly troubling to most systems suppliers.  Customer activism may even
  reduce the number of runaways from an estimated 35% of all current
  computer projects.  Says a systems designer at one Big Eight accounting
  firm:  "It could be just the thing we need to make us more honest."

A sidebar lists THINGS TO DEMAND WHEN BUYING A COMPUTER SYSTEM:

  * ACCEPTANCE TEST.  Requires the supplier to run the customer's 
    actual data successfully through the system.
  
  * GUARANTEE.  The customer pays leasing or purchase charges only
    after the new system has been working correctly for two months.
  
  * BINDING ARBITRATION.  Stipulates that the customer can elect to 
    have disputes resolved by an outside arbitrator.
  
  * SOFTWARE OWNERSHIP.  Give the customer the rights to the system's
    source code and leaves it in the customer's possession.
  
  * SUPPORT.  Guarantees that support and servicing for the system will
    be available for at least a year -- even if the supplier goes out
    of business.

A short note in the `Los Angeles Times' 27 March 1989 carried this summary
of information from a letter in the 'New England Journal of Medicine':

                VIRUS HITS HOSPITAL COMPUTERS
    
   A "virus" infected computers at three Michigan hospitals last
   fall and disrupted patient diagnosis at two of the centers in
   what appears to be the first such invasion of a medical computer,
   it was reported last week.
   
   The infiltration did not harm any patients but delayed diagnoses
   by shutting down domputers, creating files of nonexistent patients
   and garbling names on patient records, which could have caused more
   serious problems.
   
   "It definitely did affect care in delaying things, and it could have
   affected care in terms of losing this information completely," said
   Dr. Jack Juni, a staff physician at the William Beaumont Hospitals 
   in Troy and Royal Oak, Mich., two of the hospitals involved.  "It
   was pretty disturbing."
   
   If patient information had been lost, the virus could have forced
   doctors to repeat tests that involve exposing patients to radiation,
   Juni said.  The phony and garbled files could have caused a mix-up
   in patient diagnosis, he said.
   
   "This was information we were using to base diagnoses on," said Juni,
   who reported the case in a letter in the New England Journal of
   Medicine.  "We were lucky and caught it in time."

An individual placed a time bomb message on a government service system in the
San Francisco Bay Area saying, "WARNING! A computer virus has infected the
system!" The individual is learning that such a prank is considered almost as
funny as saying that you have a bomb in your carry-on luggage as you board a
plane.

This week's (26 March.) Sunday Times (UK) has an article relating to a Bulletin
Board being run by a 14-year-old boy in Wilmslow, Cheshire, England, which
contains information relating to such things as making plastic explosives.
Anti-terrorist detectives are said to be investigating for possible breaches of
the Obscene Publications Act.  Apparently reporters were able to easily gain
access to this bulletin board and peruse articles on such subjects as credit
card fraud, making various types of explosive, street fighting techniques and
dodging police radar traps.  One article was obviously aimed at children and
described how to make a bomb suitable for use on "the car of a teacher you do
not like at school," which would destroy the tyre of a car when it was started.
The boys parents did not seem to think that their son was doing anything wrong,
preferring him to be working with his computer rather than roaming the streets.
A London computer consultant, Noel Bradford, is quoted as having seen the
bulletin board and found messages discussing "how to crack British Telecom, how
to get money out of people and how to defraud credit card companies.  Credit
card numbers are given, along with PIN numbers, names, addresses and other
details."

For those of you interested an umbrella organisation has been established
in the UK to co-ordinate information on, and research into all aspects of
computer security. In the first instance one of the organisations primary
concerns will be combatting the threat posed by computer viruses by
acting as a clearing house for virus information and control software.

Below is a copy of an initial letter mailed to prospective members:

			The Computer Threat Research Association

The computer threat research association, CoTra is a non-profit making
organisation that exists to research, analyse, publicise and find solutions for
threats to the integrity and reliability of computer systems.

The issue that caused the formation of CoTra was the rise of the computer
virus. This problem has since become surrounded by fear, uncertainty and doubt.
To the average user the computer virus and its implications are a worry of an
unknown scale. To a few unfortunates whose systems have become a critical issue.

The key advantage of CoTra membership will be access to advice and information.
Advice will be provided through publications, an electronic conference (a
closed conference for CoTra's members has been created on the Compulink CIX
system) as well as other channels such as general postings direct to members
when a new virus is discovered.

CoTra membership will be available on a student, full or corporate member
basis. All software that is held by CoTra that enhances system reliability,
such as virus detection and removal software, will be available to all members.
It is intended to establish discounts with suppliers of reliability tools and
services. A library of virus sources and executables and other dangerous
research material will be made available to members who have a demonstrable
need.

A register of consultants who have specific skills in the systems reliability
field will be published by CoTra and reviews of reliability enhancing software
will be produced.

Your support of CoTra will ensure that you have the earliest and most accurate
information about potential threats to your computer systems.

CoTra, The computer threat research association,
c/o 144 Sheerstock, Haddenham, Bucks. HP17 8EX


Part of the organisation's aim is to establish reciprocal links with other
similar organisations worldwide to facilitate the sharing of experience and
rapid flow of information on new threats.

To this end if you are involved in, or have contacts with, a similar
organisation in your country, please write to CoTra (or by email to me, and I
will forward your correspondence) outlining your organisation and its aims.

Yours sincerely,

M. Mitchell Waldrop's article (_Science_, 17 March 1989, pp 1437-1439) on SOGS
is notable for its coverage accessible to the general scientific public,
and for its claim that the software engineering community has switched to
rapid prototyping.  Selected quotes follow.
  -- Paul Eggert, Twin Sun Inc. &lt;aerospace.aero.com!twinsun!eggert&gt;


		Will the Hubble Space Telescope Compute?

	Critical operations software is still a mess--the victim of
	primitive programming methods and chaotic project management

First the good news: two decades after it first went into development, the
$1.4-billion Hubble Space Telescope is almost ready to fly....

But now the bad news: the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore still
has dozens of programmers struggling to fix one of the most basic pieces of
telescope software, the $70-million Science Operations Ground System (SOGS)....
It was supposedly completed 3 years ago.  Yet bugs are still turning up ... and
the system currently runs at only one-third optimum speed....  If Space
Telescope had been launched in October 1986, as planned at the time of the
Challenger accident, it would have been a major embarrassment: a superb
scientific instrument crippled by nearly unworkable software....

[chronology:
	1980-1	2"-thick requirements doc. written by NASA-appointed committee
	1981	contract awarded to TRW; peak team included 150 people
	1983	first software components delivered
	later	SOGS declared utterly unsuitable.
]

The problem was basically a conceptual one.  NASA's specifications for SOGS had
called for a scheduling algorithm that would handle telescope operations on a
minute-by-minute basis....  The tacit assumption was that the system would
schedule astronomers on a monthly and yearly basis by simply adding up
thousands upon thousands of these minute-by-minute schedules.

In fact, that tacit assumption was a recipe for disaster....  The number of
possible combinations to consider rises much faster than exponentially....
In the computer science community, where this phenomenon has been well known
for about 40 years, it is called ``the combinatoric explosion.''  Accepted
techniques for defusing such explosions call for scheduling algorithms that
plan their trips with a road map, so to speak. And SOGS simply did not have it.

In addition to performance issues, however, SOGS was also deficient in basic
design terms.  ``SOGS used last-generation programming technology,'' says one
senior programmer....  ``SOGS was designed in such a way that you couldn't
insert new releases without bringing down the entire system!  For days!'' says
the science institute's associate director for operations, Ethan Schreier....
Indeed, the fundamental structure of SOGS is so nonmodular that fixing a bug in
one part of the program almost invariably generates new bugs somewhere else....

So, where did SOGS go wrong?...

One of the main villains seems to have been the old-line aerospace industry
approach to software development....  In the wider computer science community
this Give-Me-The-Requirements approach is considered a dismal methodology at
best...  Modern programming practice calls for ... a style known as ``rapid
prototyping''...

Even more fundamental ... few people at NASA were even thinking about
telescope operations in the early years....  the Space Telescope project as a
whole was saddled with a management structure that can only be described as
Byzantine....  At the hardware level the chaos at the top was reflected in a
raft of independently developed scientific instruments and onboard computers,
none of which were well coordinated with the others.  Indeed, the presumption
was that any such problems would be taken care of later in the software....

So, is SOGS fixed now?

Maybe.  With TRW's help, the institute has spent the past several years beating
the system into shape....  On the other hand, such progress has come at a
price.  SOGS now consists of about 1 million lines of programming code, roughly
ten time larger than originally estimated.  Its overall cost has more than
doubled, from $30 million in the original contract to roughly $70 million....

In both NASA and Pentagon contracting, the cost of the old-line approach is
becoming all too apparent.  Indeed, it has become a real sore point in the
computer community.

``It's the methodology that got us to Apollo and Skylab,'' says [James] Weiss
[data systems manager for Space Telescope at NASA headquarters].  ``But it's
not getting us to the 1990s.  The needs are more complex and the problems are
more complex.''

``SOGS,'' he says, ``is probably the last example of the old system.''

Computer  technology  significantly  affects  most  segments  of   society,
including   education,  business,  medicine,  and  the  military.   Current
computer technology and technologies that seem likely to emerge  soon  will
exert  strong  influences on our lives, in areas ranging from work to civil
liberties.  The DIAC symposium considers these influences in a broad social
context  -  ethical,  economic, political - as well as a technical context.
We seek to address directly the relationship between technology and policy.
We  solicit  papers  that  address  the  wide  range  of  questions  at the
intersection of technology and society.

Within this broad vision, we request  papers  that  address  the  following
suggested  topics.   Other  topics may be addressed if they are relevant to
the general focus.

The April 1989 _Reader's Digest_ contains a condensed version of a new book,
_Free Fall_.  The subject is Air Canada Flight 143 (23 July 1983) from
Ottawa to Edmonton, which came extremely close to becoming a major disaster
when the airplane (a Boeing 767) ran completely out of fuel while in the air.  

The problem resulted from a combination of circumstances:

(1) Both the electronic sensor designed to measure the fuel supply, and
    its backup, failed, and the necessary replacement parts were not
    readily available.  This meant that the crew had no direct indica-
    tion in the cockpit of their fuel status; the fuel gauges were
    dependent on the plane's computer equipment and were thus blank.

(2) A "dipstick" procedure for measuring fuel supply by hand was done
    incorrectly, leading the mechanics to conclude that the plane had
    more fuel than was in fact the case (and, thus, that it was safe to
    fly the plane without working fuel gauges!).  The error was later
    traced to the fact that the airplane was one of the first Canadian
    767's built to metric specifications -- and the mechanics had com-
    mitted a simple math error because they were still used to measuring
    fuel in pounds instead of kilograms.

Further, when the plane finally ran completely out of fuel and both
engines failed, the entire instrument panel -- now bereft of electrical
power -- went blank.  The radar transponder also failed, making it
impossible for air traffic controllers to track the plane.  Fortunately,
an older radar facility in Winnipeg was still operational, enabling some
degree of tracking from the ground.

Fortunately as well, the pilot of the now powerless and instrumentless
767 had had extensive experience as a gliding instructor.  He managed to
land the jet -- without engines -- at an abandoned military airstrip
about 50 miles north of Winnipeg.  Although a small fire broke out in
the plane, it was quickly extinguished.  No one (either in the plane or
on the ground) was killed or seriously injured; the plane, however, nar-
rowly missed hitting several people camped on or near the long-abandoned
runway.  The plane sustained moderate damage, primarily because the nose
gear did not extend all the way to its "locked" position and collapsed
on landing; but it was eventually repaired and still flies today.

Air Canada initially laid the blame on the pilot, co-pilot, and mainten-
ance workers (the pilot had at one point tried to help the struggling
ground crew with the fuel calculations, but ended up making the same
math error).  Eventually, though, a board of inquiry commissioned by the
Canadian federal government overturned this ruling and cited Air Cana-
da's rush to introduce a new aircraft that weighed fuel in kilos (while
older planes continued to use pounds), without giving adequate training
to the maintenance personnel, as the major cause of the accident.  Both
pilot and co-pilot received numerous awards for the skills they dis-
played in saving Flight 143, and both continue to fly airplanes for Air
Canada.

My reporting of this story is not intended as a condemnation of the
metric system.  Indeed, I myself have long been a staunch advocate of
metrication.  But the RISK of confusion and error attendant with conver-
sion to a new and unfamiliar system of measurement -- coupled with the
RISK of depending on advanced electronic systems that leave one little
or no manual recourse if they should fail -- deserves note.

Tuesday (March 28), a 16 year old farm worker was killed "when he was caught
between a conveyor belt and a doorframe." The details aren't clear from the
article, but the article does say that an electrical breaker, a plug, a kill
switch, and a direction control were all within the worker's reach at the
time he was killed. The worker's overalls became snagged on the chain-type
conveyor, which was only moving at one foot per minute. The implication from
the article seems to be that the youth had never been taught how to turn off
the machine!

I received an off-the-wall phone call last night from an editor who is
overseeing the translation of the Hackers Dictionary into Japanese.  That
amusing compilation was put together a decade or so ago by A.I.  grad students
at Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie-Mellon and recorded the then-current vernacular
of their shared cultures.  They did it for fun, but it somehow ended up getting
published.

The Hackers' Dictionary contains more than a few puns, jokes, and other things
that are hard to translate such as "moby," as in "moby memory", or "fubar" and
its regional variants "foo bar" and "foo baz".  While a Japanese version of
this dictionary might be of some limited value to a person who comes to the
U.S. for an extended visit, there are clearly some risks involved in attempting
such a translation.

The particular problem that prompted the call was the definition of "logical."
Apparently the dictionary gives as an example a statement something like "If
Les Earnest left and was replaced by another person, the latter would be known
as the logical Les Earnest."  This had been written when I was the principal
bureaucrat of the Stanford A.I. Lab. and was apparently intended to describe
some set of responsibilities that could be transferred from one person to
another.

The editor reported that the Japanese translator had been hopelessly confused
by this example; he found "earnest" in the dictionary but was unable to figure
out what a "Les Earnest" was.  The editor had tried to explain it to him but
was unable to get the idea across.  He finally called me to find out what my
official job title had been, so that he could describe the example in more
generic terms.

I hope that they manage to work it out, but I am not willing to bet that the
Japanese Hackers Dictionary will be fully comprehensible.

PC WEEK (March 27, 1989) reports:

     "The recent rash of remote local area network software
     packages has thrust the PC industry into a national
     controversy over electronic monitoring and workers'
     rights to privacy.

     At question is whether or not products such as . . .
     Microcom Inc.'s Carbon Copy, which can be configured to
     allow undetected monitoring of PCs, violate workers'
     Fourth Amendment rights 'of people to be secure in
     their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
     unreasonable searches and seizures.'

     In answer to complaints from Massachusetts unions that
     workers' rights are being violated, the Massachusetts
     Coalition of New Office Technology (CNOT) plans to set
     up some guidelines to regulate employers who opt for
     electronic monitoring.  The group's first step is to
     file a bill with the Massachusetts Dept. of Labor that
     would force employers to notify job applicants of any
     electronic monitoring . . . and to inform workers when
     they are being monitored."

Carbon Copy is usually perceived as software which allows one PC to be
controlled from another remotely located one.  But programs like Carbon Copy
can be configured to observe network activity without a user's permission,
detection, or override.  Lisa Morel of Microcom reports that:  "the ones who
are asking about it [undetected monitoring] are the system managers."

While monitoring software can provide important network trouble- shooting and
tuning help, users may view its secret operation as "condoned tapping."
Monitoring differs from event logging.  More than recording what the user does,
monitoring software clones the user's activity on the observer's terminal.

Interest in using undetected monitoring programs may increase with growing
concern about network security and management.  These programs are not limited
to PC platforms.  Moreover, serious reservations reach beyond the nasty
business of how managers gather employee performance data.

o  The observer may monitor user access to organizationally
   sensitive information.

o  Secret monitoring conflicts with the Information Resource
   Management (IRM) principle of user data ownership.

o  From a lay legal view:

     -  In a Federal government environment (including
        contractors), secret monitoring of user access to
        personnel information could lead to violation of the
        Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579).

     -  Undetected monitoring of a third-party's remote session
        could violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
        of 1986 (Public Law 99-508).

In efforts to preserve security and integrity, are system managers and their
parent organizations prepared to handle the ramifications of secret monitoring?

GALACTIC HACKER PARTY

                2nd, 3rd, 4th of August 1989
                                 PARADISO, AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND

During the summer of 1989 the world as we know it will go into overload.
An interstellar particle stream of hackers, phone phreaks, radioactivists
and assorted technological subversives will be fusing their energies into a
media melt-down as the global village plugs into Amsterdam for three
electrifying days of information interchange and electronic capers.

Aided by the advanced communications technology to which they are accustomed,
the hacker forces will discuss strategies, play games, and generally have a
good time.  Free access to permanently open on-line facilities will enable them
to keep in touch with home base -- wherever that is.

Those who rightly fear the threat of information tyranny and want to learn what
they can do about it are urgently invited to interface in Amsterdam in August.
There will be much to learn from people who know.  Celebrity guests with
something to say will be present in body or electronic spirit.

The Force must be nurtured.  If you are refused transport because your laptop
looks like a bomb, cut off behind enemy lines, or unable to attend for any
other reason, then join us on the networks.  Other hacker groups are requested
to organize similar gatherings to coincide with ours.  We can provide low-cost
international communications links during the conference.

From:    WA2SQQ Bob Kozlarek
Subject: Software Virus
	PKZIP/PKUNZIP .92
	 AM40/AM41

Recent developments in the software world have required the famous PKARC
software to be replaced by a new version called PKZIP/PKUNZIP.

While several versions have been seen, the latest appears to be version .92
.  Usually listed on landline BBS's is a program which will provide a menu
driven screen for PKZIP, usually listed as AM-40 or AM-41.

After running these one time, the embedded virus allocated 13 meg of memory
to "never never land". It appears that this "strain" looks to see how much
memory is occupied on the HD and then proceeds to gobble up an equal amount
of unused memory.  The results are devastating if you have more than 50% of
the drives capacity in use.  With the assistance of Gary WA2BAU I was able
to retrieve the lost memory by using CHKDSK /f.  For those of you who are
not familiar with this DOS command, drop me a line @KD6TH and I'll
elaborate.  My sincere thanks goes out to Gary WA2BAU for saving me lots of
disk handling ! Please pass this on to your local BBS and be sure to include
the remedy.

Considering the dangers of using software and hardware for which doc is
poor, I think that the following, found on a distribution list I receive,
is very appropriate for this list.  Certainly RISKS readers are likely
to have many good suggestions, and a discussion of how we may
improve how we create/use/misuse documentation would be, to me,
quite useful.  Responses to Joel's query go, of course, directly to
him, but I'd think that discussion can go to RISKS.  (Subject to
the usual RISKS guidelines and our moderator's opinion, of course.)

&gt;
&gt;I am working on a proposal to add to the curriculum here a course in
&gt;writing computer documentation.  The course, as currently envisioned,
&gt;would deal with both hardware and software docs, and would focus
&gt;primarily on satisfying the needs of the non-technical end-user.  The
&gt;course would be offered by the English department but might be included
&gt;in the degree programs of other departments such as Computer Science,
&gt;Communication, etc.
&gt;
&gt;In order to provide evidence for the need for this course, I'm
&gt;gathering information on the attitudes of users toward the state of
&gt;computer documentation today.  Anyone who would like to assist me can
&gt;do so by answering the following questions:
&gt;
&gt;1)  On the usual scale of F to A, what overall grade would you give
&gt;    to the docs you've used over the past few years?
&gt;
&gt;2)  What is/are the most common, persistent, and/or destructive
&gt;    problem(s) you've encountered in these docs?
&gt;
&gt;I would also be grateful if anyone who has had direct experience with this kind
&gt;of course  --  as teacher, student, whatever  --  would give me useful advice.

I sent Joel mail asking for permission to submit his query to RISKS.
His response is also thought provoking.

&gt;I would be pleased if you would forward my docs survey to RISKS and to

&gt;of reasons that I won't go into here. The vital info:

&gt;I think I'm onto something big here, something that goes far beyond
&gt;one course at one school. I seem to have tapped into a great wellspring
&gt;of anger and frustration, and the material I've gathered should be good
&gt;for at least an article, if not a whole volume.

Today's Independent newspaper contains an advert by BMW which provides yet
further evidence of the automative industry's flagrant disregard for the
possible risks associated with new computer-based technology.  The main text of
the advert is reprinted below, in its entirety, followed by a brief note of
some of what I regard as the more obvious risks.

 BEFORE A BMW WILL START IT WEIGHS UP WHO'S DRIVING
 
 First BMW brought you ABS, for safer braking in the wet.  Then came ASC, to
 help counter wheelspin during acceleration.  Today, they can unveil DWS:
 probably the most significant advance in anti-theft technology to occur in
 recent years.
 
 DWS stands for Driver's Weight Sensor.  A unique system that compares the
 driver's weight with a pre-programmed value stored in the sensor's computer
 memory.  If the two values do not match, the car simply refuses to start.
 
 Clearly, this represents a whole new level of anti-theft sophistication.
 But one that has only be made possible thanks to recent advances in space
 satellite PHAT technology.  This remarkable new material - Poly Halide Anodal
 Tritium - exhibits a highly predictable change in electrical conductivity
 according to the pressure exerted upon it.  By harnessing these properties,
 BMW's engineers have devised a wafer-thin pressure pad that, when
 incorporated into the driver's seat, can electronically assess the occupant's
 weight to within 10 grams accuracy.
 
 Such is the system's intelligence, it will take account of bodyweight
 variations that occur according to the time of day, or even the time of year.
 This it achieves by interlocking with the car's on-board 365-day digital
 clock.  Accurate allowance can then be made for weight increases that may be
 expected immediately after meal times, and those that are caused by
 multi-layer clothing during the winter months.
 
 Despite its space age technology, the operation of DWS is simplicity itself.
 
 On entering the car, the driver inserts the ignition key, at which point the
 words `Code Enter' flash up on the dashboard LED display. Up to five of these
 codes can be stored for five different drivers.  The driver now enters his
 personal code on the key pad and his weight appears on the light-up display,
 expressed in either pounds or kilos.  (Lady drivers who would prefer this
 visible display switched off should consult their BMW dealer, who will carry
 out the small necessary adjustment free of charge.)
 
 The sensor weight reading is then compared to the programmed weight in the
 memory, and providing this falls to within +-5%, the car will start normally.
 If, however, the figure exceeds these tolerances, then a discreet gong
 sounds, and the entire ignition system shuts down.
 
 Should persistent attempts be made to restart the car, an alarm system is
 triggered, and the headlights flash alternately until the unauthorised person
 vacates the seat and re-closes the door.
 
 At the same time a pre-recorded message is transmitted on the standard
 police radio frequency, notifying all walkie-talkie equipped police officers
 within 350 metres of the car's registration number.
 
 If you'd like to know whether the Driver's Weight Sensor anti-theft system
 can be fitted to your car, contact your local BMW dealer, or post off the
 coupon below [to Hugh Phelfrett, BMW Information Service, PO Box 46,
 Hounslow, Middlesex, TW4 6NF].

Some likely risks:

Just when you have arrived back from a week-end backpacking, and are desperate
to get to MacDonald's before they close, the car is likely to refuse to
recognise you. (The opposite problem is perhaps not so bad - for example, it
would be good for you to be occasionally forced to walk or jog to
WeightWatcher's class.)

Suppose the car does consent to take you to MacDonald's, the weight display,
which I assume is dynamically updated, will be an additional and dangerous
distraction while you drive home eating your Big Mac. (A head-up display would
reduce this risk.)

A person's weight variations over the year are strongly correlated to cultural,
racial, and religious factors. Almost certainly, therefore, this system will
provide another example of "computerized discrimination".

There is even a security-related risk. By periodically dieting, a spy could use
the occasional transmissions of the pre-recorded message as a covert signalling
channel to a near-by embassy, say.

From The Wall Street Journal, Thursday, March 30, 1989, p. A1:

"DIAL-A-SNORE:  People having difficulty sleeping can dial the Lenox Hill
Hospital Sleepline in New York.  An answering machine plays an eight-minute
tape that includes a message designed to help insomniacs doze off while
listening."

Pity the poor insomniac who does fall asleep in the middle of such a call:

- After eight minutes, the Lenox Hill Hospital answering machine will hang
up and a loud, synthesized telephone company voice will say, "If you'd like
to make a call, please hang up and try again."

- If our insomniac manages to sleep through that, his or her phone might
well remain off-hook all night, blocking incoming (possibly emergency) calls.

This is quoted from memory from a Wall Street Journal article on the event: The
manufacturer's "minimum equipment list" for the 767 includes two electronic
fuel guages.  Thus, technically, the pilot took the plane off with inadequate
equipment.  I can understand why both the pilots and the airline would consider
manually measuring the fuel level with a dipstick to be fully equivalent to the
electronic fuel guage, but this event shows that one should probably fly by the
book; infrequently performed manual backup activities have a high likelihood of
error.

This morning's Washington _Post_ has a near-full-page article on fly-by-wire
aircraft and the safety issues involved.  It's a rather well-written piece
which (unlike too many of the so-called "news" reports) is not written to
prove that the FBW systems ("are absolutely safe"|"are not at all safe").
Choose your favorite ending; both types of "news" are available.

(The article is on page C-3; issue date is Sunday, 2 April)

The article cites the Airbus crash in France last 26 June.  That crash has been
the subject of numerous RISKS submissions which have explored many of the
issues, but the _Post_ article cites other Airbus problems I haven't seen
detailed.  They include "...engines unexpectedly throttling up on final
approach; inaccurate altimeter readings; sudden power loss prior to landing;
steering problems while taxiing."

The reports are credited to "the European press".  Can anyone elaborate
on the reports?

 [Nancy Leveson is in DC this week, and picked up a copy.  If no one else comes
  up with a fuller report, Nancy has promised one for Tuesday night.  PGN]

A1 + A2:

Elevator accident kills 13-year-old refugee
(By Dennis Foley, Citizen staff writer)

  A 13-year-old girl [...] was crushed to death Saturday in an Ottawa
apartment elevator that residents say has a history of malfunctioning.
  Segal Samanter jumped on the elevator and was caught between the closing
door and the door frame [...] She was crushed against the upper door frame.
  Several residents said all three elevators continually malfunction
and passengers are often jarred by their quick-closing doors.     [...]
  "If they break down, they're repaired immediately," he said. "There was
an elevator repairman here today." [building manager, Cliff Gray]
  He didn't know which of the three elevators had been repaired Saturday.  [...]
  "There is always something wrong with these elevators. They move when
they're not supposed to, and they stop between floors." [Afshin Adill]
  Ababdihakim Ali, 19, said that earlier in the day the door of the
elevator in which Samanter was killed would close only halfway. It
continued to operate this way, he said.    [...]
  Witnesses said the elevator had stopped several centimetres above the
floor level before Samater (sic) got on.
  Awleker Ahmed, 16, said he had been standing alongside Samanter in the
elevator lobby and had warned her against trying to jump on to the
elevator, which already contained several passangers.
  She ignored his warning, he said.   [...]
  Pat Baerg, the building's secretary, said problems with the elevators are
the result of tenant abuse.
  "If children didn't play on them and tenants didn't jam the doors open
with cardboard, we wouldn't have problems," she said.
  She also said many tenants didn't know how to properly use them.
  "It's a tenant problem, not an elevator problem," she said.     [...]'

&gt;(2) A "dipstick" procedure for measuring fuel supply by hand was done
&gt;    incorrectly, leading the mechanics to conclude that the plane had
&gt;    more fuel than was in fact the case (and, thus, that it was safe to
&gt;    fly the plane without working fuel gauges!)...

Does the book (or the condensed version) address the question of whether
this "safe" procedure violated regulations?  My recollection of what was
said at the time is that it's okay to fly a 767 with both fuel gauges
operating, and it's okay to fly with one gauge operating plus the
dipstick check, but if both gauges are out [as in the 1983 case], the
plane is supposed to stay on the ground, period.

Whether my memory is correct or not, taking off with no fuel gauges strikes
me as a dangerous and foolhardy action.  Quite apart from reducing a
redundant system to a single failure point (the manual calculation), the
decision to take off without gauges also quietly assumed that nothing
would go wrong in such a way as to quietly reduce available fuel (e.g.
a leak).  The real problem here was not unit conversion, but the old
"it can't happen to me" syndrome.  Bet that pilot never takes off without
gauges again, ever, dipstick tests or no dipstick tests.

Some newspapers in the area are trying to obtain magtape copies of public
records that already available on paper, such as driver licenses, criminal
convictions, and land ownership.  They want to perform statistical tests and
cross-database matching.  This would seem to have all the dangers of
governmental database matching, e.g. that when a coincidence is found, the
victim is assumed guilty and must prove his innocence.

However, the newspapers might be harder on an innocent victim than the
government since they can publish anything, however false, if they can't be
proved to have been malicious.  Finding and printing an interesting
coincidence, perhaps that you own property next to someone accused of organized
crime, and also sold your previous car to another organized crime suspect,
wouldn't be malicious, just sensationalistic.

From an informational notice entitled "Important Answers about PROPERTY
REVALUATION" hung on my doorknob by a representative of the Montgomery County
Auditor's Department (Dana A. Stamps, County Auditor):

	... [previous Important Answers, to questions like {\bf What is
	the purpose of a revaluation program}]
	
	{\bf How is my property value determined}
	
	In the first phase, data collectors -- who are not appraisers --
	verify and update the County property data file by making an on-site
	visit to your property.  Using the information gathered by the data
	collector and sales data from the local market, the appraiser uses a
	computer to perform statistical analysis and mathematical calculations
	necessary in arriving at two basic approaches to value for residential
	property -- the Cost Approach and the Market Approach -- to compare
	your property to the current market trends and assist him in his final
	conclusion of value.
	
	The computer then produces an appraisal review card, from which a
	professional appraiser will determine the actual value in a final
	field review of each parcel.  All final value conclusions are made by
	an experienced appraiser during this review.  With the laborious tasks
	of statistical analysis and calculations being done by computer, the
	appraisers are now free to concentrate their talents on evaluating the
	results.  Through integration of the electronic efficiency and
	accuracy of the computer with the experience and sound judgement of
	professional appraisers, the auditor's office will save the taxpayers
	of this county many thousands of dollars on future revaluations and
	enhance the quality of the appraisal process.  ...
	[more Important Answers follow]

No news yet on any systems acquisition fiascos in the Auditor's
Office, but the tone of the letter shows that the Auditor expects
county property owners to sleep easy knowing that their tax bills are
being set with the help of "the electronic efficiency and accuracy of
the computer."  There is an appeal and review process for individuals,
but no mention of how the statistical model itself is validated.

Regarding Mike Trout's query:

&gt;But on a more important topic, is there any empirical
&gt;evidence to suggest that credit card fraud could be significantly reduced by
&gt;facial images, either true photographs or digitized images?

Several years ago I was told by the late Charles Read, who at the time was
Director of the Inter-Bank Research Organisation, here in the UK, that they had
run an experiment on the use of photographs on credit cards, as an aid to
reducing fraud. He told me that: "We sent out a dozen people, each with a
credit card bearing the same photograph of the same gorilla, and on average
they succeeded in passing the card eight times!" (I found the phrase "the same
photograph of the same gorilla" particularly memorable, and have often wondered
what the results would have been if they had used different gorillas!)

April's IEEE Spectrum contains an article about the design of the Intel i860
(aka "N10") RISC processor.  In a section called "Unauthorized Initiative" [p
26] the author (T. S. Perry) includes the following story:

  One of the designers heard from a friend in Intel's CAD department about a
  tool that would take a design from the logic-simulation level, optimize the
  circuit design, and generate an optimized layout.  The tool eliminated the
  time taken up by circuit schematics, as well as the checking for schematic
  errors.  It was still under development, however, and while it was even then
  being tested and debugged by the 486 team (who had several more months before
  deadline than did the N10 team), it was not considered ready for use.

  The N10 designer accessed the CAD department's mainframe through the
  in-house computer network and copied the program.  It worked, and the
  bus-control bottleneck was solved. 

  Said CAD manager Nave guardedly, "A tool at that stage definately has
  problems.  The specific engineer who took it was competent to overcome most
  of the problems himself, so it didn't have any negative impact, which it
  could have.  It may have worked well in the case of the N10, but we don't
  condone that as general practice."

A number of classic RISKs are apparent, but what stands out to me is the
lucidity in the last paragraph and the importance of engineers' *understanding*
their tools, not just *using* them.  (This also reminds me of how some
mathematicians get upset when they perceive engineers using mathematical tools
without a good understanding of their basis, e.g., using integration without
studying measure theory first...) Of course, it is not just electrical
engineers but social `engineers' and other planners, controllers, etc. that
need to understand their tools functions and limits.

Same problems in Silicon Valley.  I rear-ended a car in stop/go traffic in
December (my first ever collision).  I gave the guy I hit my insurance details,
and reported the matter to my insurance, who agreed to pay, no problems.

A month later I got a notice that my license would be suspended in two weeks
for being in an accident and not having insurance.  I was informed that after
that date I would be automatically jailed if any officer caught me driving.
How did the State hear of the accident, and how did it conclude I was
uninsured?  I've no idea.  The telephone number they gave was *permanently*
busy, I tried many times, but I *immediately* had sent them documentation which
proved I had been insured.

Two months later I got a notice informing me that my suspension had been
cancelled, after it had been in place for some weeks.  I'm glad I wasn't
stopped during that time is all I can say.

I noted with interest the article on the erasure of floppy disks placed
vertically behind a child's car seat in an automobile equipped with seat
heaters.  I wonder if the data was made unreadable by the magnetic field
of the heater, or if the disk was raised to above the Curie temperature
(the point where a substance loses its magnetism because of thermal agitation.)

Today, there was a bulletin on the radio in which the Montreal Urban Community
Transportation Commission (MUCTC), the authority that operates the buses and
subway (Metro) in Montreal, announced a problem with the magnetic stripe at
the bottom of its monthly passes when used in automatic turnstiles. They claim
that some six hundred of the five hundred thousand issued monthly (0.12%) are
damaged by proximity to magnetic latches in purses and wallets.

Does anyone know if credit cards are subject to this problem?

A rather bizarre common mode failure has been detected in the recent inspection
of grounded B-1B bombers: there was a shortage of lubricant in a critical
gearbox in 70 of the 80 planes inspected (with 17 more still to go).  The
problem was found on the plane whose wing swept into the fuel tank
(<A HREF="/Risks/8.46.html">RISKS-8.46</A>), which resulted in two shafts fractured and a leak along a fuel
tank seam.  [San Francisco Chronicle, 5 April 1989, p. A7]

(quotes&amp;inserts from FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL, 25 March 1989)

On Feb 2 the 1st prototype (of 5) of Sweden's Saab JAS39 Gripen fighter crashed
on landing after its 6th test flight.  It impacted, broke left main gear,
bounced, skidded and flipped.

``Gripen is naturally unstable and has a triplex digital fly-by-wire system
with a triplex analogue backup.''

Initial flight was ``some 18 months behind schedule'' and this was ``attributed
to difficulties in proving the software for the flight control system.''

After the 1st flight, test pilot ``remarked that the control system seemed
too sensitive and that the control laws would probably need to be changed.''
On all flights ``the aircraft experienced problems with lateral oscillations.''
[On the] ``last flight oscillation in pitch was also apparent.''

The accident investigation committee chairman ``confirms earlier assumptions
that the flight control system was at fault.''

Chairman:
``The accident was caused by the aircraft experiencing increasing pitch
 oscillations (divergent dynamic instability) in the final stage of landing,
 the oscillations becoming uncontrollable.  This was because movement
 of the stick in the pitch axis exceeded the values predicted when 
 designing the flight control system, whereby the stability margins were
 exceeded at the critical frequency.''

Separate investigation by the JAS Industry Group:
``The control laws implemented in the flight-control system's computer had
 deficiencies with respect to controlling the pitch axis at low speed.
 In this case, the pilot's control commands were subjected to such a delay
 that he was out of phase with the aircraft's motion.''

``the company hopes to fly JAS39-2 before the end of the year.''
``Delivery of the first production aircraft [...] is now expected
 in [1993, although typo said `1933'], instead of 1992.''

                Swedish wind cuts fly-by-wires

Flight-control software has been blamed for the crash of the prototype
Swedish Gripen fighter last February.  The preliminary report from the
Swedish government's crash-investigation commission indifified the
software's inability to cope with gusting winds and the oversensitivity of
the control system as the prime reasons for the accident.

According to a spokesman for the commission, problems with the \pound 3.2
billion project first arose in an earlier flight test.  "The preceeding test
flight had shown up problems, but it's not a problem with the aircraft or
with the flight control systems.  It's a software problem.

"The whole of the control system was too sensitive for the pilot; it
operated too fast.  It was too easy for the pilot to go outside the
flight-control envelope into unstable flight."

In common with many fighters currently being developed, the JAS39
Gripen is designed to be inherently unstable to increase its
manoeuverability.  It relies on the software to keep it under control.

"There were limitations on the flight control systems, but during the
landing phase the wind was stronger than allowed for by these
limitations.  The pilot had to try to overcome them."

A final report into the crash is due in May, but work has already
started on the second prototype aircraft, including a modified version
of the flight-control software.

Here is the full Washington Post article, interspersed with a few of my
comments.   

WASHINGTON POST: OUTLOOK, 04/02/89
Copyright (c) 1989 The Washington Post Co.
By Jim Beatson
    
    [Jim Beatson writes on aviation issues for the Guardian and some other
     British newspapers.  He is currently living in Canada.  NGL]
         [Apparently either Beatson or the Post removed some more controversial
         items from the original British appearance of this material.  PGN]

   IN JUNE, a new plane hits the American skies. Northwest Airlines will become
the first U.S. carrier to take delivery of the European Airbus A320 -- the most
advanced passenger aircraft in the world, and already one of the most
controversial. In use since last May by British Airways and Air France, the
medium-sized 150-seat twin-engine jet is the first airliner to have every
function, from flight controls to toilet operation, directed by computer.
   On June 26, 1988, two days after the third A320 went into service, it
crashed while performing a low-level pass at a French air show. A woman and two
children on board were killed. An investigation blamed the accident on pilot
error, but the pilot faulted a number of factors including the aircraft's
computers for providing incorrect altitude information. (The pilot, a senior
Air France captain, was subsequently dismissed.) Since then, various unsettling
reports have appeared in the European press, regarding: engines unexpectedly
throttling up on final approach; inaccurate altimeter readings; sudden power
loss prior to landing; steering problems while taxiing.

       [NGL:  It is interesting that the pilot was never believed about 
       the altimeter although there is not plenty of evidence to back up
       his story.  I have noticed several things about evaluation of 
       accidents in general:

       1) Human error is always the first ascribed cause whenever a human 
       is involved in the system where an accident occurred.  However, 
       most accidents are multi-factorial.  If the altimeter is indeed 
       inaccurate, then the accident was only partially caused by the
       pilot.  Humans tend to want simple answers to complex problems and
       to be able to ascribe blame to some single cause.  There are, of 
       course, other factors at work in these oversimplifications such 
       as liability issues and misplaced faith in technology.  But seldom 
       are accidents the result of only one thing going wrong.  Actually, 
       the few times I have found this to be true (i.e., one thing is at 
       fault), it is a computer that is the primary agent.  Perhaps engineers 
       expect other things to fail and therefore design systems so that a 
       single failure cannot lead to an accident.  But since (as engineers 
       often tell me or write in system safety evaluations) computer software 
       does not fail...

       2) If a human cannot be blamed, then the hardware is.  The first
       incident involving the Therac 25 occurred in Hamilton, Ontario.
       The accident was blamed on a faulty microswitch (a "transient"
       failure since nothing could be found wrong with the microswitch).
       The fix for the problem was to put in a duplicate microswitch to
       detect when the filter was not in place to correctly filter
       the X-ray beam.  When the next incident occurred in Tyler,
       Texas (again involving the misalignment of the filter), it was
       believed that the burn suffered by the patient (who died from his
       injuries 6 months later) was electrical.  Nobody believed that he
       could have suffered an overdose or that the computer could be 
       involved.  The electrical system was checked out and found to be 
       OK so the machine was deemed safe.  Two weeks later another man 
       was overdosed in Tyler (he died two weeks after this) and FINALLY, 
       someone (at the hospital) decided the computer might be involved.  
       It was the physicist at the hospital who was able to reproduce the 
       problem and raise an alarm about the computer.  He had some difficulty 
       convincing anyone else about this.  The Therac 25 victim in Georgia 
       had great trouble convincing anyone that the Therac was responsible 
       for her severe burns.  This was true also for the first overdose in 
       Yakima.  Finally, when the second person was overdosed in Yakima 
       (and all the prior incidents had occurred including the detection 
       of an error in the software that could have caused the incidents), 
       people were willing to examine the possibility that this was a 
       software error (a different software error was given the blame 
       this time).  Why are people so reluctant to believe that the 
       computer may be at fault?]
     
[returning to the Washington Post article]

   Of course, the introduction of any new aircraft entails shake-out
problems of one kind or another. But the A320's extensive use of
computers raises a new set of questions: Are we ready to rely so heavily
on complex software systems for such safety-critical applications as
commercial flight? 

   Bird on a Wire

The control system employed by the A320 is known as "fly by wire." FBW
replaces the conventional stick and rudder controls with a series of
computers and miles of electronic cables. Instead of the familiar
control-column, the pilots use "side-sticks," a single lever resembling
the joy sticks used in video games.
   Sensing devices which gauge the aircraft's flight characteristics
pass the information to the six color monitors that replace nearly all
the traditional analog instruments and result, Airbus says, in 75
percent fewer instruments than conventional configurations. On the
uncluttered flight deck, the pilot on the right uses the side-stick with
the right hand while the pilot on the left has a left-handed version.
(On the left, pilots tend to push the aircraft to the right owing to the
position of the forearm and wrist; that side-stick was adjusted to
compensate.) But the computer system actually directs the control surfaces. 
Only the rudder and horizontal stabilizer -- both on the tail -- be 
mechanically directed by the pilot.
   All other flight controls are managed by the electrical flight-
control system (EFCS), which contains three spoiler/elevator computers
(SEC), two elevator/aileron computers (ELAC) and the flight-augmentation
computer that oversees stability, limiting and protection functions. The
engines and throttles are managed by the full-authority digital engine-
control (FADEC) computers. The EFCS uses "dissimilar redundancy." That
is, computers that are designed to back each other up are of different
brands, have different microprocessor types and are supplied by
different vendors -- all to minimize the likelihood of identical hardware
parts failing at the same time. And different programmers were employed
to write each of the parallel sets of software. Moreover, each computer
is divided into two physically separate units with "segregated" power
supplies.

      [NGL:  There were different programmers.  Were there different
       requirements specifications?  How about design specifications?
       How much detailed design information was provided to the programmers?]

   The EFCS is designed to fly within a theoretical "flight
envelope" -- permissible ranges for various maneuvers -- thus providing
computer-monitored protection against windshear forces, overload or
overspeed conditions. If the pilot were to, say, allow the speed to drop
toward the stall point, the computer would sound alarms and
automatically increase the power.
   In the event that two computers should disagree, one automatically
shuts itself down and its tasks are carried out by the other. For
example, if one unit directed the flaps to be partly extended and its
monitoring software expected full flap extension, then the first unit
would automatically shut itself down and its functions would be passed
over to the other. The pilots' display monitors would tell them what had
happened. Finally, each of the five flight-control-surface computers is
capable of performing all of the essential tasks of the others as well
as its own tasks.

      [NGL:  If two computers disagree, how is it determined which computer
       to shut down?  It does not sound like the pilots do this, they are
       just told about the event afterward (and may not have the information
       necessary to make this decision anyway).   So how is the decision
       made?  How do they know that the monitor is correct and the other
       one is not?]
     
   The Airbus A320, of course, is not the first civilian aircraft to use
computerized control. Boeing's 757 and 767, for example, have computer-
activated spoilers; and Boeing had planned to use FBW technology in the
7J7 but subsequently deferred development. Joe Sutter, Boeing's chief
engineer for the past 20 years, believes that "fly-by-wire is way
overstated as to its benefits"; and as for the side-stick, system, "we
have some reservations -- like what one pilot is doing is not obvious to
the other."
   "The main benefit of FBW," he says, "is to reduce weight and increase
range. It will really boost safety. But fooling around with FBW to
reduce [something like] tail size goes against the design philosophy I
have always urged -- that you've got to design an aircraft which one day
for some reason or other is going to get into a hell of a lot of trouble.
" That means mechanical back-up systems for the main control surfaces.
"What happens with FBW when the aircraft gets outside its control laws?
Its going to leave the pilot in one hell of a lot of trouble -- for what?
One-percent fuel burn?"
   A great deal more than that, says Airbus, which believes it now
enjoys a significant competitive advantage over Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas in fuel and weight savings. An Air France official says that the
Airbus A320 is 40 percent more fuel efficient than the old Boeing 727s
they have replaced. He was expecting 8 to 9 percent better, "but it's a
good result anyway."

   How Safe Is Safe?

But for all FBW's advantages, critics argue that its sophisticated
computer system may be too far ahead of its time because of our
relatively limited ability to test the reliability of software.
   Airbus Industry executive Robert Alizart believes that the duplicate
architecture "reduces the chances of a total system loss to an absolute
minimum." But Martyn Thomas, chairman of Praxis Systems, which produces special
high-reliability software for Britain's Air Force, believe such precautions
offer no guarantees. "Errors get through," Thomas says.  "There may be common
sources of error, such as a faulty specification, which cause the same mistakes
in every version of the program. Identical errors may be made by independent
teams. Testing only exercises a small proportion of the possible situations
that the program may have to handle."
   Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at S.R.I. International, a Menlo Park,
Calif., think tank, is a specialist in software engineering who has documented
hundreds of software failure cases in the aerospace and other industries.
Neumann says, "There are very serious risks in reliance or software in
safety-critical applications. A seemingly innocuous addition to the software
could have disastrous effects not discovered in testing. Never trust anyone who
says such failures can never happen."
   The task facing testers is prodigious. "For even small amounts of software,"
says Thomas, "the number of possible paths far exceeds the number which could
realistically be tested. For example, a recent module comprising 100 lines of
assembly code was analyzed and found to contain 38 million possible paths, of
which 500,000 could be followed with valid input data."
   Mike Hennell, head of Computational Mathematics at Liverpool University --
an authority on software reliability -- has not examined the A320's software
code. Still, he says: "I wouldn't get into an Airbus A320 or any fly-by-wire
aircraft."
   "We don't have the technology yet to tell if the programs have been
adequately tested. We don't know what 'adequately tested' means. We can't
predict what errors are left after testing, what their frequency is or what
their impact will be. If, after testing over a long period, the program has not
crashed, then it is assumed to be okay. That presupposes that they will have
generated all of the sort of data that will come at it in real life -- and it
is not clear that that will be true."
   Indeed, scientists have been working for 15 years on software
reliability models, writes John Musa of AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in the
February issue of IEEE Spectrum. And they are now "moving into practice
and starting to pay off." But they "deal with average rather than
specific behavior, since the random nature of program usage and fault
introduction generates failures at random." In the case of an airline
reservation system, for example, "it is impossible to predict the next
specific input and hence the next specific failure. Average behavior,
however, can be characterized."
   The international design standard for airborne software systems (RTCA
DO-178A) was developed by the Washington-based Radio Technical Commission for
Aeronautics. Nancy Leveson, a specialist in software safety research and
currently a visiting professor at MIT, says that DO- 178A is "not adequate for
certifying commercial aircraft software. It lacks any mention of formal
verification of safety, as required, for example, by the Department of Defense"
which demands safety and hazard analysis.
   The FAA does, however, oblige developers "to use certain accepted concepts
for design and development," says Mike DeWalt, an aircraft computer software
specialist with the FAA. Although FAA officials do not see all the programming
("obviously there's no way in the world that a review agency could look at that
much code"), they do demand adequate testing and quality evaluation, and even
sample the programmers' work.  "Basically, we take a slice through the whole
system," says DeWalt. That is, pick a function like left aileron control and
"follow it all the way down through testing and configuration management."
   "I don't want to imply that manufacturers and subcontractors will not do
their best," Leveson says. "After all, they have the liability, and I'm sure
they are decent human beings who care about human life. The problem is that
without external review, we are depending on the competence of the employees of
these companies, and I am less sanguine about the general state of software
engineering knowledge and practice in industry than I am about the good
intentions of humans."
   Daryl Pederson, deputy director of the FAA's Aircraft Certification Division
and the man charged with certifying the A320, says of DO-178A, "The document
recognizes that you can't test every situation you encounter." His British
counterpart, Brian Perry, head of Avionics and Electrical Systems at the Civil
Aviation Authority, agrees: "It's true that we are not able to establish to a
fully verifiable level that the A320 software has no errors. It's not
satisfactory, but it's a fact of life."

   Computers in the Sky

Nonetheless, FBW offers the pilot some real gains. In extreme situations
such as suddenly encountering strong windshear, the computers
instantaneously compensate. Gordon Gorbes, chief test pilot for Airbus,
says, "If a pilot has to make violent changes to the aircraft's attitude
in an emergency, then the computer will prevent the pilot pushing it
past design strengths. For example, the computer would prevent the pilot
putting it into a dive that might break off the tail." And FBW saves
money for the plane's owner, by reducing hardware costs, keeping the
aircraft at optimum fuel-saving trim and facilitating the switch from
three- to two-person flight crews.
   Many pilots flying the A320 have been enthusiastic in praising its
handling and flying qualities. But some have complained about software
problems and control irregularities. (The number of such complaints,
according to Airbus' technical director, Bernard Ziegler, is small.) One
problem reported by Air France, in a memo dated July 10, 1988 to Airbus,
noted a software bug in its altimeter which measures the aircraft's
height, a problem which has also been observed with British Airways'
A320s. It is this problem that the pilot of the A320 that crashed at the
small French airport at Mulhouse last June claimed contributed to the
accident.

      [NGL:  And which no one believed at the time.]

   There are various ways to fix a bug or add to a plane's installed
software. Complete boxes containing replacement hardware and software
can be exchanged by Airbus Industries. For carriers like Northwest, with
100 aircraft on order, this option would be expensive. So reprogramming
could take place at a keyboard in the aircraft, conducted by Airbus or
Northwest engineers. With over 640 aircraft on order around the world
using two different makes of engine and a variety of sub-systems, the
problem of "configuration management," as it is termed in the computer
industry, becomes apparent.

    [NGL:  Note that a configuration management problem involving 
     a navigation computer was implicated in the Antarctica crash of 
     the Air New Zealand plane into Mount Erebus.  Of course, planes
     are not sent back to the factory for all of the hardware design 
     changes that occur -- usually the maintenance crew handles 
     them, Is the problem different for software?]

   So does the problem of anticipating a near-infinitude of real-life
contingencies. In 1983 a United Airlines Boeing 767 went into a four-
minute powerless glide after the pilot was compelled to shut down both
engines because of overheating. The National Transportation Safety Board
discovered that the plane's computerized engine-management system had
ordered the engines to run at a relatively slow speed to optimize fuel
efficiency. In the flight's particular atmospheric circumstances,
however, this had allowed ice to build up on some engine surfaces,
reducing the flow of air and causing the engines to work harder and
overheat.
   "The problem is that the designer didn't anticipate all the possible
demands the software would face," says Hennell. "The computer will
always do something. But it will only do the correct thing if it has
been programmed for that situation."

Over the weekend National Public Radio had a piece about a new form of sports
wagering: radio-controlled mechanical horse racing.  Apparently the robot
horses used are miniature, which allows racetracks to be placed in smaller
areas; the "horses" also of course do not require care, feeding or jockeys.
The idea is being proposed by an individual who has built a few operating
prototypes.

One reporter raised the question: What is to prevent an unscrupulous bettor
from interfering with or jamming the radio signals?  The promoter replied that
he would be using military technology that prevents jamming.

I'm sure the Pentagon will be delighted to hear that they no longer have to
worry about radio interference.

A small update on the death of the 13-year-old girl crushed in the
elevator a few days ago:

  It seems that the elevator the girl was killed in was the same one
that had been `repaired' only a few hours earlier. Also, a quote from
today's story (The Ottawa Citizen, Tuesday April 4, 1989, pg A1 + A2):
  "The elevator was open and she took one step inside. But she didn't
  take the other one because the door closed and went up." ' [Idil Adam]
(She was crushed against the upper door frame. I take it she must have been
caught by the inner doors and carried upwards. No mention has been made yet of
any possible reason the elevator was able to move with the doors open, or of
why the usual obstruction sensors didn't cause the door to open when they
started closing on her. Indeed, neither of these -questions- has been raised
yet in the paper.)

Here in our office building we have elevators with similar problems, though
possibly not as dangerous.  A lot of these problems seem to be due to bad
software.

The elevators are "Otis Elevonic 401" elevators.  They appear to be
microprocessor controlled; they have voice synthesizers that announce
the floors, and scrolling text displays that give advertisements about
the stores downstairs, the date and time of day, etc. 

They have a number of problems that I've seen thus far:

1) The sensors which are supposed to stop the door when they collide with a
person do not use mechanical switches; they seem to use electronic "body
capacitance" switches.  These switches are often out of adjustment.  On some of
the doors, the door will stop and reopen before it contacts you at all.  But on
several of the doors, the doors won't reverse unless you actually touch both
doors' switches at the same time with your hands.  Contact with a coat sleeve,
or hand contact with just one door, won't work.  Apparently the traditional
mechanical switches were replaced with electronic switches to reduce problems
of mechanical wear on the switches, without consideration that the new switches
are not as reliable in the field because of this adjustment problem.

2) There is an evident software bug in the elevators' exception handling.  If
the door is held open for longer than a certain amount of time, the elevator
enters an exception mode in which a buzzer begins sounding (the voice
synthesizer doesn't say anything during this time), and the elevator tries to
close the doors even if you are still holding them open.  Sometimes when it
enters this mode, the elevator badly malfunctions.  It will sometimes clear all
or some of the buttons that were pressed.  I've been on the elevator following
this exception handling when the elevator was supposed to be going down and
would instead go up to a floor for which no button was pressed, stop without
opening the doors, and then after a moment go down to the proper floor.  It
looks as if the programmer(s) didn't test this exception handling very well.

3) The timers for how long the door stays open, etc., seem to be implemented in
software, and use a mysterious algorithm for deciding how long to keep the
doors open that sometimes results in the doors closing before anyone can get on
the elevator.  You can never tell when the door is going to close.  Sometimes
it takes a long time for it to do so.

4) It is possible to confuse the elevator by pushing more than a certain number
of floor buttons at a given time.

5) The elevator has a feature whereby, if you accidentally get on the elevator
and intend to go up when it is going down (or if it changes direction due to a
timeout before you push the button), it won't let you push the button for the
floor you want to go to.  You can push the button, but it won't light up, and
the elevator ignores it.

6) The buttons are apparently polled periodically by the microprocessor.  When
you push the button, it lights up (apparently via a local switch) while you are
holding the button down; but if you release the button before the polling has
detected that you pressed it, the light goes off.  The initial lighting of the
button seems to have been a bad design decision, since it gives the user the
incorrect impression that the button pressing has succeeded.

7) The buttons inside the elevator are labeled with cryptic icons.  For example,
at the bottom of the button panel are some buttons labeled exactly like this:

	&lt;|&gt;       &gt;|&lt;

One of these closes the doors, the other opens the doors.  Some elevators have
a front door and a back door, and the buttons for those are labelled like this
instead:

	&lt;|&gt;       &lt;||&gt;       &gt;|&lt;        &gt;||&lt;

Many people seem to be confused by these icons, and when trying to stop the
door from closing for someone, will push the button that causes the door to
close instead.

These are only the more evident problems.  The elevators have other bugs, such
as a tendency to display "Japanese" characters instead of English on the
scrolling displays, to not detect the door position properly if someone stops
it (causing the elevator to sit until it goes into the exception mode), and
other anomalies.  It appears that a lot has been implemented in software that
was formerly done in hardware, and the software has not yet been well-debugged.

In late October 1988 the Naval Postgraduate School was ordered to switch its
payroll from the Civilan Pay Branch at the Naval Supply Center in Oakland to
the Navy Regional Finance Center in Washington DC.  Since then, there have been
hundreds of errors in paychecks reported to the comptroller's office at NPS.
The conversion was almost completely botched:

  - Even though the data was computerized both in Oakland and Washington,
    the switch was apparently done by manually keying in the data
    (this conclusion is based on the types of errors that were made)
  - There was apparently NO cross checking done between the original data
    from Oakland and the data as recorded in Washington
  - There were apparently NO sanity checks done on the data as recorded in
    Washington

In my case, they messed up my last name ("Shimeall" at Oakland became "Shimball"at Washington), changed my federal tax status and number of exemptions (from
Unmarried and 1 in Oakland to Single and 0 in Washington) and removed the
deduction for state taxes (required of all California workers).  My colleagues
have reported errors including failure to include deductions for health
insurance, multiplying payroll deductions (i.e., suddenly doubling the life
insurance deduction), greatly increased or decreased number of dependents, and
errors in amount of accumulated leave and sick days.  According to the
comptroller's office there have been about 5 edge-inches of reported errors in
payroll.

I'm not certain if this changeover from Oakland to Washington involved just NPS
or if it involved other facilities in Central and Northern California.  Do any
of the other RISKS readers have similar tales to tell?

In The New York Times, Monday, March 27 1989, page D15, Business section,
there was a 7 page, multicompany advertising block entitled
  Special Report: NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY and Applications ,
which included the following "article".  It was accompanied by, and was
undifferentiated from, several vanilla technical "articles".


Networking in the year 2000 A.D.

  In the year 2000 networked computing is not restricted by regulatory,
political, geographical, or psychological boundaries.  No longer is it of
any concern whether an MIS department can deliver a cost-effective, reliable,
and high-performance network.  [...]

[...perfectly networked world...]

  Security is not compromised in all this openness.  Imagine one small computer
virus roaming through this perfect network.  Imagine just one mischievous
hacker taking on your identity.  Imagine just one fanatical terrorist
manipulating the world's information sources.  Needless to say, "the network"
requires absolute integrity.  End-users are screened via eye, voice,
fingerprint, and brainwave patters.  In the year 2000, a worldwide common
access control scheme allows for easy yet authorized access by end-users to
both private and public sector information.  This is not to say that once you
are in, you are home free.  Not at all! Users, as they are born, educated,
employed, and retired, gain (and lose) access to information.  Provisioning of
network services is by valid want, verifiable need, absolute necessity,
specific job function, and paid subscription.

  There are no more privately operated and managed networks.  Any privatization
results in wasteful informational isolationism.  The original concept of ISDN
reaches its full technological glory and simply renders obsolete any other
networking approach.  Network processing grows to such gargantuan proportions
that the telecomm companies of the world develop into non-profit, publicly
funded United Nations' organizations that are chaged with the world's core
central information resource.

  Corporate data centers become purely business application resources in 2000.
[...] Direct memory and CPU access is available from within the corporation and
from without.  Technology is replaced long before it breaks, Murphy's Law is
amended.  [...] Programmers are a thing of the past. [...]

&gt;Some newspapers ... perform statistical tests and cross-database matching. ...

Newspapers have been doing this for ages, they've just had to do it by hand.
There are a handful of companies that sell all sorts of organized information
to newspapers/media outlets.

If they can be proved to have been grossly negligent they're in trouble as
well.  Also, a newspaper that builds up a record of attacking "poor, innocent
citizens" will be raked over the coals by the competition for attacking
"upstanding citizens and readers".

&gt;Finding and printing an interesting coincidence ...

This sort of thing has been used to crack major stories concerning:  real
estate dealers with racist selling practices, small town/county "accounting
errors" and a handful of other problems.  It's still very new to the newspaper
industry (many of whom think a MacIntosh should be easier to use :-).  Give it
a few years to wear off, and they'll use it as responsibly as any other
information gathering tool.

Check recent issues of Columbia Journalism Review, Editor and Publisher, et al.
for articles on "computerized data gathering".  There are people out there, in
the newspaper industry, who are concerned about privacy and access to
computerized information about individuals.

In the 6 Feb 1989 issue of Aviation Week:

  Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, commander of the service's Systems
  Command, bemoaned the state of military software as a "huge problem" that
  runs industry-wide.  "We have a perfect record on software schedules -- we
  have never made one on time yet and we are always making excuses", he said
  at an Air Force Assn. symposium.  The general also weighed in with criticism
  of electronic combat [radar, countermeasures, etc. --HS] programs, calling
  them a "disaster".  But he blamed government as well as the defense
  industry, saying Uncle Sam constantly changes requirements and budgets.

In thinking about the specific problem, originally discussed here under the
heading of "Faking Internet mail", of determining whether or not the From:
header line is valid, I came upon the following scheme which would authenticate
that a given message was sent by the specified (user,host), if you're prepared
to assume that the mail software at the actual host claimed in the message is
trustworthy, and if you assume no perversions of the network short of
line-tapping.

The following is from the point of view of host A, receiving mail:

1) A connection is opened, and a mail dialog is initiated by a remote
   host.

2) In order to maintain upwards-compatibility with the current mail system,
   the dialog may proceed the same way that it customarily does, at the
   conclusion of which host A executes step 6 below and exits thereafter.

3) If the remote system supports this authentication scheme, it will send
   a special code to initiate the following authentication sequence.

4) Host A assigns an identification number n (say, the value of the system
   clock) to the mail message being received, and tells the remote host
   to associate the number n with this message.

5) The remote host sends the message and completes the connection.

6) A passes the message on to the user it is destined for, say X,
   with a header line: "Message n, not yet authenticated."

7) A decodes the From: line and constructs a message to send to the
   host, say B, specified as the original sending host.  This will be
   a message containing special codes that talk directly to the mail
   servr on that machine.

8) A sends to B the message, which says: "I received a message, purportedly
   from user Y at your location, to which I assigned the identification
   number n.  Did you send it?"

8) B receives the message.  If it did send the message, it has kept a record
   in an authentication database cross-referencing &lt;message from user Y&gt;,
   &lt;sent to host A&gt;, and &lt;identification number n&gt;.  It sends a message in the
   affirmative, and deletes the authentication record.  If it did not send 
   the message, then it replies in the negative (unless it is a crooked system).

9) A receives the confirmation, which includes the identification number
   n, and the recipient X, and sends a message to user X saying, "message
   n authenticated".

I don't think that this scheme can be circumvented as easily as one can
currently fake a message on the Internet.  Handling messages forwarded
between machines (user%host%host%host...@host) is a detail I haven't
worked out, but should be possible as an extension of the above plan.
I know that much more secure schemes are possible, I was trying to think
of a least-effort approach which would provide a significant degree of
protection.

Newsgroups: news.admin,comp.org.ieee
Subject: Advertising vs the net

California Assembly Bill AB576 (not yet passed into law) states
that a person who uses a machine that electronically transmits
messages or facsimiles of documents through connection with a
telephone network to transmit unsolicited advertising material for
the sale of any realty, goods, or services is guilty of a misdemeanor.

The IEEE San Diego Section Bulletin (from which the above is
excerpted) states that the SD-IEEE propose supporting that Bill.

Apparently this is an attempt to control FAX junkmail.

I do not have the full text of the Bill, but it seems to me that there is
some possibility that it could affect the USENET (and other BBS-like)
transmission of many types of messages that are currently accepted by this
community.  There might also be significant first-amendment issues.

Possibly other states might follow California's lead on this; some
states have already enacted or considered FAX junkmail legislation.
It seems to me that such a law must be drafted carefully to avoid
fixing things that aren't broken.

It might well be worth your time to write for a copy of the Bill and comment
upon it to your legislators.  Remember that they don't read the net, so
blowing smoke here won't help.

In RISKS 8:48, Brian Randell reports an experiment in which a UK organization
tested the utility of putting the holder's picture on credit cards as a theft
deterrent.  The "holder's" picture was that of a gorilla, but there was no
problem using the card.

Is that *really* a valid test?  Considering the number of strange things you
can find on credit cards in the US (and probably other countries), and given
that the merchants who accept the credit cards aren't expecting to have 
pictures on them as anti-theft measures, I don't find any justification for
concluding that the test demonstrates a failure of the concept.

The use of the photo ID on a driver's license as a check for age for booze
purchases is well-established, and if the clerk is careful will filter out
some of the more obvious "borrowed" cards.  Nobody claims that it is perfect,
just that it helps reduce the use of other people's cards.

On the other hand, there is the famous (and possibly apocryphal) story of 
a WWII defence plant worker who demonstrated that the guards were
not checking the picture badges...she replaced her picture with one of 
Hitler and wasn't ever stopped.

Were photographs normally included on the credit cards used in this experiment?
If not, then the store clerk would be going "beyond the call of duty" in
checking the photograph.  The clerk could even think that a picture of a
gorilla is the issuing bank's logo.  And if photos were normally used, the
clerk might think that the person presenting the card is the gorilla's legal
guardian, since you'd hardly expect the gorilla itself to walk up to the
counter :-) The experiment might have been more valid if the cards had a
photograph of a *person* who looked markedly different from the bearer of the
card.

Since the cashiers probably weren't aware that the gorilla was intended to
be a form of identification, this result isn't surprising nor significant.
especially now that many credit cards come with meaningless holographic
images on them, like the bird-in-flight on the card i hold.

from Boston Globe, Apr 6, 1989, front page story:

   Use of autopilot tied to Alaskan oil spill

   A computer operated autopilot aboard the Exxon Valdez may have been
   set by Capt. Joseph Hazelwood for a course that headed his ship toward
   a reef, overriding commands by the third mate and leading to the
   nation's worse oil spill, according to an Alaskan newspaper.

   The report in today's Anchorage Times was based on comments by the
   Coast Guard's chief marine investigator, Mark DeLozier.
   According to the report, neither the third mate who was in charge on
   the bridge nor the helmsman who was steering the ship was aware that
   manual turns of the wheel had no effect on the rudder or the course
   of the ship because the automatic pilot had been set.

   If confirmed, the report would explain how the outbound tanker - even
   under the hands of an unlicensed mate - veered 1 1/2 miles across an
   inbound vessel traffic lane and tore open eight cargo tanks on Bligh
   Reef 25 miles outside the Valdez oil terminal."

[Remainder of article concerns the cleanup and captain's arraignment.]

	_Weather Agency Maps More Efficient Service_

	The National Weather Service will be a leaner and much more
	automated operation in the 1990s.  Under a modernization plan
	submitted to Congress, the National Association of Atmospheric
	Administration will establish a national network of 115
	forecasting offices equipped with high-technology sensing,
	processing, and communication system.  Currently, the service
	relies on nearly 300 local offices to collect and disseminate
	weather data.

	Improved satellites, a national network of sophisticated
	Doppler radars (which allow forecasters to see inside storms)
	and a 1000-unit Automated Surface Observation System that
	collects temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and other
	atmospheric data will enable the service to phase out 800
	jobs, reducing agency staff to some 3900.  The new
	technological systems should allow for "earlier detection and
	permit the short-range prediction of destructive, violent,
	local storms and floods, thereby mitigating a glaring
	shortfall in current warning services," according to the
	service's plan.

As a pilot, I've been following the NWS transition from human observers to ASOS
machines in the last year very carefully.  While these machines report
objective things (temperature, dewpoint, precip over last N hours) rather
accurately (barring mechanical breakdown, etc etc), they do very poorly at
cloud cover and current precipitation.  For cloud cover, an ASOS reports what
is *overhead* (possibly modified by some recent history information, I'm not
sure).  This is very different from what the human observers report, which is
generally a function of weather for about 5 miles around.  This means one
little stationary puffy at 1000 feet directly over the ASOS can be confused
with a 1000 foot overcast.... quite a different situation.  Humans can also
include "rain ended at 24 minutes past the hour" or "frontal passage [a wind
shift] at 18 minutes past the hour", which I believe the ASOS cannot do.  (This
is very useful to decide where the front will be farther downwind at a later
time.)  And how do you come up with a sensor that recognizes "blowing snow"
contrasted with "blowing dust" (quite a different thing :-)?

The talk in the aviation community been rather specific on the resulting
decrease in aviation safety because of the *reduced* information available to
pilots.  What gets me is that this article touts the *advantages* of
automation.  Notice the reduction in personnel: this will probably be all the
human observers replaced with ASOS machines.  The Doppler radars are mostly in
place; the new satellites would have been there anyway; so all we are really
doing is losing the "human touch".

On a local (for us Oregonians...) note: one of the human observations cut was a
mountain-top observation station in the Cascades near Eugene (or Medford... I
forget).  This cut made headlines because the local meterologists were apalled;
the station had been making continuous observations since the early part of
this century, and served as a baseline for very long range weather trend
information.  Although other stations in the area provide similar information
(which is reportedly why the station was cut), they have not been reporting for
nearly as long, thus destroying their long-term-trend usefulness.

There was a story a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal discussing
this new concept in horse racing. The horses are *not* mechanical. The
horses are of a smaller breed that was used to pull small carriages
around the turn of the century. The jockeys *are* mechanical. They
consist of a small piece of telerobotic hardware that can control
the speed and direction of the horse. This controll is achieved using
conventional reigns and a loudspeaker. These jockeys are controlled
remotely by a radio control similar to that used for R/C airplanes and such.

The main reason for using the hardware-based jockeys is weight.  Even the
lightest human (wetware-based :-) ) jockey would slow these minature horses
down to a very unexciting pace. The robot-jockeys weigh only 22 pounds and in
the illustration they looked like a small tin man with arms, a racing derby and
no legs. The original prototypes were developed for patrolling the perimeter of
a very large ranch. To protect the rancher from thieves, the ranch perimeter
was constantly patrolled by several men on horseback. In an effort to cut
costs, the inventors thought of mounting a TV camera on a horse with some
method of control, hence the robot-sentry/jockey was born.

The military anti-jamming technology mentioned involves the standard
practice of encoding the control signals on many frequencies simultaneously
(perhaps 10-100 different frequencies) to improve the odds of transmitting
a signal in the presence of a jamming signal and/or noise.

As far as RISKS go, it doesn't take a leap of the imagination to conceive of
this technology being used in battlefield environments. One of the most
difficult problems currently facing robotics researchers is navigation and
locomotion in unstructured environments. By coupling current robotic technology
to biologically-based locomotion systems, this problem may be overcome for the
time being. A variety of scenarios is possible for any animal that can be
trained to respond to the commands of some robot. Perhaps the day may come when
robots and animals will fight the actual battle while we humans sit back,
joystick and beer in hand, safely directing the battle while remotely viewing
the results on a CRT monitor (1/2 :-) ). Sounds like a new idea for a video
game.  (full :-) ).

With respect to the fly-by-wire issue, I think it's important to separate
two concepts:

   (1) Whether cables, hydraulic lines, or electrical signals, sensors,
computers, and actuators translate the pilot's actions to the control surfaces
(the A320 article stated "FBW replaces the conventional stick and rudder
controls with a series of computers and miles of electronic cables", as if
similar amounts of cables or the equivalent were not required to accomplish the
conventional method).
   (2) How much additional "intelligence" is placed between the pilot and the
control surfaces.

It may well make sense to replace mechanical cables by electrical or
fiber-optic ones, for reasons of reducing cost, weight, and complexity, or of
improving redundancy.  I am confident that a system whose only function was to
make this substitution could be made robust enough to equal or exceed the
reliability of existing systems, especially in damage situations.  For example,
one could arrange to use multiple battery-powered actuators, with a radio link
as a final backup even, to reduce the chances that an engine falling off would
disrupt the control signals, as it did in the Chicago DC-10 accident.  I
believe many of the space shuttle controls include this direct mapping as a
fallback.

Most of the FBW systems discussed in this forum apparently add significant
processing stages between pilot input and control output, sometimes of
necessity, since these aircraft are sometimes not inherently stable.
Ultimately, that seems like a good idea, too, but it's a lot more complicated,
since essentially it means that the computer is flying the plane.  Clearly this
approach deserves at least as much scrutiny as it is receiving, here and
elsewhere.

&gt;   [NGL:  It is interesting that the pilot was never believed about the
&gt;   altimeter although there is [now] plenty of evidence to back up his story.

There is also substantial evidence to discredit him: the voice transcripts
indicated a highly unprofessional preflight and takeoff.  Normal checklist
procedures were not used, and the atmosphere was too relaxed and casual.  The
French government leaked this data very early in the investigation, which
undoubtably influenced where the general direction of the investigation was to
go.  As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time in airliner
cockpits, I can say that the transcripts were quite horrifying in their lack of
professionalism.

On the specific issue of the altimeter making a difference, the airplane was
flying approximately 50 feet off the ground.  At that altitude, the pilots'
eyes should not be in the cockpit; the airplane's approximate altitude (or,
more importantly, its relation to the trees and ground) could have been 
established at a glance.  There's a simple rule of thumb in such cases: if 
an obstacle is above the horizon, you're going to run into it.  This alone 
seems to suggest poor judgement, perhaps accentuated by the informal 
atmosphere in the cockpit and the "weekend fair" mentality of the proceedings.

I don't think the Mulhouse-Habsheim crash can be used to condemn functional
aspects of the A320--at least, judging from the information I've seen on it.
The crash is much more vulnerable to questions regarding the human-factors
design of the A320 cockpit, and the validity work workload-saving automation
and display formats.  Considering how senior (each pilot had just over ten
thousand hours, and the captain, at the time, was the head of the A320 program
for Air France, with more time in type than anyone else) the crew was, one must
at least consider the possibility that the cockpit design may have encouraged
the atmosphere which led to the poor decisions which led to the crash.

In Nancy Leveson's Airbus commentary,

  "not plenty of evidence to back up his story"  should have been 
  "now plenty of evidence to back up his story".

[I corrected it in Robert Dorsett's quote of it, in the previous message.]

Boston's Logan Airport was fogged in on Tuesday evening, and Nancy took the
train back from Washington DC.  Evidently her train of thought was dominated by
her thought of train.

Having gone out and bought the book, I now have some additional details
about the 1983 incident in which an Air Canada Boeing 767 ran out of
fuel while on a flight from Ottawa to Edmonton.

The book is _Freefall_, by William Hoffer and Marilyn Mona Hoffer;
St. Martin's Press (New York), 1989; ISBN 0-312-02919-5; US$17.95.

To recap, the plane's electronic fuel sensor system failed.  The "fuel
quantity processor" on the Boeing 767 in question used two separate,
independent operating channels for redundancy.  If one channel failed,
the processor would ignore it and use the other.  In this case, however,
a cold solder joint in an inductor caused one channel to fail in an
unanticipated way:  instead of cutting off completely, this channel gen-
erated a reduced -- but nonzero -- signal.  The fuel quantity processor
was not designed to deal with such a situation, and so failed entirely.

The night before the fateful flight, a maintenance technician in Edmon-
ton, Alberta tried unsuccessfully to find this problem.  No replacement
fuel quantity processor was available, but he discovered that by turn-
ing off the circuit breaker for the faulty sensor channel, he could get
the fuel gauges to work.  He marked the breaker with yellow maintenance
tape and made a note in the plane's log book.  However, his log notes
seemed to make no sense and were misunderstood by the maintenance crew
at Dorval Airport in Montreal; a technician there reset the breaker
despite the tape over it, without noticing that he had thereby disabled
the fuel gauges again.

Since the plane had left Edmonton the previous night with only one fuel
sensor operational, the manual required a "drip" test with mechanical
dipstick-like devices to double-check the fuel (kerosene) level.  The
fuel truck's gauges measured fuel *volume* (in litres) -- but this had
to be translated into fuel *mass* as part of the "drip" test.  The
mechanics knew how much fuel the plane needed, in kilograms; but when
they went to figure out how much fuel (in litres) to pump into the
tanks, they mistakenly tried to convert from *pounds* to litres.  This
error was made all the easier by the fact that the conversion factor was
labelled in the mechanics' reference books as "specific gravity"; the
fact that the number also embodied a volume-mass conversion was com-
pletely glossed over.  As I mentioned in my earlier message, the Boeing
767 in question was one of the first "metricized" airplanes in the Air
Canada fleet; other planes still measured fuel in pounds, not kilos.

After the plane was refuelled, the pilot noticed that the fuel gauges
were now blank.  On this basis, he asserted to the maintenance people
that the plane was not legal to fly according to the manuals.  However,
the mechanics insisted that Maintenance Control had cleared the plane
and that it was OK to fly.  In such a situation, the pilot could theo-
retically have stuck to his guns and refused to allow the plane to go
-- but it was well known that "an overly cautious pilot who grounds too
many flights for what others perceive as trivial reasons is likely to
find himself grounded."  Further, the written guidelines or "Minimum
Equipment List" for the 767 had already been revised agains and again
-- and, in fact, there were three versions of the MEL book at this time
(one for pilots, one for mechanics, and one for airport Maintenance
Control).  So, given that Maintenance Control had cleared the plane for
takeoff on the basis of the fuel "drip" test, the pilot would have put
himself in a potentially indefensible situation by challenging their
decision on the basis of *his* copy of the MEL regulations.

The above details can be found in Chapter 13 of the book, starting on page 89.

So, to summarize, the mishap resulted in part from:

(1) Inadequate design of the redundancy systems in the fuel quantity
    processor; it failed entirely in the face of an unanticipated
    *partial* failure of one of the two sensors.

(2) Miscommunication between mechanics at airports in Edmonton and
    Montreal, resulting in the first mechanic's fortuitous "kludge" fix
    to the problem being unknowingly undone by the second mechanic.

(3) Metric conversion woes in conjunction with the refuelling of the
    plane -- compounded by the fact that a key mathematical factor in
    the calculation was labelled in such a way as to conceal its true
    role as a unit conversion factor between mass and volume.

(4) Ambiguous rules for minimum equipment and line of responsibility in
    determining whether the airplane was flight-worthy.

I recently had a "normal" bad experience with an ATM:  (bank name withheld
to protect the guilty - but it's a HUGE bank in Massachusetts). The machine
gave me half the money I asked for, but the receipt read that it had given
me the full amount. Of course, I immediately called the "help" line (which
should perhaps be called the "I can't help" line), and reported the
incident. I requested that they shut down the machine until they could audit
it.  To my surprise, they responded that, according to their carefully
thought out policy, they could not shut down the machine on the basis of a
single customer complaint.

Note, however, that if the MACHINE detects an operational irregularity, it
shuts ITSELF down immediately, often without returning your card. I find it
not only odd, but downright &gt;risky&lt; that the complaint from a customer is
given less weight than the machine's "perception" of a possible problem.  On
the one hand, some software or hardware system has determined that there MAY
be a problem - and this is acted on at once.  On the other hand, I report an
ACTUAL problem - and I find myself being ignored. This says volumes about
the propensity to believe the computer at all costs: the customer "couldn't
be right - the computer says so."

	You're quite right, Brian. BMW seem to specialise in providing
	RISKy technology. A few years back I bought a BMW316i on the
	basis of an ad in the Guardian describing its ionically-bound
	detergent-containing paint. You remember that it claimed to be
	self-washing. Well, imagine my surprise when returning to my
	new car after a particularly heavy thunderstorm I found that
	*all the paint* had washed off! 

	This is not to mention the self-inflating tyres that blew themselves
	up so much that the car lost half a ton in weight, requiring
	me to spend 300 pounds (BMW prices!) on a larger spoiler just
	to keep the car on the road.

	I note that the previous representative, Herr Uve Behnaad, has
	been replaced by a new man, Mr Phelfrett. It seems, however,
	that BMW policy has *not* changed and that the motoring public
	continues to be put at RISK by poorly-tested new technology.

		BMW INTRODUCES ITS NEWEST INNOVATION:
			   ROAD WARMERS

Having spent the last twenty years perfecting the sports sedan, BMW has now
taken up the ultimate challenge - perfecting the road.
Road Warmers are the result of twenty years of German engineering.  And
represent perhaps the single most important contribution to the automotive
industry in the past decade.

Road Warmers employ laser technology to ensure constant road conditions.  The
way in which they operate is simple.  Underneath the car, four pivoting convex
lasers are mounted in front of each wheel.  The lasers are aimed at the
pavement directly in front of the tread stance.  They work in tandem with
five-speed turbo fans.  So not only do they manage to melt snow and ice, they
also dry the road of excess moisture.  And virtually eliminate the need to
clear your driveway during winter.  Inside the car, the driver is continually
apprised of the climatic conditions through BMW's onboard computer and Active
Check Control.  This enables the driver to set the road to a temperature that
best suits their level of performance.  The result is a road that never
changes.  Four seasons become one.  And performace is assured like never
before.  Eventually Road Warmers will be standard on all new BMW's.  But as
part of a special offer, your dealer will install them on your present car free
of charge.

&gt; [notes on autopilot connection to tanker spill.....]

Another newsgroup has an article today in which the author claims to have
seen the following Valdez-related tale:  The installation of Coast Guard
radar equipment which could have been sophisticated enough to track the
errant vessel before it was too late had been deferred in order to provide
more budget money for our ersatz war on drugs.  Risks Digest is not the
place for major social discussion on this subject, but I do find it
interesting that the ebb and flow of socially-oriented politics may have
ultimately had an impact on the ability of accident prevention systems to
function at maximum effectiveness...

[Heated discussion on budget priorities, social effects, and morality
should probably be directed to misc.headlines, alt.drugs, alt.flame,
or some other social newsgroup.......:-)]

Forget computer risks - it should be clear by now that Phobos is inhabited and
that they are willing and able to neutralize large threatening objects that are
aimed at them.  Just wait till they send something in return - that's when

There have been many messages in RISKS about people believing computers
before people. They generally end with something like the following (taken
from a recent message):

&gt; This says volumes about
&gt; the propensity to believe the computer at all costs: the customer "couldn't
&gt; be right - the computer says so."

One thing to bear in mind is that the computer can be mistaken, but it
can't be malicious. The computer program won't deliberately try to defraud
a (bank/travel agency/government department/whatever). I would certainly
hope that the bank would believe the computer over a customer with no
documentation, at least until they can perform an audit.

On the other hand, of course, if you CAN document your case and they still
stand by the computer... that's a whole different kettle of fiche.

I don't think there's been any more in Risks about Toronto's first foray into
machine-counted votes.  To recap the earlier items: many ballots were silently
rejected by the (optical-recognition) machines because they were not cut
accurately, and a demand for a manual recount was blocked because the election
law required any recount to use the same methods as the original count.

The courts must have given this some precedence, because we have already had an
appellate court ruling.  The ruling was that it was not reasonable to enforce
that provision of the law when the method itself was clearly defective.
Consequently, manual recounts were held where necessary, and in one district
the result actually did change.

In RISKS 8.50, Brian Kanto (via Skip Montanaro) writes about California's
attempt to make sending junk mail by facsimile illegal.  I wonder how legal
this is.  Suppose someone here in Washington sends a junk fax to someone else
in California (I know, I'm assuming negligible costs for the phone call).  How
does California expect to prosecute someone in the District of Columbia for
violating a California law while the person is in the District of Columbia?

If the law says that "a person WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
who uses..." it should be alright, but otherwise, there are some serious
questions about infringement of interstate commerce (which is properly under
the jurisdiction of the Federal Government) that need to be addressed.

Of course, this whole message begs the question "How is this a risk to society?"

This week's issue of Computerworld contains an article on page 10 that
may be of interest to RISKS readers.  The article is titled "Humane
Society collars a chip off the old hound dog."  Beginning the first
week in May, the Marin (CA) County Humane Society will begin injecting
microchips the size of a grain of rice into animals up for adoption.
The chip can be activated by waving a scanner over the animal's back
and it results in a unique 10-digit number being displayed.  The number
is used to query a database that contains the owner's name.  The purpose
of the system is returning lost pets to their owners.

These implants have been available for a fee in clinics throughout
Canada since last July.  They have been used by some shelters and
veterinarians on an optional basis in the U.S. since the last quarter
of 1988.

The vendor of this system is International Infopet System of Agoura
Hills, CA.

The relevance for RISKS?  What if someone wants to use this technology
as the basis for a national identity card for people.

FORWARDING OF A MESSAGE FROM JOHN LUCE:

I was a Software Engineer on the Elevonic 401 project (but not on the
cab software that controls the features discussed).

Item 1: The sensors that are malfunctioning on the doors were viewed as
unsafe by the engineers involved. However, mgt. felt the risk was small
compared to the COST savings obtained by using them. 1 problem was that they
needed adjustment often, but not replacement, while the older versions
had to be replaced more often but were vastly more reliable while in service.

Item 2: The doors are forced close to prevent the tie-up of the elevator.
Poor maintenance will cause the door bumpers to not retract the door. This
is an easy upkeep and will fail only if the building has decided against
a periodic maintenance plan and just calls when something breaks down.
The holding open of the doors causes the car to go into 'Delayed Car' mode
which takes the car out of service. When the doors are finally allowed to
close, the car has to intialize itself. If it is in the lower half of the
building, it will run up to initialize, and run down if in the upper half
regardless of buttons pushed.

Item 3: The length of door open time is decided by the building owner and
is put in to a Contract Table. The only thing for sure is that a door that
opens answering a Hall Call will stay open longer than a door that opens
for a Car Button.

Item 4: The number of floor buttons pushed doesn't cause the confusion of
the elevator, it's the number of buttons tempered by the weight inside
the car. If the weight sensors do not show enough weight (arbitrary, but
effective) for the number of buttons pushed, it cancels the buttons. To
understand the implementation, the name of the module that does that is
called 'KIDS'. It prevents the floor to floor runs kids like to have occur
by pushing buttons and getting out of the car before the doors close.

Item 5: Design intent. If someone can't read the arrow to know which way
the car is running, he shouldn't be allowed to put in a car call away from
the direction it's moving.

Item 6: Unless this is OLD software, i.e. the building has not upgraded
it, this is impossible to do. The scan and latch of buttons was placed
in a 96 millisecond task.

Item 7: All the engineers agree with you on this, but since Otis sells
to many foreign countries (including the oriental ones), this was the
only recourse left open. I'm sure better icons could have been devised.

Finally, displays and voice are customer designated and maintained by
the customer. If he fails to read the manual, these items will appear
to malfunction.

I hope this clears it up. I firmly believe, even though I no longer work
there, that Otis Elevator North America R&amp;D had the best set of s/w
people I've seen overall.

Any opinions expressed above are my own and not to be attributed to
my present or previous employer.

NEED DRAMS?  HERE'S ONE WAY TO GET THEM

If the shortage of dynamic random-access memories is abating, a band of armed
robbers in California's Orange County hasn't heard about it.  Over the past six
months, at least five companies have been hit in late-night robberies, with the
memory chips as the main target.  The biggest haul was at Western Digital Corp.
in Irvine, where two bandits forced an unarmed security guard to open a storage
area and took some $100,000 worth of DRAMs, according to authorities.  The
armed robberies are a new development in the DRAM shortage, they say, with
previous thefts largely being inside jobs.

From the 4/7/89 Boston Globe:

"Some Bostonians are having the time of their lives eavesdropping onNynex Mobile
Communications cellular phones. With the help of their trusty Radio Shack
Portavision 55s, designed to pick up the audio portion of UHF television
signals, these naughty people claim to have heard Secretary of Finance and
Administration Edward Lashman discussing a press conference with his wife and
Boston Mayor Ray Flynn checking in with his office. "It makes for a great day,"
says one listener who calls in sick at his job to spend the day with his ear
pressed against the radio. "At 7 a.m. you hear the construction people
complaining that their suppliers delivered the wrong stuff. At 9, it's the
lawyers telling their clients how to lie in court. After noon the risque stuff
starts..."

The article goes on to say that Radio Shack no longer sells that model, and
that the FCC says such eavesdropping is illegal.

CDC has a (relatively) new operating system for its Cybers, called NOS/VE (it
has been around for a few years).  While browsing through the tutorial manual,
I came upon the section on batch jobs.  It contains the following paragraphs:

  To submit a batch job from your terminal, you first create a file that
  contains the job and then specify the name of the file in the SUBMIT_JOB
  command.

  The first line of the file must contain the LOGIN command.  This command
  specifies the user name, password and family name to be used for the job,
  as in the following example:

      login login_user=pat password=secret login_family=nve

So the user name and password will be sitting there together in a disk file, in
plain text.  I don't think I need to elaborate on the RISKs of this.

Note that the keeping of user name and password is not necessary, as the
file is submitted from a terminal, where the user is already logged in.

CDC apparently noticed this at some point, and in a footnote they state:
"If, for security reasons, you do not want to include your password in a
file, you can use [some other command]."  Nevertheless, this is just a
footnote, and the first thing the users are taught about batch jobs is
to put their user name and password in a file!

Subject:      Cornell Chronicle coverage of Morris

The Cornell Chronicle is the Administration's propaganda organ.  As such, their
coverage of the [Robert] Morris report is relatively one-sided, but since they
got the report in advance, they summarized it.  I'll put the last paragraph
right here:  Copies of the report are available from the Office of the Vice
President for Information Technologies, 308 Day Hall, [area code 607] 255-3324.

CORNELL PANEL CONCLUDES MORRIS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPUTER WORM
(By Dennis Meredith, Cornell Chronicle, 4/6/89)

  Graduate student Robert Tappan Morris Jr., working alone, created and spread
the "worm" computer program that infected computers nationwide last November,
concluded an internal investigative commission appointed by Provost Robert
Barker.
  The commission said the program was not technically a "virus"--a program that
inserts itself into a host program to propagate--as it has been referred to in
popular reports.  The commission described the program as a "worm," an
independent program that propagates itself throughout a computer system.
  In its report, "The Computer Worm," the commission termed Morris's behavior
"a juvenile act that ignored the clear potential consequences."  This failure
constituted "reckless disregard of those probable consequences," the commission
stated.
  Barker, who had delayed release of the report for six weeks at the request of
both federal prosecutors and Morris's defense attorney, said, "We feel an
overriding obligation to our colleagues and to the public to reveal what we
know about this profoundly distrubing incident."
  The commission had sought to determine the involvement of Morris or
other members of the Cornell community in the worm attack.  It also studied
the motivation and ethical issues underlying the release of the worm.
  Evidence was gathered by interviewing Cornell faculty, staff, and
graduate students and staff and former students at Harvard University, where
Morris had done undergraduate work.
  Morris declined to be interviewed on advice of counsel.  Morris had requested
and has received a leave of absence from Cornell, and the university is
prohibited by federal law from commenting further on his status as a student.
  The commission also was unable to reach Paul Graham, a Harvard graduate
student who knew Morris well.  Morris repotedly contacted Graham on Nov. 2.,
the day the worm was released, and several times before and after that.
  Relying on files from Morris's computer account, Cornell Computer Science
Department documents, telephone records, media reports, and technical reports
from other universities, the commission found that:
  - Morris violated the Computer Sciences Department's expressed policies
against computer abuse.  Although he apparently chose not to attend
orientation meetings at which the policies were explained, Morris had been
given a copy of them.  Also, Cornell's policies are similar to those at
Harvard, with which he should have been familiar.
  - No member of the Cornell community knew Morris was working on the worm.
Although he had discussed computer security with fellow graduate students, he
did not confide his plans to them.  Cornell first became aware of Morris's
involvement through a telephone call from the Washington Post to the science
editor at Cornell's News Service.
  - Morris made only minimal efforts to halt the worm once it had propagated,
and did not inform any person in a position of responsibility about the
existence or content of the worm.
  - Morris probably did not indent for the worm to destroy data or files, but
he probably did intend for it to spread widely.  There is no evidence that he
intended for the worm to replicate uncontrollably.
  - Media reports that 6,000 computers had been infected were based on an
initial rough estimate that could not be confirmed.  "The total number of
affected computers was surely in the thousands," the commission concluded.
  - A computer security industry association's estimate that the worm
caused about $96 million in damage is "grossly exaggerated" and "self-serving."
  - Although it was technically sophisticated, "the worm could have been
created by many students, graduate or undergraduate ... particularly if
forearmed with knowledge of the security flaws exploited or of similar flaws."
  The commission was led by Cornell's vice president for information
technologies, M. Stuart Lynn.  Other members were law professor Theodore
Eisenberg, computer science Professor David Gries, engineering and computer
science Professor Juris Hartmanis, physics professor Donald Holcomb, and
Associate University Counsel Thomas Santoro.
  Release of the worm was not "an heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses
of operating systems," the report said.  "The fact that UNIX ... has many
security flaws has been generally well known, as indeed are the potential
dangers of viruses and worms."
 The worm attacked only computers that were attatched to Internet, a national
research computer network and that used certain versions of the UNIX operating
system.  An operating system is the basic program that controls the operation
of a computer.
  "It is no act of genius or heroism to exploit such weaknesses," the
commission said.
  The commission also did not accept arguments that one intended benefit of the
worm was a heightened public awareness of computer security.
  "This was an accidental byproduct of the evant and the resulting display
of media interest," the report asserted.  "Society does not condone
burglary on the grounds that it heightens concern about safety and security."
  In characterizing the action, the commission said, "It may simply have been
the unfocused intellectual meanderings of a hacker completely absorbed with his
creation and unharnessed by considerations of explicit purpose or potential
effect."
  Because the commission was unable to contact Graham, it could not determine
whether Graham discussed the worm with Morris when Morris visited Harvard about
two weeks before the worm was launched.  "It would be interesting to know, for
example, to what Graham was referring to in an Oct. 26 electronic mail message
to Morris when he inquired as to whether there was 'Any news on the brilliant
progject?'" said the report.
  Many in the computer science community seem to favor disciplinary
measures for Morris, the commission reported.
  "However, the general sentiment also seems to be prevalent that such
disciplinary measures should allow for redemption and as such not be so harsh
as to permanently damage the perpetrator's career," the report said.
  The commission emphasized, that this conclusion was only an impression from
its investigations and not the result of a systematic poll of computer
scientists.
  "Although the act was reckless and impetuous, it appears to have been an
uncharacteristic act for Morris" because of his past efforts at Harvard and
elsewhere to improve computer security, the commission report said.
  Of the need for increased security on research computers, the commission
wrote, "A community of scholars should not have to build walls as high as the
sky to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly when
such walls will equally impede the free flow of information."
  The trust between scholars has yielded benefits to computer science
and to the world at large, the commission report pointed out.
  "Violations of that trust cannot be condoned.  Even if there are unintended
side benefits, which is arguable, there is a greater loss to the community
as a whole."
  The commission did not suggest any specific changes in the policies of
the Cornell Department of Computer Science and noted that policies against
computer abuse are in place for centralized computer facilities.  However,
the commission urged the appointment of a committee to develop a university-
wide policy on computer abuse that would recognize the pervasive use of
computers distributed throughout the campus.
  The commission also noted the "ambivalent attitude towards reporting
UNIX security flaws" among universities and commercial vendors.  While
some computer users advocate reporting flaws, others worry that such
information might highlight the vulernatiblity of the system.
  "Morris explored UNIX security amid this atmosphere of uncertainty, where
there were no clear ground rules and where his peers and mentors gave no clear
guidance," the report said.
  "It is hard to fault him for not reporting flaws that he discovered.  From
his viewpoint, that may have been the most responsible course of action,
and one that was supported by his colleagues."
  The commission report also included a brief account of the worm's course
through Internet.  After its release shortly after 7:26 p.m. on Nov 2, the worm
spread to computers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Rand
Corporation, the University of California at Berkeley and others, the
commission report said.
  The worm consisted of two parts--a short "probe" and a much larger "corpus."
The problem would attempt to penetrate a computer, and if successful, send for
the corpus.
  The program had four main methods of attack and several methods of defense to
avoid discovery and elimination.  The attack methods exploited various flaws
and features int he UNIX operating systems of the target computers.  The worm
also attempted entry by "guessing" at passwords by such techniques as
exploiting computer users' predilections for using common words as passwords.
  The study's authors acknowledged computer scientists at the University
of California at Berkeley for providing a "decompiled" version of the worm
and other technical information.  The Cornell commission also drew on
analyses of the worm by Eugene H. Spafford of Purdue University and
Donn Seeley of the University of Utah.

The following article on product recalls appeared in this morning's paper.  Of
the five items mentioned in the article, three of them cite `software error' as
the reason for the recall.  All three cases involve medical products.
                               						B.J.

    PRODUCT RECALLS
    by Mylene Moreno, States News Service 
    [from The Boston Globe, Monday 10 April 1989, page 14]

   WASHINGTON - The federal government announced the following product recalls
last week.  Unless otherwise noted, the recalls were voluntarily initiated by
product manufacturers, importers, distributors or retailers.  The list includes
products distributed in New England and nationwide.

        Food and Drug Administration

           o  Nellcor Inc. of Hayward, Calif., recalled 164 N-1000
        Multi-function Monitors containing Display Software Version
        1.0.7, serial numbers [...] produced [...].  The product is
        intended for use as an adjunct monitor of blood oxygen
        saturation, airway carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide gas levels
        by trained medical physicians.  Due to software error, the
        monitor innacurately reports the partial pressures of nitrous
        oxide and carbon dioxide at altitudes of 2,000 feet or higher. 
        Approximately 51 units, which were distributed nationwide and in
        Canada, remain to be corrected.

           o  Hewlett-Packard Co., Andover Division of Andover, Mass.,
        recalled 428 Hewlett-Packard brand Sonos 100 Ultrasound Imaging
        Systems, models 77000A and 77010A, serial numbers [...], a
        scanner for qualitative and quantitative echocardiography and
        echoradiology applications.  The blood velocity may be
        incorrectly calibrated due to a software defect resulting in
        erroneous reading under certain conditions.  Product was
        distributed nationwide and internationally.

           o  Hewlett-Packard Co., Andover Division of Andover, Mass.,
        recalled its series 77020 Ultrasound Systems and Upgrade Kit
        Software Part No. 77120-10051, an ultrasound scanner designed
        for radiology applications.  Product may product incorrect strip
        chart recordings due to software error.  1,428 units were
        distributed nationwide and internationally.

           o  Norfolk Scientific, doing business as Statspin
        Technologies of Norwood, Mass., recalled 539 boxes of Statspin
        Disposable Roto-Products, product number RD01, lot numbers
        [...].  The product , distributed nationwide, is used for plasma
        separation.  Poor welds may cause the blood to leak at the seam
        at the lower or upper part of the rotor.

        Consumer Safety Commission

           o  The Vendo Company of Fresno, Calif., launched a voluntary
        retrofit program for 115,000 Vendo soft drink machines that are
        at least 38.5 inches wide.  Vendo will install anti-theft
        devices in the machines to dissuade individuals from dangerously
        rocking or tipping the machines to obtain free products.  In
        recent years, rocking and tipping has resulted in an increasing
        number of deaths and serious injuries.  The public is encouraged
        to call Vendo at 1-209-439-1770 for more information.

The recent comments on use of dipsticks to measure aircraft fuel level
when some number of electric gauges are malfunctioning prompts me to
point out that use of electric gauges itself is actually one of the
older examples of fly-by-wire introductions.  No old-time pilot would
consider taking off unless:

     1.  He or she had personally dipped a thumb in both wing tank
     filler holes and verified that the tanks were topped off,
 and
     2.  The sight gauges (glass tubes on either side of the cockpit in
     a high-wing plane) were filled with something that looked like
     fresh gasoline.

It took a long time for people to accept electric fuel gauges; they somehow
just didn't give one the same level of confidence.

From an article on an airline accident in Flying, March 1989, p. 27:

   Should an airplane or an engine be designed so that
   forgetting a single item could lead to a spurious but
   convincing appearance of a life-threatening
   malfunction---not immediately, but once the airplane is
   airborne and the omission has faded from memory?

   Computer programmers face this kind of question constantly;
   they never know what the novice user will come up with, and
   so they design their programs to survive any kind of abuse.

&gt;(4) Ambiguous rules for minimum equipment and line of responsibility in
&gt;    determining whether the airplane was flight-worthy.

Ambiguous rules, yes; ambiguous responsibility, no.  Aviation regulations
and laws are *extremely* clear on this:  ultimate authority and
responsibility rest with the pilot, and nobody else.  Even air-traffic
control is advisory only:  the pilot is the judge of whether their
advice is safe and should be followed, and if he does something clearly
stupid because they told him to, it is legally *his* fault.  The line of
responsibility for determining flightworthiness may be confused in the
middle, but the pilot is most definitely at the top.  Aviation is one
of the few fields where things are this clear-cut.

This is not to deny that pilots often are under a lot of pressure to get
the plane to its destination on time, or that a cautious pilot may find
himself in trouble with management.  Or that a pilot with years of boring
airliner flying behind him will tend to unconsciously assume that safety
is inherent in the system, making him more willing to take chances when
the heat is on.

The other day I accidentally discovered how to disrupt operations on one
of our multiuser BSD UNIX hosts from an MS/DOS PC with PC/NFS.  The PC was
having a boot time problem where the message "use NET START RDR hostname"
was being displayed.

I misunderstood the message, thinking that command was used to assign the
host that performs authentication, and issued it substituting in the
hostname of our Sequent Symmetry host.  A few moments later people
starting complaining that the Symmetry was down.

Actually, the "NET START RDR" command identifies the hostname of the PC,
which it looks up in its HOSTS file to determine its IP network address.
A message on the Symmetry's console explained why it was unavailable,
b"Duplicate IP address on the network".

The risks should be obvious.  System Managers should not be allowed to
touch PCs without re-reading the manuals first.  :-}

I didn't think I would run across something to surpass the BMW weight-dependent
anti-theft system so soon, but today I received the Buick _Dimension_ promo
disk.  For those who aren't familiar with it, the Macintosh version runs a 
Hypercard-like slide-show (with music, sound, and animation) detailing the
Buick product line.  This year's disk mentions a new feature (with animated 
demonstrations): a "remote access" system on the Riviera and Riatta, two 
sports cars.  Here's what they have to say:

  "Remote Keyless Entry is designed to unlock and lock your car's doors and
  unlock the deck lid from up to a 30 foot radius.  On some Buick models, you
  also control the interior lighting.  On those with factory equipped theft
  deterrent systems, locking and unlocking automatically arms and disarms the
  deterrent system.

  "One of billions of unique codes are programmed into the systems Erasable
  Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM).  Using 4 or 8-bit microprocessors,
  the system reacts to an operational code such as "unlock the doors," only
  after receiving a valid identification code.

  "The benefits of this system are fully realized only after using it.  How
  about identifying your car from others at night in a crowded parking lot by
  pressing a button, or being able to open the deck lid when approaching your
  car with your arms full of packages?

  "The Keyless Entry System is standard on the Reatta, and is available as an
  additional feature on the Riviera and Electra/Park Avenue models."

     [The problem with the KES is that this one is real -- in contradistinction
     to the BMW promos.  The vulnerabilities are obviously considerable.  PGN]

The Friday, April 7th Boston Globe ran a front-page story about an MIT
graduate student whose car was marked as abandoned, towed, and compacted into
a neat cube of steel in the space of four hours. It turns out the student
was in my wife's department, and I have managed to confirm these facts:

Omitting the fact that the Massachusetts law allowed the car to be marked
as abandoned based on the word of a neighbor, the Boston city police
department and the Bureau of Motor Vehicle registration seem to be subjecting
the driving public to the risk of parking your car, or at least parking
a car from a foreign country. The student in question had previouslyst
registered the car in Massachusetts, and had then returned home to Nova
Scotia and had the car registered there. When he returned to Massachusetts,
in accordance with state law, he maintained the Canadian registration.

The towing authorities checked his Massachusetts registration information
and found that the registration had expired a few years ago, which convinced
them it was abandoned. The Globe article indicates they didn't bother
checking the Nova Scotia registration (valid) because they would be
forced to use the Interpol network, which is reserved for felonies.

The car was worth $2500, pre-compaction. I wonder if $2500 vandalism
constitutes a felony offense?

The city of Boston is now attempting to recover towing fees, a $250
fine for abandoing the car, and a $110 fee for compacting the car.
The student, Michael Picard, is suing the city.

The police seem to have relied quite heavily on a negative result from
their computerized database -- an expired registration here, that means
no valid registration anywhere, right? And they assumed that since the
registration had expired, there was no point in using their address
information to try to contact Picard.

Admitted that this might have happened to a double-parked chariot in
Mesopotamia, but computers seem to have allowed the authorities to
act thoughtlessly and destructively with impressive speed.

&gt; "The elevator was open and she took one step inside. But she didn't
&gt; take the other one because the door closed and went up." ' [Idil Adam]

This is really bad news, since it suggests something worse than just a
malfunction.  In the old mechanical elevators I've looked at closely, the latch
that locked the outside door had a switch built into it.  The latch consisted
of a hook on the door that hooked into a hole in a metal box attached to the
door frame.  One surface of this hook was laminated with an insulating material
covered with a plate of metal.  (Thus, the plate was insulated from the hook
and everything around it.) When the hook latched the door into a closed
position, this metal plate would bridge two metal contacts inside the box the
hook latched into, closing a circuit that allowed the elevator to move.

This was a clever design for several reasons.  First, it wasn't possible for
the switch to jam closed due to dirt, etc., since the bridging contact was
pulled several feet away from the switch terminals by the door opening.  It
could get shorted by a piece of metal falling across the contacts, but they
were about an inch apart, and inside the metal box.  Second, if you manually
reached inside the box, you would get an electric shock, which tended to
discourage tampering (as well as discouraging people who were curious how the
switch was constructed :-)).  It appeared, if the designers had done this
intentionally, that they had decided that the risk of the deterrent electric
shock was much less than the risk of the elevator moving with the doors open.

If this elevator had the same type of switch, it sounds as if maybe someone had
bypassed the safety mechanism during one of the past repairs.  Elevators are
extremely powerful (the motors that move them are enormous, even for small
elevators), and it appears that a lot of thought goes into the safety
mechanisms used in them.

Someone who used to work for Otis (I trashed my mbox and lost the name) just
sent a very informative note in to RISKS regarding the design of Otis
elevators.  One point made in the letter is in error, in my opinion, and shows
a common mistake of people assessing new technology.  The author noted that the
elevator buttons are polled in a 96 millisecond loop, and hence it is not
possible for someone to push a button without the elevator noticing.  The
impression is that 96 milliseconds is very fast, because it is measured in
milliseconds.  If you restate the sentence as "the elevator only polls the
buttons every 1/10th of a second," then the impression is that the exact same
amount of time is very slow, because now it is measured in seconds.

	When dealing with human major muscle motions (like moving your arms or
walking), it is typical to see components of the motion happening at 50Hz.
This suggests (but does not prove) that 10/second isn't fast enough to assure
that the button press gets sensed.  Better numbers come from a stopwatch -- I
can start and stop a stopwatch in about 0.04 seconds (mine has separate start
and stop buttons. With a one-button stopwatch, the time is generally just under
0.2 sec). My depressing two buttons independently in 0.04 seconds does not
necessarily mean that I can depress and release one in 0.02 seconds (=20
milliseconds = 1/50th second), but it does mean that 1) 50Hz is a reasonable
bandwidth for my fingers and 2) I can certainly depress and release a button in
well under 1/10th of a second.  The 0.2 second time for two presses of the same
button with the same finger also indicates that 10/second isn't fast enough,
since a simple division by two indicates that something is happening at 10Hz,
and that 10Hz number ignores all the time I spend accelerating and decelerating
my finger in between button presses.  Finally, when I rode the elevator to my
office this morning, I was able to press and light the button five times in a
row without the button polling electronics noticing the action, indicating that
in at least one elevator the polling loop is too slow.

Don't make performance decisions based on units.  Make performance decisions
based on performance.

In an article on the fire about a Soviet submarine, the AP reports that five
months ago, a reactor aboard an icebreaker in Murmansk almost melted down when
a worker drained cooling water from an operating reactor instead of one that
was shut down for repairs.  They attribute that story to the newspaper Vodny
Transport.

[...] I came upon the following scheme which would authenticate &gt; that
a given message was sent by the specified (user,host)

[Peter describes a scheme where basically a receiving host delivers a given
message to the destination user, then asks the sending host whether or not the
message originated there.  If so, another copy of the message is delivered to
the destination user, with a header line stating that this copy is
authenticated.]

This seems like a good idea, except from the point of view of the user
who receives such mail.  Assuming that this becomes the standard way
of transmitting mail, a user ends up receiving two copies of every
message -- one unauthenticated, and one authenticated.  (Except for
the folks who always get fake mail. :-)

I think a better way would be to have the mail sent as usual from the
sending host to the receiving host, but with an option to authenticate
immediately. This would be done by having the sending host look at the
received message, parse out the supposed sending host and user (from
the "From:" line), open a connection to an "authentication daemon" on
that host, and ask "did user &lt;x&gt; send message-ID &lt;y&gt;?"

If the sending host did not support authentication, the connection
would fail, and the receiving host would add a header to the message
stating that the message was possibly fake.

If the connection was successful, but the authentication failed (i.e.,
the receiving host didn't have the message ID in its database or the
username didn't match up), the header would state that this was
probably a fake message.

And of course if both the connection and the authentication were
successful, the header would state that this was a genuine message.

The only problem I can see with this modified scheme is that mail sent
through multiple hosts (for instance, on the UUCP network) would take
three times as long to get to their destination.

May I add to the list of flagrant security violators the Hewlett Packard
Corporation?  Under MPE/V (the current OS for HP/3000 machines), all batch jobs
must begin with a JOB card (those of you living in the late 1980s, substitute
"line of text") which contains user and group passwords in plain text.

Interestingly, one of our systems programmers (who shall remain nameless)
spoke of this as a FEATURE, because it allows users to submit batch jobs
for other accounts!

Steven C. Den Beste, denbeste@BBN.COM, quotes a Boston Globe story
about cellular phone eavesdropping and says that the article claims that

&gt; that the FCC says such eavesdropping is illegal.

Has the law changed?  I was led to understand that the FCC does not ban the
reception of any signal.  Of course, banning the reception of certain signals
is going to be tough to enforce anyway.

karl@sugar.hackercorp.com (Karl Lehenbauer), commenting on the security of 
electronic mail quoth:
&gt; Cellular phone data encryption is a relatively simple matter as well.  I don't
&gt; think we'll see any movement in that area until the users demand it, and the
&gt; government isn't likely to push heavily for it, a few strong proponents of
&gt; personal privacy in the legislature nonwithstanding.

  Just for information, significant levels of encryption for cellular phone
services have been considered by various vendors.  I'm constrained not to
comment on the details, but one vendor did speak with an associate and me
about the time and cost of getting access to proper encryption devices for
their product line.  They were constrained to deal with an american company
to do so, though, so I haven't heard anything more about it.

At the RISK of turning this into a comp.risks.elevators forum, I have some
further information on Eric Roskos' contribution:

| The elevators are "Otis Elevonic 401" elevators.  They appear to be
| microprocessor controlled; they have voice synthesizers that announce
| the floors, and scrolling text displays that give advertisements about
| the stores downstairs, the date and time of day, etc. 

[ Troubles deleted ]

Yup - those are the ones in our building too.  While I haven't noticed those
specific troubles, there are others.  They tend to cancel all calls when more
than three are selected, but there is one idiosyncrasy that I find disturbing.

I have a little hand-held (amateur) transceiver, generating just 3 watts on 147
MHz from a "rubber duck" antenna - very inefficient.  When I'm in the mood, I
trigger it next to various bits of electronic equipment, just to test their RF
susceptibility.  Imagine my surprise when the lift doors immediately flew open
(when closing), and a sepulchral voice announces "Do not be alarmed.  We are
experiencing a temporary malfunction."

Obviously, immunity to relatively weak RF fields was not a design issue.

I also get worried when their fancy flourescent display goes bizarre.  I would
hope that it is being driven by a slave computer, not the main control
processor...  I can always avoid the lifts, but 11 floors is a long way to
climb the stairs.

In RISKS 8:53, Patrick Wolfe describes the consequences of his
misunderstanding an error message on his PC.  The message, "use NET
START RDR hostname", was intended to mean

  "Issue the command 'NET START RDR hostname', substituting the name
   of your PC for 'hostname'."

But he interpreted "hostname" to mean the name of the host to which
the PC was connected, i.e., the network server, and the effect was to
bring down a multiuser BSD UNIX host.  He concludes:

 &gt; The risks should be obvious.  System Managers should not be allowed
 &gt; to touch PCs without re-reading the manuals first.  :-}

I draw a different and more enforceable conclusion:  

   ERROR MESSAGES SHOULD BE UNAMBIGUOUS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TELL
   THE USER TO DO SOMETHING  (or can be interpreted to do so).

Documentation is probably still the least-regarded aspect of software
production and maintenance, but it's the user's key to the product.

From "Eavesdropping Left and Right" in _The Nation_ of April 17, 1989, by
Gregory Flannery, reporter for the _Mt. Washington Press_, Cincinnati, Ohio.

    '... In 1979, [Cincinnati Bell's security coordinator James] West
    allegedly ordered a wiretap on lines serving vote-counting computers
    at the Hamilton County Board of Elections.  As ballots were being
    tabulated on election night, the computer shut down for two hours.
    "About 8:30 ...  election evening, Mr. West called me," [Cincinnati
    Bell installer and supervisor Leonard] Gates says. "He said we had
    done something to screw up the voting processor down there. He said,
    'You must have done something wrong.'"  Gates has testified that
    West told him the computer wiretap could be used to alter votes, but
    no evidence of such tampering has been produced to date ...'

The article also discusses other allegations which are part of a $112 million
dollar class-action suit accusing Cincinnati Bell of selling information
gathered through illegal wiretaps on client telephone lines.

Apropos the recent claim that, though a computer may be wrong, it is
not trying to defraud you -- I know of a system where the computer was
programmed to defraud consumers.

A large pie manufacturing company introduced microprocessor-controlled
production lines at the end of the 1970's.  The system dispensed the
appropriate weight of filling into each pie.  State law allowed for
human inaccuracy in pie fillings - if the pie was a "4oz" pie, the
bakers were permitted to range from 3.5 to 4.5oz.  The bakers were
thrilled with the supreme accuracy of the new system, and set it to
dispense at the lower limit instead of the nominal weight, all the time.

As far as I know this dishonesty continued unchecked, and it is permitted
because the computer system allows an accuracy hitherto unobtainable.

On the subject of people taking the computer's word as infallible...  did
anyone else catch "Perry Mason: The Case of the Musical Murder" on NBC Sunday
night?

Late in the show, after our hero Mr. Mason has figured out that his client is
innocent and the witness currently on the stand is the murderer, he begins to
question the witness as to his whereabouts.  The questioning goes something
like:

	Q: Where were you on the night of the murder at 2:30am?
	A: In my room doing script revisions.

	Q: How long were you workong on the script revisions?
	A: All night.

	Q: You use a word processor to work on the script, right?
	A: Yes.

	Q: Does the word processor put the date and time on the
	   files you modify?
	A: I don't know.

	[Mason pulls out a directory listing from the fellow's
	 computer...]

	Q: Now, next to the file "Polly", what time is shown?
	A: 1:35am

	Q: So you weren't working on the script during the time
	   of the murder, you finished working on it much earlier?
	A: Yes.

And of course, the witness breaks down on the stand and confesses.

Now, granted, one can argue that it's "only television" or "just meant
as entertainment".  But judging by the idiotic things I've heard
argued based on "I saw it on [fictional show of your choice]", I
suspect a lot of people take this stuff as gospel...

Anyway, the show demonstrates the fallacy of assuming that since the
information came from a computer, it is somehow ennobled, and nobody dares to
question it.  It apparently never occurred to these people that the time of day
clock on the computer could have been wrong for some reason.

For example, the Compaq we have here for an Ethernet analyzer comes up with
some random date and time every time we turn it on.  It does not even prompt
for the correct time (since we don't really care), one has to remember
explicitly to set it (and we never bother).  In fact, on most MS-DOS systems
I'm aware of, just pressing RETURN gets you through the time/date stuff without
ever having to set it correctly.

And as another example, Sun "generic" kernels come using the Pacific Standard
time zone... how many people don't bother to change it, or just stuff the
current time in without changing the time zone?

And as still a third example... how many systems out there use the "old" rules
for daylight savings time conversions?  They would have the wrong time for a
week or so unless someone fixed it manually...

If I were the guy on the stand, I would have denied it all and forced Mason to
prove that the time of day clock on the computer was correct at the time I last
edited that file.

Jerry Saltzer wrote that no old-time pilot would consider taking off without
personally verifying the fuel load in the plane, either by looking at it,
touching it, or dipping something in it.  As a not-so-old-time pilot (though
expecting one day to be one), I can say that most of us general aviation
pilots (and all of us GA pilots with whom I'll personally fly) STILL verify
the fuel load.

Fuel gauges, especially in general aviation aircraft, are NOTORIOUSLY
inaccurate.  I will not fly a GA plane without having eye-balled or thumbed or
dipped the fuel tanks, regardless of rain, high-wing plane with no ladder,
or whatever.

Indeed, many airliners fly without this precaution.

Henry Spencer wrote that aviations regulations state that the "ultimate
authority and responsibility rest with the pilot, nobody else."  Whereas this
is certainly true in general aviation, this is NOT true in air carrier
operations.  In air carrier operations, there is a division of labor, where
many people other than the pilot in command are responsible for, and have
authority as to, various aspects of a flight.

Now, once airborn, it's the pilot's word that goes.  Period.  However, while on
the ground, during loading and dispatch and such, various ground crew members
have authority and responsibility.  Of course, it's not THEIR necks on the line
in the sky....

&gt;"If a pilot has to make violent changes to the aircraft's attitude
&gt;in an emergency, then the computer will prevent the pilot pushing it
&gt;past design strengths. For example, the computer would prevent the pilot
&gt;putting it into a dive that might break off the tail."

In a past issue of the "Aviation Safety Digest", published (then) by the Bureau
of Air Safety Investigation, part of the Australian Department of Name Changes
(the Civil Aviation Authority this month) was the following incident report.
[From memory]

A single engine light aircraft was flying in heavy cloud and moderate
turbulence when it apparently entered a thunderstorm cell. A severe downdraught
caused an abrupt descent, followed by wind shear causing a stall, and further
descent. The pilot broke free from the base of the cloud, still descending, and
saw lots of trees. He pulled back VERY HARD on the controls, recovered control
of the aircraft, but felt it was performing strangely, so he landed at the
first opportunity.

Subsequent examination of the aircraft showed:

a) eucalyptus leaves in the undercarriage, presumably from tree skimming.

b) the wings had undergone permanent deformation, with the tips being
   now some 30cm higher than normal. The main spar had bent in two
   places. This was attributed to 'G' forces in excess of the flight
   envelope of the aircraft.

Now my point: had this been a fly-by-wire aircraft, it would presumably never
have been overstressed. The fact that it (and the pilot) would be in little
pieces in a rainforest is, however, depressing. The pilot reacted correctly, in
that he was "between a rock and a hard place", and chose between certain death
due to trees, versus probable death due to airframe failure in flight. He was
VERY lucky to come out of this at all, but how would a computer judge between
these extremes? (Note that even if the aircraft had had a radar altimeter it
would have been hard pressed to tell the height of the treetops. If the flight
computer had tried to pull out more gracefully it might still have been an
unhappy ending.)

The simple answer is "If it had fly-by-wire, it would have had weather radar,
and this would never have happened". True, but to me, irrelevant.

The manufacturers of aircraft build in a healthy safety margin, which in this
case saved a life. But there are at least three choices with a FBW system:

1. Allow the computer to fly to the "real" (no safety margin)
   limit, on the grounds that you can trust it more than a human.  
2. restrict it to the same performance limitations as you would certify if
   there was no FBW.  
3. Forget these safety margins entirely, independent of FBW installations.

I don't like any of the above options. (2) would have killed the pilot above,
(1) and (3) are quite similar in end effect, and could see us with a rash of
airframe failures due to manufacturing tolerances, corrosion, or miscalculation
on the part of the engineers (or their software).

As has been pointed out elsewhere, extreme circumstances do happen,
and can sometimes be rectified by humans.

Aside: Harry Harrison, in "Deathworld" written in the mid-sixties, has the hero
escape captivity in a spaceship's lifeboat only to crash because the
controlling computer won't pull out of a dive quickly enough.

I think it is only fair to mention that using SUBMIT_JOB is just one way of
submitting a batch job, and, indeed, NOT the way that our User Services group
teaches our users.  It took me an hour to find the text that was quoted above,
in an older version of a printed manual dated April 1988.  In the current
version of NOS/VE the JOB/JOBEND construct is what the casual user first sees
when reading about batch jobs - this method of submitting batch jobs inherits
validation information from the parent job and thus there are no plain text
passwords.  The primary purpose of SUBMIT_JOB is to run jobs on OTHER
machines.....

San Francisco Chronicle, Chronicle Wire Services, April 11, 1989:

               "Computer Group Wary of Security Agency

    A public interest group said yesterday that the National Security
Agency, the nation's biggest intelligence agency, could exert excessive
control over a program to strengthen the security of computer systems
throughout the federal government.
    
    The group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility - based in
Palo Alto - urged key members of Congress to focus "particularly close
scrutiny" on the agency's role in helping to implement legislation aimed at
safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information in federal computers.
   
    "There is a constant risk that the federal agencies, under the guise of
enhancing computer security, may find their programs - to the extent that they
rely upon computer systems - increasingly under the supervision of the largest
and most secretive intelligence organization in the country," it said."

In RISKS 8:52, David M.  Gursky wonders about the legality (constitutionality,
enforceability) of California's new law against (unsolicited) junk fax, and
ends with

  &gt; Of course, this whole message begs the question "How is this a risk
  &gt; to society?"

Junk fax is just as much a menace as junk phone calls that seize the line and
won't let go.  While junk mail just fills up your mailbox, it doesn't deprive
you of legitimate mail unless it piles up to the very top.  Junk fax, as long
as it's coming in, ties up your machine and makes it impossible for legitimate
transmissions to reach you.

"Tell the Public the Truth About Risks"
(The Washington Post, 4/12/89, p. A22, letter to the editor)

"Jessica Tuchman Mathew's op-ed article `Is There More Risk in the World?'
(March 29, 1989) sidesteps one the most basic issues in risk management: the
difference between imposed risk and assumed risk.  Dr. Mathews states that
once people cease to trust `those who manage and regulate the risks in their
lives . . . society's responses become irrational.'

"Public opposition to risky technologies - or technologies whose risks are
concealed or lied about by industry and regulators - is not irrational.  If
they are denied complete and reliable information, people will continue to
fight against the introduction of new, unknown risks in their lives.

"Full public information and participation are critical elements in
decisions about risk.  Unfortunately, in this decade the federal government
has consistently restricted public knowledge and involvement in such
questions, with decisions often made on the basis of narrowly defined
cost-benefit analysis.

"This trend should be reversed.  Complete information about various options
must reach those upon whom risks will be imposed in order to ensure their
involvement in final decisions.  For example, in the public debate over
meeting future energy needs, nuclear power and its attendant risks should be
compared not only with conventional methods of power generation but with
increased efficiency and renewable energy sources, federal, state and local
government must cooperate and show increasing flexibility in informing, not
closing out, the public.  The public has a right to know - and to decide."

I expect that the dangers of overlooking the possiblility of someone
disconnecting the power supply of a security system were hammered out in
this forum years ago, but I thought this story was a little different.

A friend of my brother had a car whose alternator broke down.  He had the
alternator mended.  He tried to start the car again.  Nothing happened.  He
realised the battery was still disconnected.  He left the car, shut the
door, opened the bonnet and reconnected the battery.

Clunk!  The Central Locking System locked all the doors of the car,
with the keys left in the ignition....

Disconnecting the battery again didn't allow the doors to be opened
again --- the manufacturers got that one right.

The NYT (April 11, 1989) reports that Dorcas R. Hardy, Commisssioner of the
Social Security Administration, told a Congressional committee that the agency
had verified millions of SSN's for private credit companies.

The risks of using SSNs and private credit companies have been discussed
before.  TRW, the nations largest credit reporting company recently proposed
paying the SS Administration $1000000 to have 140 million numbers verified.
Risks seem even greater when one company has credit information on 140
individuals--approximately 2/3 of every man, woman, and child in the country.

Phil Gambino, an agency spokesman, reported last month that the agency had
verified SSNs only at the request of beneficiaries or employers and had never
verified more than 25 numbers at a time.  He said such disclosures were
required under the Freedom of Information Act.

At the hearing yesterday, Dorcas R Hardy, Commissioner of the SSA, at first
denied any other verifications.  Later she admitted that in the early 80s,
3,000,000 SSNs were verified for Citi Corp and that last year 151,000 numbers
were verified for TRW.  Ms Hardy said that the 151,000 numbers were just part
of a "test run."

Senator David Pryor, D-Ark, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, said
that previous commissioners, the Congressional Research Service of the Library
of Congress, and Donald A. Gonya, chief counsel for Social Security have all
decided that such verification is illegal.

        Re Curtis Spangler's contribution in RISKS 8.54 ("NSA and Not Secure
Agencies"), quoting the SF Chronicle, quoting the CPSR spokesperson:

&gt; "There is a constant risk that the federal agencies, under the guise
&gt; of enhancing computer security, may find their programs - to the extent
&gt; that they rely upon computer systems - increasingly under the
&gt; supervision of the largest and most secretive intelligence organization
&gt; in the country," [CPSR] said."

        I find the "may" most quaint.  It strikes me that this is a risk to
which we give all too little consideration.  In the recent disputes over
`hackers' and the `ethics' of hacking on this newsgroup I have occasionally
noticed some pretty uncritical paeans to security.

        The classical philosophers held that knowledge is power.  Today we
hold that information is power -- not the same thing: worse, in fact.
`Information' in the modern sense is much more structured, hierarchical, and
systematic than the classical notion of `knowledge' allowed.  It therefore
permits a much greater range and freedom for the employment of our powers and
a correspondingly greater degree of control over nature -- human included.  As
a result, it aggravates and amplifies the tendency of power to centralise
itself to a much greater extent than would have been possible in premodern
times.  One could, in fact, state a general law of information similar to that
of thermodynamics: "The information control (security) of the universe is
always increasing."  Just as in thermodynamics local excursions in the
direction of lesser entropy occur only at the expense of a net gain in entropy
for the universe, so in information systems temporary increases in access to
information take place at the expense of global increases in control.

        Security itself is a (potential) risk -- to those who are not
themselves part of the security establishment or who are not in favour
therewith.  The interests of those who would implement and enforce security
measures in information systems must always be balanced against the rights and
interests of (1)the users and (2)the subjects, i.e. those about whom the
information is being gathered.  Remember: just because you are a member of (1)
does not mean you are not a member of (2).

(Re: Thayer, <A HREF="/Risks/8.53.html">RISKS-8.53</A>)

&gt; Has the law changed? I was led to understand that the FCC does not ban
&gt; the reception of any signal.  Of course, banning the reception of
&gt; certain signals is going to be tough to enforce anyway. 

[I originally wrote the following posting in response to the first
cellular telephone posting, then decided not to send it because (a) I'd
already made several RISKS postings recently and (b) I'm reluctant to
comment on legal matters when many legal people seem to get upset by
lay-persons doing so.  However, in response to the above question I
decided to send it in anyway.]

(Re: Den Beste, <A HREF="/Risks/8.52.html">RISKS-8.52</A>)

&gt; The article goes on to say that Radio Shack no longer sells that model, and
&gt; that the FCC says such eavesdropping is illegal.

Intentionally listening to cellular communications is a violation of PL 99-508,
"The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986," and the violator is
subject to a $500 criminal fine if the interception was of cellular telephone
and not for one of the "bad purposes" defined in the legislation (other types
of violations have penalties up to $250,000 for an individual or $500,000 for
an organization).  Accidentally encountering such a broadcast while tuning this
model of receiver is not a violation if you do not intentionally listen to it,
i.e., if you just pass by it in the course of tuning the radio; this issue was
specifically addressed in the ECPA.

The cellular telephone frequencies are adjacent to and overlap part of the UHF
TV band, so it is also possible to tune them on older, continuous (as vs.
discrete)-tuning UHF TV sets.  It was reported in the press that the FCC
recently stated that it is not illegal to manufacture and sell radios that tune
the cellular frequencies, and in the past the FCC has allegedly declined to
enforce the ECPA as applied to cellular telephones.  On the other hand, the
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association recently used legal measures
to force Grove Enterprises, a small dealer of radio equipment in North
Carolina, to stop enabling a disabled feature of Radio Shack scanners that
allowed reception of cellular telephone.  It's interesting to note that Radio
Shack was one of the companies listed in the Senate Report 99-541 as
"support[ing] the principles involved in the [ECPA] legislation," and they
manufacture a radio which has an option jumper that enables reception of these
communications.  It is currently sold with this option disabled.

There is currently an ongoing debate between radio hobbyists and various
sections of the government on application of the ECPA to cellular telephone
communications.  Recent issues of the monthly periodical _Monitoring_Times_
contain a good bit of editorializing and news items on the subject; there was
also a recent book specifically about how to intercept radio telephone
communications released by a publisher oriented towards "communications
monitoring" topics.  It also appears to be the case that a lot of scanners are
sold and modified to receive cellular communications, and that the popular
opinion is that the ECPA will not be enforced with regard to cellular
telephone.  From a practical standpoint, this suggests that it is wise to
assume that any cellular telephone communications are probably being listened
to.  From the viewpoint of the potential listener, like the types of
unauthorized computer access discussed here recently, in the absence of strong
enforcement it is probably largely an ethical consideration: whether or not it
is technically legal or illegal, one has to consider whether it is ethical.
And, as I've argued in the past, Ethics per se doesn't say whether this sort of
activity is "ethical." It's a difficult problem to address, other than simply
to realize that the problem exists, and act in an informed manner.

Disclaimers: The above comments result from reading published documents on the
ECPA, and are *not* the opinions of a legal professional.  My interest in the
subject is solely in the area of keeping up with security and privacy issues,
and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of anyone else.

Subject: Security hole in 386i login

The login program supplied by Sun for its 386i machines accepts an argument
which bypasses authentication.  It was apparently added in order to allow
the Sun program "logintool" to do the authentication and have login do the
housekeeping.  This allows any user who discovers the new argument to the
login program to become root a couple of ways.

ps:  Mike Rigsby (rigsby@ctc.contel.com) tells me that at a 386i SOS
     administration class he attended, he was informed that this access path
     was a design feature put in for forgetful administrators but that the
     class was told to keep it a secret.  I find this surprising, if true,
     since this is the OS that Sun claims "meets the spirit of C2

     specs than I thought I did.

&gt;prove that the time of day clock on the computer was correct at the time I 
&gt;last edited that file.

Actually, in the experience of the "average viewer" of a Perry Mason show, this
is probably a valid representation.  If they know computers at all, they're
probably PC-class things containing a clock card.  Just a little diligence sets
things up OK; most folks probably like the idea of a date/time stamp on
documents that they're constantly revising.

So, while it wouldn't have happened in many of our labs, it's probably
reasonable to have skipped Mason's providing "proof" that the clock was correct
since it's entirely reasonable, in this kind of case, that it probably was.

In RISKS 8.54, davy@riacs.edu reports on Perry Mason's latest:

"Anyway, the show demonstrates the fallacy of assuming that since the
information came from a computer, it is somehow ennobled,..."

But it didn't come from just any computer, it came from a Macintosh!

Seriously, I've come across several Macs here at TMC with clocks about four
hours slow.  Why?  They were manufactured and tested on Pacific Standard Time,
and here it is Eastern Daylight Time.  Contrariwise, I've seen and heard about
many Macs with clocks that run fast by several minutes per month.  Clock
accuracy requires maintenance!

I have been trying to get more information on how the 767's systems work, 
but I think I should clarify something here.  People seem to be getting the
idea that the romantic notion of sticking a dipstick in a fuel tank is
a practical, easy accomplished act in an airliner.  It isn't.  

Putting aside the fact that one has to get on the wing (and add structural
and maintenance support for the traffic areas), on Boeing aircraft, at least,
the overwing fuelling ports are fastened with several dozen screws.  It is
a pain taking the ports off and putting them back on.  A lengthy, expensive 
process.  Normally, fuelling is done on the starboard wing, through an 
underwing high-pressure nozzle.

To give an idea of how unattractive overwing fuelling is, recently, an Aero-
mexico 727 diverted to an ex-WWII bomber base in Galveston, TX, during a 
thunderstorm.  They were short on fuel.  Galveston has a full-service FBO, 
and routinely caters to executive jets--but they didn't have the right 
nozzle size.  Instead of opening the overwing hatches, they sent a car off 
to Houston to fetch the right adapter, sixty miles away--a total delay of 
about four hours.

All of this rather makes me doubt the "dipstick" story on the Air Canada
767, unless there's a new, specialized system that avoids the filler port.
Or, more likely, "dipstick" is slang for a secondary automated system.

In the old days (on props), "inspections" WERE used, but often required custom-
designed dipsticks.  A few planes were lost because the wrong dipstick was
used (improper graduations).

In practical airliner work, fuel is calculated using four methods:
   1.  The amount pumped in (by weight, on the truck);
   2.  Gauges near the wing (totalizers);
   3.  Individual tank quantity gauges and a totalizer gauge in the cockpit
       (merely knowing how much fuel is left is not adequate; one must know
        WHERE it is, due to loading considerations).
   4.  The amount burned (the fuel passed through the engines, fuel flow).

Fuel management is a continual cross-check of all these factors (that's what
the flight engineer, if present, is there for).  Occasionally, things screw up
(as in the case of the UA 747 near Japan, which "ran out of fuel," but was
found to have 30,000 lbs left in the center tank--they actually lost three
engines).  Overfilling is also more common than it should be--if you ever see a
plane dripping liquid, it's probably an overfilled tank.  The fire trucks won't
be far behind...

&gt;Henry Spencer wrote that aviations regulations state that the "ultimate
&gt;authority and responsibility rest with the pilot, nobody else."  Whereas this
&gt;is certainly true in general aviation, this is NOT true in air carrier
&gt;operations.  In air carrier operations, there is a division of labor, where
&gt;many people other than the pilot in command are responsible for, and have
&gt;authority as to, various aspects of a flight.

Legally, they have no authority.  Under FAR 91.3, the pilot in command is
directly responsible for, and is the ultimate authority as to, the proper
operation of the aircraft.  In PRACTICAL work, as other posters have noticed,
other people assume a de facto responsibility.  However, once the captain signs
the dispatch papers, he is LEGALLY responsible.  If the captain signs off with
an improperly loaded aircraft, or with dry fuel tanks, it is HIS legal
responsibility.

The "ground crew" concept came into being during the 60's, and was a result
of human-resource studies.  It usually works, but ground people do make mis-
takes.  The pragmatic pilot will always double-check the figures and, at
least, make an effort to determine whether the figures (and the general
status of the airplane) are in the ballpark.  We are starting to see a re-
turn to a more "hands on" management style.

  Commercial aircraft rarely take off with a full fuel tank, there is no
profit to be made in lifting a bunch of extra fuel.  Only enough to make
it to the primary destination and secondary landing site plus some extra
for holding is loaded.  Any extra would just have to be dumped anyway to
meet the safe landing weight.

  So eyeballing the tank to see if it was full would be useless, you would
need to use the dipstick.
                                          John Hascall

   [The next step is a computer program that checks the fuel levels, the
   flight destination, the weather data, and the plane load (among other
   things) and determines whether there is enough fuel.  If pilots came to
   trust THAT computer program -- and the sensors, computer data. etc. -- then
   my eyeballs would be rolling.  So, let's hear it for intelligent people,
   whether or not they use dipsticks!  PGN]

Student grants in New Zealand are now paid by direct credit from the
university's bank account to the student's. On Tuesday Victoria University sent
a tape with the details to its bank, the Bank of NZ, which passed it on to
Databank, the NZ banks' centralised computer centre. One (human) error meant
the university was apparently asking for debits of a total of about $2,000,000
from some 4700 students instead of credits to their accounts.  Databank did
this although of course the university was not authorised to debit the
students.  According to today's "Dominion" newspaper BNZ may have spotted the
error. On Wednesday a certain amount of chaos ensued, with students' banks
saying all their cheques would be honoured that day and no overdraft fees
applied.  Corrections were made that night. It seems that Databank had no
senior staff on duty on Tuesday night when the wrong transactions occurred, and
guessed wrong on finding conflict between BNZ and Victoria University of
Wellington instructions.

During a recent episode of the PBS series "Learning in America", the cameras
were taken through a trade show at which computer and software vendors pitched
high-tech teaching aids to school board purchasing agents.  Aside from possible
(and clearly debatable) RISKs to the brains of American schoolchildren (my
child was taught by a computer; she must always be right!), a more ominous idea
was presented.  A company whose name I cannot recall was demonstrating a
software system to track attendance.  It included a feature whereby parents
would be automatically notified (by mail, I suppose) of their childrens'
absences:

  "Where were you last week?!?"
  "In school, mom!"
  "Wrongo!  The school computer says you were absent 12 days last week!"

From the Phila. Inquirer, April 12, 1989.  Page One, New Jersey/Metro section. 

"Ex-worker charged in virus case -- Databases were alleged target",
by Jane M. Von Bergen, Inquirer Staff Writer

A former employee was charged yesterday with infecting his company's computer
database in what is believed to be the first computer-virus arrest in the
Philadelphia area.

"We believe he was doing this as an act of revenge," said Camden County
Assistant Prosecutor Norman Muhlbaier said [sic] yesterday, commenting on a
motive for the employee who allegedly installed a program to erase databases at
his former company, Datacomp Corp. in Voorhees [N.J.].

Chris Young, 21, of the 2000 block of Liberty Street, Trenton, was charged in
Camden County with one count of computer theft by altering a database.
Superior Court Judge E. Stevenson Fluharty released Young on his promise to pay
$10,000 if he failed to appear in court.  If convicted, Young faces a 10-year
prison term and a $100,000 fine.  Young could not be reached for comment.

"No damage was done," Muhlbaier said, because the company discovered the virus
before it could cause harm.  Had the virus gone into effect, it could have
damaged databases worth several hundred thousand dollars, Muhlbaier said.

Datacomp Corp., in the Echelon Mall, is involved in telephone marketing.  The
company, which has between 30 and 35 employees, had a contract with a major
telephone company to verify the contents of its white pages and try to sell
bold-faced or other special listings in the white pages, a Datacomp company
spokeswoman said.  The database Young is accused of trying to destroy is the
list of names from the phone company, she [sic] said.

Muhlbaier said that the day Young resigned from the company, Oct. 7, he used
fictitious passwords to obtain entry into the company computer, programming the
virus to begin its destruction Dec. 7 --- Pearl Harbor Day.  Young, who had
worked for the company on and off for two years --- most recently as a
supervisor --- was disgruntled because he had received some unfavorable
job-performance reviews, the prosecutor said.

Eventually, operators at the company picked up glitches in the computer system.
A programmer, called in to straighten out the mess, noticed that the program
had been altered and discovered the data-destroying virus, Muhlbaier said.
"What Mr. Young did not know was that the computer system has a lot of security
features so they could track it back to a particular date, time and terminal,"
Muhlbaier said.  "We were able to ... prove that he was at that terminal."
Young's virus, Muhlbaier said, is the type known as a "time bomb" because it is
programmed to go off at a specific time.  In this case, the database would have
been sickened the first time someone switched on a computer Dec. 7, he said

[note -- it makes me kind of sick to see the term "sickened" applied to a
database... sigh]

Norma Kraus, a vice president of Datacomp's parent company, Volt Information
Sciences Inc, said yesterday that the company's potential loss included not
only the databases, but also the time it took to find and cure the virus.  "All
the work has to stop," causing delivery backups on contracts, she said.  "We're
just fortunate that we have employees who can determine what's wrong and then
have the interest to do something.  In this case, the employee didn't stop at
fixing the system, but continued on to determine what the problem was." [hear,
hear!]

The Volt company, based in New York, does $500 million worth of business a year
with such services as telephone marketing, data processing and technical
support.  It also arranges temporary workers, particularly in the
data-processing field, and installs telecommunication services, Kraus said.

  [As usual, everything is now a `virus', even a nonreplicating timebomb.  PGN]

Corrections to some semi-philosophical remarks in a recent posting:
Hugh Miller, Not Secure Agencies, in <A HREF="/Risks/8.55.html">RISKS-8.55</A>:

&gt; The classical philosophers held that knowledge is power.

If we give "classical" its usual meaning, no such philosopher "held
that power is knowledge" (or, at any rate, none known to me).  The
famous aphorism comes from Bacon, and what he was doing was proposing
a radically new definition: that nothing counts as true knowledge
unless it enables us to intervene in and control the material world.
All the rest was mumbo-jumbo.  This was part of an explicit attack on
(more or less) everybody who preceded him, especially the Schoolmen.

Note: There's a meta-problem with phrases like "the classical
philosophers [believed this or that]" -- for the simple reason that
there were many different ones, and they often disagreed.

&gt; 'Information' in the modern sense is much more structured ...
than the classical notion of 'knowledge' allowed.

Comparing information and knowledge is like asking whether the fatness of a pig
is more or less green than the designated hitter rule.  Let's take Plato and
Aristotle as exemplars of "classical" views on "knowledge."  For both of them,
knowledge concerns the highest truths about the cosmos and mankind's place in
it, and is aspired to by the very best kind of human being.  Such cannot be
said of lists of social security numbers.

From: ficc!peter@uunet.UU.NET
&gt; One thing to bear in mind is that the computer can be mistaken, but
&gt; it can't be malicious. The computer program won't deliberately try to defraud

Hmmm. Depends on your definition of "malicious."  A large bank I worked for was
found in court to have programmed its computers so as to systematically defraud
its customers of their full compound interest. Whether the program into which
the fraud was built was "malicious" is largely a matter of terminology.

Let me turn the issue around somewhat - can a computer recognize "malice" in a
person?  Believe it or not, some computerized psychological tests (that are
regularly admissible in court as evidence) purport to be able to diagnose
malicious tendencies.  I was once compelled by a court to submit to such an
examination, despite my academic protest that such tests were scientifically
invalid (which was established statistically in the 1960s).

The computer reported that I didn't have a sense of humor, which I still find
amusing.  However, the widespread use of such tests is definitely not amusing.

  In reference to Dave Curry's response about the guy on the stand.  Mason
doesn't have to prove he was guilty of the crime; he has to prove that his
client is not guilty.  Ergo, it wouldn't matter if the guy on the stand denied
everything and forced Mason to prove anything.  The bottom line is Mason by
discussing the "directory" could introduce some doubt to the District
Attorney`s argument.  Normally, if the case is not provable "beyond a
reasonable doubt", a verdict of "not guilty" is usually given.

  Of course, since Mason always does such a good job, the DA doesn't have to
work hard for the next trial.  But then again, Mason might defend the "guilty"
guy successfully since "was the directory acquisition legal"?

  So much for supporting Mason writers...

  I agree strongly with Dave's arguments since many people do accept computer
printouts as infallible facts and gospel.  I wonder how many RISK debates
are accepted because they appear in the RISK forum...  I also wonder how many
people use the RISKS forum discussions/debates to support local opinions...
The computer word/document/listing has become a very powerful tool (just like
statistics) and many people use it to their advantage.

I'd like to respond to a posting by Brian McMahon, Administrative Computing,
University of Maryland in which he states :  "May I add to the list of flagrant
security violators the Hewlett Packard Corporation? Under MPE/V (the current OS
for HP/3000 machines), all batch jobs must begin with a JOB card (those of you
living in the late 1980s, substitute "line of text") which contains user and
group passwords in plain text.

  "Interestingly, one of our systems programmers (who shall remain nameless)
spoke of this as a FEATURE, because it allows users to submit batch jobs
for other accounts!"

The C2 evaluated version of MPE V/E, which was announced in October of 1988,
allows the security administrator to configure the system to remove this
vulnerability.  In particular, to quote from the Final Evaluation Report:

  "Prevention of password exposure in batch submissions is effected by
rejecting embedded passwords in job cards, prohibiting cross streaming
[mentioned in the second paragraph above], and allowing System Manager and
Account Manager to stream subordinate's jobs, and a user to stream one's own
jobs, without having to supply passwords.  A privileged interface, STREAMJOB,
is provided which allows privileged mode programs to start jobs without having
to supply passwords."

Obviously, word hasn't gotten out to everyone about how the C2 secure version
of MPE V/E works, but I know it does since I was team leader of the National
Computer Security Center evaluation team.  It is true that a customer must pay
extra to get the Security Configurator software which will turn on the above
features, but the ability to prevent job STREAMing with exposed passwords is
there in all versions of release G.03.04 and later.  You have to have the
Security Configurator to configure it that way; otherwise it will default to
the previous way of handling STREAMing, which requires embedded passwords.
This is known as backward compatibility, and HP is hardly the first company to
worry about that.

This reminded me of an anecdote in one of the early books about computers,
which was used to illustrate Babbage's insistence that the Difference Engine
should produce as output plates for printing the results, lest someone's error
in copying/typesetting introduce an error. (Might have been the book "Faster,
Faster" by W. J. Eckert.)

  There was a brief period in which England and Spain were on good terms with
  each other.  An English admiral invited a Spanish admiral aboard his flagship
  for a visit, during which he presented the visitor with a beautifully bound
  copy of the English navigational tables.  After the visit the Spanish fleet
  sailed away and was never heard from again.  It seems the English never used
  their own navigational tables, knowing them to be full of errors; they always
  used the French tables.

I recently obtained - from Bev Littlewood - a copy of an article in
France-Soir for 18 February about computer-related problems of the Airbus
320.  In case it can, despite the passage of time, still add usefully to the
information that has been made available in the Anglo-Saxon (French for UK
plus US!) press, I am providing an almost complete translation, in which I
have endeavoured to retain the flavour and style of the original article.
(My apologies for the amateur nature of the translation and of the
inadequacy of the dictionary that I had available to me at the time!)

Brian Randell, Computing Laboratory, University of Newcastle upon Tyne

  AIRBUS 320: THE COMPUTER REFUSES TO PASS ON THE PILOT'S INSTRUCTIONS:  One
  of the Incidents which has caused Aerospatiale to return the machines to 
  "marbre" [?]

Less than one year after it first went into service, the Airbus A320, the
most sophisticated civil airliner existing, has to go back to the "marbre"
[?]. A simple revision after thousands of hours in the air?  Not just that!

After going into service in April last, the plane is "chouchoute'"[?]  by
its builder, Airbus-Industrie, and the air lines. All the improvements
capable of being made to the latest Airbus are made under the control of
DGAC (Direction Ge'ne'rale de l'Aviation Civile). "The A320, like all new
machines, is in its period of debugging ["de'verminage"]," emphasized Daniel
Tenebaum, the boss of DGAC. "It is above all a question of removing faults
which have appeared since it first went into service."

STRAIGHT AT A MOUNTAIN:

During critical phases - landing and take-off - the computer system shows only
the most dangerous alarms. "This is a wretched problem", explained an Air
France captain, "Certain failures are recorded by the computer, but the pilots
are informed only later".

Paul Baud, the flight trials director of Airbus-Industrie explains:  "To ease
the task of the pilot, only the problems which relate directly to critical
phases are communicated to him: fire in the engines, the baggage hold, or in
the toilets."

But there are worse ones. The computer system (nicknamed the "Little Genius")
sometimes escapes from the control of the crew. "I am going to land at Geneva
in my A320, and it happens that the altitude indicators show `hauteurs
farfelues' [incorrect heights?]. Luckily the airport urgently advised me of
this. Otherwise we would have flown straight into the mountain!" Immediately,
the captain demanded that the computer be replaced as being not completely
reliable.

Worse. The case of the pilot who saw with horror his computer indicating "full
fuel load" when he started his descent to the airport in West Berlin.  And the
famous "Little Genius" refused to let him take over manual control.  "We very
nearly had a catastrophe", said the pilot.

The cause, it seems, is the electrical power supply. "We have screened[?] all
electrical resistances" ["Nous avons passe' au crible l'ensemble des
re'sistances"], insists Paul Baud. "There was though a failure. Henceforth, the
on-board computers will be fitted with higher performance diodes."

A FAULTY COMPUTER:

They will even improve the transformers-rectifiers. These serve to supply the
A320's automation systems, in modifying the the alternating and the direct
current. Nevertheless, Airbus-Industrie points out that all the flight-critical
mechanisms are duplicated. One defective computer is thus immediately replaced
by its twin.

regarding improved sound-proofing.]

From Dublin's EVENING HERALD of Thursday 13th April, without permission:

 "1,000 Pilots Face Ban"

 The US Federal Aviation Administration said it planned to suspend or revoke
 the licences of more than 1,000 pilots who lied about past alcohol or drugs
 convictions.

 The FAA said about 10 per cent of them were commercial airline pilots and the
 rest were private pilots.

 The FAA said it got the names of more than 6,000 pilots through a computer
 match of medical applications, criminal records and state motor vehicle
 records.

Any of the pilots on the list care to comment?  Do you feel that this is a fair
or foul use of computer databases?

Dermot Williams, University College Dublin, Dept. of Computer Science

    [In an effort to make sure we stick to the computer risks, and not compete
    with the aviation BBoards on technical nuances, I suggest that some of the
    pending submissions to RISKS might better be redirected elsewhere.  This
    item is clearly a computer database problem, not an aviation problem.  PGN]

Dave Horsfal writes in Risks 8.54:
  I have a little hand-held (amateur) transceiver, generating just 3 watts on
  147 MHz from a "rubber duck" antenna - very inefficient.  When I'm in the
  mood, I trigger it next to various bits of electronic	equipment, just to test
  their RF susceptibility. ...

This is distressing behavior from a licensed amateur radio operator.  In the
US, this might subject one to revocation of the license and possibly criminal
penalties if the action caused damage or injury. In the US, amatuer radio
transmissions are restricted in purpose, and testing RFI rejection of
commercial equipment is not one of them.  Even if the manufacturer were wholly
negligent in their RFI rejection, the amatuer ``investigator'' of this fact
could reasonably be expected to understand the consequences of probing this
inadequate security.  For example, I rather doubt that any one would make such
an investigation of, say, someone's pacemaker. In my opinion, amatuer radio
operators have approximately the same responsibility as did the author of the
Internet worm. They have substantial technical knowledge and good reason to
believe that their action could cause malfunction, and in this case, possible
injury.

My daughter's high school (and several others in this area) has had such a
notification system in place for several years.  I don't know how much a part
the school's computers play in this, but the notification is in the form of a
telephone call to the home and a generic recording that is played.  Something
along the lines of "Your child was reported absent in one or more of his/her
classes today." The source of problems (or "risks") of this system is human,
not computer-based.  Every time I received the recording, my daughter's absence
was excused, usually because of a school field trip that had been approved by
the school; so if there's poor coordination between teachers and
administration, parents will receive false alarms.  (Which, like too many cries
of "Wolf!" may lessen a parent's belief in any real reports of absences.)
Also, since the calls are usually generated at a predictable time in the
evening of the absence, truants could just take the call for the parent and
report it as a wrong number.  (I've also heard of people without children
getting these calls, either due to typos in the student's records or misdialing
of the number.) So much for an infallible reporting system here.

	When I was in my Sophomore year at The Bronx High School of Science,
they implemented a computerized attendence scheme.  Every student was given a
number (welcome to the real world... forget your name, you are now ####) which
was used to trace the student through their years at school.  When attendence
was taken in classes and in Homeroom, the teachers would fill out "bubble"
sheets which were passed through a scanner to the central computer, which was
located somewhere in Manhatten!
	They quickly found many problems in the system.  Errors in filling in
the wrong bubbles, the computer crashing, students forgetting their number, and
students who would cut Homeroom (which meant "Absent for Day") yet were not
marked absent in certain classes, really screwed the school administration up.
	And, as with most other computer systems, there were ways around the
system.  Supposedly being the "brightest students in the country" (YEAH,
Right!! :-}), you can imagine the fun we had beating it.
	In a word, computerized school attendence systems are a JOKE! And they
don't help with convincing the students that are REAL people, not just cogs in
the system.

One evening last week the phone rang and I answered to hear a sepulcral
electronic voice announce that my son, whom I know was in school, had been
absent from all of his classes that week.

The best part of this system, from the schools point of view, is
that there's not even any chance to question that electronic voice.

linden@Sun.COM (Peter van der Linden) asserts that a computer can defraud
you. His story about the pie factory is seriously flawed.

1) The computer is just a tool. You are being defrauded by the management of
the pie factory, in the same way you are defrauded by the taxi driver who short
changes you rather than by his taximeter.

2) Weights and measures are controlled by legislation. It may be immoral to
take advantage of the loopholes in that legislation, but it is not dishonest.
If the law is unsatisfactory, get it changed.

3) In the pie factory case, before automation, 50% of consumers of a 4oz.  pie
were getting *more* than they had paid for. I wonder how many of them wrote to
the factory to offer more money?

4) Computer weighing systems do *not* allow "an accuracy hitherto unobtainable".
(I wrote potato chip weighing systems for two years for a living). What they
generally do is allow repeatability in weighing, i.e., a narrowing of the
distribution curve of the weights dispensed, which then allows a slight
reduction in the 'set-weight', at an enormous saving to the producer, spread
over millions of items, but a minimal impact on the consumer of a single item.

5) Peter says "if the pie was a "4oz" pie, the bakers were permitted to range
from 3.5 to 4.5oz". This sounds unlikely to me. I am not familiar with American
weights and measures legislation, but the law is usually either formulated such
that *no* pie may weight less than 4oz - which means that the average pie must
actually weigh 4oz plus twice the standard deviation of pie weight (at least -
depends on how assiduous you want to be in avoiding prosecution!), or there is
some kind of limit on what proportion of pies may weigh less than the marked
weight. If the control is merely on the average weight, given two pies, I'll
have the 8oz pie and you can have the empty carton! In either case, it is in
the manufacturers interest to reduce the standard deviation as much as
possible, which is what the computer allows. In fact, the real problem is not
weighing the pies, or whatever, but accurately dispensing the filling. In the
EEC, all products are divided into two categories, 'easy to pack', and
'difficult to pack' with the former having tighter controls than the latter.

When I was weighing potato chips, one of the things we did was make sure each
and every packet had at least the legal minimum content. This goes part-way
towards ensuring that every consumer gets what he paid for.

Having been roundly chastened for claiming that a computer can not be
malicious, let me explain this point more fully. A bank may have policies that
are malicious, and may embody these policies in a computer program.  I would
not deny that... the point I'm making, though, is that the computer software
can be assumed to embody the policies of the bank. Subject to bugs and design
flaws, of course, but it's the bank's policies.

An agent of the bank, then, has a reason to stand by the computer:

  While the software may have bugs, they can be reasonably certain it is not
  intended to defraud the bank. So long as the bank has reasonable policies,
  they can also assume that there's nothing in the program intended to
  deliberately defraud its customers. They have no such certainty about the
  customers themselves.

The problem comes when a customer has documentation to substantiate his
or her claim, or they know there's a bug, and they still don't act.

HOW CONCERNED WORKERS BLEW WHISTLE AT NORTHROP
by Ralph Vartabedian, Times Staff Writer

On her very first day at Northrop's Western Services Department in El Monte,
which produced guidance devices for nuclear-armed cruise missiles, Florence
Castaneda said she knew that "something was terribly wrong."  In an electronics
"clean room," Northrop employees were smoking cigarettes, boiling water for
soup, eating lunch at their work stations and watching soap operas on a
television set mounted on the supervisor's desk, she recalled.  Castaneda
noticed that instead of using industrial solvents to clear and prepare circuit
boards for soldering, workers were using a jar of Tarn-X, a retail brand of
polish for silverware.  "There was a price tag on it from Thrifty Drug Store,"
she recalled.  "I hadn't seen this kind of work being done in the aerospace
industry."  ...

As a result of their efforts, a federal indictment was filed earlier this week,
charging their formal supervisor, Charles Gonsalves, with criminal fraud.
Tests were allegedly faked and in some cases not performed at all on cruise
missile guidance systems and on stabilization systems for Marine Corps jet
fighters, the indictment said.  Besides Gonsalves, criminal charges were filed
against Northrop itself, two high-ranking executives and two other supervisors.
Northrop has said the criminal changes against it and two current executives
are "unwarranted," but the firm has acknowledged that problems existed at the
plant and that Gonsalves and three other employees have been fired.  ...  Not
only was the plant manager, Gonsalves, charged with fraud, but the factory's
quality assurance supervisor and its chief engineer were indicted.

Unlike many other defense industry whistle-blowers, Castaneda has no financial
stake in any False Claims Act law suits, which individuals can bring on behalf
of the government and share in the damages.  She was motivated by a sense of
concern over "those nuclear missiles out there" that she always worried "could
be the start of World War II."  ...  "I called the FBI in November, 1986.  They
told me I sounded like a disgruntled employee and that it was a case of sour
grapes," Castaneda recalled. (Justice Department officials declined to comment
on Castaneda.)  It was not until a nephew in the Air National Guard arranged a
meeting with Air Force agents from the Office of Special Investigations that
anybody would listen to her story.

In January, 1987, an OSI agent [met with Castaneda and fellow workers Barajas
and Meyer].  "Florence had earlier attempted to contact Northrop, but nothing
ever happened," Barajas said. "Pat Meyer and Florence called back east to
Precision Products Divison [the corporate parent of Western Services
Department' to say problems were going on.  After that, absolutely nothing was
done.  It disgusted everybody.  We knew that if we tried to complain, nothing
would be done."  Barajas said that he wrote an anonymous letter to corporate
executives at Northrop, but the letter eventually ended up back with Gonsalves.
"He posted it on the bulletin board to tell everybody that it wouldn't do any
good to complain.  He laughed at it.  He said, "Whatever fool tried it, it
didn't get anywhere."

After the investigation was launched in 1987, however, government agents met
with the employees once every other week at Barajas' house.  Barajas provided
investigators with a computer tape used to falsify tests on cruise missile
systems built at the plant.

[The rest of the article describes details of the investigation including
wiring one of the employees with a tape recorder.  There is also a bizarre
story about a psychologist who had been assigned to Castaneda after a temporary
disability claim in April 1985, who visited Castaneda at home three times a
week for two hours each time for several months.  "She told me to forgive
Northrop and to forgive Mr. Gonsalves -- to ask God to forgive them -- and to
just go back to work," she said.]

From a book review in Science magazine, 7 Apr 89

  "He even tells us about his disappointment upon learning that a part he was
  ordering from a catalogue couldn't be shipped until the next week, in spite
  of a promise in the catalogue of same-day service.
  `You must have a very old catalogue,' he was told, without a trace of
  irony.  `Now we have a computer.'"

The book reviewed is "Ideas and Information: Managing in a High-Tech
World" by Arno Penzias; Norton, New York, 1989. 224 pp. $17.95

[On the subject of radio amateurs transmitting in elevators:]

In fact, radio amateurs are allowed to do various things other than talk to
each other.  They may operate radio control aircraft, they may evaluate
antennas, and they may run RFI tests -- usuallly to minimize interference from
their own transmissions to TVs, etc.  Horsfal's downfall [oops, no pun] might
come if he did not properly identify himself with his call sign.

The more interesting point for RISKS is that a 3-watt handitalkie is NOT an
especially unusual device to be found on an elevator.  Our buildings &amp;
grounds people carry them around all the time, and they certainly aren't shy
about using them near elevators -- or your pacemaker, for that matter.

Elevators and other 'smart' safety-critical gadgets like automotive
microcomputers must have a defined behavior in any likely electromagnetic
environment.  They don't have to work, but they should fail safe.

In the Feb 27 Aviation Week, in an article on US Navy antisubmarine warfare
and future plans for same:

	The fundamental problem with ASW is that it is very complicated.
	There is no single system that is a panacea, like Aegis is to
	air defense, Rear Adm. James R. Fitzgerald, director of the
	antisubmarine warfare division of naval warfare for the chief
	of naval operations, said.  "If there were, the Navy would buy
	a lot of them and declare the problem solved."

The view of Aegis that is revealed in this is, um, interesting.

Thoreau had a considerable interest in this subject, actually.  In one of
his earlier works (I think "The Maine Woods") he tells in great detail the
story of the incident he's probably referring to here, in which a ship split
open after colliding with a rock called "The Grampus" ("grampus" being the
name of a kind of whale, the name coming from the Latin "crassus pisces," or
"fat fish").  He saw a large sign that advertised the disaster like a circus
poster, and he and his brother turned aside from their trip to go see.  He
ends up the story with the moral "The resolute man's purpose cannot be split
on any grampus," which was the cryptic quote in my signature line for a long
while on the Usenet, back when we subscribed to it here.

It is good to see someone reading Thoreau; he had a lot of comments on
the progress of technology, and had a great appreciation of telegraph wires
for reasons other than merely the fact that messages were sent down them.

	"... we will see that some will be riding, and the rest will
	 be run over; and it will be called, and will be, `a
	 melancholy accident'."

[His comment on public enthusiasm for new technology, and the fact that often
in the end it turns out not to be that useful, and sometimes harmful, for many
of the people who were most enthusiastic about it.  In this case, he was
talking about the new steam locomotive that was coming to Concord.]

Last week I had the pleasure of eating in one of those restaurants that has an
automatic order entry system.  This is a system whereby the waitroid has a hand
held terminal onto which s/he enters the table's order, and this order is
relayed via infra-red to a pickup in the ceiling, thence to the central order
computer, and finally to the chefs in the kitchen.  It is a marvelous system,
as long as it works.

In this case, the chef stolidly maintained that he never received one of our
orders.  Since the computer had not told him to service an order, he refused to
do so.  The waiter was unable to convince him.  Similarly, the waiter refused
to resubmit the order, since his terminal informed him that it had been
processed, and if he resubmitted the order, he would be liable to collect
double the fare.

We waited for over two hours for our food, until we advised him that the
hand-held terminal would find a very uncomfortable location on his body if
*we* got our hands on it :-)  It took the intervention of the manager to get
the food (and why it took 2+ hours, I will never know).

In the end, the waiter apologized to us, graciously explaining that it was a
"computer error" that had caused all the delay.

Here's a followup to the article I sent last week about HeathKit's "Most
Accurate Clock" and Daylight time.

After my problems with the clock being exactly 1 hour off, I checked with both
Heath and NBS (the folks who run WWV/WWVH) and discovered that the embedded
digital signal does indeed include a packet which indicates Daylight time.

The decision to send the packet is controlled by a manual switch at the 
WWV site in Ft Collins.  According the NBS, "...our people don't make
mistakes when using that switch..(paraprhased)".  According to Heath,
"We've had several complaints about this over the years".

I'm certainly glad that I don't have anything depending on the correct hourly
readout from that clock! (although I do have my computer system set up to set
it's time from the clock once a day).

The discussion on the Boeing fuel management issue reminds me of an issue that
we delt with when I first came to work here at NSWC.  The first A6-E aircraft
delivered to the Navy had severe fuel management problems.  In fact, the first
A6-E I saw we dug out of the swamp near Norfolk VA.  The A6E has two wing tanks
and a main tank behind the cockpit.  However, to be used, the fuel in the wing
tank must be pumped into the main tank from which it is pumped into the engine.
The pilot took off with an indication of a full main tank and full wing tanks.
During ascent, the engines flamed out.  The pilot suspected that the main tank
was empty and started the transfer from the wing tanks to the main.  However,
the pumps were not fast enough and he could not restart the engines.  The
problem was a failure prone fuel level indicator.  The advantage that a
computer would have added is that it would have made the same error that the
pilot did - assuming that the indicator was correct.  Therefore, we can still
blame the pilot for not checking the tank prior to take-off.

The following condensed from Bob Wallace, Network World v6#7 2/20/89 pg 1.
 
Fear of alienating customers has encouraged some companies to rethink the way 
 they use ISDN's automatic number identification (ANI) capability.

American Express Travel Related Services Co. (TRS), AT&amp;T's first commercial 
 ISDN user, reportedly found that customers were startled when some of its 
 agents greeted them by name.  TRS has since prohibited the practice.
 Richard Zatarga [TRS employee], in a presentation at a "Preparing for ISDN"
 conference in Toronto (12/88), said TRS now avoids identifying callers by name.
 "We have changed the way we answer the [telephone].  We know who they are, but
 we still hunt for information" from callers as if we had to identify them. 

Although TRS has since denied that it used ANI to identify callers by name and 
 that it received negative feedback from cardholders, sources close to the 
 project who requested anonymity said numerous users reacted unfavorably to 
 personalized greetings.  TRS "learned that you don't answer the telephone with
 the customer's name."

American Transtech, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T (and the first company to
 test ISDN Primary Rate Interface [32B+D]), processes one million calls a day,
 making it the nation's fourth largest telemarketing company.  The company does
 not, however, greet callers by name. "We could do it, but we don't want to let
 customers know we can capture their telephone number," said a spokesman. "We 
 don't use [specialized greetings] because it would intimidate callers." 

Besides the RISK of alienating customers with ANI, there is a pervasive fear 
 among prospective ANI implementors that callers will raise legal objections to
 ANI once they know how it works.  People with unlisted phone numbers are 
 expected to spearhead that movement. 

According to Huel Halliburton, a communications manager with Centel Electric, 
 central office switches equipped to support equal access deliver the phone 
 numbers of callers with both listed and unlisted telephone numbers to 
 companies that use ANI.

J M Hicks' contribution on Central Locking Systems (RISKS 8.55) brings to mind
many other potential dangers of electrical control in autos. Most of these I
have seen discussed at various times within this forum, but there is one in
particular which concerns me.

Electric windows are becoming ubiquitous on new cars today, and unlike central
locking systems, there is no manual override. This is made very obvious by the
fact that such windows cannot be raised after the ignition has been turned off,
which is in itself a rather annoying attribute.

However, annoyance turns to danger when an emergency arises. In an auto
accident causing the doors to jam closed, the windows are the only means of
escape when waiting for a cutting crew could be fatal. Furthermore, it is well
known that the windows provide the best (only?) means of escape from a car
underwater. If the electrical system is shot, and the occupant is unable to
break the windows, what other options are there?

Certainly electric windows provide a great convenience in everyday driving, but
I wonder how many people consider the risks when they choose their options on a
new car. And I wonder if the auto manufacturers themselves realise the risks
and are merely cutting costs because nobody voices concern.

This morning, walking in a public area of a building, I noticed a messenger or
computer operator ahead of me in the same corridor casually wheeling an open
cart loaded with about a dozen tapes. Suddenly, he left his cart in front of an
overhead door, walked on about 50 feet to the next door off the corridor, and
disappeared. Curious, I waited in the vicinity of the cart to see what would
happen next. Some 30-60 seconds later, the overhead door opened, and the clerk
appeared from behind, pulled the cart in, and closed the overhead door again.
I continued on my way, with a few questions turning over in my mind:

1) What if someone had made off with a tape or two while the cart was
   unattended?

2) Why wasn't the messenger accompanied by, say, a security guard with a radio?
   The guard could have watched the cart while the messenger went to open the
   door. Also, this precaution would avoid the risk of the messenger being
   attacked by a gang (2 or 3 would be enough to steal a tape or two) while
   passing through the public areas.

3) Why weren't the tapes in an enclosed box, locked with a key at the beginning
   of the trip, and unlocked with a duplicate at the destination. (The
   messenger, of course, should not carry a key!) This would prevent tapes from
   disappearing or being substituted while in transit.

4) Do people still do stupid things like this in 1989? (Yes!)

The following editorial appeared in the 1 April 1989 issue of FLIGHT
INTERNATIONAL.  It seems to indicate that a bevy of old, controversial issues
are bubbling to the forefront again:  technical training for pilots, cross-type
ratings, cockpit design, EROPS reliability, and computer-assisted information
systems.

  In the hours that followed the crash of a British Midland Airways Boeing
  737-400 on Britain's M1 motorway, the airline industry harbored fears that
  the accident held terrible significance for the burgeoning business of flying
  twinjets for long distances over water.

  Dual engine failure was soon ruled out as a cause of the British Midland
  crash, but with last week's publication of its special bulletin on the
  accident, the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch has raised
  new issues with equal significance to extended- range operations (EROPS). ...

  What possible significance can the crash of a short-haul airliner on a hop
  from London to Belfast have to the safety of aircraft crossing and recrossing
  the world's oceans?

  While the AAIB's special bulletin makes no attempt to determine the
  accident's cause, or to apportion blame, it details a sequence of events
  which could easily have occurred in mid-ocean, with equally disastrous
  results.

  The sequence begins with the failure of a fan blade in the 737's left
  engine, producing symptoms which the crew wrongly diagnosed as a problem with
  the right engine.  Those symptoms included vibration, plus smoke and the
  smell of burning carried by the air conditioning in the cockpit.
 
  After examining systems recovered from the crashed aircraft, the AAIB is
  certain that the cockpit instruments correctly indicated severe vi- bration
  in the left engine.  Investigators note, however, that pilots distrust
  aircraft engine vibration indicators, based on experience with earlier
  electromechanical instruments.  Crews seem unaware that electronic indicators
  on later 737-300's and the 737-400 are more accurate.

  Another example of mythology triumphing over knowledge is the apparent
  perception among 737 crews that cockpit air conditioning comes solely from
  the right engine, and that smoke and burning smells in the cockpit tend to
  indicate fire in the right engine.  In fact, air supplied to the cockpit
  comes from both engines, in a 70:30 right: left mix.

  Whether either of these misconceptions played a part in the British Midlands
  crash is not addressed in the AAIB's special bulletin, but FLIGHT understands
  that accident investigators have become increasingly concerned at the level
  of technical knowledge expected of airline pilots.

  The issue of technical knowledge takes on new significance in a two-crew
  twinjet flying 1200 nm from the nearest airport.  Theoretically, the
  information systems in modern widebody airliners should provide the crew with
  everything they need to know, and prompt them to take timely and correct
  actions to cope with any emergency.  This assumes that the crew understands,
  and trusts, what the system tells them, however.

  In mid-ocean, a high degree of mutual man-machine trust is essential.
  Information supplied to the crew must be trustworthy--and be known to be
  trustworthy--and knowledge must triumph over crew mythology.  That means
  better technical training for pilots.  The alternative for safe EROPS is to
  reintroduce that much-maligned breed, the flight engineer.

  Three months after the M1 crash, the AAIB is still piecing together what
  happened on Flight BD092, despite having ready access to the crew, the
  wreckage, and good recorded flight data and cockpit voice.  It will be months
  before the final accident report is published.

  If an EROPS aircraft goes down in mid-ocean, what the cause might never be
  discovered" (sic).

A controversy is currently before Congress over a Dept. of Agriculture plan to
cut in half (from around 2000 to around 1000) the number of meat plant
government inspectors.  Part of the rationale for this change (which is being
protested by numerous consumer watchdog groups and many meat inspectors
themselves) is that a new computer system allows for very precise "targeting"
of the plants which are most likely to have problems, thusly (supposedly)
allowing for fewer visits to plants the computer considers "safe" based on
various parameters (including past history, etc.)

However, in testimony before Congress, current inspectors have (at risk to
their own jobs) testified that the computer system being used is not reliable.
Reports have indicated that it makes mistakes about even very "simple" data
items, including sending inspectors to plants when they are closed.  This
certainly doesn't raise one's hopes about the more complicated data factors the
system must also handle! One inspector pointed out how the computer forbid him
going to a particular plant because the model deemed that plant "safe".  But
based on his own knowledge, he went there anyway, and found serious food
poisoning contamination.

Most watchdog groups feel that we need MORE meat inspectors, not less.  For the
federal government to use questionable computer models as an excuse for
slashing meat inspection seems to show extremely poor judgement and a
considerable risk.

Anyone for a burger?

  [If you do eat meat, support your friendly natural meat producers.  The
  computer model undoubtably ignores growth hormones, dyes, antibiotics in
  the grain feed, etc., even at dangerous levels.  By the way, whistleblowers
  seem to deserve some anonymity, for otherwise the watchdog might get turned
  into a hotdog.  (Bribing the inspector with free drinks might be called
  `Wetting your Whistleblower'.)  PGN]

On my last vacation trip, I rented a car with "Automatic Seat Belts".  In this
particular car, at least, these have a very powerful motor and no manual
override once they start moving.  I found them really scary.

When I commented on them while returning the car, the agent said (paraphrased):
"Yeah, they're pretty bad.  We had one catch a lady's earring in the belt and
it ripped part of her ear off."

One nice thing about driving an Alfa Romeo (which has power windows) is that in
my 1978 model, a hand crank was provided as a manual override to the power
motor (the crank was stored in the glovebox).  The newer models don't have this
feature since, according to the mechanic, the window motors just never went bad
(I'll believe him - my 1987 has had *nothing* go wrong anywhere on the entire
vehicle).

Of course, in the event of a water landing, I will simply pop the roof and
punch out vertically.  And they tell me the Alfa isn't a practical car! :-)

&gt; It should be borne in mind, however, that Thoreau was speaking of the
&gt; tables calculated by HUMAN calculators, not machines.  ...

Agreed, the tables were computed by humans, but then, who writes software, who
designs hardware?   :-)

The general issue is:  What are the risks involved in trusting one's artifacts,
whether they are instruments, tables, computational theories, algorithms,
machines, etc.?

An article by Gary Marx, in the local weekend paper, but apparently reprinted
from The Christian Science Monitor, discusses the trend towards TV news shows
using videos filmed by amateurs with video recorders. The article, entitled
"\Bold{Cower!} You're on candid camcorder" in the local edition, mentions
several points quite familiar to long-standing RISKS readers (eg, "It is
possible to create images not found in reality and to mix real and imaginary
images,"), but is interested as one of few publically newspaper articles that
concern themselves specifically with the risks to privacy that technology can
easily bring about. Some parts extracted from the article:

 'Information technology in private hands can offer documentation and
alternative views. [...]
  Without appropriate policies, there is a danger of creating a group of
journalistic vigilantes who will offer fraudulent or contrived news, invade
privacy, and debase the quality of television news. [...]
  Camcorders are at least visible, but tiny hand-held video cameras the size
of a deck of cards can also be purchased along with cameras hidden in picture
frames, mirrors, briefcases, and even books.
  Our lives may increasingly become episodes in someone's version of
\it{Candid Camera}. [...]
  Video cameras must be considered alongside other potentially invasive
information technologies such as miniature voice-activated tape recorders,
devices for remotely monitoring telephone and room conversations, computer
dossiers, electronic location monitors, and drug testing. [...]
  These new technologies are likely neither to be as harmless as advocates
claim nor as dangerous as critics fear. Their impact will be determined not by
anything inherent in the technology but by the choices we make. "

     -- The Ottawa Citizen, Sat. Apr. 8, 1989, pg B6

Surveillance in America}. ...]

&gt;  (my 2m HT has) just 3 watts and a rubber ducky... very inefficient

  Well, it may not be really efficient at getting your signal anywhere far, but
a short antenna like that can have very high RF voltages present. I know my
Kenwood TR-2600 (1 or 3 Watts between 144-148 MHZ) would easily reset the
telephone on my desk before we upgraded to a Rolm system, which appears to be
resistant. It isn't the power that upsets electronic devices - it usually is
the voltage. There may be parts of an electronic control which resonate at high
frequencies, and therefore build up large levels of voltage, enough to force a
low logic level high, etc. It is hard to foresee that in the design of a system
which is intended to operate at much lower frequencies.

  The Otis 401, though it did malfunction, also detected the malfunction before
doing anything dangerous. This is a case where the designer could not prevent
RF from upsetting the controls, but did build a mechanism to gracefully cope
with the upset. Even if the control was encased in an RF tight box (which would
likely increase the cost significantly), the ability to cope with RF or EMI
induced upset must be there. Since it isn't often that the control will be
inundated with RF at close range, the design need really only cope the
infrequent case that upset occurs.

 Heard on BBC radio Parliamentary report this morning. At question time a
Member of Parliament stated that the Police at Hillsborough based their
decisions to open a gate on the computerized tally from the turnstiles that
indicated the ground had ample space to take more people. The government's
plans to make computerized turnstiles compulsory increases the risk that a
computer failure or error could result in another tragedy in the future.  The
government where asked to reconsider their plans in the light of recent events.

        Excerpted from "MP demands probe into burglaries," by Tim
Harper, _Toronto Star_, We 19 Apr 89, p. A13:

  OTTAWA - A New Democrat MP has asked for an investigation of a series of
  "high quality break-ins" at his office and those of 4 environmental and peace
  groups.  Jim Fulton said yesterday the break-ins preceded the grilling of a
  senior defense department scientist in a probe to flush out the person who
  leaked information about nerve-gas testing in Alberta ...  No one was
  arrested and the RCMP have rejected any link.

  Kirk Roberts, a spokesman for the Ontario Environment Network on Spadina
  Ave., said thieves who ransacked the office Jan. 13 stole equipment but
  ignored a personal computer valued at $3500.  The thieves, Roberts said, were
  interested in stealing data tapes that included correspondence among some 100
  Canadian environmental groups ...

  In a letter to Fulton about the break-ins, RCMP Commissioner Norman Inkster
  wrote, "Our enquiries into this matter have not uncovered any evidence to
  suggest the incidents were linked or conducted by any organized group of
  individuals."

I spoke with Kirk Roberts this afternoon.  "I've got to get hold of this
article," he said.  "I don't know what the thieves were _interested_ in, but
they in fact did steal all of our backup tapes, except for the ones we keep
off-site."
        OEN uses a WEB system, which provides dialup connections to 47
countries and affords full email/messaging functions.  The system utilizes
120MB tape cassette backups.  "The system does afford an encryption option for
users who want to use it," said Roberts.  "But the thing is, none of the stuff
on those tapes was what you would call particularly sensitive.  If any
reasonable request had been made for items on those tapes, we would probably
have supplied them.  As an environmental organization we do things, and _want_
things done, publically.  That these tapes were stolen says more about the
thieves' paranoia than about the tapes' contents."
        OEN has only suffered the one break-in so far, said Roberts.
Jim Fulton's Parliament Hill office has, however, he hears, been
burgled four times.

This year, for the first time, students voting in the student elections here at
Stanford University aren't using paper ballets or voting machines.  They're
using Macintosh computers.

People have been making quite a big deal out of this.  The papers report that
state officials are observing the process.  Past student elections have been
plagued with administrative bungles, which the computers are supposed to help
prevent.  The whole thing is quite important to the people who are
administrating it -- one would think that they've been extremely careful....

I went to vote today.  After I had cast all of my votes, a window appeared
asking me if I now wanted to make my selections permanent.  Seemed reasonable
enough.  But there was only one possible response to click on: "No".  As this
wasn't the response I was hoping to make, I hit return and clicked a few times
and the window went away and then it came back again.  This time there were two
possible responses: "Yes" and "No".  I selected "Yes", confident that my votes
were being accurately recorded.

(I'll leave it to others to report on the numerous machines out of service, and
the long queues at the ones in service, and the complete lack of privacy, and
....)

  [While this system is a nice advance in letting the voter review the ballot,
  the problems of system integrity, assurance of nontampering, ballot privacy,
  etc. are largely ignored.  It is certainly a worthwhile experiment, and will
  provide challenges for system penetrators and authorized programmers who want
  to rig elections.  Some of the problems that will need to be overcome have
  been discussed extensively in the reports by Roy Saltman, Lance Hoffman, and
  others mentioned in earlier RISKS.  PGN]

We had one in our high school, similar to a combination of the above [described
in RISKS 8.57].  Each student had an 8 digit number (birthday, plus 2 digits
for repeats; never mind the RISKS in that!), and the 2nd period class would
fill out a little bubble sheet, which had `present,' `excused,' `absent,' and
`tardy.'  These would then be scanned, processed, and an absent child would
have his (or her) parents called that evening.  A child who was tardy for more
than 3 days in a row, or for more than 20 days in a semester, would also have
her (or his) parents called.

I should mention that I grew up in a largely hispanic neighborhood, and they
never did figure out how to handle the cases where the parents understood only
English or Spanish (they tried English only, didn't work; tried Spanish only,
my mother threw a fit 8-)).  Nor did they take answering machines into
account...

Oh, of course, an obvious RISK:  the computer originally was called up by a
central computer in LA (Los Angelos) to send various reports.  It took me and
my cohorts 2 weeks to find out the number of the computer, after which we
demonstrated how much we could screw up the system merely by calling repeatedly
(keeping it busy) (yes, we told people what we were doing; they didn't believe
us till we showed them [they were present when we were doing it, ok? 8-)]).
Shortly after that, they changed to having the computer call LA, which was a
number we never did figure out...

  In response to the recent post on the dangers of automatic seatbelts:

One day, while my father and I drove along in a rental car (I believe a Subaru)
with automatic seatbelts, he saw that he'd caught his coat in the car door.  Of
course, being me, I dared him to open it and see if it fell out.  He opened the
door, and much to our surprise, the seatbelt opened, all while happily motoring
along at about 40.  Later that day I looked it over and saw that the
seatbelt-opener used a simple pressure switch that could have been lifted
intact from any refrigerator-light mechanism.  Needless to say, this is VERY
dangerous.  Scenario:

John and his buddies go for a ride.  Being saftey-concious, He owns a car with
auto-seatbelts.  Unfortunately, they need them.  They are sideswiped by a giant
Mack truck.  More unfortunately, the driver's side door _pops open_. This 
triggers the seatbelt-release mechanism, John hits the windshield and...

Not fun, huh?  Well, at least it looks like such seatbelt improvements may be 
obsoleted by the new $30 airbags... I hope.

I found this is a SunSpots Digest we received today (v229). [How do you stick
your thumb in to check how full a file system is? :-) ]       Walter Roberson

&gt; Date:    Tue, 28 Mar 89 07:45:08 CST
[...]
&gt; I know that once I was unpleasantly surprised when I planned on a 512 MB
&gt; file systems size and calculated what that should be in terms of sectors
&gt; and cylinders on my disk. I figured that 512 MB = 512 * 1024 * 1024 =
&gt; 536,870,912 bytes. When I made the file system, I found out it was not 512
&gt; Mb (from the output of newfs). Working backwards, I found that Sun used
&gt; 512 Mb = 512 * 1000 * 1000, which makes [sense] to me since I am a
&gt; mechanical engineer, but we all found it confusing.

Summarized from a story by Gregory Crouch in the `Los Angeles Times',
18-April-89:  

A whistle-blower alleges that Litton Systems designed a company software system
to under-record the computer usage of Litton's commercial clients, causing the
federal government to be over-charged.  Former Litton employee James Carton has
filed suit after concluding that Litton rigged its computer billing service to
over-charge the government more than $25 million between 1983 and 1988 for
computer work on hundreds of defense contracts.  Late last month, the U.S.
Justice Dept. announced that it has taken over Carton's suit.  With fines for
every instance of over-charging and treble damages, the total could reach $175
million.  Under the False Claims Act, Carton stands to receive 15% to 30% of
any damages awarded to the government.

Litton denies the charges, claiming it saved the government money by letting
commercial customers use the same computers.

While writing an assigned report on the profitability of Litton's computer
services, Carton noticed that most of the commercial customers, accounting for
more than half of the data center's revenue, were actually costing the company
money.  One company was charged for using two disk drives when it actually was
using three.  At the same time, the government was being overcharged.  He
discovered and reported more discrepancies, but, more than a year later,
nothing had changed.  He finally decided to file suit.

&gt;From "World Press Review," May 1989, quoting "Wirtschaftswoche," Duesseldorf:

    A "black box," or data recorder, for cars is being developed by a
    consortium in West Germany. The size of two cigarette packs, it
    will cost $215 and record changes of direction, the status of lights
    and turn signals, steering-wheel and pedal positions, and even whether
    the radio is on. Every 30 seconds new data will be stored on a
    microchip; in an accident, this data will freeze, and later information
    will continue to be recorded...

            [Once again, there is a serious question as to the integrity of
            the data in the recorder.  In a court of law, we have the problem
            that the data may not be what was recorded in real-time...  PGN]

Summary: Finding risks can be risky.

  [The foregoing discussion] raises a computer version of a well-known risk:
that of testing for errors.  (Not to mention the risk of finding and/or
reporting them!)

  Almost any test of any piece of equipment is definable as trying to make the
equipment fail.
	If it does fail, the person doing the testing is liable
        to civil or criminal penalties.  

	If it does not, she risks being subject to lesser penalties 
        for trying to make the equipment fail.

	This is an interesting double-bind (well, 1.5-bind actually) that can
be used to discourage testing of potentially dangerous things.  Because it
typically requires some kind of legal protection for the tester, it is often
held to be something only a government should do.  Yet if it is, then we are
faced with finding out how to test the testers who are acting as our agents...

	It can also make ordinary people reluctant to run **necessary** tests.

	Well before the Internet Worm of yore, I executed a uucp-test program
named "virus" that informed system managers if their security was unnaturally
low.  As you might guess, some were concerned.  Regrettably, some took
exception to the fact that the test was done **at all**, and called upon my
management to ensure that their opinions would be made known to me.  (In my
Honeywell days this sort of thing was known as a "career killer").

	In fairness I should point out that some people knew a test program
on sight and publicly defended the test, the program and myself. (Thanks,
Dave and Erich!)

	Nevertheless, the chilling effects were real.  And the problem of
protecting the testers is still outstanding.

John Luce's comments on the design goals of electronic elevators certainly
raised the level of my knowledge about them. I would like to offer some
comments:

1) Automatic systems should not outguess the user and do unexpected things
   without an explanation at the time of occurrence. I am referring to the fact
   that, after the doors are held open for a length of time, a car sometimes
   has to go to a specific place to initialise itself. This behaviour is
   disconcerting, and can be frightening to a person who is afraid of
   elevators. The recorded announcement could be used to tell the user what is
   happening and thus reassure him.

   Arbitrarily cancelling the buttons inside the car is not foolproof. What
   about a group of small children, each going to a different floor? How
   would a blind user know about the cancellation? A better solution would
   be a specially-shaped button inside the car (maybe you'd pull instead of
   push) that would allow someone getting in an car with no-one inside to
   to cancel the uselessly selected floors.

   Sometimes it's desirable to be able to select a floor that's in the wrong
   direction. For example, in many buildings, especially apartments, the call
   buttons outside only go one way (down). For a trip upward, you have no
   choice but to select the wrong way. Also, if a large number of people
   (several cars full) want to make the same trip, it is useful for people in
   the first cars to send them back for more.

2) The elevator manufacturer was wrongly blamed for features that were the
   building owner's responsibility. I have yet to see an elevator where the
   division of responsibility is spelled out for the user (e.g. a sign saying
   "If you have any comments or complaints about the audio announcements,
   please contact _______, and not Otis."

An article by Jim Schachter in the 'Los Angeles Times' 19-April-89 is headlined
U.S. INDUSTRY DOES A POOR JOB OF PROTECTING PRIVACY, STUDY SHOWS.  Univ. of
Ill. Prof. David Linowes chaired the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission more
than a decade ago.  He has now released a new study showing just how little
attention has been paid to the commission's conclusions and just how much
ground has been lost.  He urges Congress to act.  Prof. Harley Shaiken of UC
San Diego calls for "applying the standards of the Bill of Rights to the
workplace."

Linowes says outdated, inaccurate records are being used to make critical
decisions about hiring and promotions.  "This information is never destroyed,
and it's obtainable instantaneously."  State and federal privacy laws remain a
patch-quilt, and advances in computer and telecommunications technology have
increased data collection and analysis.

According to the new survey of major corporations, 38% still have no policy on
releasing employee records to government agencies, and 57% do not tell
employees what records about them are maintained.  42% gather data about
workers without telling them, and 57% hire private investigators to probe
employees' or job applicants' backgrounds.

A sidebar lists PRINCIPLES OF A 'FAIR INFORMATION' POLICY:

  1.  Minimize intrusiveness.  Don't collect more data than is necessary.
  2.  Maximize fairness.  Let the subject know what information is being
      collected and why.
  3.  Establish an enforceable expectation of privacy.  Provide recourse
      if privacy is violated.

The serious security problem that was reported in Risks Volume 8, Issue 15
has been corrected by Sun.  Sun support and Sun's field offices are now able
to supply a new set of programs that will solve the problem.  We strongly
recommend contacting Sun A.S.A.P.

Until you receive the new programs from Sun,  we suggest that you change the
protection of the login program.

	chmod 2750 login

This will allow login to continue to work but removes users access to it.

Since we do not have a Sun 386i system at CERT, we were unable to test the
new programs being supplied by Sun.  Field reports indicate that the new
programs do solve the problem.

When using floppies, the user is generally led to beleive that nothing can
happen to alter a floppy that lacks the notch giving permission to write. In
actual fact, this is not the case. For example, the APPLE II inplemented the
protection of diskettes in software. Worse still, in the case of the APPLE, was
a failure (observed by the author on at least two systems) of the drive
electronics whereby the heads would be "on' continually, and thus degauss
random spots on the floppy (while the head was moving) and all of one track
(when the head stopped moving, generally on the boot track!) on any disk
inserted! At an Apple club here in Montreal, members were warned to try their
Apple with a working diskette with no critical files, then a backup copy of
that if the first failed, then to DO NOTHING ELSE if neither worked. That way,
at worst you would only risk degaussing two virgin copies of a working disk,
and not, say, a $300 copy-protected software package or irreplacable data.  I
had always thought the problem was unique to the Apple. However, the following
item, from Info-IBMPC Digest, shows that this is not the case.  Do RISKS
readers know of other systems that are not protected at the hardware level?
What about 3 1/2 "rigid floppies"? What about magnetic tapes? Cassettes?

  Subject: Possible to write to a "Write Protected" Disk

  In reference to the sure fire cure for viris problems using a bootable
  disk in drive A which is "write protected".  This write protection is
  performed in software at some level.  It is possible "At least on a Real
  IBM-AT 6mhz, first rom revision" to write directly to the disk and bypass
  the write protect mechanism.  I do not know how it was done but I know
  that it can be done, I ran across someone who had written this code so as
  to be able to write on disks with no notch cut in them...

Today's Toronto Star also has an article about the SkyDome.  That's the
city's new stadium, the world's first with a retractable roof using rigid
segments.  According to the article, when the stadium opens this summer,
the roof will operate at 1/3 speed, taking an hour to open.  And the reason
for this is that the computer programs to work it aren't ready and a
"smaller" version will be in use.

        The "information break-ins" story posted two days ago has become
front-page news in the *Toronto Star* today ("Who stole files in mystery
break-ins?" by Tim Harper, Fr 21 April 89. p. A1).  Here is a chronology,
extracted from the article:

21 Nov 88 - University of Toronto campus offices of Science for Peace:
     floppy disk containing membership address list, financial records,
     correspondence, drafts of communiques, and a work in progress by George
     Ignatieff, former chancellor of the university and Canadian UN
     ambassador, on the use of chemical weapons.  Nothing else touched.

13 Jan 89 - Ontario Environmental Network, 456 Spadina Ave.: In addition to
     the backup tapes referred to yesterday, there were about 300 floppies and
     a few PC's removed as well.  Curiously, the most valuable PC in the room
     was untouched; it, however, had no data on its hard disk.  The others,
     which did, were the ones taken.

17-19 Feb 89 - Canadian Environmental Law Association, 243 Queen St. West: A
     computer and a small amount of cash was stolen.

6 Mar 89 - Office of Hon. Jim Fulton, MP, Houses of Parliament, Ottawa: File
     on alleged open-air testing of chemical weapons at CFB Suffield in
     Alberta was rifled, contents possibly photocopied (Fulton keeps a
     high-speed photocopier in his office).  Fulton says on 3 previous
     occasions he had noticed "evidence of break-ins," but had simply
     attributed the disorder to cleaning staff or new staff members.  Two days
     after this break-in, Dr. Celso Mendoza, a specialist in biomedical
     defense employed in monitoring safety standards at CFB Suffield, was
     grilled for several hours by DND officials in a motel room in Medicine
     Hat, Alta. According to Mendoza, he was accused of "leaking politically
     embarrassing information to members of Parliament."  In addition, a
     report has been circulated amongst Mendoza's colleagues accusing him of
     professional incompetence.  Mendoza is preparing to sue the federal
     government over what he calls "constant harassment" by the DND.

10 April 89 - Green Party of Canada, Vancouver office: Disks holding
     membership lists were stolen.  No other equipment, including a stereo and
     a photocopier, was touched.

        Yesterday Canadian Solicitor-General Pierre Blais, having previously
claimed there was no link between the break-ins, said that he would order RCMP
Commissioner Norman Inkster (who has also denied a link) to investigate the
possibility of one.  Blais also said he would speak to the minister for
National Defense, Bill McKnight, about the questioning of Dr. Mendoza.  "These
are serious allegations made by Mr. Fulton," said Blais.  "They are already in
the press and it's a very serious matter."

        Said Fulton: "If five branches of the Toronto-Dominion Bank had been
mugged in the last couple of months with the same kind of modus operandi, the
same kind of files being rifled, ... there would be a major investigation
going on.  The names and addresses of tens of thousands of Canadians have been
taken in these break-ins."

        All of the thefts remain unsolved.  According to Sergeant Len Paris of
the University of Toronto police force, "Thefts of items under $1000 don't
attract a lot of police attention."

Today's Toronto Star has an article about a person who's been getting 17
telephone books delivered to his house each year for the past 5 years.  The
computer's role in this should be obvious.  And I suppose it's not for the
delivery people to say how many directories should be delivered to a particular
place, just because it looks like a residence...

The Star says the victim says Bell Canada says he's actually supposed to be
getting *22* phone books.

The directory has 2,084 pages and extra copies cost $20 (Canadian).    [each?]

According to a recent article in the Marin Independent-Journal, authorities 
were monitoring ATM transactions to trace the movements of accused killer
Ramon Salcido.  In addition to simply monitoring ATM use, his line of credit
was changed to "unlimited" since authorities were afraid that he might become
violent if he couldn't get money because he had exceeded his limit.

Boston U. has been using computers (Macs) to tally votes both this year and
last.  Many of the issues you mentioned have been, if not completely dealt
with, at least started on:

The vote tally program is written in HyperCard.  The keyboard (which is used to
enter college and residence information for the non-University wide positions)
is kept by the computer's owner (who is an official member of the student
election process at that point).  The mouse is used to check off votes, and
when the user is finished, they leave.  With only a mouse (and a limited number
of buttons to use) it's hard to do much to the system by way of changing votes
or crashing it... and privacy is kept by having the screen turned AWAY from the
computer's owner while voting.  There are, however, still some RISKS involved.

First is that of disk crashes.  This happened this year--a certain number of
votes were unreadable.  (The student newspaper didn't give details, so I can't
report on those.)  They were not enough to have affected the Student Union
race, though it's possible that they might have changed some college or
residence races (no, I don't know for certain).  An unscrupulous programmer may
very well change votes, or the computer's owner could pull something (if
they're technically capable--which isn't much with HyperCard).

The second is the RISK to the Mac user interface standard posed by the
untrained (at least in Apple's guidelines) programmer.  Not that this is a
major RISK on the order of 767 fuel gauges, but it had a tendency to confuse
me--precisely BECAUSE I use a Macintosh so often.

In Risks 8.58, an article noted problems with assuming the correctness of
time output by radio controlled clocks.  I've a couple of notes on the subject
and I speak as a designer of one such clock, Precision Standard Time's
"Time Source".

1. The operator at WWV has been known to forget to set or reset the Daylight
Savings Time switch on the time code generator in Colorado.  We discovered
this because we were looking at the transmitted signal the day DST was 
supposed to start.  When we received Hawaii (WWVH), the bit was set and when
we received Colorado (WWV), it wasn't.  We called WWV and asked what the
problem was; they were rather abashed.

To solve this, PSTI is building new time code generators for WWV which will
automate almost the entire task.  Human intervention will be required to set
the start and stop dates for DST, and to notify the time code generator of
pending leap seconds, and the (very simple) software will take it from there.
The design of the new time code generators, in both hardware and software, is
intended to be very simple, so we can have a hope of correctness.  This, of
course, assumes the microprocessor and other VLSI chips we are using are, in
fact, correct.  Naturally, the hardware is triply-redundant.  The software,
however, is not, so common-mode failures will not be prevented.

2. Radio clocks are not perfect.  Even if the software is bug-free, and the
hardware is glitch-free (neither of which hold in practice), two major holes
still exist: WWV, WWVH, WWVB, and, I believe, GOES, have no error detection or
correction capability.  It is possible for a radio clock to receive false radio
data due to noise.  In the PSTI clock, I put in a sophisticated algorithm to
try and reject false data, but it is probabilistic: there is a chance the clock
will output the wrong time.  Most likely, an incorrect output will be wildly
wrong, so host systems can reject it as bogus, reset the clock (or let it
correct itself when "good" data overpowers the "bad"), and continue.
Furthermore, if you are using a radio clock as a security measure, you should
be aware how easy it is to falsify WWV, WWVH, and WWVB.  For testing the PSTI
clock, we built a WWV simulator, using the guts of another clock, and three
555-based oscillators.  Hooking this into the modulation input of our
venerable, WW-II vintage signal generator, we were able to create radio signals
just like, but more powerful than, WWV and WWVH, and thence to fool the clock.
This was great for testing, so we could check behavior of DST start/stop,
propagation delay changes, year rollover, leap second insertion/deletion, and
so on.  But if you are using a radio clock for security, be warned that someone
in a van outside your building can trivially fake the signal.

I bet the GPS satellite time signals contain error detection codes, if not
error correction, which ought to reduce false time output to a minimum, but
won't stop a bad person from faking the time.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get anyone interested in modifying the WWV/WWVH code
to include a public-key encipherment approach, so that if the clock can decode
the signal, the signal must have come from WWV/WWVH.

No software hackery is necessary.  Simply open up the disk drive and tape the
switch closed or put something opaque in the path of the light sensor.  I once

In Risks 8.61, David M. Zielke and Peter Jones point out vulnerabilities of
current write protect mechanisms.  Specifically, they say that write
protection is done at a software level on some microcomputers, including
Apple IIs and (at least some) IBM PCs.

There was a heavily debated discussion on PC write protection mechanisms on the
VIRUS-L forum not too long ago.  The outcome was this: I looked at the IBM ROM
listing and saw that the ROM was attempting a write (via the hardware disk
drive controller) and *then* checking to see if there was an error status
returned.  Furthermore, two of our students, Richard Baum and John Hunt,
checked the circuit diagrams of the original IBM PC floppy disk drives and
determined that, indeed, the write protection mechanism was in hardware.  Now,
assuming that the write protect sensor is correctly determining the presence of
a write protect tab, we concluded that no disk writes could occur.

It may or may not be different on other PC models (such as the AT that David
Zielke refers to), but the IBM PC floppy disk write protection is done in
hardware.  I invite anyone to prove otherwise by providing me (or Risks) with a
piece of code that can verifyably write to a write protected PC disk on a
machine whose write protect mechanism is functioning.

Recently, a posting appeared in RISKS which claimed that the Apple write-
protection is implemented in software.  Wrong.  Take it from me; I
unfortunately know everything about the Apple ][+.  Write-protection is
implemented in hardware.  Software routines are used to _detect_
write-protection.  You can remove these routines and fool the operating system
into thinking that it has written to a write-protected disk, but it has not.
(In fact, I have performed this test under DOS 3.3 with a 5.25" drive.)
It is possible that 3.5" drives might not have write-protection, just
a tab detector, but I doubt it.  It costs almost nothing to do it in hardware.
I attribute the claim that IBM drives do not implement it in hardware to the
fact that the IBM is a shoddy conservative machine which can't even scroll
the screen without flashing, and whose designers cannot compare to the Woz
(who also designed the ][ 5.25" drive).  But then, nobody can.

Apple drives sometimes destroy write-protected disks, but those cases are due
to hardware problems.

Here is the reply to Mr. Zielke's letter that I sent to the IBM PC list. Since
you chose to post his (uninformed) message, I think it would be a good idea
to post my reply as well to aleviate some of the (totally baseless) fear and
anxiety it might generate.

The technical reference to the Real IBM AT ('Personal computer AT high Capacity
Diskette Drive', Aug. 31, 1984, pp. 7&amp;8) clearly shows that the drive won't
write unless the write protect sensor sees a hole. The protection is not in the
software (DOS or BIOS) and not in the FDC firmware. It is done in the drive's
hardware. If you want to write to disks with no notch in them, you have to
disable the write protect sensor---a minor operation, but more than just
writing some code. It requires a screwdriver. I suggest that you confirm this
with your friend.

There was a long discussion in the virus list about whether the write
protection on IBM PC is hardware or software; you may want to dig up its
archive to read the sometimes heated discussion (Mac users stating that they
know nothing about PCs but someone told them that only DOS calls check for
write protection and BIOS calls will write irrespective of the notch; cheapo
non-IBM drives that ignore black and/or mirror tabs; etc).

The question was settled for good in virus-l, and I hope there's no need for
every un/misinformed user to submit his 2 bits worth to RISKS.

&gt;... Do RISKS
&gt;readers know of other systems that are not protected at the hardware level?

It depends on what you mean by "at the hardware level".  Almost any system with
multiple heads (this includes most modern disk and tape) will find it difficult
to run the final write signal to the heads via the write-protect switch.  Any
other scheme introduces electronics between the switch and the heads, and those
electronics can fail.  Also, said electronics may well include firmware in
microcontroller chips -- is this "hardware" protection?  That aside, everything
I'm familiar with does the write-protect check at a level where user
programming can't affect it... but what horrors microcomputer companies will
perpetrate to save a few cents, only they and their customers can tell.  (As
witness the original IBM PC monochrome monitor, which software could burn out
by setting control registers improperly -- IBM borrowed the monitor from an
earlier product which wasn't user-programmable.)

I do not know what sort of Apple-]['s are used in Montreal, but mine certainly
does have disk write protection in both hardware and software.  Back in the
days when Apple published schematics (before they made Macintoshes), their DOS
manual contained schematics of both the disk controller card and the disk drive
analog board.  The analog board sits inside the disk drive and controls, among
other things, the voltage applied to the erase head.  The schematic shows that
the write protect signal from the switch that senses the notch in the diskette
is used to gate the write request signal from the controller, thus providing
(in the absence of hardware failure) a non-overrideable write inhibit.  The
write protect signal was also provided to the controller card, where the
software could query the write protect status of the drive.

  Of course, many Apple owners were not afraid of modifying their hardware, and
one particularly popular modification was to install an external write enable
switch that bypassed the notch switch, or to disable the write protection
entirely.  This saved the user from having to cut notches in order to use the
reverse side of single-sided diskettes.

In digest #8.61 it is reported that it is possible for software to defeat the
"write protection" notch on 5.25" disks, on both Apple and IBM disk drives.

I can not speak for all disk drive manufacturers, but in the case of the Apple
drives, the information reported in the article is totally incorrect.  Apple
5.25" disk drives use an electro-mechanical switch that prevents writing to the
disk unless the "write protect" notch is unobstructed.

It is possible to defeat the software "sensing" of the write-protect switch,
but it is not possible to defeat the switch itself from software.  If this is
done, the only effect will be that the appropriate error message will not be
presented to the user.  The drive still can not write to the disk. Depending
on how the software changes were made, there still may be an error message
generated, when the O/S is unable to "verify" the supposedly written data.

It is still possible to destroy a disk though, given the right combination of
hardware failures.  In that case, the procedure recommended by the users
group would be perfectly valid, and a very good idea.  After all, if the
hardware has failed to the extent of destroying disks, it makes good sense to
test it on disks that you can afford to lose -- not your only copy of that
$500 program that helps keep your business running.

Of course, a competent hardware person can just ........     :-)

                BOEING 737 PROBLEMS REACH FRESH HEIGHTS
            by John Kavanagh, Computer Weekly, 6 April 1989

Autopilot computer systems on Boeing 737s have been hit by a problem which has
caused aircraft to change height without warning.  It is believed that full
details of the problem have been requested by the investigators into the crash
of the British Midland 737 on the M1 motorway in January. One theory is that
the crew were misled by cockpit instruments.

Six incidents have been recorded by British Airways on its aircraft but the
company says there has never been any danger because the crews have always
checked the autopilot actions against other cockpit instruments.

Boeing and Honeywell Avionics, manufacturer of the autopilot system, have
alerted airlines using the 540-plus aircraft affected.  "We have been working
with the airlines and the regulatory autthorities to fix the problem." Boeing
says.

The problem occurs after a pilot enters a new height to the autopilot.  The
system displays the instruction, but under certain circumstances the aircraft
moves to a different height and the autopilot then displays the new reading.

One senior British Airways captain says the autopilot seems to use instructions
entered earlier, even as long ago as the previous flight.

British Airways has called the problem "random memory initiation" and says it
is caused by unexpected electromagnetic conditions such as lightning, strong
radar signals, or an electrical power surge.  Boeing says it has no evidence of
any accidents occurring because of the problems.

                   Cockpit Computers Defy Pilots
              By David Learmount, Air Transport Editor
                (From Flight International, 4/8/89)

Airliners have levelled out at incorrect flight levels as a result of flight
management computers overriding pilot instructions.  This results from a
phenomenon which British Airways has named random memory initialisation (RMI).
BA says that modifications it has carried out have eliminated the problem.

A line pilot has described RMI as "an increasingly common defect," although
replacement of the microchips thought to be responsible is being carried out.
The faults are most common, according to aircrew, in the early part ofa flight
after the aircraft has been on the ground for some time.  BA has experienced
problems on all of its aircraft types fitted with electronic flight management
systems.

The theory is that chips are retaining instructions which should have been
overridden by the pilots' latest entry into the flight management system.  The
earlier instructions sometimes override the current ones, changing not only
aircraft performance, but the digital display showing the effective instruction.

If the pilots are monitoring their flight management control display, they
should see the change take place, or the incorrect entry come up.  In busy
phases of flight, however, such events have been missed.

A change in selected parameter has been known to tkae place in the 737-300.  In
the glass-cockpit 757 and 767, the more likely error is that the aircraft may
fly through the set "height-acquire" flight level, or depart from the one it is
at, although the value in the "height-acquire" window remains as selected.  The
latter two events are likely to be discovered quickly beacuse the crew will be
monitoring flight level.

An airline pilot tells FLIGHT that some aircrew believe this sort of event may
be contributing to pilots' scepticism about information displayed in modern
cockpits--a human factor under investigation in the British Midlands 737
accident.  Pilots may enter one set of of information, then act on different
data which is displayed.

In one incident, a BA 737-300 on airtest out of Heathrow was cleared to descend
to flight level 80 [8,000 feet].  The crew believe they entered FL80 in
height-acquire, and saw it on the mode control display.  The aircraft levelled
at FL70, and air traffic control queried the action.  The crew saw that FL70
was entered on the "height acquire" window of the flight management mode
control panel and queried the ATC instruction.  The pilot then set FL80 on
"height-acquire" and climbed to it.  The crew then flew level for a short time
at FL80 and, while watching, saw the height-acquire display change to FL70.

Another 737-300 pilot has remarked to FLIGHT that, while dialling the
height-acquire instruction, care is necessary because the display can settle
one flight level above or below the figure entered.

BA admits to changes of these types occurring a recorded six times for a reason
classified as "transient electromagnetic condition" (TMC), which they say has
now been cleared by modification.  TMC can be induced by current surges, and it
is a well-known electronic phenomenon.  Power surges or other forms of TMC can
occur under well-recognised conditions, such as changeover from ground power
supply to aircraft generators, lightning strikes, and radar proximity.  Effects
have also occurred when the cause was not obvious.  It is not clear whether BA
references to events resulting from TMC are the same--or related to--pilot
reports of RMI detailed in BA's monthly Air Safety Review.

TMC problems have been dealt with by changes to software, hardware, and the
mode select panel.  BA says that there have been no further reports of problems
since the modifications were made.

   --------

An observation:

Modern glass cockpits (i.e., not the 757, 767, or A310) all use tape
altimeters.  Reading errors are common on such displays.  In addition, these
displays are not standardised; some scroll down to indicate increasing
altitude; some scroll up.  Some have a "highlight" window, showing current
digital altitude; some don't.  Setting errors, combined with read errors, could
be fatal.

Media observation: pilots are being increasingly portrayed as "reactionary old
fogies whose fears might actually be justified"--as if the manufacturers and
the industry, in general, are the bearers of Light and Goodness. :-)

 Many of the recent postings seem to have a lot in common.  They all deal with
some form of technological defect.  Airbus accidents blamed on faulty
computers, Audi 5000's effected by radio interferance, Elevators in which Micro
processors fail to detect open or blocked doors, fire control systems which
mis-identify civilian planes, the list goes on.

 Each of the incidents above have, of course,  another thing in common, they
were designed by humans.

 What are the risks associated with technology we don't properly understand?
As we have modernized elevators, planes, cars and fire control systems, they
seem to have become not only more complicated but more trouble prone.

 I am reminded that K(eep) I(t) S(imple) S(tupid) is perhaps something we
should reevalute by the NOVA episode "Beyond Top Gun" in which Korean war
pilots said, while flying in Vietnam, the first thing they did in a dogfight
was start turning things off starting with the back seaters' intercomm followed
by some of the warning buzzers and other techno whiz bangs.

One advantage of Winchester-type disc drives is that they are sealed against
smoke and other particulates.  Hard drives with removable media, however,
must have ``absolute'' filters, since smoke particles are larger than the
flying height of a typical disc head.  It's a fine theory to warn your
customers not to smoke, but who's going to check up on third-shift operators?

At a famous West Coast computer company where I worked in the early seventies,
the newly founded disc division had just shipped their first production drive
to the computer division for testing.  A friend of mine in Systems Integration
believed it was not his duty to coddle the equipment, but to subject it to more
typical real-world conditions.  He installed the drive, got the diagnostics
running on it, and then lit a cigar and proceeded to exhale all the smoke
directly into the disc's air intake.  SPANG---head crash.

The disc division tried to ``blame the messenger'' and wanted my
friend fired, but the computer division backed him up.  Result: by
the time this model went to real customers, it had an absolute
filtration system, and eventually proved to be quite reliable.

What do the readers of this forum think are the risks involved in using
"Standard" tools such as lex or yacc etc. in developing sensitive applications?
Is it reasonable to set some criteriaa for saying that a given tool has
withstood the test of time therefore it can be safely used?  If so what should
this criteria be?

For those of you interested an umbrella organisation has been established
in the UK to co-ordinate information on, and research into, all aspects of
computer security. In the first instance one of the organisation's primary
concerns will be combatting the threat posed by computer viruses by
acting as a clearing house for virus information and control software.

Below is a copy of an initial letter mailed to prospective members:

			The Computer Threat Research Association

The computer threat research association, CoTra is a non-profit making
organisation that exists to research, analyse, publicise and find solutions
for threats to the integrity and reliability of computer systems.

The issue that caused the formation of CoTra was the rise of the computer
virus. This problem has since become surrounded by fear, uncertainty and
doubt. To the average user the computer virus and its implications are a
worry of an unknown scale. To a few unfortunates whose systems have become 
a critical issue.

The key advantage of CoTra membership will be access to advice and information.
Advice will be provided through publications, an electronic conference (a
closed conference for CoTra's members has been created on the Compulink
CIX system) as well as other channels such as general postings direct to
members when a new virus is discovered.

CoTra membership will be available on a student, full or corporate member
basis. All software that is held by CoTra that enhances system reliability,
such as virus detection and removal software, will be available to all
members. It is intended to establish discounts with suppliers of reliability
tools and services. A library of virus sources and executables and other
dangerous research material will be made available to members who have a
demonstrable need.

A register of consultants who have specific skills in the systems reliability
field will be published by CoTra and reviews of reliability enhancing
software will be produced.

Your support of CoTra will ensure that you have the earliest and most
accurate information about potential threats to your computer systems.

CoTra, The computer threat research association,
c/o 144 Sheerstock, Haddenham, Bucks. HP17 8EX

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Part of the organisations aims is to establish reciprocal links with other
similar organisations worldwide, to facilitate the sharing of experience
and rapid flow of information on new threats.

To this end if you are involved in (or have contacts with) a similar
organisation in your country, please write to CoTra (or by email to me, 
and I will forward your correspondence) outlining your organisation 
and its aims.

Yours sincerely

  In times of emergency such as this, we suspect that such requests can be
  [used] legally by appropriate agencies without too much fuss.

Part of the problem here is not that the technique was used, but that it was
done without judicial approval.  The bank *chose* to co-operate, on the word of
the police authorities.  In this case, the situation was fairly clear.  What if
it's a foreign student who is accused of being a ``terrorist''?  Such
accusations by the government have already been thrown out of court on several
occasions.  (The student may or may not be one; that's irrelevant.)

 &gt; Unfortunately, I couldn't get anyone interested in modifying the
 &gt; WWV/WWVH code to include a public-key encipherment approach, so that
 &gt; if the clock can decode the signal, the signal must have come from WWV/WWVH.
 &gt; 						        -- David Schachter

The signal must have come from WWV/WWVH _at some time_! This would verify the
source of the signal, but not the timeliness.  Your clocks could be set back by
broadcasting a tape of WWV/WWVH.  The encipherment only solves half the problem.

DARPA PROGRAM TO BATTLE WAR ON DRUGS, TERRORISM by Gary H. Anthes

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is quietly putting together a
multimillion-dollar program to develop advanced computer technology for the
wars on drugs and terrorism.

The technology is likely to be built on a foundation of artificial intelligence
and parallel processing, and it will be applied in situations that the Defense
Department refers to as special operations/low intensity conflicts, or SO/LIC.

The new program is headed by William Marquitz, deputy director of DARPA's
Information Science and Technology Office and a veteran of the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon's command, control, communications and
intelligence unit.

According to Marquitz, much data that could be useful in counternarcotics and
counterterrorism --- for tracking currency, cargo shipments and phone call
patterns, for instance --- is readily available.  But the government has
generally has not brought to bear fast computers that can examine trillions of
bits of information per day and smart software able to distill out the tiny
amounts of useful information. ...

One agency with a small research budget is the Drug Enforcement Administration.
According to Marquitz, DEA manually reviews printouts of international
telephone calls, looking for suspicious patterns.

For example, repeated calls to South America from a private residence in
Miami might trigger some sort of investigation.

Obviously such a procedure is tedious and error-prone.  Marquitz envisions a
fast parallel processor running an expert system that can examine millions of
telephone calls a day and discern subtle and complex patterns for follow-up by
law enforcement officials.  Marquitz says it isn't a problem of data collection
but of data fusion and reduction, a process he calls ``digging the signal out
of the noise''.

Opportunities to marry AI, parallel processing and pattern recognition
techniques exist in several other areas, Marquitz said.  A great deal of
cocaine enters the country in cargo containers that mysteriously disappear for
days at a time and then magically reappear.  ``The data to track these
containers is available in manifest records and can be readily supplied, but it
is not automated,'' Marquitz said.  A computer system could track the movement
of these boxes on a near real-time basis, looking for anomalous conditions, he
said.

In another example, Marquitz said currency-tracking schemes could be devised,
not for checks and credit card transactions, which drug distributors never use,
but for greenbacks based on their serial numbers.

Marquitz said DARPA's current focus on counternarcotics has roots in the past.
``During the [presidential] campaign, there was a lot of debate about drugs;
the campaign highlighted the issue.  We were already looking at the more
general problem of SO/LIC, so we were up to speed about thinking about these
problems.  Now we are way out ahead,'' he said.

Marquitz also said DARPA officials are working on a five-year plan for research
and prototype development in SO/LIC.

&gt;  [This of course contradicts the myth that smaller programs run faster.  PGN]

It also contradicts the story that I heard. One of my clients is an architect
who lives 2 blocks away from the SKYDOME. Living next door, he is very
interested in the SKYDOME (including the undercapacity transit plans, but
that's better left to another RISKS submission), and being an architect, he
hears many interesting things. According to him, the stress on the dome from
opening and closing the dome was badly underestimated, and current estimates
are only 4 times a year will be safe (down from an original projection in the
30-40 range), i.e. any more will dangerously stress the machinery and lead to
early failure. I tried, without success, to determine what sort of assumptions
this revised estimate was based on, but it's not his area of expertise, so he
couldn't help me much.

From the little he told me, I can't determine whether a software rewrite would
be capable of "solving" this problem or not.

I know this is usually reserved for computer risks, but I've discovered a
heretofore-unknown (at least to me) advantage.

Last night my block experienced a power outage.  And since my place is
all-electric, I was left totally in the dark (without candles, flashlights,
etc).  The only self-contained light source that I could find was the eerie
blue glow emitted from my lap-top computer.

As I wandered about like a computer-age Diogenes, I thought it ironic that the
only thing to operate during a blackout was a computer.

As an example of "anti-risk" I was interested to observe during a recent
shopping trip that the computerized registers at Osco's (a local drug store
chain) query the cashier when a questionable price is entered, apparently
according to the category of the item (which the cashier enters separately).
In this case, the cashier had entered a price of $79 for a skin care product,
and the register politely inquired whether he had made a mistake (as, indeed,
he had).

        The requirement that systems be kept simple is itself too simple to
"manage" technology -- if, indeed, WE manage IT, and not the other way around.
Nor is simplicity necessarily a virtue if a simplified tool magnifies its
potential for control, control of events AND persons.  Making a tool less
"option-rich," even at the cost of decreased flexibility, is not the answer to
our problem, because the problem it IS an answer to (how to smoothly adapt a
control function to an irregular domain) is not the central one.  The central
problem is whether all this technology serves a good, "The Good" if you will.
Crucial to that problem is the question of whether nature -- our own included
-- can and should be adequately characterised as an "irregular domain" for the
possible employment of technology.

        That it does we take more or less for granted, at least at the
policy-planning level.  (Our consciences, we hold, are our "private" affair.)
A recent posting in the alt.fusion newsgroup castigated the opinions of people
like Paul Ehrlich and Jeremy Rifkin, who have questioned whether such a thing
as a "Utah tokamak" cold-fusion reactor might not be bad for us after all.
"What pieces of disgusting slime they are," wrote the author. "Fortunately,
with something this important they will be ignored, and, if they interfere,
steamrollered."  I fear his attitude, more temperately phrased, is shared by
the great majority of us.

        Steven Kull, a psychoanalyst, interviewed a number of DoD, military,
and defense-related industry types for his recent book _Minds at War_ (New
York: Basic Books, 1988).  His aim in the book was to examine the
psychological attitudes of nuclear strategists.  Especially interesting (and
chilling) was an observation he made about interviews on the subject of the
big push for hard-target kill capability (GPS, Navstar, earth-penetrating
warheads, etc.).  Those of us who work in similarly computer-intensive milieux
would do well to adapt it to our own work:

              A rather curious widespread attitude was that the
        United States "might as well" improve its hard-target
        capability given that it had the technological ability, as
        if the effort to improve such capabilities was virtually
        costless. Even respondents who understood and were actually
        sympathetic to concerns about the instabilities engendered
        by hard-target kill capability often shook their heads as if
        to say that only an overwhelming logical argument could stop
        such technological developments.  There was a pervasive
        feeling that despite multibillion-dollar costs, building new
        weapons with greater accuracy was virtually effortless,
        while refraining from doing so was a gargantuan effort. Some
        simply asserted that the weapon in question was a good
        weapon in a technical sense and therefore should be built.
        In a few cases, respondents even seemed surprised when
        pushed for a stronger rationale based on strategic
        considerations.

[...] this brings up another RISK: the effect our organizations have on the
use/misuse of technology.  The problem I'll tell about was not a technological
one, it was a bureacratic one, but if it had not been solved a technological
RISK would have resulted.

I used to work in an Air Force Systems Command System Program Office as an
Avionics Project Manager.  One of the boxes I had responsibility for was the
Intercom Set Control Panel (ICSCP), which controlled the radios, the
pilot/weapon systems officer intercom, and voice warnings on one particular
fighter.  Voice warnings occurred for events like low fuel; a digitized female
voice would say, "Bingo Fuel.  Bingo Fuel."  The warning would occur everytime
that interrupt occurred, so if you were jigging the plane around to avoid
getting killed, fuel slosh might generate many warnings.{\footnote The voice,
on early versions of the aircraft, belonged to a woman from Florida known as
"Bitchin' Betty".  When we decided to redigitize for our aircraft, her voice
quality had changed and "Caustic Kristen" took her place.  Female voices are
preferred because pilots (overwhelmingly male) react more quickly to them.}

Here's where the fun begins: the voice warnings attenuated all radio and
intercom messages by 23dB.  So let's say you're doing the aforementioned
jigging: you could miss a critical radio transmission ("Number two, you're
going to hit the ground", "Number three, you have a MIG on your tail") and die.
This problem had been corrected on earlier versions of the aircraft by just
removing the attenuation; the pilots could correctly distinguish and interpret
two or three simultaneous messages.  The requirements fellows had told my
office to correct it for the new version.  This got lost in the organizational
cracks; I dug it up when I was going through old message traffic after I was
given management of the program.  The attenuation was embedded into an approved
high-level, baseline specification and had trickled down into at least two
lower-level specs.  An engineering change proposal would have to be made if we
followed the rule book.

We were well into full-scale development, and two or three preproduction
ICSCP's had been made.  The firmware was really firm; we would have to rip out
the old chips (and fatigue the boards) and install new ones.  The way the USAF
does business, it takes two years before you can even have the contractor start
work on an engineering change (it takes that long to jump through all the
hoops). By that time, about forty systems would be in the field.  We would have
to retrofit each one at a cost of millions of dollars for the entire program.
The change was not safety-critical; that had been determined when they changed
the older versions of the aircraft, so we couldn't put out an "urgent" change.
A safety-critical mod would not have looked good when our budget went before
Congress, either.

So, what to do?  I made a visit to the ICSCP subcontractor with my main
contractor and we determined that we could either cut a single wire or make a
two-line software change.  Wire-cutting was a kludge I wanted to avoid, but it
started looking awfully attractive: the USAF was not buying any software
documentation, so we hadn't a clue about what to change if we wanted to modify
the software organically and wire-cutting is something the intermediate shops
could do.  Remember that the contractors have little interest in actually
making the change *now*: the baseline has been approved and they stand to make
lots of money off the retrofit program if we go the software way (and maybe
even if we cut the wire).  But by some gentle convincing and appeals to
professional pride (and the promise to tell the Advanced Tactical Fighter SPO
what a great job they had done in averting a costly retrofit), I told them to
make the change to the spec and modify the software and I would make sure the
SPO would approve it.  It was done, and the retrofit avoided.  I called some
friends at ATF and told them the whole story.

Lessons learned: The machinery we set up to manage our large projects carries
RISKS of its own.  If we had gone by the book, forty+ aircraft would have been
in the field with a RISKy condition.  By having a very professional contractor
with a liberal dose of enlightened self interest, a problem with our
organizational machinery was circumvented.  I'm sure other organizations have
had similar problems, and solved them in similar ways.

Lt John S. Karabaic, WRDC/TXI, WPAFB, OH 45433-6543             513 255 5800
These opinions are mine.

BTW, the operators (pilots and WSO's) hated the voice warnings with a vengeance.
They much preferred simple tones and warning lights.  But high-tech sells...

In fields that are mature enough to have liability associated with wrong
actions, users of standard products have the protection of the law.  Real
standards exist for things like steel beams, so a designer or builder can order
beams and expect that they will perform as specified in the standard.  The
standard specification for steel beams requires tests using standard methods
which are understood and accepted by competent engineers, who use standard
terminology in communicating with one another.  If a beam fails in service,
then the builder's lawyers call the beam maker's lawyers to discuss things like
compensatory and punitive damages.  The threat of liability for wrong action
keeps most people honest enough to avoid lawsuits.

Real engineers would laugh at the idea that lex and yacc are "standard"
products.  What standard specification do they satisfy?  What standard
test methods verify that the particular version of lex or yacc used to
develop a system conforms to the specification?  What standard rules of
design, developed by recognized groups of experienced professionals,
guide other competent professionals as to how lex and yacc should be
used?  What standard defines the terms in which competent professionals 
communicate about these tools?  Who do a system builder's lawyers talk 
with if the tools fail in service?

I don't think there's an absolute rule here; a lot depends on the application
and its history.  For a task that's very well understood theoretically -- i.e.,
parsing or lexical analysis -- a good tool is likely to be far more reliable
than a hand-coded equivalent, and far more consistent besides.  A similar rule
can be applied to very complex tasks, such as protocol design; if your primary
goal isn't (for example) to design a new transport protocol, you're much better
off using a standard one.  The bugs are often subtle, and today's protocols are
the product of years of experience.

It's the middle range where I'm more skeptical; one needs reason to trust
something.  If an application is complex, an existing tool often doesn't quite
fit; adding just a few little hacks is a sure road to disaster.  We often see
this in newspaper horror stories about municipal accounting systems that are
years late and millions over budget -- even though the general concept is
straight-forward enough, all the little special cases can kill the project.

From the New Haven Register, 24 Apr 89.  (Page 30)

		Pilots in Northwest crash accused of
		disconnecting alarm on another flight

(Associated Press) Detroit:  There is evidence that the pilots involved in a
deadly 1987 airliner crash, blamed in part on a warning system failure,
intentionally disconnected a similar alarm on another jet two days earlier,
the plane's maker says.

In a petition filed with the National Transportation Safety Board, Douglas
Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas Corp., said the pilots pulled a
warning system circuit breaker on the first plane, interrupting power to the
system and silencing an unwanted warning, The Detroit News reported Sunday.

The same pilots, John Maus and David Dodds, were in control of Northwest
Flight 255, a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, when it crashed on takeoff at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport on Aug. 16, 1987.

The pilots died, along with 154 other people, including two people on the
ground.  The only survivor from the plane was a 4-year-old girl.  It was the
second worst aircraft accidednt in U.S. history behind the 1979 crash of an
American Airlines jet near Chicago that killed 275 people.

The NTSB concluded last May that the warning system on the MD-80 failed to
alert the pilots that they hadn't set the wing flaps and slats, which provide
added lift for takeoff.

The board faulted the pilots for not setting the flaps and slats and failing
to complete a routine pre-flight checklist.  The board also said power to the
warning system was interrupted, but couldn't determine why.

Douglas' petition, obtained by the newpaper, cited a note written by Northwest
pilot Merrill Hodges in September 1987.  Hodges said he found an alarm system
circuit breaker pulled on another MD-80 jet flown by Maus and Dodds.

Flight records show Maus and Dodds landed that plane in Santa Anna, Calif., on
Aug. 14, 1987, and the plane stayed on the ground until Hodges entered the
cockpit the next day, Douglas' petition said.

"The unavoidable conclusion is that the absence of power to the takeoff
warning system was the flight crew's intentional disablement of the takeoff
warning," the petition said.

Northwest lawyer Carroll Dubuc said Douglas' petition doesn't raise anything
new and promised to file a response that will rebut Douglas' claim.

The newspaper quoted an unidentified official of the Air Line Pilots
Association as saying the claim is false.  The official said the union is also
preparing a response.

[Background:  Martindale and Hubbell is, and has been for many years, the
standard directory of lawyers and law offices.  It runs to many thick volumes,
and is a required part of any law library.]

From "The American Lawyer", April 1989.  (Page 19.)

If you want to serve process on New York's Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, you could be
handing papers to a dapper, red-liveried doorman at The Belmont, an exclusive
residential building on Manhattan's East 46th Street.  Mail addressed to
Whitman &amp; Ransom could end up in the hands of one J. Pugh, the tenant in
apartment 5A of The Vancortlandt, a tony upper Park Avenue building.  And
lawyers unfamiliar with Wall Street's Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson
could be reporting to a luxury apartment building on the Upper East Side.

Although the Belmont's doorman doesn't work for Weil, Gotshal, he says he has
been receiving "all kinds of mail" for the firm.  "Maybe a few lawyers live in
this building," he adds, "but there is no law firm here."

It seems that Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., made a few mistakes in printing its
1989 New York law directory.  Twelve New York firms - including Weil, Gotshal;
Fried, Frank; Whitman &amp; Ransom; Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim &amp; Ballon; and
Kelley Drye &amp; Warren - are listed with incorrect, and seemingly random,
Manhattan addresses.

"I'm not very happy with [Martindale]," says Weil, Gotshal partner Alan
Weinschel.  "This is the most god-awful negligence.  Suppose somebody serves
papers on us at [East 46th Street] and it takes an extra day to forward it to
our office [at 767 Fifth Avenue]?  What if we miss a deadline because somebody
didn't make a change in the directory?"

Martindale cannot explain the erroneous addresses, except to blame "a computer
glitch," according to Richard Pizzi, vice-president and corporate counsel to
the legal publishing company.  Pizzi says the company's computer was "turned
down, and then back up" after the New York volume was already proofread.
Martindale didn't discover the errors until after the volume was printed and
mailed.

"We tried to address the issue head on," Pizzi says, noting that the company
gave each affected firm a complete refund of the cost of printing attorney's
biographies in the volume.  The publisher also arranged with the post office
for mail to be forwarded to the proper addresses, and sent customers a
two-page announcement of corrections.  Nonetheless one firm is sending a
messenger four times a day to pick up Federal Express mail and other
deliveries that might have found their way to the incorrect address.

Martindale's efforts haven't earned high marks from some lawyers at the
affected firms.  One angry partner says that when he insisted Martindale issue
stick-on labels with the correct addresses, the company didn't respond.
(Prizzi says the company is considering the suggestion.)  Pizzi turned down
requests from firms who wanted the book reprinted.

But other firms involved in the mix-up are not concerned.  The Manhattan branch
of Rochester's Nixon, Hargrave, Devans &amp; Doyle, for example, is listed at two
addresses - 30 Rockefeller Center, its true address, and 101 Park Avenue.  "Our
regular customers know where we are," says Edward Hughes, managing partner of
the New York office.  "We'll rely on everybody's good humor to get by."

   Here is yet another example of microprocessor programming foolishness: When
several of us went to the local Pizza Slut for supper this evening, we were
seated next to the jukebox.  After noting that it looked pretty new we
proceeded to forget about it until it went into "attract mode".

   If it remains unused, it will eventually play a seemingly randomly chosen
song about once every 15 minutes.  This behavior, a relatively trivial
extension of the attract mode common to video games, did not elicit much
comment.  It did however provoke more intense scrutiny of the jukebox.  There
were several 7-segment displays making up the front panel (the usual "current
selection", "current play", and so forth), and one labeled "most popular
selection".

   Given that the group was composed of techie types, we proceeded to speculate
on the usefulness of that display -- including the idea of feeding the play
history to a clearinghouse ala Arbitron or Nielson.  We also started wondering
if the people who programmed the jukebox remembered to exclude the selections
played during attract mode from the "most popular selection" calculations.
Answer: NO! When the jukebox played "143" in attract mode, the "most popular
selection" display switched from "165" to "143".  *Sigh*

Makers Ready Smart Seat Belts for Mid-'90s Entry

DETROIT - Seat belts with electronic tension and slack controls should be
commonplace on cars in the 1990s, according to manufacturers.  ...  Research
shows that the more comfortable belts are, the more likely people are to wear
them.  The problem is that belts are more comfortable when they exert less
tension on the body, but they provide the most protection when they are snug.
...  Common mechanical belts in US cars today control slack with ratchets and
pawls similar to window shade mechanisms. ...  Mechanical belts' major drawback
is that sometimes too much slack is left in a belt when a person leans forward
and then sits back in the seat.

    A survey in 1988 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety showed that
more than one-third of the belted drivers of American cars have greater than
the safe limit of 1 inch of slack in their restraint.  This phenomenon
contributed to more severe head and facial injuries.  ...  Engineers at Bendix
Safety Restraints Division of Allied Signal Corp. and TRW Vehicle Safety
Systems Inc. -- the two major seat belt suppliers said electronically
controlled belts with electronic slack controls will provide maximum safety and
maximum comfort.

Both companies have developed prototype belts with electronic slack controls
and have presented them to their Big Three customers for evaluation.  ...  Once
electronics are made part of a seat belt system, other features can be added
easily, said Dr. Fleming [staff engineer in R&amp;D at TRW] ...  Sensing brake
pressure is important because a driver whose car is sliding on ice might brake,
and an inertial sensor might not pick it up, said Dr. Fleming.  With
electronics "It doesn't cost you anything to lock those belts ...  and drive
the motor backwards to really tighten down the belt," he said.  This would be
accomplished by having an algorithm that signals the seat belt motor to
temporarily run in reverse at double voltage during an emergency situation, Dr.
Fleming said.  ...  These smart systems might then lead to anticipatory systems
that use radar as the sensor, ... Systems also can be created to adapt
themselves to individual occupants tastes for slack and tension.

                     [What about electrical systems failures leading to loss of
                     control *and* loss of seat belt locking???  Marc Mengel]

                            are drunk, strap you in, and call the police?  PGN]

An article by Kim Murphy in the 25 April 1989 'Los Angeles Times' reports that
U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer unexpectedly rejected the plea bargain of
Kevin Mitnick, the hacker once called "as dangerous with a keyboard as a bank
robber with a gun."  Pfaelzer declared that Mitnick deserves more time behind
bars.

As reported in RISKS 8.43, "Mitnick pleaded guilty to one count of computer
fraud and one count of possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone
codes.... Mitnick faces one year in prison.  Under a plea agreement with the
government, he must also submit to three years' supervision by probation
officers after his release from prison."

Judge Pfaelzer said Monday, "Mr. Mitnick , you have been engaging in this
conduct for too long, and no one has actually punished you.  This is the last
time you are going to do this."  She said a confidential pre-sentence report
recommended that she exceed even the 18-month maximum prison term called for
under mandatory new federal sentencing guidelines.  The judge's action voids
Mitnick's guilty plea.

Both prosecuting and defense attorneys were surprised.  Mitnick's attorney said
he did not know whether his client would agree to a guilty plea carrying a
longer prison term.  This could make it harder to bring charges against
Mitnick's alleged associates.  If Mitnick is brought to trial, testimony from
at least one of his associates would be required to convict him, and they would
not appear as witnesses without receiving immunity from prosecution.

I guess we've probably beat this topic about to death, but comic strips do give
some picture of popular beliefs about computers.  The current story line in
Spider-Man has Jolly Jonah attempting to discover the web-slinger's True
Identity by hiring a team of psychologists to "feed information into a
computer," which will then figure out the answer.

This is not the only time I've run across this sort of computer naivete.  When
I was just learning to program (in BASIC, lo these many years ago), a friend
called me up with a scheme to win a local radio station contest.  I would take
all the clues that the station had broadcast describing, and "feed" them into
"the computer" (presumably into the BASIC interpreter :-), and he would figure
out some way to get through to the radio station when the computer came up with
the right answer.

The question for RISKS readers is double-edged.  How did this impression of
computers as all-knowing come about, and how should we, as professionals,
describe computers so as to dispel these notions?  The answer to the first part
of the question is fairly obvious.  A friend pointed out to me the multitude of
public sources of misconception -- from popular entertainment (Twilight Zone,
2001, Knight Rider), to sales campaigns and news reports based on press
releases (users will be able to train themselves and solve world problems with
computer X), to sensationalistic claims by well-known and highly visible
computer scientists.

The other side of the question is much harder.  I've often found myself trying
to characterize the limitations of computers as they are applied to these
situations (i.e. discovering an identity from a set of clues).  It's an
interesting juxtaposition to the awesome ability computers have for producing a
set of clues from an identity (e.g. a SSN).  Trying to explain the differences
in cocktail-party English is difficult at best.  As our data bases become
larger the principle of garbage-in-garbage-out seems to be taken less seriously
(ironically), and non-computerniks don't seem to interpret this to include
nothing-in-nothing-out.

To reiterate, how should we present the limitations of computerized information
handling in a clear, non-patronizing way, and how can we effectively counter
those who imply the omniscience of "The Computer?"  Do we need a "truth-in-
advertising" code for computer capabilities; if so, what should it look like?

Before deciding that I enjoyed software development more then engineering, I
was involved in nondestructive testing (NDT). One of the major functions of NDT
is to determine the adherence of the item under test to standards.  Generally
these standards are related to the safety of the larger system in which the the
tested item is a component. My experience directly contradicts that expounded
above.  Anyone who orders and uses a product simply based on its "meeting"
standards is being extremely foolish.

For example, an NDT lab that I worked for was owned by a steel warehouse firm.
The parent had a contract to supply structural steel for a major office
complex. Twice the firm purchased steel only to discover that the mill
certificates were faked. In the first case, this was discovered only when
welders reported problems during fabrication. This kind of problem is more
widespread then most people would like to admit. Consider the recent spate of
reports on substandard areospace fitting being sold with false documentation.

Further, I was several times asked to falsify NDT results to certify that items
met standards. In one case, I failed a number of welders taking a certification
examination (on the same building project noted above). The fabricator simply
took the SAME weld coupons to another lab and EVERY ONE of the welders passed.
In another case, at nuclear weapons plant I worked at, a team of EE's was
prevented from inserting additonal circuitry into a test system that would
falsify test results only when one threatened to go public with the
information.

While the above examples are concerned with outright fraud, many things
involved in applying standards are open to interpretation.  Consider the RS-232
standard. How does an inspector of power plant welds determine if an ultrasonic
echo means the weld is substandard, when it is the "gray" zone? Many standard
compliant items are not in compliance.

The point of all this is that standards guarantee little or nothing.  Questions
of liability are meaningless. If the profit to be made is high enough and the
risk of detection small enough, many firms will falsify certification. Worse,
the falsification may be impossible to trace. A part fails and loss occurrs,
but often the damage is such that no reconstruction of the exact cause can be
made. Since the part was certified, the search is likely to turn elsewhere
(assembly, operation, etc.). I am tired of "real engineers", who are no more
exact, informed or methodicai then programmers pretending that engineering is
somehow less prone to exactly the same problems in project management and
control as programming. It would a trival exercise to compile a list of
engineering failures, just as it would be for programming failures. The real
issue is how to design and manufacture anything correctly.

  From: Assoc. Press article in the May 1, 1989 Raleigh(NC) Times:

      The TCASSII system consists of a sophisticated transponder ...
   antennae, and a computer that analyzes and displays the 
   movement of nearby planes.  ...

     "The system has no bugs," said Don Dodgen of Honeywell.

     If two computers meet, he said, orders to the pilots will be
   reconciled automatically:  if one plane is told to climb, the 
   other will be advised to descend or to say on course.

No comment can do justice to this.

(condensed from Albany NY Times Union Wed April 26, 1989, page B-17)

The up-again down-again Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant near Oswego was
back on line Tuesday, following a weekend shutdown that "shouldn't have
happened," according to a federal official.

An employee accidently keyed a hand-held two-way radio near circuitry for the
turbine generator monitoring system Saturday night.  The transmission shut down
the system, which in turn triggered an automatic shutdown of the entire
facility.

A section chief of the NRC region 1 office said that he has never heard of a
similar accident but that most plants are sensitive and there are strict rules
to prevent this.

Replacement fuel costs $350K per day when the 1080 MW plant is down.

The plant had been up less than a week after a shutdown caused by corrosion and
loose wiring in a meter.

B-2 BUILDERS: PROTOTYPE NOT NEEDED
By Mark Thompson, Inquirer Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON - The builders of the Pentagon's B-2 Stealth bomber are boasting
that their computer-aided design for the revolutionary boomerang-shaped
aircraft is so good that the $500 million plane will leap from the computer
screen into the air by July without benefit of a prototype model to test the
blueprints.

"The first B-2 is a production aircraft," the Northrop Corp. said
in its just-released annual report.  "There are none of the prototypes
that have been required in previous generations of aircraft."

But critics warn that the Air Force decision to begin building the
$68 billion fleet of 132 sinister-looking planes before flight
testing has even started could prove disastrous.

"I think the B-2 will crash the first time it flies," said Kosta
Tsipis, director of the Program in Science and Technology for
International Security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"I wouldn't be a passenger aboard it for anything in the world."

The lack of a prototype will make the planes' first flight "pretty
exciting," agreed John Pike, associate director of the Federation
of American Scientists in Washington.

"I'm perfectly prepared to see the airplane fly more or less as
advertised," he said.  "At the same time, I'm equally prepared to see
the airplane crash more or less immediately."

But Capt. Jay DeFrank, an Air Force spokesman, said, "We're confident
that it will make a successful first flight."  The plane's two seats
will be occupied by pilots from Northrop and the Air Force for the
inaugural flight, which may occur secretly, he said.

The top-secret B-2, successor to the troubled B-1B, has been designed to
fly into the Soviet Union undetected by radar.  The not-ready-to-fly
B-2, unveiled in November, is scheduled to be operational within the
next several years, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said yesterday
on NBC-TV's _Meet the Press_ that full production would not start in
the 1990 fiscal year as planned.

Asked whether he would consider killing the program, Cheney replied,
"We're going to postpone actually going into full procurement because
I'm not comfortable with the program yet, there are a lot of technical
problems with it, and it is extremely expensive.  And until I have time to
review it, which I've not yet had, I'm not prepared to make that
judgement."

The B-2's flying-wing design is an updating of Northrop's YB-49 aircraft,
a 1940s-era prototype bomber that the Air Force killed before production
began.  The B-2's shape is naturally unstable, and the lack of a tail
means it will be much harder to control than a conventional airplane.

"It is essentially a boomerang," said James W. Kelley, a former Northrop
aerodynamicist.  "Once it goes into a spin, it cannot recover."

B-2 skeptics question both the plane's radical flying-wing design, first
revealed a year ago, and the Air force's decision to save money by
going straight from the drawing board to the production aircraft.

Historically, new aircraft designs are tested with a series of
custom-built planes, each flown and modified until all major problems
have been eliminated.  Only then does production begin.

But in the case of the B-2, about a dozen planes are under construction,
although not a single one has flown, several sources said.

In recent years, experts have urged the military to build prototypes
to let them "fly-before-buy," confirming the designs before committing
billions of dollars to production.  Prototyping should be done "to uncover
operational as well as technical deficiencies before a decision is made
to proceed with full-scale development," the presidentially appointed
Packard commission said in its 1986 study critical of Pentagon purchasing.

But while the Air Force is requiring prototypes for its fledgling and
highly secret Advanced Tactical Fighter, it does not believe the B-2
needs them.

"It was determined because of its revolutionary technology and the
highly sensitive nature of the program that prototyping was not the best
way to go," DeFrank said.  The secret nature of the program prevented
further elaboration, he said.

Others contend the plane's radical flying-wing design and high price
tag demand prototyping.

"A $70 billion program with no prototypes?" asked an incredulous Thomas
S. Amlie, an Air Force engineer at the Pentagon, who said computers
and models could not replicate the rigors of flight.  "Of course we
should prototype.  We ought to fly one, and wring the hell out of it,
with zero-zero ejection seats so the pilots can eject at zero
altitude and zero air speed and live through it."

Amlie dismissed Air Force arguments that there were classified reasons
why prototyping the B-2 makes no sense.

"They always say there are classified things that we can't know about
because we don't have the clearance," Amlie said.  "Well, I've been in
the business for 37 years, and every time someone has told me that it
turns out they were lying."

But Northrop says its battery of high-powered computers, whose data base
contains drawings of all of the B-2's parts down to the smalles rivet,
has "systematically eliminated" most of the risk inherent in a new
aircraft design.

With the computers, design changes can be made before production begins.
Such changes are particularly painstaking aboard the B-2, where the
plane's radar-evading design requires a frozen exterior shape into which
all of the plane's systems and weapons must be crammed.

"Given all the aerodynamic and performance compromises they've had to
make to reduce the radar cross-section of the B-2, you're just
flying much closer to the margin," said Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists.  "That's precisely why you need to do prototyping."

"It's very strange that they're not being required to prototype," added
Joseph V. Foa, an aeronautical engineer at George Washington University
who first studied flying wings 40 years ago.  "When you have an aircraft
that's going to cost a half-billion dollars apiece, it's a good idea
to prototype.

Pike said recurring delays -- the plane's first flight originally was set
for 1987 -- showed that Northrop's computers had not eliminated the B-2's
problems.  "That tells me this thing is no different from anything else,"
he said.  "Just because it looks right on the computer screen doesn't
mean that it's going to work in the real world."

Without prototyping, the Air Force -- if it discovers problems -- will
argue that the $20 billion investment it already has made in the
program requires repairs instead of cancellation, Pike said.

"They're basically front-loading the program so that regardless of what
the test results are, they'll already have spent so much money on it
that it will be difficult to cancel," Pike said.  "You're paying to have
the work done twice -- first time to do it wrong, and then the second
time to do it right."

Here is another addition to the list of risks of information age.  There is an
article in Thursday morning edition [May 4] of San Jose Mercury News titled
"Member learns the hard way: American Express is watching".  It described how
American Express called a member to voice their concern that he might not be
able to pay their recent bill.  American Express was able to access his
checking account and find that he had less than what was owed to them.  His
card was temporarily "deactivated" after the member refused to give any
financial information except that he would pay up the bill with cash when it
came in.

Apparently, the card application, in finer print, declares that "[American
Express reserves] the right to access accounts to ascertain whether you are
able to pay the balance".  After some arguments with the company, the member
comments that "I learned a lesson: My life is not as private as I thought".

First, this is news to me.  I hold an AmExp card, and I wasn't even aware that
my accounts are constantly being checked.  Second, how could the banks dish out
information on the account holders to third parties without proper
authorization?

  I was tracing the phone wires in my house yesterday afternoon trying to
find out why my phone was "off-hook" when all of the phones were actually
hung up. Just before the lines enter my house I found a gray box labelled
"Telephone Network Interface". Curious, I opened the box to find two RJ-11
modular phone jacks with black connectors in them that were held in by
clips. I popped the clip, unplugged the plugs and plugged in a normal phone.
Lo and behold, a dial tone! I wandered around the neighborhood a bit and
found a few more of these boxes. Looks like you can wander around Boston
with a phone, plug into someone's circuit, and make as many phone calls
as you like. Who needs lineman's equipment?

New York Times Reports Shuttle Software Patch
 
Excerpted from the New York Times 5-5-89 edition by Henry E. Hardy

[...] In checking the Magellan's control systems two weeks ago, engineers
detected and corrected one potentially catastrophic problem. A design flaw was
found in the software for the spacecraft's computer. If the craft were to lose
its proper orientation to the Sun and the Earth, the flaw could have prevented
the spacecraft from regaining its bearings. The result could have been the loss
of the spacecraft, as it failed to get enough solar energy to run its
electronics and thus could no longer keep its antenna pointed at to Earth.
   Project officials said engineers devised a "patch," a substitute set of 
instructions, to override the design flaw.
   John H. Gerpheide, the Magellan project manager at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said: We're convinced that 
we've got a good fix on the problem. The fix has been tested and 
thoroughly reviewed. We don't have any concern at all."
   Errors in computer instructions were said to have been the cause of 
the failure of Phobos 1, an unmanned Soviet spacecraft, as it was 
headed to Mars last September. The spacecraft tumbled out of 
control. And the craft, unable to keep its solar panels pointed to the 
Sun, ran out of electricity.
   The companion craft, Phobos 2, made it to an orbit of Mars and 
then failed as it was maneuvering to drop scientific instruments on 
the tiny Martian moon Phobos. Soviet scientists who were here to 
view the launching of the Atlantis said the cause of the Phobos 2 loss 
was still unclear.

Here is a NASA press release on a self-diagnostic *IN FLIGHT* maintenance
system.  I am sure this would be useful in tracking down problems but I can
only imagine the problems that could arise from trusting such a system.

	"But the computer said it was fixed"

	-David Robinson

NASA FLIES FIRST AIRCRAFT SELF-DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM   (  RELEASE:  89-69 )

     In the first flight in a joint NASA/USAF program that promises
self-repairing flight controls and lower maintenance costs in future aircraft,
computers aboard the NASA Ames-Dryden F-15 Flight Research Aircraft were able
to correctly identify and isolate in flight a simulated failure in the flight
control system.

     Flight control system failures can and do occur during flight.  When this
happens, costly ground maintenance diagostic tests are conducted to try to
identify the failure so that appropriate corrective actions may be taken.  In
many cases, the failure cannot be identified during ground tests because the
actual flight conditions are not duplicated.  With the new expert system
technology, failures can be identified and isolated before landing and be fixed
immediately.

     The first simulated failure was an angle-of-attack sensor.  The
maintenance diagnostic system correctly identified the failure and isolated the
problem.  Future tests will incorporate other failures.

     "This is a real breakthrough in flight control system maintenance
diagnosis for future aircraft," says F-15 Flight Research Aircraft Project
Manager Dr. James Stewart.  "Newer digitally-controlled aircraft are more
complex.  However, digital controls allow this type of computer programming
which will reduce the maintenance cost of future digitally-controlled
aircraft."

     The maintenance diagnostic system is the first technology to be tested in
the Self-Repairing Flight Control Program.  The other technologies, scheduled
to begin flight tests this fall, include failure detection, identification and
reconfiguration of the flight control system.

     An example of the need for reconfiguration is when a tail surface fails in
flight.  The flight control system will be reconfigured (repair itself) so that
other surfaces take over the function of the failed tail surface.  Also, a
pilot alert system will tell the pilot what the problem is and what the new
configuration and flight envelope are after the system has self repaired.

     This program is being conducted by NASA's Ames-Dryden Flight Research
Facility, Edwards, Calif., and is sponsored by the Air Force Wright Research
and Development Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  The prime
contractor, McDonnell Aircraft Company, St. Louis, Mo., with the General
Electric Aircraft Control System Division, Binghampton, N.Y., designed and
developed the maintenance diagnostic system for use in the NASA program.

I found the fuss about Northrop's statement that the first B-2 will be a
production aircraft to be unjustified.  The mere fact that they say it is not a
prototype does not mean that it is not a prototype, My dictionary defines
"prototype" as a first or early example of something.  Nobody is claiming that
the first will be the second or a late example of the B-2.  Whatever they call
it, the risks will be the same.  Some organisations and spokesmen will use any
excuse to stir up a controversy.

Software engineers please do not be misled.  It is not the generation nor even
the design that requires a prototype.  The prototype is part of the design.
The design is not complete without it.  All assertions to the contrary are
fallacious and dangerous.

Engineering of any kind is risky enough without this kind of foolishness.

There is a subtlety here that people not intimate with military aviation may
not appreciate.  This is not as big an innovation as Northrop is claiming.  It
has been common for quite some time to build even the first one of a new
aircraft in "production" tooling.  Although it does save a lot of time, it also
contributes greatly to realistic testing.  Things like production processes
affect the result; it simply is not possible, in practice, for a hand-built
prototype to accurately represent production hardware.  Proper testing requires
hardware built with production tooling.  This practice started with the USAF's
"Cook-Craigie plan" techniques in the 1950s.

(Many of the critics quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer article are making
fools of themselves because they don't understand this.)

Doing this also helps a lot when one wants to get production moving rapidly
after testing; part of Cook-Craigie is a scheme whereby early stages of
production ramp up fully while later stages concentrate on getting the first
few aircraft out the door, the hope being that any modifications that are
needed will not affect the early stages badly.

Inevitably, this sort of thing involves risk that production tooling will need
to be torn up and revised because testing finds problems, and that half-built
aircraft may need expensive revisions or even scrapping.  Efforts are made to
get the thing right the first time, and to get good test results as quickly as
possible.  Sometimes it works well; sometimes not.  As in other such production
innovations, after early successes there was a tendency for later projects to
get the outline right -- first aircraft built in production tooling, first
stages of production rolling early -- while forgetting important unorthodox
details like the emphasis on intensive early testing.  The result is failures,
which tend to be blamed on bad luck or the inherent difficulty of the problem
rather than on bad management.

(Another production innovation which suffered the same fate was concurrency:
designing all the pieces of the hardware simultaneously, relying on good
interface documentation to make sure they all work together.  When it works, it
gets hardware out the door much sooner than step-by-step methods.  It worked
well for the early ICBM programs because (a) they consistently funded multiple
parallel development efforts for anything deemed risky, and (b) they didn't
choose between them until hardware was available to be tested.  Many later
programs adopted concurrent development without these important (and expensive)
details, the result being a lot of failures.)

The ultimate end product of remembering the successes but forgetting the
details is what's going on at Northrop:  the conviction that it's possible to
get everything right the first time, so no modifications will be needed and
full-scale production can start immediately.  That *is* folly, but not because
there aren't any prototypes.

Rich Neitzel's anecdotes do not justify his conclusion.  In every case that he
mentioned there were standards that were clear enough and substantive enough
that, in his opinion, they were not met by the products in question.  We have
no such standards in software.  He points out that we will never eliminate
fraud and incompetence.  The fact that there will always be people who cheat
does not mean that we should not have standards.  Au contraire!

  "A bad standard is better than nothing.  It gives you something to violate."
  [A quote from the Hammer Forum, 1986]

  "Standards are like motherhood: They should not come too soon, and there
  should be an identifiable father."  [CAPT John Nichols, USN, 1968]

  Gordon Bell said it best in his seminal essay, "Standards Can Help Us," IEEE
  COMPUTER, June 1984, pp. 71-78.  Serious readers should review that article.

The practical application of the tongue-in-cheek advice from Hammer '86, and
from Nichols and Bell, is that at the least, standards, even flawed ones, give
us the basis for further discussion, based on something more than just personal
taste.  I remember discussing computer system reliability with representatives
of UNIVAC, early in this decade.  These capable folks had arguably one of the
best systems of that era - the UNIVAC 1100 series.  Its ancestors had succeeded
despite a history of frequent crashes, which were then common in the industry.
Newer systems, with designs unhampered by demands for "backwards compatability"
with older models, and free to use newer technology, were beginning to
demonstrate an order of magnitude more reliable performance; e.g., one crash a
quarter instead of one per week.  (Actually, the old systems were worse than
that, and the new ones better.)  I lost that argument, because the others were
convinced that "bigger means less reliable."  An analogy about jumbo jets vs.
smaller plans did not help.  It was only when the competition [viz., IBM]
introduced the 308x series, with its multi-megabyte diagnostic code, and MTBF
in months vice hours, that the argument was over.

I'm not suggesting a "standard for reliability."  I am saying that the
effort to make standards can help us appreciate the diversity of our needs,
and the adoption of standards can raise our level of expectations.

Generally rather similar to the risks involved in using other "standard"
tools like compilers, assemblers, text editors, front-panel switches :-),
operating systems, etc.:  there is always a chance that the tool has not
been fully tested and will do the wrong thing silently, or that it will
not catch user errors that it is supposed to catch.

&gt;Is it reasonable to set some criteria ...

Lengthy use tells you something about the average density of bugs in the code,
but won't necessarily tell you about the one bug that's in precisely the wrong
place.  Thorough validation suites are better, although rarer.

Better yet are validation suites for the *application*, ones which do their
best to stress its components.  (Note, this is not the same as "black box"
validation suites written with no knowledge of said components.)  The fact is,
even well-proven tools can have obscure bugs lurking in them.  Case in point:
the C compiler in V7 Unix, an unambitious compiler written by a very good
programmer and exhaustively shaken down by widespread use, had a bug in its
32-bit-divide routine that was not found until people -- specifically, some of
my users -- stumbled over it.  The code made some assumptions about the
hardware that were true, at least most of the time, of older pdp11 processors
but not of the new 11/44 we had.  The most interesting part was that my fix for
the problem appears to have also cured some much rarer misbehavior found even
on older processors.  The values returned by that routine may have been wrong,
occasionally, all along.

One simply cannot afford to place implicit trust in *any* of the tools used to
build a sensitive application.  As with "end to end" arguments in networking,
to be sure that the final product is right, one must test it directly and not
rely on trusted tools.

About a month ago, I moved to my office, in my new job.  A sun 3/140
workstation was on my desk.  Being more of a thoeretical person, I barely
touched it.  The first day at work hadn't finished and I had a strong
discomfort in my left eye.  When I went home, I had to take my contact lenses
out immediately.  Next day at work, the discomfort became even stronger.  I
have been wearing contact lenses for seven years now but had never felt
something like that before.  This continued during the whole week.

On Saturday, I was surprised to discover that the discomfort had almost gone.
On Sunday, I was feeling perfect.  This prompted me to think that it had
something to do with my work.  The arrangement on my desk is as follows (view
from the top) :

   |----------------||----------------------------------|
   |   ----------   ||                                  |
   |   :        :   ||                                  |
   |   :  SUN   :   ||             My  desk             |
   |   :        :   ||                                  |
   |   ----------   ||           o          o           |
   |   |keyboard|   ||           |          |           |
   |----------------||-----------|----------|-----------|
                                  \===&lt;&gt;===/   &lt;-- Me !
                                  ----------
As you can see, (you should be able to :-)) my head is in the path of the
stream of air coming from the ventilation holes (:) of the sun.  This air, not
only has a large enough speed (if you put your hand in front of my face, you
can sense the draft) but also is dryer, hence has lower relative humidity, than
the rest of the air in the room.  This means that it dries my contact lenses a
lot faster than usual.  I think this was the cause of the discomfort.

In order to try my hypothesis, on Monday morning, I blocked the ventilation
holes, using a triangular calendar that was on my desk, as follows (front view,
as if you are sitting in front of the computer) :

     |------------|
     |            |
     |   Screen   |
     |            |
     |------------|
     -------------- ____  &lt;--- One sheet of the calendar
   |----------------|   ^
   :   SUN  CPU     :  / \  &lt;-- Calendar
   |----------------| /   \

As you can see, the draft is now redirected sideways, away from me, and I don't
have any problems anymore.  The Sun should be O.K. since the one inch minimum
ventilation clearance, required by the manufacturers, is satisfied.  Of course,
you could argue that if I was hacking away on my sun, the draft would not fall
on me, which makes this a RISK of NOT using a computer :-).

Not only is it possible to pop off the grey cover and use the diagnostic
modulars that are commonly found on the sides of houses (or the nearest
telephone pole), but it is also possible to access nearly every line in an
area of a city fairly easily.  Simply find one of the grey boxes usually at
the base of a phone line tpole where the cable switches from above ground
to below ground.  These junction boxes will usually have x0,000 thousand
twisted pair lines connected together and hanging over a metal bar.  Simply
pick one, and patch in w/a pair of aligator clips.  This can also be done
inside of the black covers hanging on telephone poles.

If you really want to create some havoc, cut a couple of twisted pairs in
really hard to reach places...

On a related note, a story:

Our neighbor's hired some people to come in and clean their house.  It was done
in a rather odd fashion; you call a friend of the cleaners who then told the
person that someone called for them.  The cleaner would then return the call--
but would never have a number that they could be reached at.  No big deal, they
were using a pay phone.... wrong.  The person had a phone w/ aligator clip
instead of RJ-11 male connnector in a bucket.  Acting like they were pruning
the bushes, they would tap a neighbor's line and call whenever they needed....

It really does happen!

Whenever my local telephone company (Illinois Bell) installs new service
or alters existing service they move the telephone network interface
outside.  They do this to simplify their access for testing.

When I had a second telephone line installed at my home, the installer was
about to replace the existing network interface in the basement with a
gray box outside.  It took me some time to convince the installer to put
the network interface inside.

I have just discovered that our local Electricity Supply Company is 
using PC's and now even X-windowed VMS &amp; Unix systems to bring circuits
up and down: an iconic display allows a mouse-click and a keyboard
confirm to activate a circuit breaker, through comms links to the grid. 

Apparently NO physical token exchange is used between linespeople
and controllers: A verbal confirmation, coupled to somebody watching the 
breaker come in or out is all that is used.

Perhaps I'm being too paranoid, but If I were a linesman I'd want to
see the key for that segment in my hands before I climbed the tower,
much as permanent way crews do (used to?) for track repairs, or train 
drivers for bi-directional single-line working.

Should  automated systems maintain physical key/token exchanges from the 
past? is there an electronic "equivalent" that could be used instead?

On the plus side, They're using Radar scans of lightning strikes and
the PC network to offer some predictive services: they try and direct
line-crews to be on the alert *before* a storm reaches their section.

On the whole I think the use of computers, especially bitmapped displays
is beneficial in this area: they can condense a lot of information into
one screen, in a simple and intuitive form. Of course, providing some
active control has an "inverted" effect: simple mistakes can propagate out
into catastrophies.

Last week, I went to our local bank to do a money transfer to an american bank.
Though the clerk had a terminal on her desk, she fetched a typewriter and had
to type everything on a paper form. This surprised me a bit as the bank says
they are very up to date with technology, but that's something else. I gave her
a piece of paper with all the addresses on the one side (recipient and bank),
and on the other side, there was the bank routing number and the account
number. I thought she had done everything all right, took my copy of the form,
paid the thing and went home. When I came home, the bank had already closed as
it was 18.25. I took the form out and discovered that she had not filled in the
bank routing number. This made me curious and I took out my little paper and
checked the form... BINGO! I found out that she had written the address of the
recipient correctly, but had written the zip code of the bank as the account
number and no bank routing number, except: Household Bank, Columbus, Ohio. Next
morning I ran to the bank and told them about this. They immediately called
their headquaters as all those forms are sent of after the bank closes.
Luckily, they could take the form out of the stack and everything was all
right. The clerk said :"Oh, there was something on the back side, too? I only
read the front side.". She didn't even notice!

But imagine if the computer had done this immediately...  either the computer
would have rejected the input or I could have paid the whole thing twice..

I would like to consider here a class of problems that has not been addressed
specifically in RISKS, although its components are familiar.  The RISKS Forum
has addressed alarm systems that could not adequately be debugged under truly
real circumstances.  There was also the example of the earliest Antarctic ozone
depletion data, which was systematically rejected by the analysis program for
being *too* anomalous.  The potential for a combination of these two types of
problems might occur in aircraft monitoring during flight, as follows.

   Sensitive sensors in hostile environments (such as engines) sometimes
   report unrealistic or off-scale readings due to noise or interference.
   Consequently software monitoring the sensor may be programmed to ignore
   values beyond a certain threshold, on the grounds that such extreme
   readings must be the results of extraneous events.  If the ignored sensor
   reading was "real", however, other more remote sensors might pick up -- and
   accept -- less extreme readings.  This appears to be a potential problem in
   a variety of control systems.

In the absence of any definitive information about the British Midland 737
crash, such a hypothesis seems just as plausible as any other.  The *left*
engine was reportedly vibrating wildly (possibly due to a broken fan blade),
but the pilots for some reason(s) shut off the (good) right engine.  The
extreme vibration in the left engine might indeed have produced hitherto
unexperienced sensor readings that designers -- or the software folks -- felt
would have to be impossible.  The vibration from the left engine would have
been transmitted -- much attenuated -- through the entire airframe, and might
have been reported at a much more "reasonable" intensity by the vibration
sensors of the right-hand engine.  It does not take much of a leap in
imagination for the computer program to conclude that it was the *right* engine
that was malfunctioning.

In any event, this possible fault mode represents another case of
LOW-PROBABILITY / HIGH-CONSEQUENCE ACCIDENTS [1], and thus deserves explicit
attention.  Unfortunately it is just one more such combinatory fault mode.

One of Atlantis' main computers (one of the processors in the two pairs of the
2x2 + 1 backup architecture) failed on 7 May.  For the first time ever the
astronauts made repairs -- in this case by substituting a spare processor.  It
took them about 3.5 hours to gain access to the computer systems by removing a
row of lockers on the shuttle mid-deck, and another 1.5 hours to check out the
replacement computer.

It is ironic that such a replacement was so difficult, but not surprising.  My
old friend Al Hopkins, who at MIT Instrumentation Lab (now Draper Lab) designed
the Apollo on-board guidance computer, told me years ago how carefully they had
planned the packaging so that the astronauts would be able to make repairs on
the fly (as it were).  NASA officials would have none of it, and buried the
computer several layers underneath other equipment.  Apparently that tradition
has continued.  Perhaps the success of the Atlantis crew will change things.

During STS-9, Nov-Dec 83, multiple primary computers on the Columbia failed at
the same time, and delayed the return to earth.  On one hand, the calculations
say that losing three processors would be a rare event.  However, here we have
another example of a low-probability / high-consequence accident -- especially
if it involved the backup and one of each of the pairs.  Furthermore, since the
software is the same in all four of 2x2 the main processors, they would all
have failed consistently, and been deemed correct.  (And we just reported the
serious problem in the Magellan software caught before Atlantis' launch, noted
in <A HREF="/Risks/8.67.html">RISKS-8.67</A>!) In the case of pairwise disagreement among both pairs, there is
always the fifth, backup, computer, separately programmed.  As far as I know,
the shuttles have never had to rely on the backup computer software, so it
might be preferable to make processor replacements among the main four rather
than resort to the backup...

Excerpted from today's New York Times:

  Is the slight risk of contracting cancer from Alar too high a price to pay
for crisper apples?  Is the dramatic increase in milk production available
through genetically engineered growth hormones worth the unknown risk to
children's health?  If a few aging aircraft suffer explosive decompressions,
should all old airlines be grounded?

  Risks to health and safety and the complex questions of public policy they
create are seemingly everywhere these days.  And while there is little
statistical evidence that the hazards of daily life are on the rise, a wide
range of academic and business experts believe that American's perception of
increased peril is stifling technology, wasting billions of dollars, and,
ironically, making it more difficult to contain the most serious risks.

  ... by broad statistical measures, Americans have never been safer ...

  Even the high-profile threats have not changed the risks of untimely death or
injury.  The skies may be crowded, the planes aging and the pilots
inexperienced, but the trend in aircraft fatalities is downward. ...

  Life-saving medicines have been less dramatically affected, but even here,
the measures to compensate for risk can radically change the economic of
distribution ...

  The Environmental Protection Agency also regards itself as handicapped by
Congressional and public misperception of relative risk. ...

  What explains the public's decreasing tolerance of some risks and apparent
indifference to others? ... perceived risk is not always related to the
probability of injury.

  Easily tolerated risks include ones that people can choose to avoid (chain
saws, skiing), that are familiar to those exposed (smoking), or that have been
around for a long term (fireworks).  Poorly tolerated risks are involuntary
(exposure to nuclear waste), have long delayed effects (pesticides), or unknown
effects (genetic engineering).

  ... nuclear and chemical technologies fare especially badly in such
subjective rankings.  Indeed the general acceleration of technical change and
integration of new technology in products helps to explain the increase in
public anxiety about risk.  ...

Today's New York Times (Monday 8 May) has a front-page article title "Life's
Risks:  Balancing Fear Against Reality of Statistics".  It's the first of two
articles on "risk and public policy".

The article is ... well worth reading.  Here's an interesting quotation:

  Peter W. Huber, and engineer, lawyer and author of "The Legal Revolution and
  its Consequences" notes that ... "safety taxes" [extra costs charged by
  suppliers to pay for potential lawsuits] are added to the price of thousands
  of ... goods and services, distorting production and reducing living
  standards.  By Mr. Huber's reckoning, the safety tax represents 30 percent of
  the cost of a step ladder, one-third the cost of a ride on a Long Island tour
  bus and $300 of the cost of giving birth in New York City.

On a recent flight, the cabin crew was a bit late in starting the in-flight
movie.  The flight took less time than expected, so the movie's climactic
showdown scene began just after plane touched down.  Many of the passengers
became noticeably irritated at the flight attendants pre- and post-landing
announcements which interrupted the movie's audio.  This was a tow-in gate
so the engines were shut down well before arriving at the gate.  Without
engine power, an APU supplies electrical power.  On the switch-over,
however, the power glitch reset the audio channel controllers to the default
channel (8) which is silent.  It is common on commercial aircraft to have
"unimportant" control systems (such as the individual seat lighting and
audio) reset on power glitches.  This is not a safety problem.  Is it?

When the audio went dead on this flight, most of the passengers didn't know
what happened and pushed their flight attendant call buttons.  Same of the
more irate passengers repeatedly pushed it, causing the alert tone to sound
almost continuously.  (This was what I could see in first class. I can only
imagine what was happening in the coach cabin where passengers had to
explicitly pay extra for headsets and where there were more passengers.)

I would suspect that the official justification for the flight attendant
call button system is to alert the crew to emergencies.  During this
incident, any signaling of an emergency would not have been noticed.  I also
suspect that a failure analysis of the audio system did not foresee the
implications of a power glitch reseting the channel.  This is an example of
the most common reason for safety problems; the designers don't see all the
possible circumstances that the design will face, particularly where people
are involved.

The fix to this problem is trivial; make the default channel one with some
material on it, preferably one of the movie channels (1 through 4).  I
wonder if the current design was to save some small amount of power.

Another disconcerting observation was that the cabin crew did not seem to
understand what had happened either.  They seemed unable to help the
passengers.  They made repeated visits to the passengers who contined to
re-press their call buttons.  All that had to be done was to switch the channel
back to where it had been.

Two drafts of the following course were previously printed in RISKS digests.
These brought a host of suggestions from readers. Almost all these suggestions
were incorporated into the final version below. Volunteers are now being sought
to participate in the course this Fall (see Section 3. b. 2. below). These
volunteers could contribute items relating to computer ethics for posting on the
class bulletin board, correspond by e-mail with individual students on course
topics, and/or comment on students' postings on the class bulletin board.
The course will run from late August to early December. No money is presently
available as compensation for this service, but I will gladly contribute
letters of appropriate recognition for those who participate as resource persons
in all or part of the course. If interested, send a brief "vita" to Bob Barger
at CFRNB@ECNCDC.BITNET.

     15        Seminar members will reconvene as a group for the
               last meeting to allow for group reflection on the
               seminar experience and course evaluation.

   Exam week   Final examination

    Writing component

   Students will type thirteen 30-to-50 line (i.e., one-to-two
   page) reactions to the on-line electronic bulletin board
   readings. Students will "post" these reactions (i.e.,
   electronically send them to the mainframe computer bulletin
   board set aside for members of this seminar). In their
   reactions, students will: 1) identify the particular
   publication or publications to which they are reacting, 2)
   identify the particular issue or issues raised in the
   publication(s), 3) identify the ethical implications of the
   issue or issues, 4) identify the ethical paradigm used by the
   author, 5) add their own reasons for agreement or disagreement
   with the viewpoint of the publication's author, 6) and,
   finally, offer an alternative solution or viewpoint to that
   presented by the author, or present other appropriate
   considerations not raised by the author or covered in their
   own (i.e., the student's own) previous comments. The
   instructor will send weekly, by confidential electronic mail,
   a grade on the student's posted reaction, together with
   whatever comments the instructor thinks helpful. The student's
   original posted reaction will also be open to public comment
   by the other students in the seminar [this is accomplished by
   posting notes to the bulletin board, referencing the original
   posted reaction]. These latter comments by the other students
   in the seminar will be considered along with classroom
   discussion in computing the "participation" factor of the
   student's semester grade.

    Evaluation

   Each student's semester grade for the seminar will be
   calculated according to the following weighted formula:

      - 13 posted reactions (at 5% each)    = 65%

      - Participation (based on class
        discussion and posted comments
        on other students' reactions)       = 20%

      - Final Exam                          = 15%

3.  Implementation :

   a. This course will be taught by: Robert N. Barger, Ph.D.

   b. Materials in the course will include:

      1) Texts:
         a) Deborah Johnson,  Computer Ethics  (Englewood
            Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1985)
         b) Notes on Systematic Philosophies from Dr. Barger's
            Philosophy 1800 class (furnished without charge to
            seminar members)
         c) Postings on the above-mentioned ECN electronic
            bulletin board lists.

      2) Resource people: Computer professionals (e.g.,
      administrators, systems analysts, programmers, etc.) will
      be utilized as guest contributors to the class. This will
      be accomplished by personal appearances, as well as by
      electronically mediated conferencing (e.g., postings, e-
      mail, relay round-tables, etc.).

   c. Exceptional costs: None, unless the student wishes to use a
      modem to access the computer. In this case the student will
      be responsible for any personal equipment costs and/or long
      distance phone charges.

   d. Effective date: Fall, 1989.


 Date approved by Senior Seminar Committee:  February 24, 1989.

 Date approved by Council on Academic Affairs:  April 20, 1989.

I have had several high-level inquiries lately concerning census database
privacy/confidentiality/integrity, and integrity of the analysis used to govern
redistricting -- as well as more on the confidentiality and integrity of
computer systems used in elections.  There are several risks worth noting here.

 * Early knowledge by one party of census data could be used to plan
   appropriate gerrymandering and campaign strategies.

 * Manipulation of census data (in gathering, computer data entry, and storage)
   could influence redistricting, at both state and federal levels.

One of my recent visitors was ostensibly interested in protecting the
redistricting process from tampering (through legislation, oversight, etc.),
but I had a nagging feeling that there might also conceivably have been some
interest in how that process could be subverted.  1992 is not too far away, so
it seems appropriate to raise these problems now.

&gt; NASA officials ... buried the computer several layers underneath other
&gt; equipment.  Apparently that tradition has continued...

NASA has a considerable tradition of implicitly assuming that the only failures
that can happen are the ones in the book.  For example, it was pure luck that
the Apollo 13 astronauts survived, because that particular type of accident --
Service Module systems completely dead -- had been classed as unsurvivable and
no preparations had been made for it.  Using the Lunar Module's life-support
systems for most of a mission required using Command Module lithium-hydroxide
canisters in the LM... and the two were not mechanically compatible, and no
adapter was provided (one was improvised).  Using the LM computer to navigate
home was possible only because one or two people at MIT had loudly insisted
that the CM and LM computers should be identical.  Nobody had ever thought
about how to separate CM from LM without the SM maneuvering rockets, but
improvisation saved the day again.  All the emergency-planning emphasis had
been on dealing with *foreseeable* problems; very little attention had been
given to building versatility into the system so that *unforeseen* difficulties
could be handled.  One might speculate that this is a "characteristic error" of
organizations that try hard to plan for all possible failures.

Yesterday, I received a check from my mother for a substantial amount of money.
I took said check to the bank and deposited it, and then asked how long it
would be held.  I expected an answer of "five days," since the check was from
another state.

Much to my surprise, the teller said that there would be no hold at all on the
check.  You see, it was printed out by Mon's ImageWriter, and hence was a
computer-generated check (courtesy of "Dollars and Sense" for the Mac SE, as I
recall).  The bank's policy was to not put a hold on *any* computer-generated
checks.

The RISKS of such a policy are mind-boggling.  One who desires to commit larceny
on a large scale need only acquire an ImageWriter, a Mac, some program that
prints out checks, and a supply of checks that can be fed into the printer.

First, as a followup to the article about the movie audio problem reported in 
Risks 8.68:  My understanding of FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations) is that
during landings and takeoffs, everything that could conceivably interfere
with the safe, rapid evacuation of the A/C has to be stowed.  It wasn't noted
what sort of A/C the writer was flying in, but, unless it was one of the
newer widebodies with ALL of the move screens embedded in the overhead or
in some other fashion set up so as to NOT block ANY aisles, lights, etc,
then the crew was almost certainly in violation of several FARs.  In any
case, I think the hazards presented by the continuation of the movie into
the landing (people tied to thier seats with headsets, not paying attention
to crew instructions, lighting not set full on, headsets preventing people from
hearing crew instructions, etc) would FAR outweigh the potential anger
from folks who wanted to watch the whole movie.  I would suggest that the
writer contact the airline, and investigate the possibility of reporting
the violation to the FAA.

I own a HeathKit ID5001 Weather Computer, which is essentially a set of basic
weather instrumentation (Pressure, Temp, Humidity, Wind Speed/Dir) controlled
by a Z80C.  The Z80's programming resides in an EPROM in the unit.  One of the
"features" of this unit is that it is battery backed, and will continue to
record data during a power outage.  It also has memories, which contain things
like High and Low Temps, Highest Wind Gust, and other goodies.  Heath is
pitching this unit very hard at Aviation users, and makes a very clear point of
noting in their ads and documentation that the unit correctly computes average
wind direction/velocity (in compliance with FARs) over a 1 minute interval.
Since the unit will potentially be used to provide pilot briefings at small
(uncontrolled) airports, I think it's important that the company be forthcoming
with any "bug" fixes and/or corrections to their code.  Unfortunately, that has
not been my experience:

A few weeks ago, I called Heath Technical Support (on a different matter) and
asked "by the way, I also have a 5001, have their been any ROM changes since I
bought the unit several years ago (I bought one of the first production
units)?"  The answer was an unqualified "No, there have been no changes since
the unit went into production".  Last week, I ordered and received the
"Technical Manual" for the unit.  On about page 5, taking up a whole page, was
a listing of the 4 different RELEASED versions of the ROM, and the checksums
(there was also a listing for a 5th ROM version, with the notation "Never
Shipped").  On the next page was a listing of "Operational Characteristics",
one of which was a note that read:

  "On battery backed units from the first production run, there was a problem
  such that after a power failure, the true high wind gust reading is replaced
  by a random value".  It went on to note that this problem was corrected
  by a later release of the ROM.

To their credit, when I called Heath and reported that I had the problem, they
agreed to send my a ROM, at no charge.  But, I could NOT get the person I spoke
to to tell me what ELSE had changed.

The March 1989 Scientific American has a very interesting little piece in
its "Science and the Citizen" column, talking about the growing acceptance
of computerized proofs in mathematics.  It cites the 1976 Haken/Appel
proof of the four-color theorem, and the controversy that followed, but
observes that at least in principle, that result could be checked by hand.
Now we have a significant proof for which hand checking is out of the
question:  Clement W.H. Lam of Concordia University has used 3000 hours
on a Cray-1, spread over two years, proving an instance of one of Gauss's
conjectures ("there are no finite projective planes of order 10", to be
precise).  This proof, unlike the Haken/Appel one, is meeting little
opposition, despite its complexity (100 trillion cases) and the fact that
it was done with a collection of small programs rather than a single
systematic large one.

Lam himself says he was hoping for a positive result, which would be easy
to check, rather than a negative one.  But he is fairly confident in his
result, citing two reasons:  (a) the programs did do some internal
consistency checks; (b) the result agrees with "mathematical intuition"
(for example, an order-10 projective plane is known to be forbidden to
have any symmetry, which apparently is almost unheard-of for such an
object).

Mathematicians are coming to accept computers, it seems.  Ronald L.
Graham of Bell Labs observes that nobody has flatly refused to accept
Lam's result, as some did for the Haken/Appel result.  Haken himself
observes that there is a more mundane explanation for that:  many of
the objectors were older mathematicians who have since retired.

Haken and Graham both observe that "simple theorems should have simple
proofs" is a religious belief rather than a law of nature, and is
verifiably false in some simple artificial mathematical systems.

Except if recent major changes have been applied to the space shuttle
avionics system, the 5 General Purpose Computers (GPC) are not organized
in 2xpairs + 1 back-up, but in a redundant set of 4 computers + 1
back-up. A 2x2 configuration (Stratus-like) would not fulfill the
requirement of remaining operational after two non-simultaneous or
non-identical faults. With the 4-set configuration, "the first two [GPCs]
to fail ... must be identified to the crew as failed; the third should
also be identified as failed, but only by achieving as much coverage as is
possible within limited processing and storage overhead." (*)
That means that the 4 GPCs tolerate 2 independant faults and have a high
probability to tolerate the 3rd fault (the coverage of the built-in test
equipment -BITE- is 96.8 %).

This is achieved by voting mechanisms, automatic diagnostics and (manual
or automatic) reconfiguration.

The back-up GPC takes control (after manual reconfiguration) only
- if the voting mechanisms are defeated by two simultaneous identical
  faults (2 faulty GPCs have identical outputs), or by the 3rd fault
  if not covered by the BITE : 3.2% probability,
- or if a software error disbles the 4 main GPCs.

This morning on National Public Radio there was a report on a trial in
St. Louis, MO.  The juryless trial is a class action suit against the
Continental Can Company, which has more than one plant in St. Louis.  The
company is being sued by a group of more than 200 former employees who allege
that a computer program was used to target them for termination before they
could reach retirement age, thus denying them their pensions (and presumably
saving money for the company.)

The report went on to say that Continental Can was the leading beer-can maker
in the sixties, but fell on hard times in the seventies and has had layoffs.

Although the report did not specifically state it, I assume that the laws that
pertain here would be those protecting older workers against age discrimination
-- not against computerized screening (whether for age or anything else.)

	This attitude goes back a ways. Around 1980 I almost had to swallow
a dinner tab for 20+ people because accounting had a strict rule of no
re-imbursement of restaurant tabs without "a cash-register receipt". The fact
that the restaurant in question liked to consider itself "high class" and thus
only issued hand-written receipts did not impress them. Five minutes work with
a dot-matrix printer and a pair of scissors saved me $300. Had I not been
so ethical it could have saved me more...

Was the signature also printed by the computer?  I would hope not, since 
anyone who can get at your mother's computer would clear your mother's account.

As for the bank holding a computer generated check, their policy seems 
strange. Most companies pay employees with computer generated checks. Do the 
banks treat these checks any different?   I'm very curious.

Stores that cash payroll and similar checks (very common in many farming
communities) are vulnerable to this assumption as well.  People who would never
take a fake $500 bill think nothing of taking a fake payroll check.

I read of a ring of payroll check counterfeiters that was caught recently.  The
(new) assistant manager who was called to approve the check had worked for the
company the check was allegedly drawn against, and noticed that it didn't look
like the paychecks he'd received.  Then he looked more closely and noticed
misspellings, incorrect addresses, etc., and called the police.

It manifests itself in a variety of ways, but the basic issue is that computers
are making it easier and cheaper to generate documents that look official and
genuine.

Just a note to let you know of a possible risk to all of those of you who
drive cars with electronic fuel injection systems.

My father's newly acquired Volvo 480i has an interesting characteristic.  When
i operate my VHF ham radio gear (100 watts output at 144MHz), the car gives a
cough (!) if accelerating hard when i press the transmit switch.  The radio
signal is clearly getting into the ignition/injection microprocessor and
causing some sort of false triggering.  The problem is only of very brief
duration ( approximately a quarter of a second) after which it clears itself.
This is only noticeable when accelerating hard in low gears (45MPH in second,
65-70MPH in third).  The local Volvo dealer was somewhat perplexed (hes only a
salesman, not a RF engineer, after all!) and said he would contact the
importers to see if there's any modification (suppressor kit) to get round the
fault.

Point is, if 100 watts can cause the effect, is there any risk in driving
past other VHF transmitters (TV, FM radio, police, military installations)
where the transmitted power may well be 250 kilowatts????

When last we heard about Kevin Mitnick, the hacker once called "as
dangerous with a keyboard as a bank robber with a gun,"  the judge had
rejected a plea bargain as too lenient, saying Mitnick deserved more than
the agreed one year of jail time.  (See RISKS 8.65)

According to a wire service story in the 10 May 89 'Los Angeles Times,'
Mitnick has now reached a new agreement, with no agreed-upon prison
sentence.  He pleaded guilty to stealing a DEC security program and illegal
possession of 16 long-distance telephone codes belonging to MCI
Telecommunications Corp.  The two charges carry a maximum of 15 years and a
$500,000 fine.  The government agreed to lift telephone restrictions placed
on Mitnick since he was jailed in December.

At DEC's request, Mitnick will help the firm identify and fix holes in its
security software to protect itself from other hackers.  He will also
cooperate in the government's probe of Leonard DiCicco, a fellow hacker.
(DiCicco is the 'friend' referred to in RISKS 8.13 who turned Mitnick in.)

The credit bureau of TRW has been working with the Social Security
Administration to verify its database of 140 million names and Social Security
numbers. In order to cover the cost, TRW is paying the Social Security
Administration $1 million, while Social Security Administration will provide a
matching $1 million.

Since the Social Security Administration is asking for a budget increase for
their computer and telecommunications systems, several legislators are outraged
by the fact they they are spending $1 million for this non-government project.
Claiming that the project is "as far away from the mission of the Social
Security Administration as anything I have ever come across", Senator David
Pryor (D-Ark) questioned the competence and credibility of Social Security
Administration Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy and asked for an investigation by
the HHS inspector general.

In addition, several lawmakers such as Dale Bumpers (D-Ark) believe the project
to be a violation of civil liberties. Said Bumpers, "I don't like any public
institution releasing an individual's private information." The American Law
Division of the Congressional Research Service has already concluded that the
project is a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974.

Railroad Brings Far-Flung Dispatchers Together in Huge Computerized Bunker
by Daniel Machalba, Wall Street Journal, May 9, 1989

Starting next month, Union Pacific Railroad train dispatchers will begin
working at computers in a windowless bunker built inside an old freight house
in Omaha, Neb.  The railroad designed the structure's 18-inch-thick,
reinforced-concrete walls to withstand, if need be, a telphone pole hurled by a
180-mile-an-hour tornado.  The precautions show the importance and risks of
railroads' move into centralized, computer-aided train dispatching.  By
consolidating dispatchers now located at 10 far-flung field offices from Oregon
to Omaha, Union Pacific expects to reap savings of more than $20 million a
year.  But it must also safeguard its new center from disruptions that could
cripple railroad operations on a wide scale.  "The bunker will survive anything
short of a nuclear attack," says Michael Walsh, chairman of the rail unit of
Union Pacific Corp., Bethlehem, PA.

Last March, CSX Corp. opened a similar computerized dispatching center in
Jacksonville, FL.  The company says the new center will reduce the number of
dispatchers needed to run its 20,000 miles of railroad to 350 from 550, while
consolidating 34 dispatch offices into one.  At the heart of the new center is
computer software that can track the progress of trains and automatically
switch tracks and signals, so that a fast freight train can pass a slower one.
Freed of such routine tasks, dispatchers will be able to concentrate on special
situations.  Railroad officials say such efficiencies will make it possible for
each dispatcher to control double or triple the amount of track.  They also
hope that bringing the dispatchers into one big room, with panoramic views of
trackage projected onto wall screens, will reduce communications problems and
resultant train delays.

CSX dispatcher Jan Cato gives one example of how the centers are more
efficient.  In order for Amtrak's southbound Silver Star to overtake and safely
pass two freight trains on its way from Savannah, GA to Jacksonville, she
merely types in the locomotive numbers, speeds and other vital data about the
trains and the computer does the rest of the work.  Previously she had to throw
no less than 50 levers manually to line up switches and signals.

"The computer does the thinking when it comes to things such as tonnage, speed,
and priority," said Union Pacific dispatcher Bob McKenzie last month in the
company's employee magazine.  "But it can't determine when you have problems
like a train with an engine down, broken air hose or a train down during
inspection of a hot-box [overheated axle].  That's when a dispatcher needs to
step in."

Some dispatchers worry about information overload.  "I have my doubts I could
physically handle the expanded territory that would come with the new system,"
says Richard Pennisi, a Union Pacific dispatcher in Cheyenne, WY., who is
taking a cash settlement rather than moving to take a job at the Omaha dispatch
center.

Other railroads say they are reluctant to move their dispatchers to a single
location, fearing a widening gap between dispatchers and the territories they
cover.  "We just don't think we can operate the railroad as well without the
day-to-day, eye-to-eye contact," says Jack Martin, a senior assistant vice
president of Norfolk Southern Corp.  However, officials of Burlington Northern
Inc.'s rail unit are closely watching the new central facilities.  Burlington
Northern, which has already cut the number of its dispatch offices in half from
14 a decade ago, is considering further consolidation to one or two locations.

CSX's dispatch center, which is housed in a circular buildiing 150 feet in
diameter is permitting the railroad to retire antiquated dispatching facilities
such as a 50 year old one in Deshler, Ohio.  Dick Fliess, a CSX Transport vice
president, says the company has solved software problems that slowed some train
operations when the new center opened.

At Union Pacific's dispatch center, which will cost about $47 million, the
railroad is also consolidating its crew-calling staff, previously scattered in
four regional centers, into second story offices above the dispatching bunker
on the ground floor.

  [Someone in the rec.railroad newsgroup pointed out that there is a real risk
  of centralizing dispatching beyond the obvious one of a system failure.  The
  UP is likely to be one of the railroads that moves around the MX trains.  
  With centralized dispatching it becomes easier to determine that a particular
  block of cars always move around together (and thus possibly contain MX's).
  Furthermore, knocking out the center not only shuts down the railroad, but
  also disables (or at least impedes) the mobility of the MX.  Chuck]

Excerpts from "Travel agents in a holding pattern after airline ticket computer
stalls", San Jose Mercury News, 5/13/89 (reprinted from N.Y. Times):

  "The nation's largest airline computer reservation system, American
Airlines' Sabre, inadvertently shut down for almost 12 hours Friday,
disrupting the operations of about 14,000 travel agencies nationwide.  A
large portion of American itself was left without information about who was
booked on flights and whether seats were available, and the airline was
forced to revert to writing tickets by hand to serve tens of thousands of
travelers.  American said, however, that there were no major disruptions of
its 2,300 daily flights.
  The computer shutdown was one of the longest for what has been considered
one of the airline industry's most reliable reservation systems.  [....]
John Hotard, manager of corporate communications for American, said the
Sabre system, housed in an underground bunker-like building in Tulsa, OK,
failed shortly after midnight Friday while workers at the computer center
were installing additional disk drives as part of a system expansion.
  Service was not restored until noon Friday, he said.  But some travel
agencies said their terminals did not resume functioning until one or two
hours after that.  Apparently, no information about reservations and other
travel plans was lost during the failure.   [....]
  Hotard said the problem with the computer system was a failure in its
software.  He said the part of the American computer system that handles
flight operations -- like crew scheduling, fuel loads and weight loads on
American's fleet of airplanes -- was not affected, so flight operations were
not disrupted.

    [The system has EIGHT IBM 3090-200 E mainframes, designed to survive
    ordinary hardware malfunctions.  This appears to be a software 
    upgrade screwup that downed the whole system.  PGN]

An article by James Rainey in the 'Los Angeles Times' 12-May-89 reports
that Roberto Perales Hernandez has been jailed twice in the last three
years as a suspect in a 1985 Chicago residential burglary.  The authorities
confused him with another Roberto Hernandez due to a single entry in the
FBI's National Crime Information Center computer.

The two Roberto Hernandezes are the same height, about the same weight, have
brown hair, brown eyes, tattoos on their left arms, share the same birthday,
and report Social Security numbers which differ by only one digit!
 
The falsely imprisoned man has filed suit charging the Hawthorne (CA)
Police Dept., Los Angeles County, and the state with false imprisonment,
infliction of emotional distress, and civil rights violations stemming from
the most recent arrest last year.  He had previously received a $7,000
settlement from the county for holding him 12 days in 1986 before realizing
he was the wrong man.  In the latest incident, he was held for seven days
then freed with no explanation.

From the 'Los Angeles Times' 12-May-89:

   Two former Tampa, FL TV news managers have been charged with illegally
   tapping into phone lines and computers at another station to gain a
   news edge over their competitors.  Former new director Terry Cole and
   assistant news director Michael Shapiro at WTSP-TV have been charged
   with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of 
   information from WTVT-TV through computer phone lines, authorities
   said.  Their arraignment is set for May 19.  If convicted, each could
   face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years.  The two were fired from 
   WTSP when the station learned of the alleged thefts.  The break-ins
   began in November but were not noticed until Jan. 12, when WTVT's
   morning news producer noticed that files were missing, authorities 
   said.    Computer experts determined that an intruder had rifled the
   files.  Authorities said Spapiro knew WTVT's security system thoroughly
   because he had helped set it up while working there as an assignment
   manager befroe being hired away from WTVT in October.

I have no idea what sort of charge "17 counts of computer hacking and
conspiracy in the theft of information" really is.

Two clarifications regarding the item in <A HREF="/Risks/8.70.html">RISKS-8.70</A> on the record exchange
involving the Social Security Administration and TRW:

  - The proposed transfer of the social security records to TRW came to an
    end after the plan was disclosed at an April hearing of the Senate
    Committee on Aging.

  - The primary concern expressed by members of Congress was the privacy
  violation, not the cost to SSA.  Senator Pryor said that he was glad the SSA
  had "seen fit to preserve the confidentiality of the Social Security files.
  Unfortunately," he said, "this action comes to late to protect some 150,000
  people whose files were violated in a test run conducted for TRW [in 1987]
  and for more than 3 million people on whom verifications were conducted for
  Citibank and other firms in past years."  The HHS Inspector General also
  described these activities as "the largest breach of privacy in the history
  of the program."

As a matter of privacy law, the plan violated a general provision in the
1974 Privacy Act which states that no agency should disclose any record
unless it obtains the consent of the record subject or a particular
exemption applies.  (None applied in this case).

Some attorneys within SSA were not convinced that the language in the
Privacy Act was dispositive, but a decision of the Supreme Court a month
before the Senate hearing affirming the privacy of computerized criminal
records stored by the federal government tipped the balance in favor of
stopping the program.

[ From the Montreal Gazette, 12 May 1989]

US AIR FORCE PROBES WHETHER TRANSMITTERS CAUSED BOMB TO DROP

Atlanta - US Air Force investigators are examining whether
electromagnetic radiation from military transmitters may have caused an
F-16 jet to accidentally drop a bomb on rural West Georgia last week,
and Air Force official said yesterday.

The possibility of electromagnetic interference, however, is only one
of several potential causes the Air Force and Army is investigating,
said Dee Tait, an official at Moody Air Force Base where the F-16 is
stationed.  A final accident report won't be ready for 30 to 90 days,
she said.

No one was injured in the May 4 explosion, but the 230 kilogram bomb
ripped through a wooded area and has prompted a Georgia congressman to
call for a review of Air Force flight procedures state wide.

According to forces officials, the inadvertent bombing occurred when one
of four armed jets from the 247th Tactical Fighter Wing at Moody was
training last Thursday over Fort Benning's "Kilo Impact Area" in
Muscogee County.

The pilot of the plane, who has not been identified, tried to release a
bomb over the practice range, but it would not drop.  As the pilot
circled back over Marion County, the bomb fell and its 90 kg of
explosives shook windows of houses 900 metres away.

[ Short explanation of EMI causes deleted ]

It [ EMI ] has been attributed to navigation problems with the Army's
UH-60 "Black Hawk" Helicopter, which has been banned from flying near
100 transmitters worldwide.

In the case of the F-16, high levels of electromagnetic radiation can
accidentally detonate electro-explosive devices, or EEDs, that release
bombs, missiles and fuel tanks from the underside of the plane,
according to an Air Force {\it Explosive Safety Standards} manual obtained
by the Macon {\it Telegraph and News}.

The vulnerability of Air Force planes with EEDs has become and issue at
Robins Air Force Base near Warner Robins, Ga., where the Air Force has
been shutting down part of the high-powered PAVE PAWS radar station
every time and EED-equipped plane lands at the base.

The Air Force operates four PAVE PAWS facilities, which use radar
powerful enough to probe objects in space.  A current study at the
Robins base is examining the power of the pulsed radar beams from PAVE
PAWS and whether it disrupts ultra-sensitive electronic equipment on
aircraft.

The partial shutdowns preceded a March 1988 Air Force report that stated
"the high power contained in PAVE PAWS pulses may pose a danger to
elecro-explosive devices carried on military and commercial aircraft."

Tait confirmed that the F-16 [involved in the incident ] had been equipped
with EEDs, tiny explosive charges that release the shackles that hold
the bomb onto the jet.  "They are looking into that," she said.
However, she added, "the bomb-release mechanisms on F-16s are designed
to preclude electromagnetic interference."

A colleague drew my attention to an article in Radio Communication
(Vol. 65, No. 5, May 1989), which made me realise belatedly just how
vulnerable we are to the effects of magnetic storms. Below I excerpt
from the article, without permission.

THE GEOMAGNETIC STORM OF 13 MARCH 1989

Ted Harris and David Kerridge, Geomagnetism Group, British Geological
Survey, 29 March 1989.

"The largest magnetic storm for 40 years started at 2am on 13 March
1989... The intensity of the storm was such that the aurora borealis
(northern lights), normally restricted to high latitudes, was seen
clearly in the south of England, and there were reports of
observations of the aurora in Italy and as far south as Jamaica.

"The rapid changes in the geomagnetic field during the storm induced
voltages in power lines, transoceanic cables, and telephone and cable
TV networks. In Quebec, transformers in the Canadian electricity
supply tripped, blacking out large areas of the Province and plunging
more than a million people into darkness. (No doubt with a
consequential blip in the birth-rate in nine months time!)

"Ionospheric disturbances caused disruption of radio communications
and resulted in the loss of TV reception in some areas. Satellite
communications were also affected - as were satellite orbits as the
increased ionospheric density produced extra drag.

"The increased radiation at high level created such potential hazards
that a Concorde airliner on a transatlantic route took a more
southerly flight path to avoid subjecting its passengers to radiation.
Astronauts aboard the the space shuttle `Discovery' would have been
prevented from working outside the space craft because of the danger.
The shuttle mission was recalled a day earlier than planned because of
computer malfunctions which could have been caused by the storm.

"At sea-level, North Sea exploration companies reported that `down-well'
instruments, used to steer drill heads, had experienced violent swings in
compass readings of up to 12 degrees! A Norwegian geophysical exploration
company reported that all surveying has been halted after receiving warnings of
the storm and its severity from GRG. The director of operations reported that
two navigation systems used to fix the position of survey ships, which were in
agreement prior to the storm, were now diverging. GPS (Global positioning
system) satellites experienced increased drag which retarded their orbits so
much that positional accuracy at the Earth's surface was lost. ...

"Solar activity is likely to peak during 1990 (Solar Maximum), resulting in
more magnetic storms and a generally high level of magnetic activity over the
next two years at least."

I strongly recommend the publication The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear
Power Stations, Health and Safety Executive, Her Majesty's Stationery
Office, December 1987.  It contains a thorough discussion of the way in
which society perceives, and tolerates, risks from different sources.  It
also contains interesting UK actuarial statistics (...in Britain, a man of
20 has roughly a 1 in 1000 chance of dying in a year, for a man of 40 it is
1 in 500, at sixty, it is 1 in 50 for a man, 1 in 100 for a woman ...).

There is a companion volume of comments received from trade and professional
groups.

Quick background: the Washington area Metro subway system uses fare cards with
a magnetic strip on the back.  You buy a card of some particular value; it
is debited as it is used (the fares are distance-sensitive) and each time 
you exit Metro the remaining value is recorded *and printed* on the farecard.
With this in mind, the following news article appeared in the 19 May issue
of the _Washington_Post_, p. C7 (as usual, without permission):

  DASH Magnets and Farecards: A Fatal Attraction

  Alexandria's DASH bus system [a suburban transit system] thought it was
  promoting public transit Wednesday when it gave riders 2,500 refrigerator
  magnets in honor of national "Transit Appreciation Day."

  Funny thing, though, how the magnets apparently erased the value of an
  unknown number of riders' Metro Farecards, officials said yesterday.

  "We didn't do it intentionally, and definitely apologize to our passengers 
  for any inconvenience," said DASH General Manager Sandy Modell.

  Metro officials said riders can obtain new cards by mailing the now
  useless ones to Metro's treasurer's office [...].

  The number of Farecards affected and the potential amount owed riders was
  not known yesterday, DASH and Metro officials said.

  The value of a Metro Farecard is magnetically encoded when the card is
  purchased.  Cards are scanned electronically when passengers pass them
  through the fare gates, which automatically deduct the trip fare.

  Apparently, the small thin magnets, which fit in wallets and change
  purses, erased the Farecards when they were stored together, said Metro
  spokeswoman Beverly Silverberg.

  "It happens all the time" when women carry purses with magnetic clasps 
  or riders carry other types of magnets, Silverberg said.  Modell warned
  that magnets can have the same effect on automated teller machine cards 
  and some credit cards.

  DASH bought the magnets, which included the DASH telephone number, from
  the American Public Transit Association, which offered them to transit
  agencies across the country, Modell said.  She did not know if any other
  systems were similarly affected.

  DASH passed out the magnets "as a token of appreciation" to riders,
  Modell said.

Some time ago several submissions dealing with the potential risks of
dive computers (which automatically monitor the nitrogen level in the
divers blood, and tell him when he must surface, etc.) appeared in
RISKS.  Since then, I acquired one myself.  My experience might be of
interest to others.

Soon after Christmas, two friends and I purchased three Oceanic
Datamaster II (a particular brand) dive computers.  At the same time, we 
also purchased "Slimline" compasses, which were designed to fit into the
same console.  All of the units (three of three) were eventually
returned due to defects:

1) Due to electromagnetic interference, when the computer was ON, the
compass would point in whichever direction the console pointed - making
completely useless.

2) One unit was broken when shipped (or was broken during shipping), and
never worked at all.

3) Among other features, the computer was supposed to report the "dive
time remaining", based on air consumption and no-decompression nitrogen
levels - whichever is less.  On one unit, this was not recomputed
correctly - stuck on 29 minutes, even when there was no air left in the
tank it was connected to.  (Yep, I'll just sit here and hold my breath
for 29 minutes...)

4) The last unit appeared to work correctly when checked out in the
pool, but failed completely on its first real dive, giving no readings
at all.

All three units were returned and replaced with and upgraded model, the
Datamaster Sport - all three of which have worked properly to date.  
The EMI problem was fixed with a redesigned console boot, which moved
the compass further away from the computer.  

Certainly, some of these problems should have been caught and corrected
by the manufacturer (Oceanic USA, inc.) - particularly the EMI
interference on the compass, which would have been obvious to anyone who
turned the unit on and tried to use it.  The other problems MAY have
been caused by shipping, although I doubt it, as the cartons arrived
undamaged.  In any case, presumably the unit will be subjected to some
rough handling during use, and should be designed handle it.

I think that the real problem here was improper and incomplete testing
of the product before it was shipped out the door - potentially, a VERY
serious RISK, given the nature of the activity is designed for. 

As has been stated many times before, computer readouts are no excuse to turn
off your brain, and it is not wise to rely on any one instrument.  In my
case, I dive with two complete sets of gauges (my old set plus my dive
computer), and I continue to work out nitrogen levels for myself.  Doing
otherwise would be very foolish.

DISCLAIMER:  I have NO CONNECTION whatsoever with OCEANIC USA or any
other dive equipment manufacturer (except that I own some of their
equipment).  The opinions stated above are my own.  The events which
inspired them are also mine (unfortunately).

                State bytes off more than it can chew
                    DSHS to scrap computer system
		 by Jim Simon, Times Olympia bureau

OLYMPIA -- After the state spent $20 million and nearly seven years trying to
computerize its public-assistance program, the first caseworkers to use the
so-called COSMOS system made their own discovery:  They could figure out a
client's benefits faster by hand than with the computer.
    The Department of Social and Health Services announced yesterday it was
swallowing its losses and terminating COSMOS, considered the most expensive,
and some say ill-advised, computerization effort ever undertaken by the state.
    ``The project needed to be stopped and we stopped COSMOS,'' said DSHS
Secretary Richard Thompson, the fifth agency head who has wrestled with the
system.  ``There's a lot of things that went wrong that we still have to look
at.  My concern was that we had to stop spending the money.''
    The state has so far spent about $4.1 million and federal agencies about
$15.2 million on COSMOS--the Community Services Management and Operations
System.  Thompson said DSHS ultimately may be liable for up to $4 million of
the federal share.
    A consultant's report released earlier this week recommended scuttling
COSMOS.  The report cited poor management, an overly complex design, difficulty
to use by caseworkers and the use of untested software.
    Proponents originally predicted the troubled system would save the state
money by allowing computers rather than caseworkers to calculate eligibility
for welfare, food stamps and medical assistance.
    COSMOS, designed by Pennsylvania-based UNISYS Corp., was thought so
advanced that Gov. Booth Gardner and some of the state's computer professionals
likened it to ``artificial intelligence.''
    But its complexity apparently kept it from working at all.
    That became obvious this year when the system was installed on a pilot
basis in the Longview and Vancouver DSHS offices, according to Thompson and
others.
    Workers there found it took up to twice as long to figure out a client's
eligibility from COSMOS as it did manually.  Using the computer resulted in
frequent errors in simple calculations, and perhaps most nerve-wracking for
caseworkers, the screen often went blank for long intervals.
    ``This was an effort to create artificial intelligence so the computer
could `think' about eligibility,'' Gardner said yesterday.  ``I don't think
we'll mess with artificial intelligence again.''
    But critics say DSHS had plenty of advance warning about just how high a
risk COSMOS represented.
    In 1982, when planning first began, the agency estimated it would cost
$10 million and be completed in 1985.
    But the agency later sought a more ambitious system that was to cost $22
million and be completed by the end of mid-1987.  Before killing COSMOS, the
most recent estimates were that it would cost $38 million and take until late
1990 to finish.
    Gerald Reilly, who headed the DSHS division of income assistance until
recently, said the agency decided to keep pressing on until they could test
COSMOS in the field.
    ``We believed you couldn't know how this would work until you took it that
far,'' Reilly said.
    Reilly and others acknowledge that the state was aware of problems UNISYS
had setting up similar systems for other states.
    ``But virtually all these big systems have troubles,'' Reilly said.  ``The
welfare programs themselves are very complex.''
    ``Killing COSMOS was a gutsy move by Thompson,'' said Rep. Gary Locke,
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  ``There's going to be a lot
of finger-pointing but there was no sense chasing the good money after the
bad.''
    The death of COSMOS could prove an embarrassment for UNISYS, which has
already been paid about $4.7 million.  Two sources said the state attorney
general's office is considering legal action.  The attorney general's office
declined to comment.
    A spokesman for UNISYS' local office also would not comment.
    Thompson said the agency will still pursue a system to computerize its
benefit programs.  But the next effort will probably use one of the 17 systems
certified by the federal government using technology that has been tested in
other states, he said.
    Another major state computer project that has cost taxpayers $17 million
is expected to be scrapped next year.  State officials have said they expect
to cancel the project to transfer district-court records because it doesn't
perform anywhere near the number of tasks court officials expected it would.

             Governor's try to ban unsolicited ads backfires
                    (The Ann Arbor News, 5/13/89)
 
   HARTFORD, Conn - The great fax attack of 1989 -- an all-out lobbying
campaign against a bill banning unsolicited facsimile advertising -- may have
backfired when the governor's fax machine was jammed for hours with unwanted
messages.
   Starting Thursday and continuing Friday, Gov. William A. O'Neill's fax
machine has been beeping constantly, spitting out unwanted messages from angry
businesses that advertise by fax.
   The businesses oppose a bill now awaiting O'Neill's signature that would
prohibit them from marketing their products by fax without first obtaining
the permission of the recipient.  Violators would face a $200 fine.
   Starting Thursday morning, dozens of Connecticut businesses faxed to
O'Neill's office a form letter arguing against the fax ban.
   The stream of fax messages was so constant -- 40 came in before 10 a.m.
-- that the governor's office turned off the fax machine Thursday.
   O'Neill's press secretary, Jon. L. Sandberg, said the governor still hasn't
decided whether he will sign the bill.  But aides to the governor said the
persistent lobbying campaign proved how annoying unwanted messages casn be.
The inconvenience was compounded because the governor's office was unable to
use its fax machine to receive information about spring flooding around the
state.

I recently was sent a bill ($70) for two "lost books" from the campus's (U.C.
Irvine) main library.  Since I knew I had returned them, I went to check the
shelves.  I found one of them; I didn't have time to search for the other.
When I inquired as to why I had been falsely charged and billed, I was told by
the checkout clerk that it was a "computer error".  Upon phoning the library, I
found that the day I had returned the books the library had had a head crash.

The library policy is to search for "lost" books if the charge is contested,
but if they are not found, I am assumed guilty.  (What if the reshelvers
erred?)  There is essentially no recourse; I understand that the Ombudsman
would be impotent.  Worse, I am told that this occurs occasionally to others,
head crash or not.

What I find remarkable is that this organization would not give the client the
benefit of the doubt when they are *aware of an internal problem*.  Besides
this, I wonder about the tradeoffs they made in designing a book-return system
so vulnerable to the failure of one of its components (disk drive or human book
checker).  Are redundant drives or paper records so expensive that a major
library cannot use them?  I suspect the adminstrators who specified the
existing system did not understand what they were doing.  I suppose I should
not be surprised.

While "dying off" of some of the mathematicians who found the computerized
4-color proof intolerable is certainly part of the reason that the
computerized "no projective plane of order 10" proof is being accepted, I
think there is another significant difference.  I knew several
mathematicians who had "gone out on a limb" with statements that 4 colors
would not suffice, no matter what the predominant belief. I can recall one
whose entire career and psyche were devoted to finding non-4-colorable maps.
He would literally give new graduate students maps to color, hoping to find
one which seemed to require 5 colors. Of course each one got colored with 4
colors, but his faith did not waver.

I have not seen this fervor in regard to the planes of order 10.  I have
seen papers which included theorems of the form "If there is a projective
plane of order 10 then ....", but frequently they also included "If there
does NOT exist ..." theorems as well.

The point I am trying to make is more or less this: It is all well and good
to give "objective" arguments about why computer proofs are valid or are
not, but somehow those arguments wind up supporting what the speaker wanted
to believe anyway!

I don't really see that much difference between a computerized proof and
standard proof.  In both cases, all steps of the proof must be rigorous.
In a computerized proof, the mathematician must rigorously prove that
his program is correct.  In effect, the program definition becomes a
lemma within the larger proof.

Philosophical problems don't crop up until you ask whether the computer
operated correctly, or whether defects in the underlying software (such
as the compiler or the operating system) corrupted the results.  Since
the entire system does not admit rigorous examination, some claim that
the process is fundamentally different than rigorous proof.

What this argument overlooks is that rigor does not guarantee correct-
ness to any greater degree than can be achieved in a computer-aided
proof.  A complicated proof can have errors at many stages, and
reviewers cannot be trusted to find them all, any more than programmers
can be trusted to find all of the bugs in a complicated computer
system.  Furthermore, while program proofs do not admit direct human
verification, they do allow independent verification by other humans
using similar, but different, tools.

The question of whether independent verification actually takes place
for program proofs is equivalent to the question of whether each step in
a rigorous proof is really verified by independent auditors.  In both
cases, theoretical verification is possible, but in practice, it may not
take place, or the auditing process may fail.

  &gt;Lam himself says he was hoping for a positive result, which would be easy
  &gt;to check, rather than a negative one.  But he is fairly confident in his
  &gt;result, citing two reasons:  (a) the programs did do some internal
  &gt;consistency checks; (b) the result agrees with "mathematical intuition"
  &gt;(for example, an order-10 projective plane is known to be forbidden to
  &gt;have any symmetry, which apparently is almost unheard-of for such an object).

Is anyone more familiar with this work, such as any testing or proving
techniques he attempted on his program?  100 trillion bug-free executions
seems rather high, particularly given the binary nature of the answer he
needed.  Has the Lam proof been published yet?

Given the forthcoming MoD standard in Great Britain requiring the use of
formal methods on safety-critical software, we thought the following might
be of interest to Risks readers.

             Call for Papers for Special Issues of
     IEEE Software, Computer, Transactions on Software Engineering:

          Formal Methods for Software Engineering

Formal Methods are design and construction methods explicitly based on 
well-defined mathematical formalisms.  Examples are: VDM, Z, box-structures, 
traces, predicate transformers, state transition systems, axiomatic data 
types, and many more.  These methods promise (1) better control over the 
system development process through clarity and precision of specification 
and then of development steps and (2) reduced error commission and 
persistence through rigor, systematic review, and formal analysis.  Much 
progress has been made in using formal methods, developing support systems 
for them, and evaluating their applicability on industrially-oriented 
problems.  Applications to critical systems are appearing world-wide, and 
there is now some commercial interest based on advances in verifiable 
execution environments.  Several standards groups are using formal methods 
and one - VDM - is undergoing the international standards process.

A coordinated set of papers is planned for September 1990 with a survey
plus a tutorial in IEEE Computer, application case studies in IEEE Software,
and research papers in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

In a keynote talk for the 5th International Workshop on Software
Specification and Design in Pittsburgh, 20-21 May 1989, I cited the case of
the Aegis' role in the Vincennes' shootdown of an Iranian Airbus as an
example of a system in which the design of the user interface was critical.

Matt Jaffe (Jaffe@ics.uci.edu) responded with some comments on the Aegis user
interface -- in whose design he had played a part while at RCA -- after which
he was invited to gave an impromptu talk on his experience to the workshop.

As you may recall, the Iranian Airbus was shot down by the Vincennes, although
it was on schedule, on course, and apparently flying completely normally.
There was confusion between the commercial plane being tracked and an observed
IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) squawk from a fighter plane.  The altitude
information (Z) was not displayed on the main screens, but only in one of
various subtables that had to be called up on a smaller screen.  There was no
indication of rate of change of altitude (Z', or "Z-dot"), not even a ternary
choice among ascending, cruising, or descending.  Matt took the view that the
user interface could not have done much differently, because of intrinsic
limitations on

  1. the reliability and/or accuracy of the underlying data, 
  2. the physical and logical characteristics of the display devices
     (alphanumeric raster-scan screens with limited space)
  3. and the ability of human operators to interpret marginal
     data in the high volume and high stress environment.

This is an attempt to summarize Matt's main points:

  Mode II codes (military use only) cannot be conclusive in determining friend
  or foe because they can be spoofed by a non-friendly aircraft, as can the
  civilian use Modes I and III.  In this particular case, the military
  aircraft supplied by the US to Iran almost certainly included Mode II
  transponders.  Note some subtle points here.  IFF is to determine the
  identity of friendly aircraft, not the military capability of a non-friend.
  In this tragedy, the problem was not in discriminating between friends and
  all others but between an Iranian F-14 and an Iranian airliner.  The
  identification as Iranian was correct (and presumably not based on IFF but on
  point of origin).  A classification of a Mode II code as belonging to an
  Iranian military aircraft would seem reasonable given that the airfield from
  which the aircraft departed was a joint use airport (both civilian and
  military).  What may have happened was that the airliner taxied near enough
  to an F-14 on the ground as to preclude the system from recognizing that
  there were in fact TWO aircraft.  (ANY sensor has some resolution limits.)
  Once the airliner was airborne, its lack of further mode II activity would
  not preclude the display of the old Mode II code.  Aircraft may fail to
  respond to an IFF interrogation (of any code) for a variety of reasons and
  yet operators (both civil and military) want to have the last recieved code
  remain displayed.

  Thus the entire mechanism contains potential ambiguities.  Providing a
  recency field for Mode II squawks would probably have been a good idea,
  display space and operator cognitive limits permitting.  (At that time and
  to date, Matt indicated that he knew of no system that provided the age of
  last squawk; nor did the Navy mention the possibility.  Scary?)

  The altitude readings are generally unreliable.  Thus, the Z' calculations --
  irrespective of how they were done -- would be suspect, and subject to
  possible misinterpretation.  Nevertheless, some crude up-down-same field
  might have been useful.

  Uncertain or unreliable information will always be a major problem in any
  safety-critical system.

  From the Navy's point of view, the Captain of the Vincennes did the right
  thing -- based on what he knew.

  No standard Navy shipborad systems could have done the discrimination
  automatically.  No equipment necessary for the Vincennes mission could have
  prevented a manual decision from being difficult, nerve-wracking, and
  error-prone.

  The situation was basically untenable in the first place, with hostile
  aircraft and commercial airliners closely interwoven within an area of great
  unrest. 

  [The Stark Captain had said earlier that they had not realized the
  limitations of the combat system in that kind of an environment.  PGN]

Matt made the appropriate disclaimers -- that his knowledge is not current,
that his opinions were his own, etc.  And his audience was generally impressed
with the care with which he had thought out the issues.  All in all, this case
is of great importance, and bears close consideration.  There are many lessons
to be learned, some technological and some nontechnological -- many of the
latter relating to the intrinsic limitations of trusting the technology,
especially under adverse circumstances.  PGN

The June 1989 issue of Consumer Reports includes a test of the Chevrolet S-10,
as well as three other sport/utility vehicles.  The Chevrolet has rear-wheel
anti-lock brakes.  This is from the "Reliability" section of the report on the
Chevrolet:

  "The most disquieting [sample defect] was a defective antilock brake
  controller.  At just over 200 miles, the brake warning light came on and the
  pedal sank almost to the floor.  The pedal felt spongy and sank slowly during
  each brake application.  The controller was replaced under the warranty."

I would have expected that a controller failure would leave you with normal
brakes, and perhaps a warning light glaring at you to warn that the brakes are
now manually controlled.  Instead the failure mode sounds like a plain old
brake system leak, except that Consumer Reports didn't say that braking power
was actually lost.  Was there braking power left only because the front brakes,
which I understand do most of the braking, weren't controlled by the defective
controller?  In any event, finding the brake pedal much lower than you expect
it to be, is a risk in itself.

It's also interesting that Consumer Reports didn't make a big deal out of
this problem, so perhaps they don't consider it to be a major risk.

This is based on an article in the Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyheter, 24 May
1989, p.6.  Last year, a law went into effect in Sweden requiring the
registration of most pleasure boats.  The database is financed by a small "user
fee," i.e., a tax.  The data are public information.  A thief who steals a boat
can phone the registration office, tell them the boat's registration number,
and obtain the legal owner's name, address, and national ID number.  This makes
it easy for the thief to impersonate the legal owner when selling the stolen
boat.

This is an account of two ancient (30-year old) computer risks that were
not publicly disclosed for the usual reasons.  It involves an air defense
system called SAGE and a ground-to-air missile called BOMARC.

SAGE was developed by MIT in the late '50s with Air Force sponsorship to
counter the threat of a manned bomber attack by you-know-who.  It was also
designed to counter the political threat of a competing system called Nike
that was being developed by the Army.

SAGE was the first large real time computer system.  "Large" was certainly
the operative term -- it had a duplexed vacuum tube computer that covered
an area about the size of a football field and a comparably sized air
conditioning system to take away the enormous heat load.  It used an
advanced memory technology that had just been invented, namely magnetic
core, and had a larger main memory than any earlier computers, though it
is not impessive by current standards -- it would now be called 256k
bytes, though no one had heard of a byte then.

The system collected digitized radar information from multiple sites and
used it to automatically track aircraft and guide interceptors.  SAGE was
designed to work initially with manned interceptors such as the F-102,
F-104, and F-106 and used a radio datalink to transmit guidance commands
to these aircraft.  It was later modified to work with the BOMARC missile.

Each computer site had about 50 display consoles that allowed the
operators to assign weapons to targets and monitor progress.  As I recall,
there were eventually between one and two dozen SAGE systems built in
various parts of the U.S.

BOMARC missiles used a rocket booster to get airborne and a ramjet to
cruise at high altitude to the vicinity of its target.  It was then used
its doppler radar to locate the target more accurately so that it could
dive at it and detonate.  It could carry either a high explosive or a
nuclear warhead.

BOMARCs were housed in hardened structures.  When a given missile received a
launch command from SAGE, sent via land lines, the roof would roll back, the
missile would erect, and if it had received a complete set of initial guidance
commands in the meantime it would launch in the specified direction.

			Testing the fire-up decoder

It was clearly important to ensure that the electronic guidance system in the
missile was working properly, so the Boeing engineers who designed the launch
control system included a test feature that would generate a set of synthetic
launch commands so that the missile electronics could be monitored for correct
operation.  When in test mode, of course, the normal sequence of erecting and
launching the missile was suppressed.

I worked on SAGE during 1956-60 and one of our responsibilities was to
integrate BOMARC into that system.  This led us to review the handling of
launch commands in various parts of the system.  In the course of this
review, one of our engineers noticed a rather serious defect -- if the
launch command system was tested, the missile would be in a state of
readiness for launch.  If the "test" switch was then returned to "operate"
without individually resetting the control systems in each missile that had
been tested, they would all immediately erect and launch!

Needless to say, that "feature" was modified rather soon after we mentioned it
to Boeing.

			Duplexed for reliability

For some reason, I got assigned the responsibility for securing approval to put
nuclear warheads on the second-generation BOMARCs, which involved "proving" to
a government board that the probability of accidentally launching a missile on
any given day as a result of equipment malfunctions was less than a certain
very small number and that one berserk person couldn't do it by himself.  We
did eventually convince them that it was adequately safe, but in the course of
our studies we uncovered a scary problem.

The SAGE system used land lines to transmit launch commands to the missile site
and these lines were duplexed for reliability.  Each of the two lines followed
a different geographic route so that they would be less likely to be taken out
by a single blast or malfunction.  There was a black box at the missile site
that could detect when the primary line went bad and automatically switched to
the alternate.  On examination, we discovered that if both lines were bad at
the same time, the system would remain connected to the alternate line and the
amplifiers would then pick up and amplify whatever noise was there and
interpret it as a stream of random bits.

We then did a Markov analysis to determine the expected time that it would take
for a random bit stream to generate something that looked like a "fire" command
for one of the missiles.  We found that expected value was a little over 2
minutes.  When such a command was received, of course, the missile would erect
and prepare to launch.  However, unless the missile also received a number of
other commands during the launch window, it would automatically abort.
Fortunately, we were able to show that getting a complete set of acceptable
guidance commands within this time was extremely improbable, so this failure
mode did not present a nuclear safety threat.

The official name of the first BOMARC model was IM-99A, so I wrote a report
about this problem titled "Inadvertent erection of the IM-99A."  While that
title raised a few eyebrows, the report was destined to get even more attention
than I expected.  Its prediction came true a couple of weeks after it was
released -- both phone lines went bad on a BOMARC site in Maryland, near
Washington D.C., causing a missi&lt;le to suddenly erect and start the launch
sequence, then abort.  Needless to say, this scared hell out of the site staff
and a few other people.

The Air Force was suitably impressed with our prediction and I was
immediately called upon to chair an MIT-AT&amp;T committee that had the honor
of fixing the problem.  The fix was rather easy: just disconnect when both
lines are bad.  With good engineering practice, of course, this kind of
problem wouldn't occur.  However, the world is an imperfect place.

 According to an article by Margie Semilof, entitled "SABRE Recovers from
Network Crash", in Communications Week, May 22, 1989, the recent SABRE outage
occurred when the "Online DASD formatter was changed erroneously by another
software program operating at the same time.  This 'core corruption' resulted
in the destruction of critical system data on SABRE's 1,800 DASDs."
 The article later quotes Jim Juracek, vice president of systems engineering
for SABRE Computer Services:

     "All the predictable things are covered," Juracek said.  "The unpredict-
     able things, such as when a software program gets clobbered by another
     program . . . [ellipsis hers] there is no way to work with this."

 The article further notes that "SABRE is developing software that will
provide memory protection of applications, and thereby help prevent against
core corruption.  That software will not be ready[,] however, until the early
to mid 1990s".

 Using software for memory protection?  In the 1990s?  How, I wonder, will
they protect their protection software ("quis custodiet ipsos custodes", as
always)?  Is SABRE is too tightly coupled to its hardware to be moved to a
platform that provides hardware memory protection?  Or is it just plain too
big to be ported?

Taken from the San Jose Mercury News, 5/25/89 (Knight-Ridder News Service).

  DETROIT - Secret Serviceagents smashed what they described as a costly,
sophisticated computer intrusion network Wednesday and were surprised to
discover it made up largely of teen-agers.
  The computer systems of more than 20 companies including the Michigan
Department of Treasury and Home Box Office cable television services, were
infiltrated, according to agents serving search warrants across the country.
  Federal officials said the infiltrations by the network represented fraud
of $200,000 to $1.5 million in appropriated goods, telephone and computer time.
  Agents expected to arrest some adults when they swept down on eight people
who allegedly ran the network in several states.  Instead, they found only
one adult, in Chicago.  The rest were teen-agers as young as 14: two in
Columbus, Ohio; two in Boston; two in Sterling Heights, Mich.; and one in
Atlanta.  Agents expected to make another arrest in Los Angeles.
  Officials said at least 55 other people nationwide made use of the
network's information.
  In Sterling Heights, Secret Service agents pulled two eighth-grader boys,
both 14, out of school and questioned them in the presence of their parents,
who apparently were unaware of their activities.  James Huse, special agent in
charge of the U.S. Secret Service office in Detroit, said the youths admitted
involvement in the scheme.
  He said the eight-graders [sic], because they are juveniles, cannot be
charged under federal law and will be dealt with by local juvenile
authorities.
  Authorities believe the mastermind is Lynn Doucett, 35, of Chicago.  She
was arrested Wednesday and is cooperating with authorities, Huse said.
  Doucett, who was convicted in Canada of telecommunications fraud, supports
herself and two children through her computer intrusion activities, which
include using stolen or couterfeit credit cards for cash advances or money
orders, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court.
  If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

  Cornell University has suspended the graduate student identified by school
officials as the author of [the Internet worm].
  In a May 16 letter to Robert Tappan Moris, 23, the dean of the Cornell Uni-
versity Graduate School said a university panel had found him guilty of vio-
lating the school's Code of Academic Integrity.
  He will be suspended until the beginning of the fall semester of 1990, and
then could reapply.
  No criminal charges have been filed against Morris.  A federal grand jury
this year forwarded its recommendations to the Justice Department, which has
not taken any action.    [....]

Paul Ceruzzi has written a truly outstanding book for the new show that opened
two weeks ago at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.  The exhibit
and the book are both entitled "Beyond the Limits -- Flight Enters the Computer
Age".  Both are superb.  Go for it (them).

Paul has dug into several cases treated previously in RISKS and in issues of
the ACM Software Engineering Notes, and has been able to resolve several
mysteries.  In particular he considers the case of Mariner I, about which
various inaccurate stories have been told.  Intended to be the first US
spacecraft to visit another planet, it was destroyed by a range officer on 22
July 1962 when it behaved erratically four minutes after launch.  The alleged
missing `hyphen' was really a missing `bar'.  I quote from Paul's book, pp.
202-203:

  During the launch the Atlas booster rocket was guided with the help of two
  radar systems.  One, the Rate System, measured the velocity of the rocket as
  it ascended through the atmosphere.  The other, the Track Ssytem, measured
  its distance and angle from a tracking antenna near the launch site.  At the
  Cape a guidance computer processed these signals and sent control signals
  back to the tracking system, which in turn sent signals to the rocket.  Its
  primary function was to ensure a proper separation from the Atlas booster and
  ignition of the Agena upper stage, which was to carry the Mariner
  Spacecraft to Venus.

  Timing for the two radar systems was separated by a difference of forty-three
  milliseconds.  To compensate, the computer was instructed to add fourty-three
  milliseconds to the data from the Rate System during the launch.  This
  action, which set both systems to the same sampling time base, required
  smoothed, or averaged, track data, obtained by an earlier computation, not
  the raw velocity data relayed directly from the track radar.  The symbol for 
  this smoothed data was ... `R dot bar n' [R overstruck `.' and `_' and
  subscript n], where R stands for the radius, the dot for the first derivative
  (i.e., the velocity), the bar for smoothed data, and n for the increment.

  The bar was left out of the hand-written guidance equations.  [A footnote
  cites interviews with John Norton and General Jack Albert.]  Then during
  launch the on-board Rate System hardware failed.  That in itself should not
  have jeopardized the mission, as the Track System radar was working and could
  have handled the ascent.  But because of the missing bar in the guidance
  equations, the computer was processing the track data incorrectly.  [Paul's 
  EndNote amplifies: The Mariner I failure was thus a {\it combination} of a
  hardware failure and the software bug.  The same flawed program had been used
  in several earlier Ranger launches with no ill effects.]  The result was 
  erroneous information that velocity was fluctuating in an erratic and
  unpredictable manner, for which the computer tried to compensate by sending
  correction signals back to the rocket.  In fact the rocket was ascending 
  smoothly and needed no such correction.  The result was {\it genuine} instead
  of phantom erratic behavior, which led the range safety officer to destroy
  the missile, and with it the Mariner spacecraft.  Mariner I, its systems
  functioning normally, plunged into the Atlantic.

                      Perfecting Peopleware
                         by Rob Gurwitt

[extracted from Governing Magazine, May, 1989.]

     A few years back, Liz Krueger noticed a pattern to the calls she was
receiving from New York City's network of activists for the poor.  They were
phoning her to report that their clients, in rising numbers, were having
trouble getting their welfare checks and food stamps on time.  Far from being
scattered at random throughout the city's five boroughs, it turned out, the
troubles clustered around particular "income maintenance centers," city offices
that handle public assistance payments.

     All the centers involved, Krueger discovered, had been tied in to the new
Welfare Management System, a massive computerized network through which, at
state orders, the city was to manage public assistance, food stamps and
Medicaid disbursements.  "I could see very clearly that you started to have
crises in centers approximately six weeks after they started to go into
conversion," says Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource
Center, a Manhattan advocacy group.  New York's social welfare delivery
efforts, in short, were being derailed by computer problems.

     This was not a case of hardware gone on the fritz or of software paralyzed
by bugs, however.  It was a problem with the human part of the system.

     In the years before the state imposed the new Welfare Management System on
them, city welfare officials had used their own computerized system to keep
track of recipients and payments.  But the new system worked differently, and
social service workers were suddenly faced with hundreds of new codes to learn
- codes describing school-age children, or young mothers who had dropped out of
school, or able-bodied men looking for work.  At their terminals in hectic
offices, under pressure to keep up with their immense caseloads, city workers
were, not surprisingly, making mistakes.

     When someone trying to describe, say, a 35-year-old mother of five instead
entered the code for a 20-year-old male high school dropout, the system would
check the profile against existing city and state records, and find that the
worker's entry contradicted information about the recipient in those other data
bases.  Until the discrepancy could be cleared up, which might take weeks, no
payment would go out.

     Advocates for the pool say that welfare centers recorded error rates as
high as 30 or 40 percent; the city says that the rate only went as high as 20
percent.  Whatever the case, thousands of New York City's poorest residents
were suddenly cut off from desperately needed income.  "When the rent's due",
says Krueger, "landlords are not interested in hearing stories about the city
and the state having computer problems, and supermarkets are not interested in
the notion of credit."

     For all concerned, it was a bruising and expensive lesson in technological
change.  What the city was discovering - as other jurisdictions had before it,
and yet others are still doomed to do - was that in making a computer system
work, technical success is meaningless on its own.  Unless handled with care
and forethought, knotty human and organizational problems can confound a new
system as effectively as any latter-day Luddite.

[The article continues for several pages of well-thought-out and well-written
commentary on people/computer interfaces and the organizational issues of
introducing a new computer system.]

  In <A HREF="/Risks/8.74.html">RISKS-8.74</A>, Peter Neumann summarized comments made by Matt Jaffe on the
design of the Aegis system, in the context of the Vincennes / Iranian Airbus
incident.  I had the opportunity to read a copy of the de-classified report on
this incident and feel obliged to make a few clarifications.  Unfortunately, I
do not have a copy of the report, so I can't quote from it, thus these
observations are from memory.

   An initial IFF interrogation showed a Mode II return AND a discreet ID
code that had been in use by aircraft confirmed to be Iranian F-14s in 
earlier operations.  One explanation was:

  [...] What may have happened was that the airliner taxied near enough
  to an F-14 on the ground as to preclude the system from recognizing that
  there were in fact TWO aircraft.  

  The computer records showed that the radar "range gate", i.e. the area
which it was listening to, had been set on the airport for an extended
period of time.  It was considered quite likely that due to atmospheric
ducting effects, an F-14 on the ground and powered-up may have responded
to a radar interrogation after the Airbus was airborne.  This caused
association of this single return with the unknown aircraft, and pre-
disposed the crew to believe that it was an F-14.

  Once the airliner was airborne, its lack of further mode II activity would
  not preclude the display of the old Mode II code.  Aircraft may fail to
  respond to an IFF interrogation (of any code) for a variety of reasons and
  yet operators (both civil and military) want to have the last received code
  remain displayed.

  The above does not agree with the official report.  The Vincennes 
interrogated the unknown aircraft several times, and received Mode III 
replies with altitude information.  The Mode II return was not repeated, 
and the Mode III replies were clearly displayed.   Each new return was
shown with the current altitude return.

   It seems that a single junior officer misinterpreted his display to
indicate that the aircraft was descending and accelerating on an attack
profile towards the Vincennes.  He made several call-outs to that effect
even though his display showed otherwise.  It seems likely that he had
mentally fixed on the idea that the unknown aircraft was a hostile threat,
and was seeing on his display what he believed would be happening rather
than what was happening.  A more senior officer accepted these statements 
and relayed the information to the captain.  The senior officer was stationed 
at a console that also displayed the altitude and mode information, but he 
did not independently verify it.

   The captain was receiving inputs from several sources to the effect
that the unknown aircraft was descending and accelerating.  He chose to
fire on that information.  Unfortunately, those sources were all basically
the same source -- the statements of the junior officer.

   The situation in the ship's combat center must be appreciated to understand
this incident.  The ship was maneuvering radically and in engagement with
highly maneuverable small surface boats.  Small bore fire from the boats was
impacting the hull of the Vincennes, and fire was being returned.  The crew
perceived a hostile aircraft threat to be closing on their ship.  They thought
the aircraft was off of assigned airways as their displays of the airway were
several miles off from their correct position (I don't recall the reason why),
and they did not have information on the schedules of departures from this
airport.  The intercom lines were very active and some people were shouting.
This was an atmosphere of extreme tension and confusion -- just as we might
expect in battle.  Even so, at least one officer called "possible com-air"
(commercial airliner) several times, but his calls did not gain enough credence
to prevent the firing of missiles.

   The Aegis system is not just a safety-critical system, it is a battle
system.  As such, it must be evaluated as to how well it reaches its objectives
in a battlefield environment.  The outcome here was mixed -- the ship was
protected, but an innocent was destroyed.  It is clear that a battlefield is no
place for innocents.  It may also be the case that a system like the Aegis
cannot be used where there is much civilian traffic mixed-in with fighting
craft.  Perhaps no system can function in this environment without a chance of
such an accident occurring.  The battle doctrine may simply be incompatible
with civilian traffic.  This is nothing new -- WWII pilots made a point of
staying away from friendly ships to avoid being shot down.  If identity was in
doubt, it was preferable to shoot down a friendly aircraft than to lose a ship.

  No equipment necessary for the Vincennes mission could have
  prevented a manual decision from being difficult, nerve-wracking, and
  error-prone.

   This is true, but a system with a less ambiguous display of critical
information could make errors less likely.  Better definition of roles and
responsibilities in the combat center could also help to minimize error.
This is not just a computer system problem, but a human problem.  There are 
problems in trusting technology under adverse circumstances, but there are 
also problems with trusting human beings.  When we build systems, we must
take into account both the strengths and weakness of computers AND of people.

An interesting article from the Kitchener-Waterloo Record:

   "THUNDER BAY (CP) - An accident that killed a miner in Northern
   Ontario in March has 'frightening' implications for other mine
   workers, a coroner said Thursday.

   "Gerry Urchel, 37, fell 24 metres to his death after being pushed off
   a ledge by a piece of radio-controlled machinery, a coroner's inquest
   heard.

   "Two machines had been set accidentally on the same radio frequency,
   the inquest was told.  One machine - a scoop tram - lurched forward
   after it picked up a radio signal meant for the other machine."

There is more in the article, but this is the part that is relevant to RISKS.

I must admit, I am surprised that there are no safeguards against this sort
of thing already.  What kind of safeguards are possible in this situation
and are the safeguards reliable?

It seems that SRI's "no-single-point-of-failure" power system failed at the
hands, er the paws, of a squirrel.  It was an unsuccessful attempt to ensure
that we all got today off.

The power was off for approximately 9 hours.  CSL was fully operational by 6:30
PM.  We experienced no hardware problems as of yet but the next 72 hours will
be the test.

The network is operational and most hosts around the institute are running.
SRI-NIC is currently down but being repaired.  KL is down.

   to guarantee us safe power.  The paws that refresh would have been nice

   and this was the second Sunday in a row that an all-day power outage had

14 March 1989 issue of "Weekly World News" [one of those supermarket tabloids]

Computer Charged with Murder After Frying Chess Champ, by Ragan Dunn

A Soviet super-computer has been ordered to stand trial for the murder of chess
champion Nikolai Gudkov -- who was electrocuted when he touched the metal board
that he and the machine were playing on! "This was no accident -- it was
cold-blooded murder," Soviet police investigator Alexei Shainev told reporters
in Moscow.  "Niko Gudkov won three straight games and the computer couldn't
stand it.  When the chess master reached for his knight to begin play in the
fourth game, the computer sent a lethal surge of electricity to the board
surface.  The computer had been programmed to move its chess pieces by
producing a low-level electric current.  "Gudkov was electrocuted while a
gallery of hundreds watched."

The decision to put the computer on trial stunned legal experts around the
world.  [I hope computer experts are also shocked, so to speak.  --spaf] But
the Soviets are convinced that the computer had the pride and intelligence to
develop a hatred for Gudkov -- and the motive and means to kill him.
The mind-boggling murder drama unfolded during a six-day chess marathon between
the M2-11 supercomputer and Gudkov, a world class chess player.

According to reports, Gudkov defied all odds [Calculated by the same
supercomputer, no doubt. --spaf] and beat the machine in three consecutive
games.  And when they prepared to begin their fourth, a deadly dose of
electricity flowed up into the electronic board and zapped Gudkov dead.  Soviet
authorities initially thought that the surge of electricity was caused by a
short-circuit.  But an examination of the computer revealed no problems.

It was later determined that the machine diverted the flow of electricity from
its brain to the chess board to ensure a victory over Gudkov. [This implies
that Soviet semiconductors work at voltages of a few hundred volts, or maybe
their supercomputers are tube-based? --spaf]

"The computer was programmed to win at chess and when it couldn't do that
legitimately, it killed its opponent," said investigator Shalnev.  "It might
sound ridiculous to bring a machine to trial for murder.  [!!] But a machine
that can solve problems and think [sic] faster than any human must be held
accountable for its actions."

Rudi Hagemann, the Swiss legal scholar, agreed with the Soviet cop.  He said
that the development of artificial intelligence has come so far in recent years
that certain computers and some robots "must be considered human."

It isn't clear how the Soviets will punish the computer if it is found guilty
when it goes to court this spring. [Send it to a Gulag for reprogramming?
--spaf]

But Hagermann says the machine will probably be reprogrammed or dismantled
altogether.

[I don't think there's much to say here, except in the way of warning: next
time you accuse the system of cheating at rogue, don't say it too loudly! -spaf]

     [This reminds me of the WWN story from 10 July 1984 about the 58-year-old
     Chinese man, Chin Soo Ying, who had designed a computer system in 1950
     (based on the British Colossus) to express words of love and emotions.
     The article related how after he had built a new machine in the 80s,
     he was electrocuted by the old machine.  His wife was convinced that
     Chin was murdered by the old machine, which then committed suicide.  (The
     WWN hadline was "Jealous Computer Zaps its Creator".)  I recall this in
     the interest of perspective on the current story, and its source.  PGN]

Rumor:  AI Causes $20M Loss to Pennsylvania

How Rumors Get Started, Lesson 1 (Excerpts from Seattle Times article quoted by
Bruce Forstall in Risks 8.73):

Quote 1:
    COSMOS, designed by Pennsylvania-based UNISYS Corp., was thought so
advanced that Gov. Booth Gardner and some of the state's computer professionals
likened it to ``artificial intelligence.''

Quote 2:
    ``This was an effort to create artificial intelligence so the computer
could `think' about eligibility,'' Gardner said yesterday.  ``I don't think
we'll mess with artificial intelligence again.''


Notice the shift from ``likened it to AI'' to ``an effort to create AI.''
Notice how what starts out being metaphorical turns literal.  Does the system
in fact use any AI techniques?  Impossible to tell.  But what's the lingering
impression and what will people likely remember?

This is based on an article in the Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyheter, 29
May 1989, p. 25.  The Swedish parliament has just passed a law, effective 1
October 1989, making the records of public library loans secret.  At
present, such records are in principle public information, so that any
person can find out which books any library patron has borrowed.  In
practice some libraries refuse to give out such information, although this
is technically illegal.  The minister of justice opposed the new law,
although the article does not say why.  Like all Swedish laws, there are
plenty of exceptions.  Data may be released if the release does no harm, if
the patron borrows technical literature for use at work, if the data are
needed to calculate compensation to authors, or if the data are to be used
for research.  (Authors get some money based on how many times their books
are borrowed, in addition to royalties.)

&gt;Is SABRE is too tightly coupled to its hardware to be moved to a    
&gt;platform that provides hardware memory protection?  Or is it just plain
&gt;too big to be ported?                                                        

SABRE, like most reservation systems, runs on ACP or TPF.  These
high-performance, limited function operating systems run on hardware with
memory protection, i.e., 370 XA.  However, for performance reasons, they do
not exploit the isolation features of the hardware.  All application code
runs in a single address space and at the same level of privilege.

While this strategy is inherently dangerous, there are compensating controls
imposed on application code.  The strategy has been very successful.  The
res systems have achieved extraordinary reliability and stability for any
kind of system, let alone systems which are both mammoth and monolithic.

Portability is another issue.  Like most application code, the code of the res
systems is sensitive to its environment.  It expects a certain application
program interface.  It can run anywhere it sees that API.  The API isolates it
from the underlying hardware and operating system.  The application code has
survived many ports to new hardware and operating system.

However, the application is so large and complex that it is difficult to view
it as anything but a monolith.  The monolith can only be ported as a whole to
something big enough to contain it.  IBM is under continual pressure to expand
the environment fast enough to accomodate the growth of the application, and
the operators struggle to keep it small enough to run in the biggest system
available.

If you were to begin today, knowing what we know, you would never permit
anything so large and monolithic to come into existence.  On the other hand it
is too large, important, valuable, and vital to kill.  Like many other
successful applications from the sixties, it has a life of its own.  While we
may migrate many of its functions to compartmented sub-systems, the core is
likely to be with us for a very long time.

Success is like that.

  [Excerpted and Paraphrased from Goverment Computer News, May 1, 1989,
  pg 6, byline of Vanessa Jo Grimm.]

The U.S. attorney for Washington is reviewing an allegation that a Customs
Service official violated the Computer Security Act [PL 100-235 presumably]
by altering a computer's internal clock.

Treasury Department Inspector General Michael R. Hill referred the
allegation to the prosecutor after an investigation into year-end spedning
by Custom officials at the close of FY 1988.  The allegation involves an
official who may have authorized altering the date maintained by the
computers [that] the agency uses for procurment documents, according to
Maurice S. Moody, the IG's audit director for Financial Management Service.

Moody recently told the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight
the computers are part of the agency's Automated Commercial System.  He
declined to provide GCN with more details.

Allegedly the computer clock was rolled back during the first three days
of October [of 1988] so that $41.8M in procurement obligations would be
dated in September against FY 1988 appropriations, Moody said.

An IG report issued in late February concluded Customs had not violated
any procurement laws.  The IG's investigation is continuing, however.

"Doesn't $41.8M worth of procurement on the last day of the fiscal year bother
anybody?" asked Rep. Richard T. Shulze (R-Pa).  The purchases did bother the
IG, Moody said, and this concern led to getting the US attorney.  "This problem
is endemic in the federal government," he said.  "Year-end spedning is very
common."

William F. Riley, Customs controller, said he knew about the rollback, but he
and Deputy Commissioner Michael H.  Lane refused to say who authorized the
action...  Subcommittee members continued to press Riley and Lane. "Is the
person still at Customs?" asked subcommittee chairman J.J.Pickle (D-Texas). "He
is working full time and in the position he was at the time," Lane answered.

Rep. Beryl F. Anthony, Jr. (D-Ark) asked how Riley became aware of the
rollback. "He [the official who authorized the rollback] told me that it was
going to be done," Riley said.

[Rep Pickle suggested that a high ranking official would have to authorize such
an action, but Counsel advised Lane not to reply.  He did say neither he nor
Commissioner von Raab had made the decision.]

[The balance of the article deals with the actions of Linda Gibbs, who became
aware of the incident and reported it to the IG after being unable to stop the
action.  Gibbs also alleged that the action was intended to use available
year-end money to cover cost overrun on a contract with Northrop Corp.  She
also alleged that she had been reassigned and given no new duties.]

When people returned to work on Tuesday after Monday's squirrel attack (noted

terrific in having replacements for most by Tuesday afternoon.  (The DEC

&gt; This implies that Soviet semiconductors work at voltages of a few
&gt; hundred volts, or maybe their supercomputers are tube-based?

The story as it stands sounds bogus, but don't discount low voltages.  One of
the worst shocks I've ever received (in the range of 6 to 12000 non-static
volts) was only 12 volts.  I was VERY well grounded (driving in the rain in a
car with old metal springs in the seats and big holes in the floor), and
attempted to manipulate the metal stump of the wiper control with a finger with
a cut on the end of it.  The sensation was something like a whack across the
chest with a baseball bat.  Normally, I can't even feel 12 volts.

In <A HREF="/Risks/8.24.html">RISKS-8.24</A>, I summarized a news account about five people arrested and
charged with violating federal fraud statutes in a scheme to use more than
7,000 counterfeit ATM cards.  The alleged mastermind, Mark Koenig, was a
computer programmer who, while temporarily working under contract on a job
dealing with several hundred ATMs, transferred bank account and PIN information
to his home computer and stole an ATM encoding machine from his office.  He and
his confederates planned to use the counterfeit ATM cards to withdraw cash from
ATMS throughout California and the Midwest over the three-day Presidents Day
weekend in February.  An unnamed informant alerted the U.S. Secret Service, who
arrested the five people before that holiday weekend.

A wire service story in the LATimes 23-May-89 reports that the five pleaded
guilty Monday.  All are scheduled for sentencing Aug. 25, and face prison terms
of up to 72 years each.

   Kevin Mitnick, the hacker "so dangerous that he can't even be allowed to use
a phone". "He could ruin your life with his keyboard". "Armed with a keyboard
and considered dangerous."

   These are some of the things that have been said about this person. All of
this media hype would be fine if it just sold news papers. But it has done much
more then just sell a few papers. It has influenced those that will ultimately
decide his fate. I myself don't know the man, but I have talked to others that
do. Including one of the persons that investigated Mitnick.  From all I have
heard about him, I think he is a slime ball! But even a slime ball should not
be railroaded into a prison sentence that others of equal or greater guilt have
avoided.

I personally feel the man is just a criminal, like the guy that robs a 7/11, no
better but certainly not any worse.  Unfortunately he is thought of as some
kind of a "SUPER HACKER".  The head of LA Police Dept's Computer Crime Unit is
quoted as saying "Mitnick is several levels above what you would characterize
as a computer hacker".

   No disrespect intended, but a statement like this from the head of a
computer crime unit indicates his ignorance on the ability of hackers and phone
phreaks. Sure he did things like access and perhaps even altered Police Dept.
criminal records, credit records at TRW Corp, and Pacific Telephone,
disconnecting phones of people he didn't like etc.  But what is not understood
by most people outside of the hack/phreak world is that these things are VERY
EASY TO DO AND ARE DONE ALL THE TIME.  In the hack/phreak community such
manipulation of computer and phone systems is all to easy. I see nothing
special about his ability to do this.  The only thing special about Kevin
Mitnick is that he is not a "novice" hacker like most of the thirteen year old
kids that get busted for hacking/phreaking.  It has been a number of years
since an "advanced" hacker has been arrested.  Not since the days of the Inner
Circle gang have law enforcement authorities had to deal with a hacker working
at this level of ability. As a general rule, advanced hackers do not get caught
because of there activity but rather it is almost always others that turn them
in.  It is therefore easy to understand why his abilities are perceived as
being extraordinary when in fact they are not.

Because of all the media hype this case has received I'm afraid that: 

1.) He will not be treated fairly. He will be judged as a much greater threat
    to society then others that have committed simular crimes.

2.) He will become some kind of folk hero. A Jesse James with a keyboard.
    This will only cause other to follow in his footsteps. 

I'm not defending him or the things he has done in any sense. All I'm saying
is let's be fair. Judge the man by the facts, not the headlines.

Early last week, we had a second elevator fatality in Ottawa. In this case, the
person was caught by the doors closing as they were stepping in. The elevator
went up and down several floors before they were able to stop it and get the
fellow out. The problem was apparently an electrical problem with the door
interlock circuits that allowed the elevator to move with only one of the doors
closed. The elevator (made by Otis in about 1954) had been serviced earlier
that same day.  Those of you that remember the incident earlier this year in
Ottawa, wherein a 13 year old girl was killed, might recall that -that-
elevator had been serviced earlier the same day. The local paper never did,
though, publish the results of the inquest into that death, so I still don't
know what the problem was in that case. People have been rumbling louder about
the politics in that case (the building was largely populated by people waiting
for their immigration applications to be heard) than about the mechanics of the
elevator.

The following article appeared in the June 1st issue of Electronics Times, a
respected trade newspaper of the UK electonics industry.  It raises many
questions, ranging from technical feasibility to security, privacy, and
admissability of evidence.  Have RISKS readers any information on this
technology?

                    ELECTRONIC CARD SPOTS HOOLIGANS

Football hooligans could find their activities curbed by electronics, thanks
to a new surveillance system developed in Italy.  The Hooligan Stopper can
pick out individual trouble makers and warn of impending violence.

Manufacturers AGM Electronica and MEG Italia designed the system with UK
football fans in mind.  They claim it can cope with crowds of up to 130 000
and could replace 10 000 police officers.

Supporters gain access to the stadium with an electronic personal card
(epc), while transponders sense the occurrence of disturbances and relay
information back to a central tranceiver and data processing system.

Franco Bertuzzi, the system's inventor, declined to identify the West german
electronics company that is manufacturing the device and refused to give
details of the ics and sensors used.

"All I can say is that the microchip in the epc starts to function when the
card owner becomes violent, lashing out at other spectators or running
amok", he said.

Bertuzzi said the card did not even have to be in direct contact with the
owner to pick up 'agitation signals'. "It is already used in high level
security systems in the civilian and military sectors," he said.

"By reading the data the interceptors pick up from the magnetic strip, all
the personal details of the card's owner can be known immediately."

The epc could be sold for #20 [UK pounds] and be used to gain admission to
several matches.  By charging for the card, fans would be discouraged from
throwing it away, which they might be tempted to do if it exposed them to
detection if they became violent or unruly.

Installation costs for a stadium the size of Wembley would be around #1.5
million [UK pounds].

Remember all those articles in RISKS about governments and institutions being
able to track people using data about their magnetic ATM or credit cards?
Well, the nightmare has come true: a system specifically designed to track
people will be in use shortly.  The military government of Israel's occupied
territories announced that all residents wishing to work in Israel will be
given magnetic-striped work permit cards.  An electronic turnstyle will keep
track of their movements across the border at all entry points.

I wonder whether DARPA (and other governmental sources of funding) ever
thought that "the network" would be used to organize a revolution?

To see the process unfolding, you might consider reading through the Usenet
soc.culture.china, which currently has a combination of news, rumor, fax and
telephone numbers for university student unions in China, polemics, speculation,
and the telephone/internet address of student committees all over the world.

            THE 'CORE WALKER' THAT STALLED AMERICAN AIRLINES
                 (`Business Week' 12-June-89, page 98C)   

The computer foul-up that shut down American Airlines Inc.'s Sabre ticketing
system for 12 hours after midnight on May 12 [see related notes RISKS 8.71,
8.74, and 8.76] was not caused by human error or sabotage, the company's
investigators have found.  Instead, it was apparently the result of a glitch
that was written into the system but never showed up until now.  "We call it a
core-walker," says an American spokesperson, "because it literally walked
through the system."

The problem began when American tried to add a pair of mammoth disk drives to
the nation's largest computerized reservations system.  Suddenly, the program
accompanying the new disk drives changed a piece of information in the software
directing the activities of the 1,080 existing Sabre disk drives.  Once
embedded, this new bit of data jumped from one disk drive to another and
stripped away the names of files stored on them, making it impossible for
American's computers to retrieve the information on the drives.  To solve the
problem, American is revamping its disk-drive software.  According to the
airline, revenue losses during the Sabre shutdown were minimal.

The Observer, which is a well-respected UK Sunday newspaper, on 28 May 1989
carried a lengthy article about the A320. It contains more explicit allegations
about computer-related problems than I had seen before, so below I quote
relevant sections.  [Brian Randell, Computing Laboratory, University of
Newcastle upon Tyne]

              AIRBUS CRASH: WAS THE PILOT THE FALL GUY
Open File: Jim Beatson finds that the evidence points to computer failure.

"On June 26, 1988, Air France's new European A320 Airbus, delivered only two
days previously, crashed into trees at an airshow near Mulhouse in France while
performing a low-level pass.  Three passengers - a woman and two children -
were killed.  The pilot, Michel Asseline, a senior Air France captain and the
man inaugurating the new model, as well as being its chief instructor, escaped
unhurt.

After the accident, the European aircraft industry waited intently for a
verdict on whether the Airbus' new and controversial computerised control
system was to blame.  The day after the crash Louis Mermar, the French
Transport Minister, exonerated the aircraft. Asseline was stood down, accused
of flying dangerously, dismissed and stripped of his pilot's licence. But the
crash is far from being an open-and-shut case of pilot error.

  [Several paragraphs about the flight recorder, and the fact that four seconds
  of recording, from just before the crash, were lost because the tape was (it
  is claimed unnecessarily) cut to remove it from the box.]

Captain Asseline is also at odds with Airbus over alleged defects in the
aircraft. The pilot claims he was misled on the aircraft's true height by a bug
in the software. Normally an aircraft's height is calculated after entering the
local barometric pressure into its altimeter. Local ground control provides
this to aircraft regularly so that, with each change in barometric pressure,
the correct altitude can be displayed. The A320 has a history of occasionally
selecting a barometric reading from memory, rather than a current reading, when
switching from one flying mode to another. Both British Airways and Air France
have experienced this problem with their A320s.

  [Paragraphs describing Asseline's claims that he was misled into thinking he
  was flying at 100 feet, when it was actually 50 to 60 feet, though he admits
  that there were back-up aural warnings that he failed to heed.]

Finally the pilot claims that the aircraft failed to respond to its throttle.
`I began to push forward the throttle to stabilise my speed reduction', he told
Open File. `At that point I gave the order to disconnect the (automatic)
throttle and I'm sure that this movement put a mess in the computer. I push
forward the throttles . . . and I had no answer. So I pulled back throttles to
zero because I did that many times in training. I knew that if we had any
problems with the power, the only thing to do was to close the throttle and
then to give full power. That's exactly what I did.'

  [Paragraph confirming that, a month before the crash, Airbus put out such
  instructions.]  [Paragraphs about `a young Air France Boeing 747 Pilot,
  Norbert Jacquet who shared Asseline's belief that the computer fly-by-wire
  system was partly to blame' and who after going public on this was suspended
  on `psychological grounds' - disbelieved by fellow pilots - and has since
  been fired by Air France.]

Two facts are now established about the accident. First, Asseline was asked to
fly at 100 feet above the ground - 70 feet less than the normally authorised
level. Second, the operational direction and plan supplied by Air France for
the display was based on a longer adjoining airstrip than the one Asseline was
asked to fly over. On the originally chosen strip, there would have been ample
time for the aircraft to throttle up safely over the trees.

Since the crash, other Airbus A320 pilots have also had trouble with their
computer controls. One spoke of near disaster flying into Berlin: another of
his altimeter `going crazy' on a descent into Geneva.

British Airways' inaugurating chief pilot, George Hallett, says BA has
experienced similar problems. So, was Captain Asseline misled over the
aircraft's height, or are they merely claims which he has advanced after the
crash to take advantage of known software problems?

Even the aircraft's critics acknowledge that most of its software bugs have now
been ironed out. But Captain Xavier Barrell, technical vice-president of Air
France's pilots union, SNPL, says the vertical navigation system is still not
working properly.

Captain Asseline is now in Los Angeles, trying to gain an American pilot's
licence on a Boeing 737 200 series, the same aircraft type on which he did the
acceptance launch flights for Air France. The final report of the accident
enquiry is keenly awaited, not just by him and Norbert Jacquet, but also many
others."

And, on the subject of power outages (RISKS 8.75), _Science News_ reports that
on May 11 a raccoon electrocuted itself at the University of Utah, causing a
20-second power outage that resulted in a loss of data on the computers being
used by Fleischmann &amp; Pons to verify their cold fusion experiments. 

'coons have managed to cripple JPL more than once in the past (the last one

According to German publications, the `Wily Hacker' Karl Koch, of Hannover,
FR Germany, died Friday last week, probably by suicide. His body was found 
burnt (with gasoline) to death, in a forest near Celle (a German town near 
Hannover where he committed his hacks, as had been observed by German Post).
Koch was one of the 2 hackers who confessed their role in the KGB hack to
the public prosecutors, therewith bringing the case to public attention.
As German newspapers report, he probably suffered from a psychic disease: he 
thought he was permanently observed by alien beings named Illimunates' which 
tried to kill him. Probably, he had internalized the role of `Captain Hagbard'
(his pseudonym in the hacking scene), taken from a US book, who (like him) 
suffered from supervision by the Illuminates. Police officials evidently think
that Koch committed suicide (though I learned, that there are `some circum-
stances' which may also support other theories; no precise information about
such moments are reported).

According to German police experts, K. Koch's role in the KGB case as in daily
life can properly be understood when reading this book (which I couldnot get
until now, so I cannot control the adequacy of this theory!). Does anybody
have more evidence about cases of 'hacking' connected to moments of psychic 
anomalies, where hackers internalize roles of artificial persons and live
in worlds which they internalize after having read corresponding stories?

After having reverse-engineered several viruses on different PCs (AMIGA, Atari,
MacIntosh and IBM), we have developped (and experimentally tested, in a German
mailbox of the national Informatics society, since December 1988) a format in
which we describe essential features of computer viruses: the Computer Virus
Catalog. Thanks to Y.Radai, David Ferbrache and Otto Stolz, this Catalog is
now available in a revised form. The goal is to describe all those features
which a (not too well-informed) user needs to analyse whether and what virus
may have reached his machine; moreover, the catalog should contain some hints
which established tools help him to erase the virus.

At this time, about 25 viruses (maybe some of which exist in German locations
have been catalogued. At the Virus Test Center of Hamburg
University/Informatics (with a group of students, who participate in my
4-semester course on Computer Security), we have concentrated on AMIGA and IBM
PC viruses, but in the latter case, we have difficulties to get virus code 1)
because the German IBM PC virus scene doesnot offer the internationally
reported manifold, and 2) we refuse to exchange viruses, like stamps (we also
don't publish virus code or the `dossiers' which we produced by
reverse-engineering). We therefore appreciate any help which we can get from
competent and cooperative experts in the field.

          [The following are in separate documents:
                1st: the format of the Computer Virus Catalog,
                2nd: the index on entries at this time.]

To minimize the transfer problems to `remote locations' (seen from a Germano-
centric world view), we try to find locations where the actual entries may be
invoked (e.g. in US). Moreover, in order to guarantee some degree of complete-
ness, we ask groups/persons with developped knowledge in the field, to take on
the task of adding information about viruses not yet catalogued. We plan to
establish a committee which controls new or updated entries; while Y.Radai, and
D.Ferbrache have accepted to cooperate in this Virus Catalog Editorial
Committee, we hope for a few more experts to cooperate in this task.

Thank you in advance for comments.   Klaus Brunnstein.

NEW NIELSEN SYSTEM WILL WATCH THE WATCHERS WATCHING
By BILL CARTER
c.1989 N.Y. Times News Service, 2 May 1989

   NEW YORK -- Soon, some people may be watching television sets that will be
watching them back.  Nielsen Media Research disclosed plans Wednesday to
develop a ``passive people meter'' in conjunction with the David Sarnoff
Research Center at Princeton.  The device would measure television viewing
without relying on the participation of viewers -- a marked departure from
Nielsen's current ``people meter'' system, which requires viewers to
identify themselves by pushing buttons whenever they watch television.
   Since it began measuring television audiences in 1950, Nielsen has been
able to tell when sets in a sample household are on and what channels they
are tuned to.  The problem has been determining who in the family is
watching at any given time. Two years ago Nielsen introduced the people
meter to provide that information.
   The crucial component of the new system is an image-recognition device
that would identify members of a household and record, second by second,
when they are watching television, when they leave the room and even when
they avert their eyes to read a newspaper.
   Nielsen and Sarnoff demonstrated a working model of the device at a news
conference Wednesday, at which the issue of invasion of privacy was raised.
   Nielsen executives faced questions about the system's similarities to the
surveillance of Big Brother in George Orwell's novel ``1984.''  But Nielsen
executives argued that the system will not be intrusive.  ``I don't think
we're talking about Big Brother here at all,'' said John A. Dimling,
executive vice president of Nielsen Media Research. ``We're not scanning the
room to find out what people are doing. We're sensitive to the issue of
privacy.''  Dimling said it will be at least three years before the system
goes into service.
   The system will consist of a camera-like device and a computer attached
to the top of each set in the households in Nielsen's sample group of
television viewers.  The computer will be programmed to store the facial
images of each family member. The camera will be activated each time the set
is turned on and will scan the room for faces it recognizes.
   The same image-recognition technique has other possible applications, say
in medicine and policework.  Using a more sophisticated image-recognition
system, police could, in theory, scan an airport for known terrorists or
drug dealers.
   If tested successfully, the passive system would replace the current
people meter, which is only two years old. It was meant to provide more
precise information about which members of the household were watching
particular programs.
   The people meters replaced a system, used for 37 years, that relied on
viewers filling out diaries.  The three major television networks have
complained that people meters underestimate actual viewership.
   Research executives at the television networks have said that the
button-pushing task becomes boring quickly, leading to inaccuracies; that
many households refuse to cooperate, and that children cannot reasonably be
expected to push the buttons to indicate when they are watching.
   Nielsen now has 4,000 homes in its people-meter survey. But the networks
have complained that the current two-year period each household participates
in the survey is too long and leads to fatigue.
   The network reaction to the people meter is at least partly derived from
the effect the system has had on their business.
   Nielsen measurements of the networks' share of the audience declined 9
percent immediately after people meters were installed; a decline in ratings
means a decline in advertising revenues.  A passive system would address most
of these complaints, Dimling said.  He called the proposed system the ultimate
audience measurement, ``primarily because the respondents don't have to do
anything.''
   The response to the Nielsen announcement at the networks and in the
advertising community Wednesday was favorable.  Bart McHugh, senior vice
president of DDB Needham, said, ``A passive system is what we've all been
screaming about.''
   Alan Wurtzel, senior vice president of research at ABC, said:  ``I really
believe a passive system would be much better. I would hope they would get
this out and in place as quickly as possible.''
   Nielsen reports to clients will include both the number of viewers and
demographic data on the makeup of a show's audience.  Eventually, Dimling
said, networks could know almost instantly which sections of a show the
audience was most responsive to, and which bored them enough to make them
leave the room, pick up a magazine or fall asleep.  Dimling said that only
families that agree to participate will be included in the survey.
   Under the current people-meter system families are paid a small fee to begin
the metering process and are rewarded occasionally with small gifts.  Dimling
would not say what the monetary incentive for the passive meter system would be.
   Curtis Carlson, the director of information systems at Sarnoff, said, ``The
only information sent back to the Nielsen computers will be whether people are
watching television.''  He said the device will not actually record any other
activity.  It focuses only on facial features, he said, and decides first if it
is a face it recognizes and then if that face is directed toward the set.
Unfamiliar faces or even possibly the family dog will be recorded as
``visitors.''  The system, based on a technique the Sarnoff researchers have
labeled ``smart sensing,'' relies on visual tracking similar to the operation
of the human eye, Carlson said. Images on the periphery are screened out, and
the camera centers on only the most compelling features.
   The current prototype is about as big as a breadbox, Carlson said, and
the next step in the development process will be to miniaturize the entire
system. The goal is to have a machine about the size and shape of a
videocassette recorder.
   Nielsen and Sarnoff will also do an extended study and national testing
to ensure that the system can meet Nielsen needs before putting it into use.
   Nielsen has plans to use the technology in other ways.  For example,
Nielsen now conducts a market research project in which consumers are asked
to use a scanning device to read the product code on articles they buy. But
because the people meter requires so much work, Nielsen never asks the same
household to participate in both the scanning and people-meter surveys.
   Robert R. Brown, president of information services and technology for
Nielsen, said the passive people meter could be combined with the scanning
survey so Nielsen could track ``market stimuli with buying patterns.''
   Nielsen clients could in theory learn whether television advertising had
a direct influence on viewers' buying decisions.
   Nielsen has contracted with Sarnoff Research for exclusive use of the
technology in the media and marketing area.
   Carlson said a different version of the same technology has been applied
in at least one other business.  He said it was against company policy to
disclose which business, but he did say the federal government has expressed
interest in the technology.  He conceded that as the technology becomes more
sophisticated it could open up more questions of privacy.  ``Every
technology can be abused,'' he said.  But he stressed that his laboratory is
more interested in possible medical applications. He said, for instance,
that the system could eventually be used to increase the reliability of pap
smears by using image recognition to identify abnormal cells and could
provide a sophisticated object-recognition aid to the blind.  Development of
both is far down the road, he said.

The June issue of Defense Electronics reports that the manufacturer of the C-17
transport plane, Douglas Aircraft, estimates that software problems in the
avionics system of the plane will require a cost overrun of about *$500
million.* The figure was actually an estimate of a Congressional investigation,
then confirmed by Douglas.  The software is a package with an estimated 750,000
lines of code, as compared to the 25,000 lines of code in a C-5A.

The C-17 is supposed to replace the Air Force's transport aircraft, the C-5A,
the C-131, and the C-141.  The program was started in 1982, and there are
supposed to be 210 C-17s purchased by 1998 at a cost of $35.7 billion.

There is no detailed information in the short article on what the avionics
software problems entail.

The Bank of Montreal has two types of billing for checking accounts:
(1) a per check charge, or (2) flat rate for an unlimited number of
checks.  This month, in a burst of creative billing, both charges were
applied to the account.  What a chance to call it a computer error.
Here is what the bank said in a form letter:

          We are using the most immediate method to advise that we are
     correcting an error in the service fees charged to your last True
     Chequing Account Statement.

          We take great care to ensure all account entries are correct
     and we sincerely regret the human error which caused both monthly
                                 ^^^^^ ^^^^^
     plan fees and per item fees to be charged to some of our customer's
     accounts.  Your next statement will include the appropriate corrections.
 
Does this mean that blaming the computer will reflect poorly (in the
customers' view) on ATM?

Had an interesting experience with ATM's in the Boston Area last year.  I was
going on vacation and the mortgage needed to be paid during the vacation. So I
made a transfer, at a human teller, from savings to checking to cover it, wrote
the check and left for vacation.  Upon returning, I got some cash from the ATM
and noticed that the balances were not what I expected; savings was too high
and checking was too high also.  I went thru my receipts and found that I had
erred; I made the transfer from checking to savings rather that the other way
around.  This meant that my mortgage check was going to or had already bounced.
I called the mortage bank (different from the checking/savings bank) and
inquired about the mortgage payment.  I was told that everything was fine; the
payment was made.  Mystified, I went to my savings/checking bank and asked what
happened.  I had made the transfer at a BayBank Merrimack Valley branch office
and my account is thru BayBank Harvard Trust.  As background, in eastern Mass,
there is a banking company, BayBanks, that is really a holding company for a
variety of individual BayBank companies, two of which are BB Merrimack Valley
and BB Harvard Trust.  What I was told was that the erroneous transfer had
never been made (from checking to savings).  I inquired as to why this was so.
The person told me that when a transfer is done thru a human teller for an
account that is for a different BB company, the transaction may, or maynot get
processed; ie it drops into the bit bucket.  In order to make sure that a
transfer takes place, she suggested that I use the ATM, since there were no
known problems with transactions of this type.

So score one for the ATMs.

Reprinted from the Syracuse Herald-American, 5/28/89:

Justice Department Wary in Computer Case:
Is Washington fearful of losing a landmark trial?
by Matthew Spina, Staff Writer

	Some computer experts theorize that the Justice Department, afraid of
bungling what could become a landmark computer case, still doesn't know
how to treat the Cornell student whose computer worm slithered nationwide
in November.
	A further concern in Washington: A trial in the case might embarrass
the Department of Defense if its scientists are asked to detail how their
computers were among the thousands crippled by the worm.
	For several months, the decision on how to charge 23-year-old Robert T.
Morris, Jr. had been before Mark Richard, a deputy assistant attorney 
general.  Within the last few weeks, Richard made a decision that now is
being reviewed by an assistant attorney general, according to a computer
professional who has been talking with the Justice Department.
	"I thought we would have heard something from Washington by now," said
Andrew Baxtoer, the assistant U.S. attorney who in November and
December presented the case to a grand jury in Syracuse.
	The grand jury's report was sent on the the Justice Department, which
refuses to comment publicly on the matter because Morris has not been
indicted.
	"Within the next two weeks I assume that a decision will be made,"
said one official.
	"If they decide to begin an expensive trial, they have to make sure
they win so as not to damage future attempts to prosecute under that law," said
Eugene H. Spafford, an assistant professor at Purdue University whose analysis
of the worm has helped federal investigators.  "If they decide not to
prosecute, and the total thing that happens is he gets suspended (from
Cornell), I will be outraged."
	So far, Cornell has taken the only disciplinary measure against
Morris, suspending him for the 1989-90 academic year.  But the graduate
student left the computer science department early in November, the day 
after the worm spread out of a computer in Upson Hall.
	Morris, a computer science graduate student, has been called the 
author of a rogue computer program, called a worm, that was spread from
a Cornell University computer.  The program was designed to reproduce
and infect any computer linked to the Internet, a network shared by
colleges, research centers and military institutions.
	However, experts say an error caused the program to replicate out of
control, sending thousands of copies into thousands of computers.
	If Morris is to be charged with a felony, prosecutors would then
have to show he intended to destroy or extract information.
	Proving that would be difficult since the program neither destroyed nor
removed information from any computer.
	To convict Morris on most lesser charges, prosecutors would have 
to show he intended to harm computers.
	Prosecutors also could use a misdemeanor charge requiring them to 
prove only that Morris gained access to a federal government computer.
The worm did reach computers at the Army Ballistics Research Laboratory 
and NASA's Langley Research Center, among others.
	Some computer experts wonder, though, if Defense Department officials
will be reluctant to testify publicly about how their computers were 
penetrated - even those computers holding non-classified information.
In February, at a computer convention in San Diego, Defense Department
computer experts detailed some security improvements made to the 
network since November, but then refused to release copies of their 
presentation to people at the seminar.
	The FBI - which enforces the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 -
and some people in the computer industry are pushing for a vigorous 
prosecution to display a strong case against computer hacking.  Others in 
the industry, including some of Morris' friends from Harvard University
and Cornell, urge leniency because he was trying to demonstrate security
flaws with computers.

"How Tokyo Earthquake Could Destroy the World Economy"
SF Chronicle, Monday, June 12, page C7

The reporter quotes a story in "Manhattan, Inc" where it was disclosed
that the main and backup computer for the Tokyo Stock Exchange sit right
next to each other and in an area totally destroyed by the 1923 earthquake.

This computer is the SOLE repository of Japan's offical records of stock
ownership. Therefore if the computer is destroyed, all records of share
ownership could disappear with obvious consequences.

The original article speculated on various afteraffects of the earthquake
including the collapse of the Yen, bankrupcy of Western insurance companies,
and reversal of balance of payments problem.

The following was in the New York Times, June 13, 1989, p. B12:

                      Computer Glitch is Costly

Bettors who had the early daily-double yesterday at Belmont Park were
supposed to get back about $70 for hooking up Dyna Mite Mollie in the first
race with Jazz City in the Second.  But a computer glitch knocked their
payoff down to $3.40 and made winners out of everyone who had picked the
winner of the first race.

A defective computer file knocked out the track's parimutuel system after
the first race, and track stewards ordered the second race to be run a as
non-betting event after first delaying it for 27 minutes.  Under State
Racing and Wagering Board rules, all bets on a non-betting race must be
refunded, and the non-betting race must be removed from multiple-race bets
involving it.

So track officials had no choice but to pay off a consolation daily double
of Dyna Mite Mollie in the first and ``all'' in the second.  Actually, the
$3.40 payout on the ``4-all'' combination turned out to be a bit more
profitable than betting on Dyna Mite Mollie to win.  She paid only $3.20.

The computer problem was resolved after 55 minutes, and the remaining races
were run without any problem.  The cancellation of the other second-race
bets prompted a statewide refund of $439,144.

A new $4.1 million computer system designed to enable recording, indexing,
and scanning of 5.5 million pages of Uniform Commercial Code Division data
was suppposed to provide the equivalent of a title search for commercial
borrowers in two days instead of two weeks.  The new system went on-line on
5 April, but worked at only 30% of capacity.  For every day's work, the
staff was falling 2.5 days behind.  On 17 May they resorted to manual
methods.  The current backlog is 50,000 requests, and is not expected to be
eliminated until 1 August.  (The office is borrowing 100 employees.)
Because of the enormous delays now encountered, many lenders have simply
given up making commercial loans.  (The contractor had urged the state to
keep the old semi-manual system running as a backup, but the state
apparently insisted on a cutover without retaining the backup.)  [Source:

From the Baltimore Sun, 13 June 1989, presented w/o permission:

	Callers trying to dial a probation office in Delray Beach, Fla,
  yesterday heard sex talk from a panting woman named Tina instead.
  [...named Tina instead of what?...]

	Southern Bell officials said that a computer hacker reprogrammed
  their equipment over the weekend, routing overflow calls intended for the
  local probation office to a New York-based phone sex line.

	They said it was the first time their switching equipment had ever
  been reprogrammed by an outside computer intruder...

	The implications of a computer breach are staggering for phone
  companies.   Intercepting corporate communications, uncovering unlisted
  telephone numbers and tampering with billing information all are
  plausible consequences of such computer security breaches.

I find it interesting that two of the three "implications" of such activity
are inconvenient for corporations while one deals with personal issues.
Unmentioned are the more insidious implicatios of this specific activity,
rerouting incoming calls.  Calls to 911, for medical care, or to a neighbor
to come for help may be more costly in human terms than "intercepting
corporate communications."

This article appears in the July 1989 issue of Micro User (a hobby computing
magazine). I have written to the named anaesthetist to persuade him to think
again, and to the magazine to explain the problem.  I must emphasise that I
have no direct knowledge that the report is true, which is why I have
suppressed the name of the anaesthetist. The problem remains, though.  How
can we spread understanding of the problems of using computers in
safety-related applications, and of the minimum set of techniques which
should be employed if such systems are being developed?

{  A BBC Micro in the operating theatre

Anaesthesia is a precise art and at University Hospital, Nottingham [UK]
there are moves to sharpen that precision by taking a BBC micro into the
operating theatre.

... consultant anaesthetist [name given] plans to connect the machine to
syringe drivers and so improve control over drugs given to patients during
operations.  Senior lecturer at the hospital's adjoining medical school, he
hopes to take this even further by using the micro to receive messages from
the patient's body, adjust drug output accordingly and even act as a hazard
warning for theatre staff.

As well as being put into practice during operations, his ideas will be used
for teaching students in the Department of Anaesthesia.

"I am generally interested in looking at micro applications in the operating
theatre", he told Micro User. "The first is to link up a micro to drive
stepper motors and syringe drives which could get over the inertia problems
of the linear motors which are used at present".  }

Whenever my faith in technology flags, I turn to my favorite source of
inspiration: _The Wonderland of Tomorrow_, by Jean Carper.  I thought I
would share some of its prophetic words with RISKS readers.  (I particularly
like this chapter's title; I only wish I could send along the
illustrations.)

  Chapter 3

  Machines Will Take Over

      The electronic computer is the most marvelous machine ever
  invented.  It is often called the electronic "brain" because it does
  work so fast and accurately.  It has been widely used for only about
  ten years, yet it has already changed our lives.

      Some day a computer will run an entire company.  It will make
  about sales, production and personnel that are much more accurate
  than decisions made by businessmen.  Companies already have employed
  computers to determine policies.

      One day doctors may use computers to determine what is wrong
  with their patients.  The doctor will feed a list of symptoms into a
  machine, and it will tell him exactly which disease he should treat.
  In an experiment at Cornell University a computer and a doctor
  diagnosed the ailments of 350 people, and the computer did a better
  job than the doctor.

      Airplanes without human pilots may soon fly passengers and
  freight across the country.  Air traffic will be controlled from the
  ground by computers.  Some airports are now using computers to help
  prevent mid-air collisions.

      Computers already have translated Russian books, speeches, and
  scientific papers into English.  So far, these machine translations
  are crude and imperfect, but improvements are made all the time.
  Soon we may see translations of hundreds of foreign books and
  magazines in any bookstore.  It will be possible because computers
  made the translations many times aster than human language experts
  could.  How rapidly new ideas will travel!

  [...] People who work with computers sometimes call them "idiots." 
  A man, called a programmer, has to tell the machine how to work
  problems step-by-step.  He feeds instructions into the machine, and
  each time the machine works a problem it must consult the
  instructions.  This series of directions is called a program.  A
  program is so somplicated that a man may sped several months
  developing it.

  [...] A prominent scientist has suggested that we eliminate wars by
  having the generals of unfriendly countries play war on the
  computer.  No lives would be lost, and no cities destroyed.  The
  generals of each country would simply feed their battle plans into
  the computer.  The machine would run through the battles and show
  which side won.  The losing country could perhaps pay a fine to the
  winner, and everyone would continue living peacefully.

      We have seen very little of what computers can do, but we can
  expect amazing things of them.  One day the development of the
  computer may be regarded as a greater achievement than smashing the
  atom!

I believe that the book in question must be "Illuminatus!" by Harold Shea and
Robert Anton Wilson. The book is a spoof on conspiracy theories, and intimates
that many and probably all human institutions are just fronts for a small
group of 'enlightened ones', who are themselves a front for the Time dwarves of
Reticuli Zeta, or perhaps Atlantean Adepts, remnants of Crowley's Golden Dawn,
or even more likely the Lloigor of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. A leading 
character in this book is named Hagbard Celine.

"Illuminatus!" is a fun read if you like psychedelia and paranoia. It also
seems to have influenced a lot of subsequent work, most notably Adams'
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe". It is easy to see how an unbalanced
mind, taking it literally, could be completely absorbed. In fact
"Illuminatus!" purports to intend just this sort of programming, referring
to it as 'Operation Mindf**k'. I don't think this constitutes a real danger
for the vast majority of sane adults, but it may, tragically, have been the
case here.  Or perhaps, no disrepect intended, Koch may in the course of
various hacks really have discovered too much about the Illuminati. After
all, they are supposed to be the secret power behind the KGB ... :-)

Michael Doob ("The Computer Didn't Commit the Crime," RISKS 8.78) remarked that
his bank has taken to citing "human error" instead of "computer error" when
apportioning blame for mistakes.  This is, of course, getting to be a familiar
pattern to RISKS users (e.g. the Airbus crash, the Vincennes, etc.).  Two
things are worth mentioning:

    (1) In the case of big systems, the investment grows so great and becomes
        such a milk-cow for so many people and institutions that any scapegoat
        but the system itself will do in the event of a breakdown.  The irony
        in this lies in the fact that the charge of "human error" is correct,
        in a way: we humans erred in constructing a buggy system and regarding
        it as reliable.

    (2) We used to cite "computer error" because it was a convenient way to
        deflect blame away from human persons.  Implicit in this behaviour was
        a view that human persons possessed a moral dignity not proper to the

        the rap. Our new pattern of blame suggests that we have set this order

Two major new North American Aerospace Defense Command computer systems have
encountered software development problems that have increased costs by at least
$207 million dollars and will be at least seven years late when delivered.

According to Aviation Week and Space Technology (May 22, 1989, pp. 24 &amp; 25),
the Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) modernization and the
Communications System Segment Replacement (CSSR) programs, both part of the
Cheyenne Mountain upgrade at Colorado Springs, have encountered major delays in
their development, prompting criticism of the management of both programs from
the General Accounting Office (GAO).

The GAO report criticized the project for its unrealistic expectations and the
willingness to start the second phase before the first phase had been
completed.  The commander of the U. S. Space Command, USAF General John
Pitrowski, said that the reports are substantially correct, but he disagreed
with certain of the GAO's recommendations.

SPADOC is the data processing and communications center that supports the North
American Aerospace Defense Command.  The center is supposed to be able to
maintain information on the position of up to 10,000 man-made objects in space.
It is also to provide warning of an attack, and to determine when satellites
need to be maneuvered for their safety.

The SPADOC modernization program was divided into three blocks -- A, B and C.
Full-scale development on Block A started in 1983 and was intended to provide
the hardware and software to automatically monitor and assess foreign
activities that might put U. S. satellites at risk.  Block B is to have the
ability to make predictions of the orbits of about 400 satellites, and to
automate a space object database that catalogs about 10,000 objects.  Finally,
Block C is to add greater automation, and to provide for the growth
requirements of the system through the year 2005.

The prime contractor is Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp.  IBM is the
major hardware supplier.  Logicon, Inc. is providing independent validation and
verification of the software for the Air Force, and the Mitre Corp. is
providing engineering support to the Air Force as well.  According to the GAO
report, both Mitre and Logicon raised concerns about the quality of Ford's
software development and whether Ford would be able to meet the schedule.

The Air Force accepted the Block A system, even though (according to the GAO)
it did not satisfactorily perform 14 of 23 required functions within the
specified time limits.  One example is that notification that a satellite is
under attack takes four times longer than specified.  According to the article,
Mitre reported that in tests conducted in 1988, the system was so slow that at
several points it was almost impossible to interface with it through the
operators' consoles.  The software is unstable as well, and unacceptable times
to restart the system after a problem had occurred (presumably software
exceptions and such) were also cited.

Ford has proposed a new architecture for Block B using IBM 3090 computers.
Ford also says that these computer will be sufficient to handle the Block C
portion as well.

The GAO also noted that, even if the software had worked and been on time, it
could not have been installed in Cheyenne Mountain due to a lack of uniform
wiring standards for computer and telecommunications equipment and congestion
in the cabling area.  Pitrowski agreed that the Air Force should have resolved
the wiring problems sooner, but noted that the Air Force awarded a contract for
facility modifications on April 19th.

We have seen quite a few articles on things going wrong with the
computerization of the military.  The latest example is the posting by Karl
Lehenbauer about "NORAD Computers: Years Late, Unusably Slow, $207 Million
Over Budget".

While most articles concerned the Western military, there is no doubt 
that our friends on the other side suffer from the same problems.  After 
all, they are doing their level best to get their hands on as much 
Western computer technology as possible.  (I have heard rumors that 
getting our technology to them is one of the most subtle and insidious 
plots developed by the CIA so far.)

As a result, it is reasonable to suspect that the advance of computer 
technology into the field of the military, has made it well neigh 
impossible to fight any war worth its SALT.  We find corroborating 
evidence for this position in the on-going disarmament proposals.  These 
have been started by Gorbachov, who knows an impossible situation when 
he sees one, and have now been taken over by Western leaders like Bush, 
who perhaps reads comp.risks.

So where the sheer incompetence of politicians and generals used to 
start wars, the sheer incompetence of us computer people has now put an 
end to it.  No mean feat.  For centuries humanity has been looking for 
the Weapon That Would End War Forever.  We have found it.  War has 
ended, not with the bang of a bomb, but with the gentle whisper of 
crashing software.

I was recently witness to an event that may be of interest to those
pondering safe user interfaces, man-in-the-loop questions, and the like. Not
being an expert in any of these areas myself, the only comment I'll make is
that it seems important to realize that there are cultural aspects of
human-technology interfaces. Never assume that a sane, well-trained person
will do 'the right thing'...

The following is a true story. No names are given, so as to protect the
participants from any further embarassment!

The scenario: experienced computer user/programmer needs to get some software
   mailed out during the weekend. He's relatively new to the office, so he has
   asked where the spare floppies are kept. He is told "there's a box with
   a bunch of floppies over on Joe's desk". There's a small error in these
   instructions: the correct box of spare floppies is on Jane's desk, not
   Joe's.

What happens: He goes into the office alone on Saturday morning. Nobody
   is there to watch him (not that anybody normally would -- he's an
   expert, remember!) He finds no box of floppies on Joe's desk. But - aha! -
   there's a nice big box UNDER the desk. It is sealed. (It was delivered 
   the day before.) He opens the box, and finds a bunch of brand-new 
   commercial software packages. Shrink-wrapped, the whole bit.  Without 
   skipping a beat, he rips open a couple, and finds sealed white
   envelopes inside. The envelopes have your usual dire license agreement
   warning, beginning with a large STOP sign... ("STOP. Read before opening!
   etc...") Without skipping a beat, he rips open the envelopes, reformats
   the enclosed floppies, puts on new labels, and uses them to mail the
   software he needed. Thus ruining a few thousand dollars worth of new
   commercial software!

Now, before you read the answer, think about this puzzle: how could a sane
   person, an *expert* no less, completely ignore the warnings and do such
   a crazy thing? What are the RISKS implications of this?

Here's the answer:

He was able to do it, without even wondering whether it was the right thing
to do, because *in his experience*, what he saw and his resulting actions
were completely normal. In a previous job, his company received large
quantities of commercial software for evaluation and review. So much software
that they treated it like junk mail. The floppies were treated as reusable
media. With that in mind, his actions become completely reasonable! He was
trained to ignore dire warnings, expensive-looking software packaging, and
the like. The only thing of value in a box of commercial software, in his
experience, was the floppy disks themselves. And they were only useful once
reformatted and with fresh labels on them.

Hmmmmm...

In RISKS 8.79, Jerry Carlin (jmc@PacBell.COM) cites a story from 
the SF Chronicle (presumably San Francisco, and not some 'zine):

    The reporter quotes a story in "Manhattan, Inc" where it was
    disclosed that the main and backup computer for the Tokyo Stock
    Exchange sit right next to each other and in an area totally
    destroyed by the 1923 earthquake.

    This computer is the SOLE repository of Japan's offical records of
    stock ownership. Therefore if the computer is destroyed, all
    records of share ownership could disappear with obvious
    consequences.

It seems very unlikely that the computer is the SOLE repository.  More
likely, the two computers together with the on-site and off-site backups of
the data they contain are the widely distributed and highly redundant
repository of the stock ownership data.  That's not such an exciting story,
of course.

Supposing that Tokyo Exchange follows conventional backup procedures
(and they could easily do much better), destruction of both computers
would mean the loss of the current day's transactions; destruction of
the entire site might mean the loss of as much as one week's
transactions.  That's expensive, but it's not catastrophic.

&gt; ownership. Therefore if the computer is destroyed, all records of share
&gt; ownership could disappear with obvious consequences.

This is why people in my position spend so much time with and are so concerned
about backups, so that the computer is not the "SOLE respository" of any
valuable information.  Well managed computer centers keep a set of complete
backups "offsite".  The ones with larger budgets use an storage location
complete with protection against fire and other environmental hazards.

The only story I have heard about a computer center that didn't keep any
backups is about US Cable in Lake County, IL.  Every six months or so, they
would unscramble all six pay channels for everyone for about a week, reportedly
because of a "computer problem" where they lost information about who was
paying for which channels.  If they had reliable backups, these records could
have been restored in a matter of hours, instead of a week.

I heard an NPR report recently about a Qantas plane going out of control
temporarily. It seems the autopilot suffered some sort of glitch. The (human)
pilot recovered from the dive, but several people bumped their heads, etc.
Since then, I've heard no follow-up, and seen nothing in comp.risks.

Was I hallucinating about the original report, or do I just have my head in a
bag this month??

Henry Spencer comments on the acceptance by mathematicians of proof by
computer.  I think it's important to recognise that the computer introduces no
new risk here; we all believe group classification theorem, don't we, and
surely no-one has ever found time to check the proofs (or even understand the
underlying arguments) of all the lemmas and prior theorems involved therein.

Mathematics has a long history of "proofs" that aren't (eg the omission of
axioms about betweenness in geometry for a couple of thousand years); and quite
a few "theorems" have been disproved. Checking a proof is no easier than
checking a program. Checking that several proofs combine correctly to deliver a
new proof is no easier than checking that several programs combine correctly.

Do we have a new risk here - the risk that, because a computer is involved, we
will assume a new risk exists even when it doesn't (or is not new)?

More likely he received an inductive shock from the electric motor.  There
is no way that a mere 12 volts will cause that sensation, but a kick of
a few hundred (thousand?) volts will do it, as the field collapses.

[Excerpted, from "Bioengineering: Biomedical, Medical and Clinical
Engineering", by A.T. Bahill (Prentice-Hall)]

     The impedance of the human body can be modeled as a core of low resistance
  (around 500 Ohms) ... and the skin with a higher resistance (1 to 100
  kiloOhms). ... the amount of electrical current necessary to induce
  venticular fibrillation [a "cardiac arrest"] in the human heart ... a minimum
  of 80 microAmps, 100 uA, and 180 uA [in three separate studies].

These values lead to estimates of the required voltage being anywhere from
240 mV (80uA times 3 kOhms) to 16 V (180 uA times 201 kOhms).  Of course,
this assumes that the current path crosses the chest.  Also, the heart is
especially susceptible to particular frequencies; good old 60 Hz is "the
optimum frequency for producing ventricular fibrillation." (Bahill)

Quoting from Colin Wilson's "The Misfits":

	The revolutionary Marat decided that de Sade was a typical
	aristocratic libertine of the old regime and ought to die;
	by accident, however, he denounced the Marquis de la Salle,
	who was executed. Marat discovered his mistake and was about
	to rectify it when he was murdered in his bath by Charlotte
	Corday. Unaware of how close he had been to the guillotine,
	de Sade delivered an address describing Marat as a great man.

The parallels to modern wrongful arrest struck me, as well as the question
of how bad the reign of terror might have been with the "help" of modern
data processing. It appears the over-reliance on the accuracy of "official"
orders has been around for a while. Perhaps Madame DeFarge should have used
an error-correcting code in her knitting?

[My remembrance of early dp is that redundancy in the form of hash totals and
transaction serial numbers was used quite early, and seems to have been
forgotten, rather than enhanced, as we have "advanced"]

According to the May 22, 1989 issue of Computerworld, Sabre is run on 8
interconnected 3090-200E computers under a Sabre-modified version of ACP
(Airline Control Program OS by IBM).  A custom version of ACP has been used
there for about 20 years.  Neither ACP nor TPF 3.1 (due to be installed 3rd
qtr 89) provides the required protection, according to the article.  It seems
the errant 'core-walker' program modified another task that was formatting
disk drives - and the labels on 1080 disk drives were destroyed.

"The Sabre system is down an average of six minutes a week for maintenance,
Juracek noted, and is usually upgraded 'on the fly' so that service to other
parts of the world is not disrupted.  Because ACP cannot run without a disk
subsystem, Sabre software engineers took the unusual step of rebooting the
crashed system using IBM's VM operating system.  Then, they had to relabel each
disk drive and reset the pointers that indicate where passenger data is loca-
ted....While most Sabre data was not lost, the 'pointers' to all flight reser-
vation data were - and it took 100 programmers and systems engineers more than
10 hours to relabel each disk volume.  The system was restarted under ACP about
7 am CDT, and the reformatting was done by 11 am.  Then, due to pent-up network
demand, American's systems engineers had to gradually restart Sabre, slowly ad-
mitting more traffic from 27 front-end communications processors here."

ACP and TPF are IBM real-time operating systems that are designed to support
heavy transaction volumes.  The article goes on to state that virtual storage
will not be available under TPF until 1993.  Apparently other protection fea-
tures are not there either, such as private address spaces and multiple
storage protection keys, which are implemented under MVS.

In RISKS 8.75, MIchael Berkley quoted a newspaper article about an accident in
northern Ontario in which a radio-control signal intended for one mining
machine triggered an unintended response in a second machine, which pushed a
miner to his death.  Berkley asked:  "What kind of safeguards are possible in
this situation and are the safeguards reliable?"

I am not familiar with Canadian regulations for radio control, but they are
probably similar to US regulations.  As it happens, the FCC has just adopted
new rules governing radio signals from unlicensed devices, including radio
control systems (Gen. Docket 87-389:  First Report &amp; Order adopted 30 March
1989).  The Commission is explicitly trying to encourage the proliferation of
low-power unlicensed radio devices of all types, in the spirit of
"deregulation" promoted by outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick.  The primary
feature of the new "Part 15" rules is to loosen restrictions on the use of
radio links in appliances and systems sold publicly.  The new rules begin to
take effect on June 23rd.  They are sure to lead quickly to a rash of new
products such as wireless modems, wireless VCR/camera units, new remote
monitoring and control systems for the home, etc.  One aspect of the new rules
relevant to the mining story is that the FCC set no maximum power limit for
radio emissions in mines, caves or tunnels.

A traditional feature of all "Part 15" devices is that they enjoy no right of
protection from interference - either from similar devices or from licensed
transmitters.  Licensing confers the right of non-interference.  Radio control
systems are generally unlicensed.

Since most of the services that the Commission regulates are for communication,
they are used to thinking of interference in terms of, e.g., degradation of TV
picture quality.  They are not used to thinking of it in terms of misdirected
control.  In fact, because Part 15 devices have no recognized right of
non-interference, the Commission's attitude is - and has always been - "buyer
beware/you're on your own."

Thus, the only safeguards we can expect in the US, to avoid accidents like the
one that killed the Canadian miner, are those voluntarily adopted by
manufacturers.  Fortunately, there is a relatively simple fix to the problem:
have each radio command begin with an identifier specifying which device is
being addressed, and have the identifier be unique enough that there is little
chance of two devices with the same identifier being co-located.  Better, have
the owner or operator be able to set the identifiers in the field, to ensure
each is unique within the transmitted signal's radius.

Over a dozen petitions have already been filed objecting to the FCC's new
rules.  I will probably be filing comments soon on behalf of the Association of
North American Radio Clubs.  I may raise this issue of radio control safety in
my filing.  But I'm sure the Commission will say that this is a matter for the
marketplace can decide, and no "interference" from them is needed.

The plot of the latest John LeCarre novel, *Russia House*, involves a Soviet
physicist who goes by the code name Goethe, who, in the story, was for many
years in charge of the Soviet ICBM testing program, and created the telemetry
encryption schemes that the Americans had been trying to break for many years
(telemetry encryption is a serious dispute between the U.S. and the Soviets in
real life).  Goethe has an attack of conscience, and decides to reveal to the
West that Soviet ICBMs are virtually duds--if they get out of their silos at
all, they're just as likely to hit Minsk as Chicago.  All of contemporary U.S.
strategic theory, and strategic spending (hardened silos, SDI,
launch-on-warning, etc.), is of course based on the assumption that Soviet
missiles can fly right down the silos of Minuteman IIIs and MXs over here.

The interesting part of this story is the effect that Goethe's information has
on U.S. authorities.  The defense contractors go ballistic, if you'll pardon
the pun.  Their whole raison d'etre is based on continuing technological
refinement to counter a Soviet threat that is suddenly no longer there.  The
"Bluebird" documents (Goethe's notebooks) also call into question the whole
multi-billion dollar apparatus of U.S. surveillance and intelligence analysis
in the strategic arena--satellites, listening posts, KC-135s, trawlers, etc.,
not to mention brigades of experts.  And the implication is that the U.S.
arsenal is really no better, that we've all been living with the colossal
implications of two enormous nuclear arsenals, and in actual fact neither one
really works at all.

The result of this revelation from Goethe is largely just an escalation of the
current stalemate between doves and hawks.  The hawks claim Goethe's
information is sophisticated disinformation, and if the information is
deliberate disinformation then the claims of Soviet incompetence *must* mean
that the missiles are actually even *more* accurate than we suspect.  The doves
claim that the information is accurate, and that there is no rationale for
extravagant weapons systems that are supposed to protect us from a threat that
has always been a hoax.  This debate produces paralysis.

It would seem to me that technologists and scientists, contemplating the
awesome significance of the integrated nuclear system that we live with every
day, would want to know, objectively, whether the damn thing will work when it
is called upon.  Once this fact had been established one way or another, it
would be immensely easier to grasp what sort of problems we face that can be
bracketed out from the technological uncertainty that saturates the whole
nuclear system.  But, since a "test" of nuclear war is impossible--or at least
so wildly crazy that no sane person would propose it seriously--we have an
enormous, fundamental precedent for building other technological systems that
have great risk, that cannot be tested, that are inseparable from political
persuasions and irrational faiths, and which incrementally add momentum and
depth to this process of scientific and technological corruption.  Goethe
suggests that when his scientific notebooks are published, they be titled "The
Biggest Lie Ever," or something like that.  But even Le Carre doesn't seem to
realize how big the lie really may be--it may no longer be confined to nuclear
weapons, but in fact may be endemic in a whole host of technologies that have
been generated within the same, now one-dimensional epistemology of modern
engineering--"we hope it will work; if it doesn't get back to us."

The following item appeared in SELF magazine (aimed at younger working
women) a couple of months ago, and I've heard nothing about it since:

"Credit-card-size medical records are being used in several pilot
programs in the U.S., and the British government is thinking about
issuing them to the entire population.  The pocket-sized plastic
"smartcard" has a thin computer chip that stores basic info. -- blood
type, allergies, current health and prescriptions -- plus a summary of
insurance coverage.  Down the road: "optical memory cards" using laser
technology similar to compact discs.  These could store a person's
entire medical history from birth to death, including diagnoses from
every visit to a doctor.  The card could even plug into a computer to
produce the patient's X-rays on a TV screen."

The technology under discussion here was not entirely clear: a "thin
computer chip" -- like that in a calculator?  How would this be
read/written to?  (A friend has told me that

	when media ignorami use the words "computer chips", they
	could mean just about anything.  In the context of "smart
	cards" they do in fact mean a tiny CPU and some memory,
	with electrical contacts on the card.
.)

I had initial visions of people carrying their medical records around
next to their ATM cards, with the same results -- like scrambling due
to magnetic wallet clasps.  The problems of storing an "entire medical
history" on a card are even worse:  lost cards, thefts, and invasion
of privacy on a mass scale.  Is this a naive assessment of RISK?

(I'm really interested in this.  Would anyone with "smart card"
 experience care to comment?)

Another example of not keeping back-ups:  I went into Tower Video about 6
weeks ago, selected a tape to rent, and presented the cashier with my Tower
Video card.  He told me that he'd have to issue me a new card number, as
the old database had been wiped out in a crash.  Tower is a chain; this
loss of data was evidently company-wide.

I guess prospective Supreme Court justices should rent from Tower!   Sam

     Dayton Daily News - Tuesday June 13, 1989 Page 3 

     Office workers, police dispatchers and bank customers got a little taste
of what life would be like without computers Monday when systems across
Montgomery County crashed all at once because of a little electrical "blip".

     A power failure of less than a second caused lights merely to flicker,
but was enough to trip circuit breakers in some buildings and zap scores of
computer systems into temporary chaos.

     The county's new 911 computer-aided police and fire dispatch system was
affected, delaying response time on some calls.

     "It tool down the county's mainframe (computer)," said Sgt. Richard
Elsner, 911 coordinator for the Montgomery County sheriff's office.  "We had
calls lined up in the computer waiting to be dispatched, and we just lost
everything.  Fortunately, we didn't have any emergency callers waiting."

     Dayton Power and Light Co. spokeswoman Ethel Washington said the utility
was unsure what caused the power failure, which she called a "blip."  She
said that "with something that quick, we may never know."

     The lights flickered in the sheriff's dispatch center in the basement
of the Montgomery County Jail at 11:18 a.m., Elsner said.  "The lights went
off for less than a second - I thought somebody cut across the lines or
something," he said.

     A second momentary pulse occurred about 11:30 a.m., he said.

     The computer failure scrambled things for a few hours, but crews were
dispatched as they were before the computer system was installed.  "The
radios are still working," Elsner said.

     Washington said DP&amp;L's computers in the West Dayton office, from which
she was calling also were down.

     For reasons of security, many private users were mum about the power
failure's effect on their computer systems,  "It was nothing major," Society
Bank spokeswoman Susan Byers said.

     Nevertheless, customers at several banks were unable to make
transactions at automatic teller machines until the mess was straightened
out.

     Tina Hamden, general manager of All World Travel, said airline
reservation computers at the downtown office shut off automatically when the
power went down.  Office telephones went dead as well, leaving clients
hanging.

     The travel agency did not lose any computer data, but a local computer
expert said that is a risk for most computer users.

     If a computer user is accessing data using a disk drive, hard disk or
other storage device during a power failure, that data may be lost during
the transfer from the storage device to the computer's internal memory.

     "It goes to that nebulous void for computer data," said Robert Stamper,
president of Databank Information Services Inc., a Dayton company that
provides emergency services for computer users.

     "If you don't have a backup, you have to re-enter that data - it has to
be keyboarded back in all over again, and on a big computer, that can cost
an absolute fortune."

     Stamper said his staffers were kept busy Monday afternoon delivering
backup copies of computer tapes to clients who lost data during the power
failure.

     "They're calling us saying, 'Bring the tapes back out,'" Stamper said.
"They either need a section of their computer records or need to reconstruct
their lost data.  If that was a blip, that was a hell of a blip."

     His customers, which include several large area companies, were also
reluctant to discuss problems that arose with their mainframe computers.

     "They don't want people to know how vulnerable their systems are,"
Stamper said.

In <A HREF="/Risks/8.75.html">RISKS-8.75</A>, Gene Spafford (spaf@cs.purdue.edu) writes about the Soviet
computer which zapped his opponent when the opponent was about to beat
him... Some may say this is bogus... but it is in fact perfectly possible.

	According to the message, this is no normal computer. It is
dedicated to playing chess and moves its pieces on the chess board.
This is possible by magnetising the chess pieces, and moving them
by induced electromagnetic fields in the board. The fields are induced
by passing a current through loops and coils of wires which are
embedded in the board. This is all to tell you that it is possible
for the machine in question to use high voltages. Alternating current
is no use for producing the magnetic fields wanted, so I suspect they 
used DC... and DC currents are LETHAL. The muscles contract when the
current flows so the heart of the player would stop immediately.
So one only needs a short circuit to the case of the chess board
(which I suspect was made of metal and not well earthed) and
the friendly computer can become a murderer.

   [Rich contributed an item which I ran in Software Engineering Notes 
   four years ago.  Here is a fuller explanation.  PGN]

In the early morning hours of January 18, 1978, a very heavy load snow and
ice from a winter storm caused the collapse of the 2.4 acre roof of the
Hartford Coliseum in Hartford, Connecticut.  This roof was noted for being
one of the first large-span roofs made possible by computer design and
analysis, and was modeled as a space truss using a trusted program.
Fortunately, the several thousand fans attending a basketball game a few
hours before had gone home, and the structure was empty.

After long analysis of the collapsed roof, the initial failure was found to
have occurred in a lateral brace used to stabilize a long, slender truss
member.  The immediate cause of failure was the inadequate design of the
connection of the brace.  The joint was modeled in the computer as having no
eccentricity, an incorrect assumption.  Eccentricity in a connection means
(briefly) that the axis of the applied load is not the same as the neutral
axis of the support, so that a bending moment is developed, putting
additional stress in the member.

A nonlinear collapse simluation was rerun using the correct model for the
joint, and with loading conditions selected to approximate those of the
night of failure.  The result was that the connection failed as it had under
the real conditions [1].

Quite simply, the problem here was: The structure analyzed was not the
structure built.

With regard to the Minuteman system, the system is guided only in the sense
that you may preprogram it for any destination. It is NOT self-correcting on
its course. The main missile is solid fuel, which means that once you light it
off, it will burn until it's gone (like the SRB's on the shuttle). They can
control the direction of the thrust but not its intensity.

At this point it is gliding until it releases its warheads. The missile has no
mechanism for sensing where it is and aiming the warheads accordingly - it is
just told, BEFORE LAUNCH, "point here, release a warhead, point there, release
a warhead, etc." The point is that all errors in the launch are cumulative and
no mechanisms exist to correct them.

Which makes the following very important: All tests of the Minuteman, and there
haven't been very many, have been from Vandenberg AF base in CA, aimed at an
atoll in the south Pacific. The missiles rise out of the atmosphere, but never
enter the Van Allen belt.

The Van Allen belt, like any magnetic field, is a toroid, and if a Minuteman
was really fired it would be over the pole - and it would pass through the Van
Allen belt twice. It is also the case that the local gravitation field
characteristics over the pole are different than they are over the Pacific.

None of this matters much when you are shooting at something like a city which
is miles across. It matters a great deal when you are shooting at a hardened
target like a silo or a bunker. There an error of 100 yards is the difference
between success and failure in knocking out the enemy target.

If the last war does happen (let's hope not) there is no question that our
Minuteman force can destroy all the cities in the USSR. To use them in a
first-strike against silos, on the other hand, is a crapshoot. (If anything,
the situation from a Trident is even worse because your starting position may
not be known completely accurately.)

I suspect that those in charge of our nuclear forces know this, and it is one
of the reasons we haven't had the war (though hopefully not the only one).

This reminds me of another story, equally interesting: Shortly after coming to
office, the Reagan administration asked the Soviets to destroy a certain class
of medium range missiles in Europe in exchange for a promise from us not to
develop an equivalent one. The Soviets laughed.

So we developed the Pershing II. It was only tested twice, and it blew up
during launch both times.

...at which point, the powers that be said "That's good enough. Deploy it." So
we built over a hundred of them and put them in Germany and the Netherlands
(political disturbances and picketing notwithstanding).

Ultimately they were traded for the Soviet equivalent class in the INF treaty.
It makes you wonder whether the Pershing II ever had any other purpose, doesn't
it?

	Several recent articles in RISKS have mentioned computer failures due
to various glitches on the power supply lines.  At the same time, many
companies are advertising Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS's) claiming that
they safeguard against these problems, or at least that they provide enough
time for a graceful shutdown in the event of a power failure.

	What is the actual situation?  Are these UPS's capable of doing what
they claim?  If so are they not used because of the cost, or because people do
not feel that they are needed?  Or are there other issues?

A momentary electrical 'blip' is a dangerous thing; I lost my computer to one
this morning.

Last night, there was an electrical storm in the area-- no close strikes or
power problems.  But this morning (clear skies), i heard a crack/
explosion like a transformer blowing out.  Immediately following this was a
momentary (less than one second) loss of power.  Later, when I went to use the
computer (Mac Plus w/a flaky video board anyway), the video had been reduced
to a 3 millimeter wide strip up the middle of the screen (Horizontal scan gone?)
Whether or not the storm had any connection with the 'blip' is questionable,
but the blip definitely nailed my computer.

BTW: the logic board is fine... only the video was lost.

Questions: What is the best way to protect against a blip (UPS? isolation
transformer?)?
What measures have been taken to protect against such blips in critical systems?
How much of a threat are 'blips' to hardware?

After an oral hearing in the appeal of my old lawsuit (re launch
on warning and the question as to whether that capability
delegates a decision to declare war to the military and its
computers), I asked for a transcript of the hearing.  I was told
over the phone that it had been located and would be transcribed,
but then received a form stating, without apology or explanation,
that it was "unavailable."  I asked why this was the case, on the
phone to the clerk, and was transferred to someone who told me
that the transcript was not available due to "computer error."

She explained that only in the past few months (*"this year"*)
had the taping of hearings become the procedure, that my tape had
mysteriously disappeared ("probably someone with access didn't
want it published", she supposed), and that this loss had caused
the court (Ninth Circuit court of appeal, San Francisco) to
realise for the first time the need for back-up tapes.
Accordingly, procedures had been changed so that originals would
be kept securely henceforth, she stated, pleading that it was
ignorance of the new computer (tape-recorder = computer in
her books) technology that caused the problem.

However, there was no problem finding the tape of a hearing I had
in the same court some *three years* earlier.

Subject: Hillsborough Football -- Another Computer Connection

In the UK, we recently had a major disaster at the Hillsborough football
ground in Sheffield, in which 95 people died after being crushed against the
steel barrier which is supposed to prevent the spectators from invading the
pitch. It is estimated that the pressure per person on the fence, due to the
weight of the people behind surging forward, was in excess of one ton.

           [The computerized turnstile problem was noted in <A HREF="/Risks/8.60.html">RISKS-8.60</A>. PGN]

Now the official enquiry into the disaster is sitting, and the papers are full
of reports. At some point, it seems the Police decided they needed cutting
gear to use on the fence, and telephoned the Fire Brigade for it to be sent.
Clearly, its need was EXTREMELY URGENT.

Note that Hillsborough is the major football ground in Sheffield. It must
occupy something the size of a city block, and it can be approached from
several roads. The following is quoted from the Daily Mail for June 14.

Two vital minutes were wasted in helping victims of the Hillsborough tragedy.

The fire brigade refused to send vital cutting gear until they knew what street
the football stadium was in. Four times telephone operator Susan Davies
demanded the address. Then she asked five times what the equipment was needed
for.

Yesterday Miss Davies told the enquiry ... that the fire service computer
would not recognise the Hillsborough ground as a place.
'It needs a specific address and district in order to determine what pumps are
required to attend', she explained.
'My training is not to assume what an address is. It's up to me to ascertain
that from the person calling'.  As far as she was concerned, she added, there
could have been several football grounds at Hillsborough. ... The conversation
... went like this:

Police: Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough please straight away?

Fire: Just a minute. Right, what's the address?

Police: Cutting equipment for Hillsborough football ground straight away.

Fire: Hillsborough football ground?

Police: Yes, Hillsborough football ground.

Fire: What road is that on, do you know?

Police: There has been a major accident, all the ambulances are there.

Fire: What road is it on?

Police: I have no idea. Hillsborough football ground.

Fire: What road is it on, do you know?

Police: Hillsborough football ground, what road is it on? (this to someone in
police control). Penistone Road.

Fire: Penistone Road?

Police: Penistone Road, OK.

Fire: Penistone Road, just a minute. What's exactly involved?

Police: It's football, a big match, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.

Fire: Yes, but why do you want us? You said it was an RTA (Road Traffic
Accident).

Police: No, major incident inside the ground.

Fire: Major incident inside. Do you know exactly what it is?

Police: No I don't. They want all the cutting gear.

Fire: For what, do you know?

Police: Hang on a sec.

Police: (another voice) Hello.

Fire: Hello, now you want some cutting gear. What exactly is it for?

Police: ... full explanation ...

Fire: Right. OK. Leave it with us.

Micheal Berkley recently (RISKS 8.75) described a now infamous accident
in which a radio controlled mining machine killed a man after receiving
an interfering signal.  In RISKS 8.80, Robert Horvitz suggested a possible
fix in which the transmitter command is headed by a coded signal 
recognizable only by the receiver.  Radio sets are readily available which
feature pulse code modulation (PCM) and employ a header code ("password", if
you prefer).  They are commonly used to control model aircraft.

If a spurious signal interferes with a PCM receiver, it goes into a 
preprogrammed "failsafe" mode until contact with the matching transmitter
is restored.  The user usually has at least some control over what happens
during failsafe mode.  The default for most airplane systems is to 
neutralize (i.e., return to a center position) all control servos.
Hopefully, this results in neutralized control surfaces and a 1/2 throttle
setting on the engine.  Of course, if the airplane is pointed at the
ground when it goes into failsafe mode, it usually will end up back in 
kit form.  In the case of radio controlled heavy machinery, the failsafe
settings must be more carfully chosen and programmed.  Is power cut
off?  Are brakes applied?  What are the position control presets?  Does
the failsafe mode depend on the most recent mode of the machine?

I'm assuming that the users of such equipment will have enough sense to
employ PCM.  They've shown no such sense so far.  A construction company in
Texas has petitioned the FCC to employ 75 MHz frequencies to operate heavy
machinery.  These frequencies are attractive because they are license-free
and the only currently authorized users are radio control car and boat
operators.  In the spirit of commericial exploitation of the airwaves, the
construction company wants to SHARE those frequencies!  That's right -
your kid's toy Baja racer may be on the same frequency as a 10 ton bulldozer.

On a related topic, the proposed "person-finder" transmitters, used to
locate missing persons, will operate on the same frequencies (72 MHz) as model
aircraft.  Again, the obvious advantages for those selling such devices are
that the frequencies are license-free and the current users are not employing
them to make money and so lack political clout.  As mentioned by Mr. Horvitz,
current FCC policy is to encourage any and all commercial use of the airwaves,
without regard to safety or the interests of current users.

Currently, frequency control for model aircraft occurs at club fields and
is strictly enforced in accordance with AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics)
regulations.  Such control will be moot if the frequencies are shared 
by "person-finder" transmitters.  This is in addition to the previously 
mentioned (RISKS ?.?) potential for abuse of such devices by employers and the
government.   The AMA is petitioning the FCC to block frequency sharing.

Caveat:  this note was written by a radio control flyer who is a member of
the AMA.

Risks Digest readers might find an article series in the current New Yorker
interesting.  Written by Paul Brodeur, the three-part series is titled
"The Hazards of Electromagnetic Fields."  The first part, published in the
June 12 issue, dealt with power-line magnetic fields and fields generated
by high-voltage transmission lines.  These are low-level effects that
manifest themselves in long-term changes in cancer (primarily childhood)
rates.

The current (June 19) issue is concerned primarily with pulsed-microwave
fields, especially those from the PAVE PAWS distant early warning radar
installations.

The last installment isn't out yet.

One frightening aspect of the problem is the way "scientists" cook their
research to suit the "needs" of their funding agencies.  For example,
Air Force researchers measured the *average* emission of PAVE PAWS, which
is a multi-megawatt *pulsed* beam, rather than its instantaneous intensity.

  NEW YORK (AFP) -- Chinese authorities are using a British surveillance
system, developed to monitor road traffic, to spy on Chinese citizens and
foreigners in the streets of Beijing, Time said in its latest edition.
  The weekly news magazine said the so-called SCOOT system had been purchased
partially with development aid.
  Time also reported that the Beijing State Security Bureau had used the system
to document charges against Associated Press reporter John Pomfret, who, the
magazine added, was expelled last week after he was filmed meeting with a
source in his car outside a hotel in Beijing.
  Because the SCOOT system can be used to film at night, it allowed authorities
to film fighting outside Tiananmen Square during an army crackdown on
pro-reform demonstrations in which western intelligence sources said about
3,000 people died.
  Chinese authorities said 100 civilians were killed and about 1,000 others
wounded.
  The authorities edited the film to show only sequences of aggressive
demonstrators attacking peaceful police, Time said.
  The sequences were shown on state television, which identified the protestors
as counter-revolutionaries.
  SCOOT also allowed authorities to pick out individual faces in the crowd.
These were also shown on television with a telephone number requesting help
from watches in identifying those who participated in the demonstrations.

A few weeks ago, the Canadian post office admitted to a secret "modernization"
office they have established. The high-tech research division of the post
office. One of the projects they were said to be working on was changing the
postal codes from its current 3 letters + 3 numbers, to a 10 "digit" system
(unclear whether it'd be pure numeric or not.) I was a little concerned about
that at the time: Statistics Canada releases some non-trivial information (eg,
the Canadian census) *broken down by postal code*. (As an aside, I've never
been too comfortable with that. They do take care that each grouping includes
at least 5 people -- but it isn't too hard to extract an individual's data from
that, if you know something about the individual.) If StatsCan continued the
practice of releasing such information by postal codes, then establishing
extremely accurate postal codes is sure to make individual cases much easier to
deduce. (And remember, its not only a crime to give incorrect data to the
census people: its also a crime to refuse to answer the questions...)

Anyhow, having many other things to occupy my mind, I haven't been thinking
about the 10-digit scheme much. None-the-less, I did happen to notice the
following, buried in an article about which firm was being favoured to provide
some new sorting machines for the post office:

   The new equipment will incorperate many features tested by Canada Post in
the Paradigm Project, a high-tech research program started about two years ago.
   The program, kept secret until last month when it was reported on by
the Canadian Press, is being used to test a new 10-digit postal code
system Canada Post hopes to introduce within the next few years.
   The system is so precise that all addresses in the country, and
possibly all individuals, will be assigned individual codes."
   [The Ottawa Citizen, Mon. June 19, 1989, pg A4]

After I thought about it for a few seconds, I realized this is a -real-
possibility! Canada has about 25 million people, so an 8 digit scheme would be
enough to number them all individually (our social insurance numbers are 9
digits, including the check digit). A 10-digit number, then, has more than
enough capacity to identify individual people in Canada!

You can have unpublished phone numbers, but will they allow you to have
unpublished postal codes? (And if so, will you have to pay extra fo that?)

  Oh yes: although this story has a Canadian flavour, note that 10 digits
would be enough to encompass all of North America. After-all, phone numbers
within North America are only 10 digits, and they haven't run out of phone
numbers yet (though they will soon have to expand the area code scheme,
which currently only allows the second digit to be a 0 or a 1.)

In 1982, CII Honeywell Bull, France, unveiled the "CP-8" smart card.  This card
does indeed contain a tiny microprocessor and, I believe, 4K of memory.  This
was envisioned to have uses as an electronic payment card.  For example, I
would go to a compatible Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and transfer funds from
my account to the card.  I could then shop with the card at stores with CP-8
compatible readers and use the funds on the card to pay for my purchases.  The
major difference between this strategy and the Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT)
that we see today is that the CP-8 was deemed as valuable as cash.  The
repository of account information was the card itself.

Now some may say that EFTs are subject to per-transaction authorization over a
network.  I know however that my bank does not have a network connection but
actually contracts to a larger bank for EFT services.  Thus, there is no direct
check of my account for authorization.  Instead, my bank authorizes a maximum
of $200.00 per 24 hours per customer.  The contracted bank simply ensures that
I do not exceed that authorization.

An advantage of the CP-8 was its audit trail.  All transactions made against
the card are audited by the processor and the user can take the card to any
CP-8 ATM and receive a printout that shows the date, time, location (machine
ID) and amount of the last N transactions.  Kind of like having your statement
in your wallet.

There were plans in Sweden to implement a scheme for the rationing of
liquor purchases from state run liquor stores using the cards but I'm
not sure this came to fruition.  I'm not sure if this card has found any
real uses or if it has been upgraded (4K of memory?).

I saw a couple of risks here.  The card is money in my pocket.  Although I
might not feel confident about walking around the streets of New York with
several hundered dollars cash I might be lulled into a false sense of security
and think nothing of transfering several hundred dollars to the card.  Thus if
the card was lost, stolen, or damaged it was the same as having my wallet full
of money stolen.  In addition to the standard means of damaging the card, we
found that significant impact to the surface could damage the cards ability to
process or store information (we hit it with a hammer, not very subtle but it
showed a weakness).

On a separate but related issue, I found that the password standard for
the Cirrus, Star and New York Cash Exchange (NYCE) ATM networks is a
four digit password.

I was impressed by the BayBanks ATM network when it first came into being
because it offered me a maximum eight (letter) digit password thus giving me
10**8 possible values.  During use of my ATM card I noticed that the screen
would always flicker as soon as I entered the fourth letter in my password.  I
decided to "play" a little and noticed that only the first four letters of my
password were required to be entered (and thus were included in the validation
of my authorization).  Thus, there are only 10**4 possible passwords.  Cirrus
advertizes access to 20,000 ATMs nationwide.  Interesting to note that there
are twice as many ATMs as possible passwords to protect my account from being
misused on them.  Maybe someone should send them a copy of the NCSC Password
Management Guideline, CSC-STD-002-85...

&gt;Martyn addresses the obvious risk from the hardware/software reliability
&gt;point of view here. The other not so obvious risk is that a BBC micro

&gt;such as are used in anesthesia .... 

Actually, it's even worse. Operating theatres contain numerous
devices, which shouldn't interfere with each other, but do. (An EEG
in such a place can often detect brainwaves in lime jello.) There are
also standards for electrical leakage - since the patient tends to be
a common ground to numerous circuits.

Hospitals also use equipment differently from other places. Suppliers
learned years ago that equipment with a flat top will wind up at the
bottom of a stack, for example. A flat top will also attract bags,
bottles and bowls of fluid, which will get spilled.

I'd also worry about the lack of professional design review. For example, what
happens to the patient if there's a power glitch?  How about reasonableness
checks on dosage?  How aware will the operator be of the computer's actions?
How quickly could he stop it (emergency off)? My experience with beginning
programmers hardly inspires confidence in an MD's first effort.

 	There is more than just performance here.  In an operating room the
anaesthetist is responsible for his own actions. He bares the consequences of
his judgements as a responsible professional.
	In the case of a microcomputer malfunction who is responsible ?  Is it
the manufacturer ? The programmer ? Perhaps the technician who maintains the
equipment ?  Further, Electronics devices have recognized mean times to
failure. Does this mean that we are installing a device in a life critical
situation that we know will have a failure down the road ?  Would we certify a
doctor who we knew would fail ?
	Lastly, the state of the art in software expert systems is still a long
way from being able to deal with the subtle differences between patients or
subtle changes in a patient's condition during an operation.  It is for that
reason that the doctor is indispensible (no pun).

This may have been only one aspect of a more wide-spread disregard for 
safety in the construction of the first Civic Center roof. It was widely 
reported in the local papers afterwards that there had been only one 
part-time weld inspector during construction - he was a high school math
teacher and evidently only worked on Saturdays or something like that.

In other words, if they had cared about safety, they might have been more
likely to catch errors in the simulation.

&gt; point it is gliding until it releases its warheads. The missile has no
&gt; mechanism for sensing where it is and aiming the warheads accordingly - it is
&gt; just told, BEFORE LAUNCH, "point here, release a warhead, point there, release
&gt; a warhead, etc." The point is that all errors in the launch are cumulative and
&gt; no mechanisms exist to correct them.

This is incorrect.  There certainly is an inertial guidance system aboard all
versions of the Minuteman missile (only IIs and IIIs are currently active).
And while is it true that the solid-fuel boosters on such missiles are not
throttleable per se, any point up to the missile's maximum range can be
targeted by changing the ballistic trajectory.  Besides, there _are_ various
thrust termination mechanisms available for solid rockets (blowing off the
nozzle, venting the combustion chamber, etc.), though I am not aware which, if
any, are used on the various Minuteman stages.

Even after burnout of the last stage, the warheads of the Minuteman III
still do not follow a purely ballistic trajectory.  This missile
carries three _independently_targetable_ re-entry vehicles, attached
to a maneuverable "bus."  The bus is powered, and changes its
trajectory before releasing each of its warheads.  I believe the
maximum separation between targets of warheads on a single missile
is classified information.

Finally, more recent warheads (tested on the MX missile) are themselves
maneuverable during re-entry, for evading ABMs.  There is evidence
that the D5 warhead being developed for the Trident II missile will
use satellite navigation signals from the Navstar Global Positioning
System (GPS) for terminal guidance.  (The Pershing II warhead,
incidentally used Terrain-Contour Matching (Tercom) radar for terminal
guidance.)  These mechanisms could remove much of the uncertainty
involved in firing missile over previously unflown trajectories.

Please forgive my lengthy response, especially since I am uncertain
what this discussion is doing in comp.risks in the first place.

I don't want to drag out a discussion of ICBMs, which probably belongs in
ARMS-D, but just to offer an addendum, or a slight correction, to Steven Den
Beste's recent posting (RISKS 8.82, Risks of Missiles).  He said that all tests
of Minuteman missiles have been conducted in flights from Vandenberg to
Kwajalein atoll.  Actually there have been four tests of Minuteman missiles
launched from silos, and all four of them failed.

I am not an expert on missile systems, but even from the little knowledge
tht I have, I do not believe the statements of denbeste@BBN.COM about the
Minuteman system. He writes (in risks 8.82) "The missile has no mechanism
for sensing where it is and aiming the warheads accordingly ... all errors
in the launch are cumulative and no mechanisms exist to correct them."

I suggest that, while the Minuteman has no mechanism that actually _looks_
to see where it is, it _does_ have positional feedback in the form of
intertial mavigation subsystems. So it is _not_ travelling in a "dead
reckoning" mode as the end of the above quotation asserts.

And I find the bald statement that the Van Allen belt and the different
"g" field in northern regions damage missle targeting, with no supporting
remarks whatsoever, to be .. um .. curious.  I don't know, and I doubt
that he knows, either -- though I would be very surprised to learn that
the U.S. military doesn't understand the Earth's gravitational field and
its effects on bodies in icbm trajectories.

In RISKS DIGEST 8.83, Walter Roberson discussed a possible Canadian move to ten
digit postal codes.  While most people in the US don't use more than the first
five digits, the US Postal Service (USPS) already uses a 9 digit ZIP+FOUR code.

Like Canada, the census people give out info based on ZIP code, and it is a
crime not to give accurate information.  So I trotted down to the local post
office, and sure enough, my address is a unique nine digit code.  There are
only four units in my building, and only nine people, so a person with census
info based on nine digits and just a little more (like, I'm the only married
male in my building) can find out anything the census bureau know about me.

We just got a note last week (delivered by the USPS to OCCUPANT) that the 1990
census is coming, with assurances that our responses to the census would be
kept strictly confidential.  In light of this RISKS discussion, I'll have to
take that claim up with both the Census Bureau and my elected representatives.

Walter Roberson describes the proposal to create a 10-character postal
code, and mentions that it seems to generate a too-high degree of
discrimination. (The current postal code, of which V6T 1W5 is an
example, does an excellent job: the first character corresponds to the
province, and the first three to the Forward Sortation Area (FSA), or
sorting station; the full code corresponds to less than a single
carrier's route. Further, the mixture of letters and digits
substantially lowers the error rate, because transposition errors, the
most common among fast typists, result in invalid codes.)

There is, however, a RISK which is entirely separate from the assault on
privacy which a 10-character code would inevitably produce. It is necessary to
realise that Canada Post's service is legendarily atrocious (though not perhaps
as bad as that of the Italian Post Office, which once shredded 40 tonnes of
mail which had taken so long to sort that it wasn't worth delivering). The
introduction of postal codes in 1974 was supposed to speed service. In fact,
service has deteriorated. (It is quite common for a first-class letter to take
a week to be delivered to another address in the same sortation area.)

Labour relations are also atrocious at Canada Post. There are at present
several tens of thousands of in-process grievances; the leadership of the main
postal union is highly radicalised; and management has made it very clear that
it is not interested in improving the situation.

When the original code was introduced, the postal workers opposed it, fearing a
loss of jobs. They stamped `Boycott the code' on letters, and protested
strenuously. Management didn't do anything in particular to smooth the
transition.

I can see the introduction of a longer code as an excuse to create further
confrontation, thus excusing the awful service. So long as long delivery delays
can be blamed on `lazy workers', whereas the Corporation is using the latest
technology to expedite things, nobody really has to do anything specific to fix
the serious management/labour problems at Canada Post.

Ain't technology wonderful?

It occurred to me that there may be a very plausible explanation for this
story--there was indeed a murder comitted, but not by the computer.  It seems
to me that the programmer, research scientist, whoever, who programmed this
super computer may have been embarrased (perhaps fatally in political terms) by
the fact that his system was being beaten my a mere human.  To get revenge, he
reprograms the computer, possibly modifying the chess board as well to make the
fatal short circuit, so that it electrocutes the chess master the next time the
computer loses.  This may even turn out as an added bonus for the researcher --
the computer may not be able to beat a chess master, but it is intelligent
enough to stand trial.  Once again, the computer gets all the blame.

[Dave Horsfall doubts that 12 volts can cause substantial electric shock.]

On the contrary.  About a year ago I drove my car into a creek and got
stuck.   I tried to disconnect the battery but found it quite impossible to
hold onto the positive terminal without insulation; the shock was sufficient
to make my arm flail around uncontrollably.  I was standing in about one meter
of water, and the car was turned off.  (Of course, I should have disconnected
the negative terminal instead, but nobody's perfect.)

PS.  Haven't people been electrocuted in swimming pools by remarkably small
voltages?  I defer to someone who knows the details.

For some of you, this will be the third time you will have been exposed to this
article. I apologize for this. The first time was intentional, but only the
subscribers on Bitnet got it. The second time was because of an anomaly in the
file transfer mechanism, unintentional. This time it is so that the non-Bitnet
subscribers can read it and so that I can finish the story of the whole ludi-
crous affair. Also, one of the respondents sent me the complete references for
the books I consulted to form an opinion of this misbegotten venture. If you
wish you can skip the repeated section of this posting and go straight to his
upgraded bibliography and the story's denouement by typing FIND BIBLIOGRAPHY or
some other search command to move your editor to that point in my account. But

PRECIS                                                 Tues, 13 June 1989

The provincial government of Sask., Canada is now embroiled in a scandal over
its involvement with an AI language translation company owned by Guy Montpetit
of Montreal, a shady dealer currently defending himself against a $39-million
lawsuit for not paying back loans. Deputy Premier Eric Berntson had discussed
with Montpetit the possibility of its investing $125 million in a computer chip
foundry, the details of which would have been overseen by Montpetit.
         But the government has already invested $4 million in Montpetit's Gig-
aText, a company established to translate by computer Saskatchewan's statutes
into French. A couple of years ago, a local Francophone created a sensation
when he took to the Canadian Supreme Court his case that his constitutional
rights were being infringed when he had to go to court on a traffic ticket that
was made out to him in English, not French. The Court decided in his favour.
After trying to quash the decision by a decree of its own, the government swore
it would save millions of dollars by getting someone to create AI software to
translate its laws, rather than by hiring bilingual humans to translate them
"the old way". The government accepted Montpetit's offer to do the job and
payed him the $4 million to rent a sizable office complex, hire administrative
personnel and a few programmers supposedly bilingual and conversant in Lisp and
Prolog. It is alleged that the government also bought him a luxury home, payed
his plane fare to "conventions", and let him use a Mercedes to get to his Re-
gina appointments. It took a long time for expert criticism of the presumptions
of this venture to reach the public, including the NDP opposition which is now
raking the incumbent PC's over the coals for it. But Berntson confidently pre-
dicts the computerized translator will be unveiled in full working condition
on June 17.
         That's four days from now. It will be interesting to see how it turns
out. From everything I have read, Artificial Intelligence language translation
is still a long, long way from being practicable, and indeed may be impossible.
The world will stand up and take notice of what has been accomplished in Regina
Sask. on June 17, but I wonder if it will be for the reasons Berntson intended.
         I based my assessment of this case on readings from a book called "Tu-
ring's Man" by J. David Bolter. (See references below.) On a different subject
is a book called "The Fifth Generation Fallacy", by J. Marshall Unger. The au-
thor, a professor of East Asian languages at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu
states that the REAL reasons the Japanese are in such a rush to invent this new
hard- &amp; software has little to do with fifth generation machines that imitate
human neural networks &amp; thought processes to speak to the user in his own ton-
gue [sic]. It is their desperation to find a means to speedily process, store &amp;
distinguish the thirty odd thousand characters of their Kanji script. These
characters are difficult to represent digitally or on a screen: It takes a 24 X
24 grid (576 bits) to store a good image of them. To keypunch, input them will
be yet harder: Business memos are still written out in hand. And it will seri-
ously test the software running at extremely high speed to tell them apart, a-
side from the grammatical difficulties involved. In short, the professor be-
lieves the Kanji character system puts an immovable limit on what any computer
technology can do for their quest for data-handling speed and efficiency. The
question is then: Do the dubious advantages of increased productivity obtained
by high-tech mean more to the Japanese than love of their culture and the ele-
gance of their 1000-year-old Kanji script?

DENOUEMENT                                                Tues, 20 June 1989

         Well, a week has passed and now I can report what happened on June 17,
the day Sask. deputy premier Eric Berntson promised to show us the computerized
French-English translator, working as planned. For it is certain he had some-
thing planned, and it came as a surprise to everyone.
         Mr. Berntson did not have a scrap of translated laws to show us that
day. But he did succeed in showing us the NDP opposition was guilty of having
wasted more of the tax-payers' money when it was in power over something like
this than the incumbent PC's have over GigaText. As he said, in 1981 "the New
Democratic Party...invested $5 million -- the equivalent of $8 million today --
in an outfit called Nabu...from central Canada [and] not one job, not one ounce
of technology moved to Saskatchewan. The whole investment was written off and
these technological wizards over there blew $5 million!"
         Nabu developed informational or educational software programs for home
entertainment. Embarrassed by this telling repartee, the NDP critics fell into
sullen silence.  (The Leader-Post, June 17 p A4)
         Yet the NDP's venture, an investment in what we would probably call an
"expert system", from a purely technical perspective had a greater chance of
succeeding than did the PC's venture into the field of AI language translation,
a goal that continues to elude the most accomplished researchers in this area.
(See "Turing's Man" in the above bibliography.) Herbert Clute (ABC Translation)
agrees with ex-director of legislation translation in neighbouring Manitoba,
Greg Yost's opinion that machine translation of its statutes was "too primitive
to be of any use." He said weather reports are the only material that can be
translated flawlessly: "If the vocabulary is straightforward and limited, ma-
chine translation would be a great saving in time, but we all know laws aren't
straightforward."
         Manitoba gave the bulk of its translation contract to "Traduction Uni-
verselle", a Montreal-based company in contact with plenty of people who were
competent to translate the language in specific areas of legislation. In four
years the bulk of the translation, 4000 pages, was translated by the Dec. 1988
deadline for public laws and regulations. (The Leader-Post, June 19, 1989 p A4)
         Saskatchewan, in contrast, since July 1988 has funnelled $5.25 million
into the GigaText Translation system, so far without success. PC politicians
have had to face accusations of wasting the money on perks for Montpetit and to
take off his hands obsolete computers from his own company. The 20 GigaMos com-
puters that GigaText bought for its Regina research centre cost the government
$152 000 each. Their cost climbed from $1,5 million to $2,9 million as they
passed through the hands of firms owned either by Montpetit or his close asso-
ciates before being purchased by GigaText. Montpetit's U.S. company "Systems"
manufactured them. (The Leader-Post, June 16, 1989 p A4)
         Incidentally, Berntson acknowledged meeting am associate of Montpetit
named Dr. Alex Voshchenkov. He considers Voshchenkov to be one of the world's
leading high-tech scientists and declared, "if I can find a way that is reason-
able to get Dr. Voshchenkov and his technology into Saskatchewan I would like
to do it." I am unfamiliar with Dr. Voshchenkov and his achievements, but with
that June 17 deadline passed, the provincial government will need all the help
it can get! (The Leader-Post, June 17, 1989 p A4)
         The RCMP has been investigating Montpetit to determine how GigaText
spent SEDCO's first $4 million. There are allegations Montpetit spent it on o-
verpriced computers, personal debts, payments to those who helped arrange the
government financing, and jet travel, like a weekend flight taken by Montpetit
and a female companion to San Francisco at a cost to GigaText of $15 000.
         In exchange for its $4 million, the government got 25% ownership in
the company. In exchange for his unproven technology, Montpetit and his partner
were given 75% control and sole responsability for signing cheques. This con-
tinued, even after he was named in a $39 million lawsuit last October, until he
was eased out in March. A new $1,25 million SEDCO loan was provided to keep the
company alive, but the June 17 deadline was set for it to prove it could do its
job. That day has come and gone. You'd think that would be the end of it, but
the project has been given a stay of execution. Berntson said that because June
17 was a Saturday, the deadline is being extended to some time this week. If at
the last moment, it miraculously succeeds, I will faithfully report the details
to the list. But if you don't hear from me again, you can assume it will have
been the big flop everyone expects. After all, there is an old Latin maxim that
fits very well here:    "DE MORTUIS NIHIL NISI BONUM."

Taken from the San Jose Mercury News, 6/21/89 (from the Kansas City Star):

Teen hacker hits satellite guide system

  A 14-year-old Prarie Village, Kan., boy, using a small home computer,
cracked an Air Force satellite-positioning system and browsed the confidential
files of at least 200 companies, officials say.
  The teen-ager, a computer hacker since the age of 8, apparently did not dam-
age the computer systems he easily entered during the past six months.  He
hoped to use his know-how to persuade the companies to hire him as a computer
security consultant, police said.
  At least two military investigators and representatives of several companies,
including Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto, showed up at a meeting this month
in Johnson County to try to find out how he did it.
  Dialing unauthorized long-distance access codes, authorities say, the teen-
ager linked his Apple computer with systems throughout the country.  He spec-
ialized in cracking the H-P 3000, a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer widely used
by businesses and the federal government.
  At one point, authorities say, he gained access to an unclassified Air Force
computer system.

[Other than in the first paragraph, there's no more mention of what, if
 anything, the kid did to the satellite positioning system.  The comment that
 he was hoping to be hired seems intriguing to me; I wonder if there's now a
 wave of "interview by cracking" starting up? --Dave]

Here are excerpts from IEEE INSTITUTE, May 1989, p. 4:

``British train accidents signal systemic problems'' by Fred Guterl and
Erin E. Murphy

... Sloppy installation caused (a) recent fatal train accident..., according
to Britrail, the state-run railway system ...  

On Dec. 12 at the busy Clapham junction in south London, ... one commuter
train plowed into the back of another, killing 35 and injuring almost 100.
... In that accident, according to British Rail, the evidence found so far
points to an installation error made a few years ago, when British Rail
replaced the older electromagnetic switches in its signalling system at
Clapham.  ... during this process an equipment room wire from an old switch
was not properly removed and came into contact with the new electromagnetic
signaling system.

The signaling system regulates the movement of a train from one section of
track to another. ... The presence of current indicates both that the next
section of track is unoccupied and what the next signal's setting is. ...  At
Clapham, the loose wire directly operated the signal, overriding the checks in
the system and causing the signal to turn green.  The signaling system was
thought to be fail-safe because a short circuit would simply cause a red
light. ...

The worker who has taken responsibility for leaving the wire loose testified
in the inquiry that on that day he had worked more than 12 hours with only
a 5-minute break ...

Headline: "Worried firms pay hush money to 'hacker' thieves"

By Richard Caseby

Firms in the City of London are buying the silence of hackers who 
break into their computers and steal millions of pounds.

At least six London firms have signed agreements with criminals, 
offering them amnesties if they return part of the money.  The firms 
fear that if they prosecute they will lose business when customers 
learn that their computer security is flawed.

In several of the case the losses exceeded 1 million  pounds but only 
a tenth of the total was returned.

The Computer Industry Research Unit (CIRU) which uncovered the 
deals and which is advising the Department of Trade and Industry in 
data security, believes the practice of offering amnesties is 
widespread.

"Companies who feel vulnerable are running scared by agreeing to 
these immoral deals.  Their selfishness is storing up serious problems 
for everyone else," said Peter Nancarrow, a senior consultant.

Police have warned that deals struck with criminals could possibly 
lead to an employer being prosecuted for perverting the course of 
justice.

Detective Inspector John Austin, of Scotland Yard's computer fraud 
squad, said: "Employers could find themselves in very deep water by 
such strenuous efforts to protect the credibility of their image."

Legal experts say the firms are mking use of section five of the 
Criminal Law Act 1967 which allows them to keep silent on crimes 
and privately agree on compensation.  However, an employer 
becomes a witness to the offence by taking evidence from a criminal 
when the deal is drawn up.

Hackers steal by electronically transferring funds or by programming 
a computer to round off all transactions by a tiny amount and 
diverting the money to a separate account.

In one case, an assistant programmer at a merchant bank diverted 8 
million pounds to a Swiss bank account and then gave back 7 million 
in return for a non-disclosure agreement portecting him against 
prosecution.

Such thefts have spread alarm throughout the City, with consultants 
offering to penetrate the computer networks of banks and finance 
houses to pinpoint loopholes before a hacker does.

The biggest contracts cost up to 50,000 pounds and can involve a 
four month investigation in which every weakness is explored.

Detectives have found that computer security at many City 
institutions is riddled with loopholes.  A City of London police 
operation, codenamed Comcheck, revealed wide spread weaknesses.  
Firms were asked to track the number of unauthorized logons over 
Easter bank holiday.

Some companies unable to tell whether hackers had penetrated their 
network, while others lacked any security defences.

In addition to theft, companies are vulnerable to blackmail.  Hackers 
can threaton to sabotage computers by inserting "viruses" and "logic 
bombs" - rogue programs which can paralyse a system.

This type of threat has prompted the offer of a new insurance policy 
underwritten by Lloyd's which specifically covers viruses and other 
computer catastrophes.

There are computer-controlled drug infusion devices on the market; they
are definitely not hobbyist items.  IVAC Corporation of San Diego has made
several presentations at technical meetings recently about a new product
of theirs called the Titrator (registered trademark) Sodium Nitroprusside
Closed Loop Module, which began development in 1981 and was finally approved
by the FDA in December, 1987.  

The FDA began regulating medical device software in 1987.  IVAC believes
its device was the first to be reviewed by the FDA under the new regulations.
Two papers about their experience appear in PROCEEDINGS ON THE ENGINEERING
OF COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS, June 8-10, 1988, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
published by the IEEE Computer Society: ``The travail involved in getting
FDA approval --- an overview of what it took to get FDA approval of a medical
device with computer technology (a recent experience)'' by Albert Paul,
pps. 28--29, and ``Failsafe design of closed loop systems'' by Alvis J.
Somerville, pps. 23--27.

Keith Emanuel, brings up the question of responsibility in the case of
a microcomputer malfunction.  I remember that National Semiconductor
data sheets used to have a warning to the effect that the component
described should not be used on any life critical application without
prior written permission from the company.  They defined a life
critical application as one whose malfunction or failure to operate
could cause human deaths or injury.  I have not seen such a warning in
data sheets of other manufacturers, so it is probable that this
problem has a precise legal answer.

Toronto Star, June 27, 1989, page B3:

About 6,000 people across Canada have received extra-large refunds after filing
their 1988 income tax returns, and must return the excess.  Clyde King,
spokesman for Revenue Canada's Toronto office, said yesterday the people
affected pay quarterly tax instalments.  These taxpayers, the self-employed and
some retired people, must pay the instalments because they're not subject to
withholding at source on the bulk of their income.  King said that in some
cases Revenue Canada's computer in Ottawa added the first-quarter 1989 tax
instalment to the 1988 refund due, resulting in the excessive refund.

Though about 70,000 people were affected, the error was caught in all but about
6,000 cases before the cheques were sent.  In many cases, taxpayers have
contacted Revenue Canada and sent back the excess.  Eventually the others will
be sent letters of explanation and asked for the return of the money."

[Comment 1: I like the "Revenue Canada's computer added" part.
 People don't create bugs, computers create bugs.]

[Comment 2: one hopes that as well as fixing the bug, they have
 correctly fixed the accounts of people whose 1989 instalments
 may not have been credited properly as of the date due...]

The June issue of IEEE Computer Magazine contains an article on a robot
vision system which reads analogue and digital meters, lights, and
determines valve, slider and switch positions:
 
        "A Vision System for Robotic Inspection and Manipulation"
        M. Trivedi, C. Chen, and S. Marapane
        Computer Magazine, June 1989, p. 91.

&lt;The authors envisage a system such as their's being used to inspect and
monitor nuclear power plants: 

        "Although most of our findings relate to a broad class of
        industrial automation tasks, the specific operational environment

        offers the potential for reduced radiation exposure to personnel
        and lower plant operating costs."

However the authors, who are funded by the Department of Energy, do not
discuss the risks of relying on such technology in critical applications
such as nuclear power plants. The ONLY allusion to any possible misgivings
people might have to this technology is:

        "These tasks need not be performed totally autonomously; a human
         observer can interpret images acquired by staionary cameras or
         those mounted on robots."
        
There would appear to be several, more robust, more easily validated
alternatives to this technology. In particular, using a robot vision system
to read an LCD display seems to be a rather expensive and error prone
implementation of a wire!

I feel that anyone proposing a software system for use in critical
applications must discuss the risks involved. And an article in a broad
readership professional magazine such a Computer would be the ideal place.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a report, 20 Apr 89, entitled
"Management and Technical Problems Delay Operation Center Acquisition"
(GAO/IMTEC-89-18).  The 50+page report discusses the Air Force Space Defense
Operations Center modernization effort at Cheyenne Mountain.

The following is from the Executive Summary:

	"The SPADOC program has been marked by management problems, unrealized
expectations, and program delays.  The Air Force has invested over $235 million
in a system that is now more than 4 years behind schedule and far from meeting
its required operational capability. 

			. . .

	At the root of SPADOC's technical problems is the Air Force's attempt
to achieve controlled mode security.  Software development tasks designed to
achieve this form of multilevel security are time-consuming, technically
demanding, and still undergoing much research and development.  In SPADOC's
case, functions such as notifying national decision makers that a satellite is
under attack take as much as four times longer to complete than required."

Interested parties can call 202-275-6241 to obtain a free copy.  In the
interest of fairness the DoD/Air Force response is included within the report.

Re: Gary Chapman, <A HREF="/Risks/8.83.html">RISKS-8.83</A>

My uncle is a conspiracy and doomsday person and several friends have worked in
the "business".  They have given me an education.  My own experiences in a
military organization have confirmed their observations:

The major problem is that only a couple of times has our nuclear arsenal been
tested under field conditions (to the public's knowledege).  Even then it has
not really been under battle conditions.

The major problem is that today's military rarely have surprise tests.
Operational Readiness Tests(ORT) would have to simulate a true war.  This would
include a lot of collateral information and details, lack of warning, and other
items.  Anything less than firing random rockets would not be a real test.
Also there are cross checks to make sure other missiles are being fired.

The current worry is that 1).  The missile crews might freeze or panic. 2).
The missile would explode on the pad or fail to fire.  3).  It wouldn't get
airborne - blast through the silo lid.  4).  It would cartwheel in the air or
explode (as one recent test did). 5).  It wouldn't hit the target.

The problem is testing this because any commander who has word of an inspection
or a ORT will prep his equipment and men.  The phemonena of the perfect troop
of military is well known to inspecting generals and chiefs of state as well as
the GIs who are told to prepare for a "surprise inspection".

The risk?  How do you test a doomsday machine.  Can any system be tested for
"ultimate load" or "emergency conditions".

NASA and McDonnel Douglas are testing a helmet-mounted, visual approach and
landing system that could have applications for future aircraft without cockpit
windows, according to the June 19, 1989 issue of Aviation Week and Space
Technology (pages 126 and 127).  The system uses two fixed-position monochrome
video cameras mounted in the aircraft's nose.  Video and graphics processing is
performed, and digitized pictures are relayed to the helmet display.

According to Mark S. Rolwes, principal investigator for McDonnell Douglas, the
use of a fixed sensor suite offers advantages such as high reliability (because
there are no moving parts) and redundancy.

A magnetic tracking device is used to measure the pilot's head movements.
Based on where the pilot is "looking", a 30 by 40 degree field of view is
selected, processed and displayed on the helmet's eyepieces.

There is a 17-millisecond delay in getting an image from the cameras to
the eyepieces.  Rolwes said the delay is imperceptible and that it doesn't
affect pilot performance.

All four pilots in the tests were able to successfully land NASA's Boeing 737
Transport Systems Research Vehicle aircraft using the landing system, coming
within 500 feet of a specified target after making several practice approaches.
A second pilot was present to set up the approach and be ready to take over and
fly the aircraft visually if there was a problem with the landing system.

I won't belabor RISKS readers by enumerating a bunch of the obvious potential
problems with such a system.  Suffice to say that the possibility of crashing
an airplane because of a failure in the video system, coupled with the
inability to look out the window (because the plane doesn't have one) is
terrifying.

The article specifically mentions future hypersonic flight vehicles as aircraft
that may not have, or be able to have, conventional cockpit windows.  Also, it
says that the system could have applications in current military aircraft in
which crew eye protection during combat is important.

For commercial aircraft, the system would supposedly be useful for obviating
window area restrictions and for providing night vision capabilities.  Although
this touches on a whole kettle of risks that have been undergoing periodic
discussion in this forum (risks from too much going on in the cockpit, etc), I
think that such a system, if well-designed, could help to reduce the
possibility of an accident, as long as a manual backup system (a window) was
retained.

Here are excerpts from FEDERAL COMPUTER WEEK, May 8 1989, p. 10:

``Air Force to Upgrade Missile Control Systems'' by Bob Brewin

The Air Force plans to upgrade the computer and communications systems that
run the launch control centers of the US long-range missile arsenal.  The
$507 million project will streamline the authentication of war order messages
as well as missile retargeting and launch authorization, according to the
Air Force.

Under the Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) contract, the Air
Force plans to automate for the first time the processing of emergency war
order messages by the two-man intercontinental ballistic-missile launch
control center crews.  Part of the job includes improvements in the
1960s-vintage weapons system control computers that manage the launch and
retargeting of all missiles in a wing.

Although the REACT system features an electronic interface between the war
order message processing function and weapon control systems, an Air Force
official said, ``The nuclear assuredness aspects of the system will remain
the same.  Man will remain in the loop.'' ...

Bruce Blair, a former launch control center (LCC) officer who studies nuclear
command and control systems for the Brookings Institution, said that while
the REACT program ``will reduce human judgment at [the LCC level] by some
factor,'' its impact will be minimal ``because most of the human judgments
are made at the NORAD or National Command Authority level.'' ...

LCC crews receive war order messages through three digital communications
channels: very low frequency radio, the Air Force Satellite Communications
System and the SAC digital information network.  According to Brooking's
Blair, the crews must then take these messages and manually authenticate
them with secured code books.  The computerized message processor would
handle these tasks, including sorting through duplicate messages,
automatically.  ``We're going to let the machine sort through all the messages
and then present the information on the screen to the crew member,'' (Col.
Michael) Mazzaro (a REACT program manager) said.  After authenticity
checks are completed, the processed messages, together with retargeting
information, are passed via an electronic interface to the weapons system
control element.  Mazzaro said that although the system has been automated,
``this is not the stuff of the `War Games' scenario.  Man is in the loop
the entire way.  He makes the decisions''...

The planned modifications ``will permit LCC's to stay on alert beyond the turn
of this century,'' (the Air Force) said. [The article explained the new
system would be used with Minuteman, MX, and possibly future Midgetman and rail
garrison MX missiles]. 

REACT consists of two different but related programs managed by the Electronic
Systems Division (ESD) and the Ballistics Systems Division (BSD) of the Air
Force Systems Command.  ESD will manage development of the higher-authority
communications and rapid message processing element for which GTE government
systems was awarded ... $33.7 million. ... BSD awarded Ford Aerospace ... $71.3
million for development of the Weapon System Control Element, which includes
rapid retargeting systems, voice communications, control consoles and displays,
the weapons system processor and modifications to existing LCC trainers. .  BSD
officials ... estimated the total value (of the upgrade effort) at $507 million
...  Ford based its architecture on the Raytheon MilVax.  BSD officials have
said they have not determined whether to use existing code or new code for the
weapons system control element.

Jon's posting re SAC's REACT missile launch ugrade is just another relentless
turn of the hair-trigger screw.  Another turn is reported in this month's Air
Force Magazine, which is all about AF electronics.  An article reports:

    The Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) [is] a
    multi-stationed net of LF radio towers and receivers...
    Electronic Systems Division (ESD), working with RCA, has
    nearly completed installing an initial, 56-node "thin-line"
    segment for flashing [one-way] emergency messages [launch
    orders] to Strategic Air Command units.

With glasnost and perestroika afoot, and the JCS visiting the U.S.S.R., must we
reduce SAC's standing response time from over to under a minute?  Is anyone
seriously weighing the concomitant risks?


[By the way,] for those who don't know, on May 1 this year I filed a lawsuit
against the Strategic Air Command's chain of command for launching Minuteman
and MX missiles, including the launch crews, alleging that their standing
orders, to launch the missiles immediately upon receipt of cryptologically
valid launch orders, are inherently reckless and dangerous.  In particular, I
allege with particularity the risk of mistaken computer prompts causing the
accidental launch of nuclear missiles.  The suit was endorsed by the board of
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.

In a motion to dismiss based on the pleadings, which presumes that all facts
alleged be taken as true, here is Commander In Chief General Chain's
(minion-attorney's) key argument:

   The allegation of "high risk" may affect the amount of
   speculation but only marginally, and it does not move the
   allegation into the realm of injury in fact.  At most,
   plaintiff makes the general assertion that some government
   officials may act in a manner contrary to law.

Several recent postings in this digest have speculated about the
accuracy/quality of strategic weapons guidance systems.  Apropos of that, I
offer the following excerpts from an article by Stan Shebs, about working on
cruise missile guidance, that appeared in the CPSR/Seattle Newsletter, June
1988:

      from ``My Life in a Megadeath Corporation'' by Stan Shebs

Upon graduation from Texas A&amp;M in 1981, I accepted an offer from Boeing
Aerospace in Seattle ... I was re-assigned to work on the cruise missile. 

I went off to Seattle (Kent actually) and started work. This involved
fingerprinting (a surprise) and the long long form to fill out (for a
clearance, even though I never did anything classified).  Next thing was to
jump in on the work, which was to help finish up and deliver "mission planning"
software - a giant mass of undocumented Fortran intended to run on IBM
mainframes at SAC headquarters in Nebraska.  My first task was to finish
testing the FORMVO module, which had to do with figuring out which VOs
(Vertical Obstructions - like trees and telephone poles) were likely to be in
the path of the missile as it flew along. 

If this is confusing, well, it was to me too.  After about a month, I went to
the official orientation and indoctrination, which lasted about two days.
Boeing was building the Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), essentially a robot
airplane about 6 meters long and 1/2 in diameter, powered by a jet engine of
just the right size for a go-cart, and carrying a 400-kiloton fusion bomb.  The
idea was that B-52 bombers would fly up to the edge of the USSR, launch the
ALCMs, and fly away again.  The missiles would then fly about 2000 km or so,
low to the ground and beneath radars all the way, to detonate at some target.
... Now the onboard software was basically done; where I came in was to help
with the software that figures out if an intended route was actually doable.
The onboard computer has only a very limited capacity, so you need a lot of
"mission planning" software to decide where to turn, how high to fly, when to
look at the ground to see if you're on course, and so forth.  Another piece of
software then makes up the cute little cassette tapes that the bomber crew
loads into the missile before launching it.  It's tricky, because how tight a
turn the missile can make depends on how much fuel it's used already, it could
run into telephone wires if it's flying too low at the wrong moment, the little
maps that it uses for navigation mustn't be too far apart, and so forth. 

The difficulty of all this apparently didn't occur to anybody until after
the missile was working, so the mission planning software got hacked out in
a real hurry, the people that did it departed for greener pastures, and
then the rest of us were picking up the pieces and trying to turn all this
into a reasonably reliable 40,000 lines of Fortran.  The day-to-day work
was like regular software stuff; debugging a program that took map data
from tapes and put them into VSAM files, writing the "Program Design" for
an already-written program (is that stupid or what), figuring out how to
compute the intersection of two polygons in space.  We supposedly had a
"model" software engineering methodology; what I remember most clearly is
that half the work was done on one flavor of IBM OS, and the other half
done on a different flavor, and file transfer between the two was tricky
and time-consuming.

The fragility of something like the cruise missile and its software is
something I've spent a lot of time wondering about, and don't really have any
idea.  The nuclear safety aspect seemed pretty good - there was at least some
effort to get accurate estimates of the chance of going off at the wrong time
(was 1 in 2^64 chance, I think).  Navigation is considerably more problematic.
Like most missiles, ALCM relies on inertial navigation, but the error
accumulation over 2000 km is immense, and you had to be sure to have navigation
maps spaced so there would be a reasonably good chance they would be found.
("3-sigma" was the standard - position assumed to be a normal distribution.)
Now that I think about it, the 3-sigma test (98% chance) would have to be
multiplied for each map, and there might be 10-20 of them, meaning as much as
40% of missiles might not make it through all the maps...  Calculations on a
sphere were a perennial problem - there was a standard joke that the safest
place in the world during a nuclear exchange was the North Pole, because the
lat/long singularity makes it impossible to target, and the worst place was 0
lat, 0 long, because the software would divide by 0 or overflow or something
while passing over the North Pole and reset to all 0s...  The precision and
formality of the software was very low, but it was exhaustively tested over and
over and over again.  I suppose the greatest risk of failure derives from
things that weren't anticipated during testing, such as a Siberian snowdrift
changing the topography on a navigation map...

(Regarding) statistics on software quality, the closest thing we had was maybe
a count of problem reports (hundreds, but each report ranged from one-liners to
one-monthers in terms of effort required).  ... the humongous requirements
document that was our bible for how the program was supposed to work (was)
alternately entertaining and horrifying. Nothing classified, we had the odd
situation that the *data* was classified, but the *program* wasn't even rated
"confidential"! (Theory was that the Russians were supposed to get a copy,
which would set them back ten years... :-) ) ...

    From the June 16 _Science_ article "Early Data: Losing Our Memory?":

    "Allen Watkins, director of the USGS center in Sioux Falls, SD,
    where Landsat tapes are kept, says, "90% of the data collected
    before 1979 are now inaccessible." The reason: the data tapes were
    recorded on old Xerox computers which can no longer be operated.
    In addition, the satellite location and timing data were recorded
    on a kind of video tape deck that no longer exists. Tape renewal
    is another problem that looms in the future. Magnetic images
    "bleed" through the layers as time passes, and tapes must be
    recopied at least once every 10 years to make them usable. Watkins
    says the task is already formidable, and wonders what will happen
    when the Earth Observing System begins sending back the equivalent
    of an entire Landsat archive every 2 weeks."

On December 22nd, someone started a virus/worm on the SPAN/Decnet network.
It attacks only Vax/VMS computers, and only those which are connected 
to the SPAN/HEPNET/Decnet network.  It cannot enter Unix systems or PC's.

This virus/worm is benign in that it does not erase information.  The writer 
apparently wishes to embarrass system managers and network administrators.

Language purists will call it a worm:  it does not modify any files,
and copies itself from node to node.

Indications point to an origin in Germany.

I spent several hours creating bogus announcements to confuse and counteract 
the virus writer.  I've mailed these to the PHSOLIDE collection point.

The virus writer has collected these announcements, and has no way
to tell which announcements are valid, and which are phoney. 


Technical details for Decnet/VMS people:

The worm enters through the Decnet Task object, and mails your system's
announcement banner (sys$announce) to Decnet node 20597::PHSOLIDE.
(This node apparently is in France)

The worm generates a random node address and tries to copy itself onto that
node.  If this fails, it tries different random nodes until it finds one.
Once it finds a valid node, it tries to copy itself using the NETFAL account
(through the Task object).  If you don't have a valid Task object, it tries
to log into account DECNET, with password DECNET.

Once it's in your system, it creates a list of all users on your node, and
mails a message to each of them.  This message is some blather about how
Father Christmas has had a hard time getting "the terrible Rambo-Guns, Tanks
and Space Ships up here at the Northpole." The message itself is written in
a stilted, almost Germanic, style.

You can immunize your system by deleting the TASK 0 Decnet object, and by
making certain that you've changed the Decnet password.  In any case, the
worm is timed to stop after December 24th.  By the time you receive this
message, the worm will have died.

In RISKS-FORUM Digest 7.94 "Clifford Johnson" &lt;GA.CJJ@Forsythe.Stanford.EDU&gt;
[Vincennes:  conclusively, a computer-related error] writes:

&gt;I reflect that *all* the information that panicked the Vincennes crew and
&gt;captain came from the computers.  The captain was not faulted [...]
&gt; The fault was found to lie largely with the computer's initial
&gt;classification of the flight as hostile, and the computers' subsequent unclear
&gt;albeit correct presentation of the ascent data.  The actions taken to remedy
&gt;the deficiencies are improvements in the computer display/ human interface.
&gt;This is a a classic case of computer *related* error: unobvious and secondary
&gt;display of criticial data.

&gt;What the Pentagon has has more or less overtly ruled is that its
&gt;most competent, trained, and alert officers cannot be blamed for
&gt;mistakenly reading and acting on deadly computer displays,
&gt;especially not in combat, i.e. when they're actually used.

   In the case of Vincennes, the computer was definitely NOT the only nor
the most significant source of information.  The ship had been primed with
intelligence reports of hostile intent, was engaged in battle, maneuvering
radically, and taking fire.  The crew could hear bullets and shrapnel hitting
the ship.  They had been briefed to expect attack including aerial attack,
and had the memory of the Stark to remind them of the dangers inherent in
their situation.  They knew they were under surface attack.  They were
ready to believe that they were about to come under aerial attack as well.

   A major conclusion of the report was that people under great stress do 
not function in the same manner as they do in lab conditions.  It's easy 
for us to scour through the records in the comfort of our homes and offices 
and make judgements, but far more difficult to make them under severe time 
pressure, in physically disturbing conditions, under the threat of death.

   This case illustrated that a correct presentation of data is not always 
sufficient to prevent error; it may be necessary to present the data 
correctly and in a form that is highly unlikely to be misinterpreted.  It 
is not clear that we will ever be able to make systems that are immune 
from misinterpretation under such severe conditions.

   There is always confusion in battle, and there always will be, no 
matter what we do with computer systems.  The commander's first duty was 
to protect his ship.  That is what he did, albeit from what turned out to 
be a non-combatant that could not have hurt him.  To censure the crew of 
the Vincennes would undermine the ability of every man in uniform to take 
the necessary actions to protect himself and his country.  The Pentagon 
brass affirmed with their decision that battle zones are places rife with
confusion and danger, and that errors under those conditions are a fact of
life.

   We learn from this incident that battle zones are no place for innocents
(a lesson that is intuitively obvious), and that we have much to learn 
about how to fight with systems based on men and machines.

&gt;  In the case of Vincennes, the computer was definitely NOT the only
&gt;  nor the most significant source of information.

What I meant was that without the computer, there wouldn't have even been a
decision to shoot.  The computer-sensor's recognition of military signals
from the take-off airfield triggered, according to rule, an initial
misclassification as hostile until proven otherwise, and without the
computers' tracking of the flight nobody could have believed that the flight
was diving towards the ship.  That the error was due to bad presentation of
data was the Pentagon's conclusion, and why the incident is conclusively
computer-related error.

&gt; To censure the crew of the Vincennes would undermine the
&gt; ability of every man in uniform to take the necessary actions
&gt; to protect himself and his country.

We agree that the conduct of men in such circumstances is inherently an
input-governed impulse.  But your sentiment overlooks that military mission
takes precedence over personal survival, and that protection of innocent
life in the Gulf was the Vincennes' mission.  Viewed in this light, the
reliance placed on the computer-governed drills is unconvincingly justified.

Subject: Viruses and System Security (a story) [by Dave Platt]
Date: 20 Dec 88 00:30:03 GMT
Sender: funny@looking.UUCP
Reply-Path: watmath!uunet!arthur.cs.purdue.edu!bee
Also-Submitted-To-RISKS-by: From: Mark Brader &lt;msb@sq.sq.com&gt;

The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently.

The more things change, the more they stay the same...

Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
(I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion
of the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory
protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value
into its "privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could
then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management
system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting
things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.

Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official
"level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to be
fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
"Security SIDR", and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.

Xerox apparently sat on the problem... they either didn't acknowledge
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.

Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their
Xerox field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take
Direct Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the
system could be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security
systems could be subverted.

They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons,
in Unix terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert
system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on
one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect,
the superuser) from aborting them.

So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-development 
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena.
These included the following (as I recall... it's been a while since I
heard the story):

-  Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
   job.

-  Disk drives would seek back&amp;forth so rapidly that they'd attempt to
   walk across the floor.

-  The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself
   and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would usually
   jam in the punch.

-  The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
   to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.

-  The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be
   instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a
   card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into
   stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some
   code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip
   over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide
   themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to
   recollate them manually.

I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well.

Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of
events took place:

  !X id1

  id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)
  id1: Off (aborted)

  id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's men!

  id3: Thank you, my good fellow! (Robin)

Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and
would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that the
bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix
file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs
that were to be started at boot time...

The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this
problem.

I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about
the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against
either of these guys.

Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by Honeywell,
which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of the
mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort.
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6
system-programming language compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one
of the chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're
both alive and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John).
Both are among the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of
working with.

Disclaimers: it has been quite a while since I heard the details of how
this all went down, so some of the details above are almost certainly
wrong.  I shared an apartment with John Gabler for several years, and he
was my Best Man when I married back in '86... so I'm somewhat
predisposed to believe his version of the events that occurred.

	Recent computer virus threatens American justice system, too

The recent computer network virus was a prank designed to be harmless.  A
minor programming error made it replicate so much that it clogged Internet,
a research network, with messages.  Now some people want to punish this
accident as deliberate sabotage.

Yes, people should not clog networks.  But the "worm" had parts designed to
avoid clogging; one had an error.  Research is error prone: punishing errors
is futile if limited to errors in pranks.  More rational is to keep critical
computers off research networks, as the military does.

Yes, another worm might be designed to destroy files.  Some people are angry
at these potential future crimes; so angry that they clamor to punish someone
as an example, whether his own deeds deserve it or not.

This clamor threatens the American tradition of justice for each individual
-- something even more valuable than a working Internet.

(NY Times, 4 Jan 89) NEW YORK -- In a sweeping new move to tighten security
at United States airports, the government Wednesday ordered that computer
card systems be installed at the busiest terminals by early 1991 to keep
people who might threaten airline safety from reaching restricted areas.
Ultimately, a total of 270 airports would have to install either computer
card systems, resembling those used for automatic banking, or alternative
methods providing equal security.  The Federal Aviation Administration rule,
estimated to cost $170 million over the next 10 years, was proposed in
March. 

The move was made as a result of the crash of a Pacific Southwest Airlines
commuter jet in December 1987 that occurred after a passenger, believed to
have been an employee dismissed by an that had bought PSA, fired several
gunshots during the flight.  All 43 people aboard were killed.

The decree Wednesday had additional significance in the aftermath of the
bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland last month in which a total of
270 people were killed.

In a section of the rule justifying its action, the FAA said currently used
identification badges "provide a means of control once an individual has
gained access to a restricted area."  "The FAA is concerned," it said, "that
these procedures could allow an individual using forged, stolen or
noncurrent identification to compromise the secured areas."  It added that
former employees could use their familiarity with procedures to enter a
"secured area and possibly commit a criminal act on board an aircraft."
[...]
Burnley noted in Wednesday's announcement that computer-controlled card
systems could be programmed to "keep a record of employees who try to enter
areas for which they are not authorized."  "They can also reject cards that
have been reported lost or stolen, or which have not been surrendered by
former employees," he said.

T. Allan McArtor, administrtator of the FAA, said such systems already
were in use at some airports and "have proved to be highly effective
and workable."

Airline officials and airport operators had advanced many objections to the
new rule, including the high cost of installing and operating the
computer-card or other systems.  But in dealing with the cost issue, the FAA
said the total investment "can be recovered fully if one incident, involving
the loss of 170 lives and a wide-bodied jet," were prevented in the next 10
years.  [...]

I apologize to Stan Shebs and to RISKS readers for not having sufficiently
exerted my responsibility as moderator regarding the Shebs/D'Ippolito
exchange.  Sorry.  Occasionally one slips by.  Rich D'Ippolito's message was
less than circumspect.  I probably should have let them try to agree on a
counterposition and a rebuttal before troubling you all.  However, there are
some important issues raised.

A response from Stan Shebs follows, along with four other commentaries.

I didn't expect such a violent reaction to my comments on cruise missile
software that appeared in <A HREF="/Risks/8.86.html">RISKS-8.86</A>, but several of my remarks really ought
to be clarified.  First off, I worked on ALCM 1981-82, fresh out of Texas
A&amp;M, with no programming experience outside of research projects, and my
only education in software engineering having been to read "The Mythical
Man-Month".  Boeing did not require any training in their software
methodology (they probably offered some, but I don't remember), we just
learned on-the-job.  (Friends who are still there tell me that things have
improved in the past several years.)  My original article was written as
personal impressions, for a non-expert audience, and unfortunately Jon's
quoting couldn't make it into more of a learned treatise.

&gt;  From: rsd@SEI.CMU.EDU
  
&gt;  In RISKS 8.86, Jon Jacky quotes Stan Shebs:
  
&gt;&gt;    We supposedly had a "model" software engineering methodology; what I
&gt;&gt;    remember most clearly is that half the work was done on one flavor of IBM
&gt;&gt;    OS, and the other half done on a different flavor, and file transfer
&gt;&gt;    between the two was tricky and time-consuming.
  
&gt;  The coupled clauses are unrelated, a compositional practice Mr. Shebs is
&gt;  apparently quite fond of.

In this case, it was a subtle (clearly too subtle) literary device; there was
almost no relation between the official methodology and daily practice.  The
process of conforming to the DoD's requirements resulted in a fanatical
adherence to the letter of the standards, with almost no concern for actual
quality.  I had written some tricky code and proved its correctness; it got
thrown away because it was "too general".  We had an independent auditor that
checked over the documentation and found missing commas, while completely
ignoring the parts of the program design that parroted Fortran code without
saying anything about its structure.  I could go on, but this is supposed to be
a clarification, not an independent message.

&gt;  [...]
&gt;  Of course the program design should have been documented beforehand, but
&gt;  recognizing that it is necessary to have for testing and maintenance
&gt;  purposes is not stupid.  I have seen many systems where the software is very
&gt;  old (or inhereted) and must be re-documented to current standards.  What was
&gt;  the case here?
  
The software was about a year old I believe; probably the same standards
were in effect then, but I can't say for sure.  It was written under
considerable time pressure and almost entirely free of comments.  The
experience of trying to puzzle out the workings of 30k lines of mixed
Fortran, Cobol, and assembler was truly horrible.  Management knew it was
all a sham, but they just asked us to go along with it.  (Funny, 30k lines
doesn't seem like a lot anymore - times change...)
  
&gt;&gt;    (Regarding) statistics on software quality, the closest thing we had was
&gt;&gt;    maybe a count of problem reports (hundreds, but each report ranged from
&gt;&gt;    one-liners to one-monthers in terms of effort required).
  
&gt;  Sigh.  There is no mention here whether this applies to _delivered_ product
&gt;  or corrected production errors.  Is this his view of what constitutes
&gt;  quality?
  
I believe the numbering of software problem reports started after delivery
of the first version, but I don't know for sure. The whole setup seemed pretty
disorganized; for instance, there was no formal system for module-level
testing, before or after delivery, and regression testing was limited to
rerunning a set of standard flight paths, which weren't complicated enough
even to test all the paths in the program code, let alone boundary cases.

&gt;  This article was posted to illuminate "the accuracy/quality of strategic
&gt;  weapons guidance systems", presumably by offering a coherent and reasoned
&gt;  exposition.  Instead, it presents jokes, innuendo, and unsubstantiated
&gt;  charges and conclusions in indefinite (and sloppy, such as the 1/2 inch
&gt;  diameter missile) language such as:

It never occurred to me that anybody could possibly misinterpret
"6 meters long and 1/2 in diameter", but it must be possible.  For the
record, it's 1/2 *meter* (actually more like 2/3, but who cares).

&gt;&gt;    The difficulty of all this apparently didn't occur to anybody until after
&gt;&gt;    the missile was working...

This was what I heard from the people who were there at the time.  They may
not have been entirely accurate, but the objective evidence and the history
of the ALCM program support this.  Old documents seem to assume that laying
out a mission by hand in the traditional way is good enough.  In actuality,
the missile is so sluggish that it has to begin climbing long before it
reaches a hill, or it will end up plowing into the side (this actually
happened during testing).

&gt;&gt;    ...error accumulation over 2000 km is immense,... 

We had graphs of just how bad inertial navigation gets over long distances.
The actual numbers are probably classified, but in general an inertially
guided missile would be useful only against cities; silos and other hardened
sites require much more accurate navigation techniques.

I found the comments of Rich D'Ippolito in RISKS 9.1 ("A 'model' software
engineering methodology") to be unconvincing and ill mannered.  Mr. D'Ippolito
is offended by a some anecdotes posted in RISKS 8.86 which reflect poorly on
the design and implementation of a cruise missile ( John Jacky, quoting Stan
Shebs).  The points which Mr. D'Ippolito references are:
	1) The development was carried out on 2 incompatible 
	development platforms --- file transfer between the 2
	systems was ``tricky and time consuming".
	2)  The "Program Design" was written after the program 
	was written.
	3) There failure conditions of the program seemed to have
	been poorly planned for, e.g, error accummulation over a long
	flight path, and the effects of snowfall on topography.
	4) Program quality was measured by raw count of problem reports
	without reference to the complexity of the reported problems.	

These are all significant problems, which cannot be dismissed by the ad
hominem arguments presented by Mr. D'Ippolito. Mr. Shebs is not the first
person to point out instances of sloppy software engineering in D.O.D.
projects, but I found his story interesting and informative. Mr. D'Ippolito
argues in the mode of a press secretary, rather than as a scientist.
Comments such as:	

&gt;Really, if Mr. Shebs's rambling demonstrates anything, it shows that the
&gt;greatest risk is hiring inarticulate and confused programmers like himself
&gt;who don't have the faintest idea what software engineering is.

are out of place and offensive.

In the 6 July Risks Mr. D'Ippolito somewhat justifiably takes Mr. Shebs to task
about his criticisms of the Cruise Missile project Mr. Shebs was a part of.

However, one comment relating to producing the design specification after
coding was completed brought back my memories of being one of the senior staff
during the mid-80s for the Navy's version of this missile, called Tomahawk.

In the view of the project's mangement, the required documentation was an
unnecessary burden placed on us hardworking developers by government
bureaucrats.  An example was the spec. which provided an English description fo
the guidance software line-by-line.  It was essentially useless.  The guidance
software had been developed in the usual atmosphere of intense deadline
pressure, with the highest priority given to making the thing work.  As a
result, the code was not a textbook example of modularity and
understandability.  In fact, the documentation probably was irrelevant, since
the engineers and computer scientists used simulations of the guidance system
and software models of the guidance equations to develop the system.

My point is that these projects are examples of the fact that industry is just
beginning to recognize the size of the investment they are making in software,
and the technologies needed.  Most defense contractors (there is a
Carnegie-Mellon survey on this) are only now coming out of the Stone Age of
focusing on coding in marathon sessions to produce software while producing
reams of documentation.

However, it is by no means clear that applying what we think of as
state-of-the-art that we will do much better.

In RISKS Digest 9.1 a certain gentlemen responds and quotes liberally from
another gentleman's experiences in software engineering for missile
guidance systems.  The jist of the article seemed to be that the original
poster was incompetent and that his remarks were irrelevant, derogatory, and
totally without merit.  Ahem, Isn't this just possibly another example of
shooting the messenger because of the message???

I once worked for a defense contractor who manufactured submarines for the U.S.
Navy (There are only two in this country, take your pick.)  Quite often there
was a tremendous difference between The Way It Is and The Way It Is Supposed To
Be. Sometimes design and manufacturing errors were found.  Sometimes they were
buried.  But usually, the reputation (of the company and the Navy) was more
important that the viability of the product.

The RISKS involved are probably as old as engineering itself; that is, creating
an absurd or impossible situation, and then deriding the first person who
brings attention to the problem.  Where would the Emperor be today if someone
had not pointed out the 'design flaw' in his new clothes?

If we cannot learn from our mistakes, we just rename them; "Success". (1/2 :-)

Sean Mathews brings back shades of when I was working on flight projects.
Dicey stuff.  All examples he documents (starting with no dynamic memory [I was
amused by starting with this]) are all standard operating procedure (so
believed in the defense and aerospace arenas).  These ideas date back decades
(not just years).  Since NASA was mentioned (and projects differ), I should
mention that the policy of explicitly reading machine code is from the days of
smaller memories.  The Agency is trying to get away from this.  The code is
still generated (I know where this example comes from) by HAL/S computers for
the shuttle (HAL, BTW does not have dynamic memory, or any of the features [no
multiprocessor support, etc.]).

Sean's posting does raise quite a few other questions:

	Is there explicit range checking?
	Are there comments on performance?
	Are there specifications on clocks and interrupt handling?
	Etc.

For the classic summary to Sean's misgivings of the merchants of killing and
mayhem.  It was Andy Mickel at U. Minn. who in the early days of Ada published:
"Reliable software must kill people reliably." [Pascal News].

Here are some comments on Sean Matthews's posting:

&gt;1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
&gt;recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).

As a practical matter, this requirement rules out all real software systems.
Also, I do not see why this makes software safer.  I think this will result in
less safe software, since there will be arbitrary limits on the length of
everything.  All last names must be 30 chars or less, all place names must be
40 chars or less, etc.  Long buffer sizes will lessen the impact, but take up
more space.

&gt;2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.
&gt;3. There should not be any distributed processing 
&gt;4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

As a practical matter, these requirements rule out most (all?) real systems.
Also, I do not see why software which does none of these things is safer than
software which does all of them.  These requirements seems to be designed to
compensate for the (huge) limitations of current program verification
techniques.

&gt;10. No optimising compilers will be used.

What is an optimising compiler?  This is a serious question.  GCC with no
arguments provides better code than PCC or Sun's CC, does that make it an
optimized compiler?  What if you give it a -O1 option, or a -O3 option (which
turns on more optimization).  All compilers do some optimization. Point 10
should say something like "All compilers used must be verified to the same
level of certainty as the programs they are compiling."  It is kind of useless
to verify a program and then run it through a compiler which is not verified.
Of course writing a compiler which does not use dynamic memory (see point 1)
would be an interesting exercise!

Overall, I found these standards funny, not useful.  My conclusion is that no
safety critical software can not be written in the UK since points 1 and 2 will
mean that none of it will be up to standard.

Sean Matthews writes of the UK safety-critical software standard:

&gt; 2-4 seem to leave no option but polling.  This is impractical,
&gt; especially in embedded systems.  No one is going to build a fly by
&gt; wire system with those sorts of restrictions.

Polling is absolutely the safest and most-used method for programming embedded
systems for saftey-critical applications.  It is a commonly held fallacy that
the essence of a real-time embedded system is FAST response to external stimuli
-- that interrupts are therefore important.  The essence of real-time embedded
systems is a GUARANTEE of a specified, finite response time to EACH stimulus.

Many embedded systems divide real time into a hierarchy of time slots, and
execute fixed subroutines in each time slot (i.e. "polling").  This makes it
relatively easy to verify that the program can meet all response time
requirements.  Stimuli requiring slower responses are handled by routines that
run less often, and routines running more often handle stimuli requiring faster
response.  Every routine can be proven to run in less time than the length of
one time slot.

Additional advantages:  The trivial scheduling algorithm makes the interaction
between the routines vastly easier to write and verify than is the case in a
system that can switch tasks at random times.  Response time bottlenecks can be
identified and addressed early in the development cycle.  It is easy to match
the requirements of the sources/sinks of stimuli/responses and the capabilities
of the embedded computer.  And on and on ...

In short, when a life depends on your system ...

While the previous posting in RISKS didn't mention this, the "destroyed
files" regarding the Exxon oil spill were apparently actually simply
the routine recycling of a month-old (or older) backup dump tape.

Exxon has continued to state that they believe all files are still online or in
paper form.  Obviously the correct procedure would have been to explicitly
order the preservation of those dumps, and nobody wants to condone Exxon's
handling of this whole affair, but it is worth noting that the deletion in
question was apparently the result of routine computer center operations common
to many environments, not some "explicit" act of destruction.

Today's (09 July 89) Washington Post has several articles about the latest
trend in foods:  Frequent Shoppers Programs.  For those of you not aware of
this, it is similar to Frequent Flyer Programs used by the airlines.  When you
buy an item at your local mega-chain supermarket, your purchase is noted in a
large customer database and you are given a credit on your account, and when
your account reaches certain defined levels, you receive coupons for various
foodstuffs.  Simple right?  Wrong.

First, the markets are proposing to record more than a purchase of so many
dollars and cents.  They intend to record the specific brands and items you
bought.  Based on this information and your address information, markets want
to start targetting mailings of flyers and coupons to you.  If their records
show you have started to buy baby food recently, the AI routines that examine
the data base will note this, and flag your record to be sent coupons on other
baby products, such as diapers and lotions.

This is in fact not a terrible thing.  If markets want to spend money send
paper in the mail to people who may or may not use them, there are far more
useless ways to spend money.  The problem is the second application.

It seems that the markets want to sell this information to the manufacturers
(the Campbell Soups, the Nabiscos, the General Foods, and so on) for use by
their own marketing people.  This also raises the traditional right to privacy
issues.

I wonder how much longer it will be till I will not be able to go into my local
Giant Food and buy a bag of flour, because their demographic survey shows that
no one eats in my apartment building.

Joshua Levy comments in Risks 9.2 on the UK MoD Std:

   &gt;&gt;1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
   &gt;&gt;   recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).
   &gt;&gt;2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.
   &gt;&gt;3. There should not be any distributed processing 
   &gt;&gt;4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

 &gt;As a practical matter, these requirements rule out most (all?) real systems.
 &gt;Also, I do not see why software which does none of these things is safer than
 &gt;software which does all of them.  These requirements seems to be designed to
 &gt;compensate for the (huge) limitations of current program verification
 &gt;techniques.

Much safety-critical software is built this way already; it is simply untrue
that these limitations rule out real systems.  Software with these
characteristics is safer because it is deterministic rather than
non-deterministic -- the number of states may often be reduced to a small
enough number to perform extensive (and sometimes exhaustive) testing and
analysis.  No dynamic storage allocation also ensures that the system will not
run out of memory during a critical operation:  Again the goal is to make the
software predictable and analyzable.  Norm Finn, in the same issue of Risks,
explains the reasons for and practicality of eliminating interrupts.

Safety-critical systems are built this way in order to perform effective
verification (e.g., testing and analysis) in general -- it has nothing to do
with the limitations of formal verification.  I refer you to the design of the
software for a nuclear reactor shutdown system described in my Computing
Surveys article (June 1986) as an example and an explanation of the purpose of
such restrictions.

 &gt;Of course writing a compiler which does not use dynamic memory (see point 1)
 &gt;would be an interesting exercise!

You misunderstood -- the limitation is on the object code, not on the
compiler.  If the compiler runs out of memory and fails to produce object
code, this is not a hazard.

 &gt;Overall, I found these standards funny, not useful.  My conclusion is that no
 &gt;safety critical software can not be written in the UK since points 1 and 2 
 &gt;will mean that none of it will be up to standard.

I cannot understand how this conclusion follows.  There is already software
performing safety-critical functions that satisfies these standards.  In my
experience, the software that has killed people in the past has almost always
used unnecessarily complex programming techniques.  For example, the Therac
deaths were related to race conditions in the software created by the use of
multitasking (which was not necessary to implement the required functionality).
The nondeterminism involved makes it impossible to thoroughly test or analyze
the Therac software to eliminate such critical errors.

The most effective way to increase the reliability of software that we
currently know about is simply to make it understandable and predictable.
Although there may be many very good reasons for using sophisticated
programming techniques, increased reliability and safety are usually not among
them.  When human life is involved, most real systems make tradeoffs in the
direction of simplicity and predictability.

For the most part, the new UK standard just specifies current standard practice
for safety-critical software used by those most experienced in building such
software.

At the COMPASS '88 meeting last summer, John Cullyer described a quality study
on modules selected from the NATO software inventory that was performed at the
Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), the central electronics research
laboratory of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).  Here is mention of that study
from a recent paper, "High Integrity Computing", by W.J. Culler, pages 1-35 in
"Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems (Lecture Notes in
Computer Science No. 331)", edited by M. Joseph, Springer-Verlag 1988: 

``One of the techniques which has been developed to provide objective evidence
  of the correctness of software is called `static code analysis' ... (which
  uses) algebraic methods which are totally independent of dynamic testing...''

Application of static code analysis since 1985 has revealed some worrying
results.  Taking a broad average over the software checked by MOD or by
contractors on behalf of MOD, up to 10 percent of the individual software
modules have been shown to deviate from the original specification.  Such
discrepancies have been found even in software that has been subject to
extensive testing on multi-million pound test rigs.  Many of the anomalies
detected have been minor and did not threaten the integrity of the system
being monitored.

However, about 1 in 20 of the defective functions that static code analysis
had shown to be faulty, i.e., about 1 in every 200 of all new modules, proved
to have errors that would have resulted in direct and observable effects
on the vehicle or plant concerned.  For example, potential overflows in
integer arithmetic appears to be a common problem, involving a change in
sign of the result of a calculation and hence the possibility of an actuator
being driven in a dangerous direction.''

At COMPASS, Cullyer said about the same proportion of faulty modules was
discovered in the British, American and German contributions.  He also
mentioned that the British MOD's interest in formal methods was motivated by
several near-miss accidents involving computers that he said he was not
permitted to discuss.

In a TV news report last evening (7/6) on the computer shutdown at O'Hare
Airport, the reporter commented that the skies were actually safer as a result,
which he attributed to two causes: first, that there was less air traffic and
second, that "pilots are relying on their knowledge and their skills rather
than on a computer."

The investigation continues into the Southern Pacific May 11 Cajon wreck.  This
was the incident where an SP potash unit train lost its brakes while descending
Cajon Pass, a grade in excess of 2%.  The train roared down the hill as the
crew radioed they were out of control; it reached 90 mph before jumping the
track and crashing into a neighborhood near San Bernadino.  Three persons were
killed, eight injured, and 11 homes destroyed.

New information indicates an inaccurate calculation of the train's tonnage.
Press reports indicated the train contained 69 cars with a weight of 6150 tons,
but an SP assistant chief dispatcher has since estimated the actual weight as
8950 tons.  Had the crew known the train's additional weight, they might have
set up the air brakes sooner.  Faulty dynamic brakes were found in one of the
four lead engines and one of the two pushers.  As the train crested the hill,
the lead engineer radioed the pusher engineer to ask if he was "giving all [the
dynamic braking] he had;" the rear engineer answered "yes" even though he told
investigators that he was aware the dynamic brakes were not working.

David Gursky's comments about grocery stores using computers to keep track 
of their customers so as to target mailings isn't anything new.

I can't be the only person who wasn't allowed out of a Radio Shack store
until I gave my name and address...

And I always say "I'm on the mailing list already" and they always say "Well,
the computer will notice it and won't put you on again."

Problem is, my name is just complicated enough so that there's always just a
LITTLE bit of difference when it is keypunched, and the computer says "BING
BING BING not the same; add it to the list."

Steven C. Den Beste   (right. "Den Beste" complete with embedded space is my
			last name.)
Steven C. Denbeste, Steven Den Beste, Stephen Den Beste, Steven D. Beste,
Steven Dan Beste, Steven Beste, Steve Den Beste, Steven Baste,
and on and on and on. At one address I was on the damned list 5 times. And
since the Radio Shack mailing list never dies (they always say "or current
resident") some poor bastard is STILL getting those five catalogs every couple
of weeks.

The best comment of all may be that I received Steve "Pick a last name"
Den Beste's message *before* my copy of RISKS with my message arrived!

And if it is any consolation to Steve, in all the times I have shopped at Radio

A less-intrusive variant of this is already in place at my local Safeway.
After your purchase is rung up, a little printer on top of the cash register
spits out some coupons for you.  They always are for competing brands of things
similar to what you just bought.

Summary of an article by Jeffrey A. Perlman in the `Los Angeles Times' 12 July
1989 is headlined AIR TRAFFIC COMPUTER FAILS 104 TIMES IN A DAY:

Unspecified hardware problems caused 104 brief failures in a new
multimillion-dollar computer system throughout the day Sunday at the Coast
Terminal Radar Approach Control, known as Coast TRACON, in El Toro.  The
failures, up to five minutes in length, wiped altitude, speed, aircraft
identification, and radio frequency data off of controllers' screens, leaving
only aircraft blips or targets.

The new system has no backups, unlike the aging system it replaced 2.5 months
ago.  Furthermore, a decoder which could have provided some of the lost
information from aircraft transponders, is inoperative because parts are on
back order.  During the failures, controllers had no way of knowing an
aircraft's altitude or identity except through voice communications.

Controllers said the failures endangered air safety, although the FAA minimized
the hazards.  Although there were no "near misses," many aircraft departing
from LA International airport did encounter short delays because controllers
were swamped.

An emergency technical crew was flown in from New Jersey and worked all night
Monday to correct the problem.  A controller spokesman said there were still at
least three more failures as of Tuesday afternoon, although the FAA's assistant
regional manager said he was unaware of any further computer failures after
Monday night's repairs.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has previously filed
complaints with the FAA about the El Toro system and about TRACON facilities
elsewhere that have received the same system.

[MORE SUBSEQUENTLY FROM RODNEY:]

The previously unspecified hardware problems are now spelled out:
According to Jim Panter, manager of the facility, "no new computer system
was involved.  It was stictly old equipment that needed to be replaced."
The series of computer outages was traced to four brittle, broken wires
inside aging memory storage units.  Four of the Univac computer's 11 memory
modules, in use for at least 12 years, went out on Sunday because of the
wires.  A heat build-up aggravated the situation, with the computer system
shutting itself down and restarting, catching up with new data, as it tried
on its own to locate the memory storage problem.

A special crew from the FAA's technical center in Atlantic City, NJ, worked
on successive nights this week to solve the problem, but because of a parts
shortage some outages still occurred Monday and Tuesday, Panter said.
There were no outages Wednesday, he said.

The computer system involved has been in use at least since 1972, although
it has been upgraded several times with new software.  The software was not
involved in Sunday's failures, although it has been involved in problems at
other TRACON facilities.  "Just like any program, the new software has had
its glitches," said FAA spokesman John Leyden in Washington.

These excerpts from "Flying the Electric Skies," M. Mitchell Waldrop, Science
(30 June 1989, p.1532ff, v.244).  Elisions... and [bracketed paraphrasing] are
mine as part of condensation.  Comments follow.

  [...]  McDonnell Douglas... thinks [pure fly-by-wire isn't quite mature, so
it's]...  taking a different tack with its new MD-11, a three-engine widebody
scheduled to start service in late 1990.  The MD-11 is even more highly
automated than the A320 in many ways. ... But the MD-11's computerized controls
most emphatically will have mechanical backups.  ``The pilots have to have
control in all situations, not just the normal ones,'' says Douglas' Miller.
``A lot of what ended up in the Airbus got done because it was neat,'' claims
Joel Ornelas, manager of the MD-11 design effort.  ``Engineers love it.  But
the pilots...?''

  [...]  Airbus [doesn't agree.  They think their stuff is great and saves
weight and can't fail; but]... the A320 does have a partial backup system: a
set of cables running back to the tail and rudder.  In an absolute power
failure those cables are supposed to let the crew keep the airplane under
control until they establish emergency power--or if need be, longer.  ``In test
flights we've demonstrated {operation with the backups} from cruise... to
landing... which is more than they were designed to do.''

  [...  However, the pilot of an A320] is... going to have to live with the
A320's preprogrammed restrictions on what it will do.  This guardian angel
behavior, known more formally as the Flight Envelope Protection System, is
widely considered by aviation professionals to be... far more revolutionary...
than fly-by-wire per se.  In effect, the A320's designers have decreed that
their judgement about the aircraft's limits will always take precedence over
the pilot's judgement.  And that is not a constraint that any pilot can take
lightly.

  ``*Nothing* must have the authority to forbid the pilot to take the actions
he needs to,'' Says McDonnell Douglas' Miller.  The problem with giving away
that authority to a computer, he says, is that ``a computer is totally
fearless--it doesn't know that it's about to hit something.''

  Imagine, for example, that an A320 pilot makes a sharp turn to avoid an
imminent collision, or else dives and then has to pull out to avoid the ground.
No matter how desperately he or shell hauls back on that sidestick, the
envelope protection system will not let the airplane respond beyond a certain
rate: namely, the rate that limits stress on the airframe to... 2.5G.

  ...this seems like plenty.  [It would] require quite a violent maneuver [to
pull 2.5G]. ...But consider... China Airlines Flight 006 on 19 February 1985.
While cruising at 41,000 feet some 300 miles NW of San Francisco... the 747
suffered [power loss and cockpit confusion leading to a] near vertical dive.
Over the next three minutes it plunged nearly 6 miles, until the captain was
able to maneuver it back into level flight at only 9500 feet.  He measurably
warped the wings.  He caused several million dollars worth of other structural
damage.  But he saved the airplane and passengers.  And to do it he had to pull
an estimated 5.5G, or more than twice the A320 limits.

  Airbus, not surprisingly, responds that an A320 never would have [entered the
dive] in the first place. ...Be that as it may, notes [747 pilot] Waldrip, many
pilots do like to fee that they can bend or break the aircraft [if they must].
[McDonnell Douglas agrees.]  ``Our strategy...  is that the pilot must have
overriding authority,'' says Miller, ``and he must be able to exercise that
control by the normal method''--the same eye-hand-brain control loop that a
pilot develops through... experience.

  For example, imagine a pilot caught by wind shear, a sudden and very
dangerous burst of cold air falling out of a rain cloud.  The best thing to do
in such a situation is to pull the nose up and put the power to the wall.
Never mind if the engines have to be rebuilt later; you're just trying to keep
from hitting the ground.  However, this is hardly the time to be thinking about
things like special override switches, says Miller.  ``You want your normal...
actions to always have the expected effects.''  So on an MD-11, the pilot would
push the throttle all the way forward until it stopped to get the full rated
power of the engine, with the built in limits providing the same kind of
security as the A320's envelope protection system.  But then by doing the
instinctive thing-- pushing very, very hard-- he could break through to a
regime the A320 absolutely forbids: extreme thrust, well beyond the rated
power.  And so it goes throughout the MD-11, says Miller.  The limits are there
for safety, ``but to override you just have to pull hard or push hard.''  [...]  
The Mac-Dac engineers seem to have worked hard on the ``human-factors'' stuff.
I'm struck by the thought that `push hard to override' is rather like "pounding
on things," which has sort-of appeared in office computer interfaces; for
example... giving a likely-to-be-an-error command to the vi text editor will
provoke a message the first time you try it, but if you repeat the command
immediately vi will shrug and do what you want.

It seems to me that risks from faulty computer-human interaction probably
can be reduced by this sort of thing.  When time is critical, it's handy
if "more force" gets you what you want without fumbling around for some
obscure override control.

The issue of "who's in charge here, anyway?" is more interesting.  The
A320 approach assumes that pilot error is more likely than proper-though-
unusual control motions.  Since pilots are still more versatile than the
computers in their planes, they should probably have the last word.  Also,
pilots can learn new tricks faster than computers can receive certified
software upgrades.  Post-aircrash review (and recently, simulator
recreation/experimentation) often produces "how-to" bulletins for pilots
to deal with unusual situations.  It might be a long time before that
stuff could be translated into revised FCS software.

[More excerpts from the same 'Science' article as in the foregoing...  PGN]

The stories briefly survey the philosophy, state of the art, and controversy of
fly-by-wire aircraft and (overly-?) protective new extensions.  Designers on
both sides of the argument, as well as pilots, are given their say.  [...]

Airbus engineering test pilot Udo Guenzel:  ``Suppose you suddenly find
yourself staring at a Cessna that has wandered into your airspace.  So you
swerve.  Now, in a standard airliner, you would probably hold back from
maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or
worse.... But in the A320, you could just slam the controller all the way to
the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you.''

The A320 has five separate computers, "redundant software obtained from two
different vendors to minimize the possibility that the same bug will appear
simultaneously," heavy shielding on its data cables to keep out electromagnetic
interference, "and, yes, the A320 does have a partial [mechanical] backup
system."

The sidebar reviews more of the history of fly-by-wire and flight
automation philosophy:  

   "We started out with cockpit automation backwards," says Northwest 
   Airlines 747 pilot Kenneth Waldrip.  In the 1970s and early 1980s,
   he says, "the idea was that the computers would fly the plane and the
   pilot would monitor them in case anything went wrong...."  There was
   only one problem with that scenario, Waldrip says:  humans are
   absolutely terrible at passive monitoring.... People get bored.  Their
   attention flags.  They start missing things.  Worse, a passive pilot
   would often have to tackle an emergency cold....
   
   By the mid-1980s, aircraft designers, pilot trainers, and the aviation
   community generally had gone through a 180-degree turn in their concept
   of what automation should do.  The new philosophy, which often goes 
   under the name of "human-centered" automation, was illustrated in 1980 
   in a seminal paper by human factors researchers Earl Wiener (Univ. of 
   Miami) and Renwick Curry (NASA Ames Research Center).  They used the
   image of an "Electric Cocoon" [similar to the Flight Envelope Protection
   System  of today's  A320]. 
   
   Instead of having people watch the machines, human-centered automation 
   means having the machines watch the people.... and it means putting
   automation back on the right track: as an assistant to the pilots.

I can't let go unchallenged Norm Finn's and Nancy Leveson's statements
(RISKS-9.2, .3) on what are variously called "polling," "time-slot," or
"crystal clock" system architectures:

   "Polling is absolutely the safest and most-used method for
    programming embedded systems for saftey-critical applications."

   "The trivial scheduling algorithm makes the interaction between the
    routines vastly easier to write and verify than is the case in a
    system that can switch tasks at random times."

   "Software with these characteristics is safer because it is
    deterministic rather than non-deterministic -- the number of states
    may often be reduced to a small enough number to perform extensive
    (and sometimes exhaustive) testing and analysis."

I don't want to comment on the _theoretical_ truth of these statements;
that argument may never be resolved.  However, in my personal experience
with major DoD systems over many years, this approach to system
architecture has led to many more absolute abominations that any other.
                                  ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The major problem, I believe, is that it does not work well with normal
design and coding team organization and management.  The approach AS
PRACTICED seems to grind together the pieces of any original functional
organization, breaks them into small pieces, and then "shotguns" them
all over the time-slot hierarchy.  Traceability from requirements to
code, never our strong suit, is lost.  "Invisible dependencies" become
the order of the day: code in major cycle XXYa34/minor cycle Ybbb_CAL
assumes that variable IXXm3_AP was set correctly by a side-effect of
code in XXZdd3/PQ88_SET/ECP9347q; when XXZdd3 is reorganized because it
wasn't fitting in its time-slot, the assumption became incorrect.  This
is first noticed when the $100 million satellite attempts to orbit at
-800 miles altitude.  Because our teams are large, scattered,
ill-managed, and leavened with the mediocre, the possible advantages
quoted above are overwhelmed.

I feel about these dueling approaches as I do about HOLs: a good
programmer/team/company can write a good system in any language, and a
bad one can write a bad system in any language.  The time-slot systems
I've seen might have been even worse had they been designed to be
multi-tasking; the choice of architecture was not the root cause of
failure.  It may be a symptom.

	     Over the past six years, FDA has documented an increase in 
       medical device problem reports of and voluntary recalls for 
       system design errors and computer programming errors.  Some of 
       the reported errors have compromised patient safety.  Included 
       are blood bank computer systems used in controling the release of
       whole blood and blood products for treating patients.  Some of
       the errors could have allowed institutions to release infected
       blood products.

	     Such inappropriate release is particularly hazardous to the 
       public health because blood products infected with HIV (AIDS virus)
       and hepatitis might become available for transfusion.  Fortunately, 
       so far, no cases of HIV infection have been traced directly to 
       computer errors, but agency experts and field investigators believe
       this result is only because the institutions have not depended 
       heavily on software controls to authorize release of blood products.

One particularly troubling aspect of the problem, uncovered during an
inspection, was a lack of security on serologic data entries.  The system
allowed more than one operator to edit the same record simultaneously, with the
result that the last one to close the record had the final word on the contents
of the record.  That is to say, one operator could enter a test result of
positive for hepatitis and exit while at the same time a second operator
entered some other result (the default hepatitis result being negative); so
when the second operator exited, the default negative for hepatitis became the
permanent entry.  This seems to violate well known principles of data
integrity, but it happened.

The software in question is no longer used, but the problem remains:  how does
one assure that dangerous bugs have been eliminated from commercial software
when one has neither real-time information about nor control over the way it is
developed?

[The lateness of this response and to my e-mail is due to a city watermain
break that flooded the basement of the building with the cooling equipment
in it, shutting down our building for 6 days -- as noted in RISKS-9.1.]

First, let me apologize to Stan Shebs and the readers of RISKS for the tone
and content of my recent article.  It was not intended to be a shoot-the-
messenger reply, and I'm sorry that it appears to be.  I most likely read
the original article as an series of general unsupported charges against a
specific former employer who had no way to respond, and took my cue from the
clearly provocative title.

Let me make the attempt to extract some lessons from the original article
and all of the subsequent discussion:

Mr. Loux asks if the intent was to discourage whistle-blowers.  Of course
not; I didn't take the article as whistle-blowing to begin with.  The intent
was to elicit more specific information on exactly what the charges were and
who they were against.  Many of the statements were made with little or no
support other than admitted hearsay, and I'm sorry I didn't respond to the
message instead the statements.  I will disregard those statements in the
remaining discussion.

It was not clear to me that there was a connection between the "model"
software engineering methodology and the file transfer problem -- I should
not have missed that.  Mr. Shebs's clarification of this point and expansion
to the comparison of meeting the letter of DoD acquisition requirements with
software quality should be seen as evidence for the immaturity of the SE
discipline everywhere -- not just for the defense industry.  

It is the real lack of true engineering methods that leads to the acceptance
of "models" where the emphasis and attention is placed on the checking off
of boxes on a delivery schedule.  After all, the incentive structure is set
up to reward schedule adherence, so it is easy to predict that the efforts
will be devoted to getting the all of boxes checked at the right times.  How
can you fault the management for doing what they are paid to do?  Even a
well-educated management (in terms of technical realism) will have a hard
time making the right response under such reward conditions.  Many
non-defense contractors have found that offering the programmers extra
rewards for meeting schedules does not get better software, nor does it get
it on time, when the impossible is requested.

Mr. Shebs also states that the greatest risk might have been from things that
weren't anticipated during testing.  I suggest that waiting until testing is
too late.  The time to do the risk analysis is in the initial stages of
design, so that the testing procedures are only used to verify that the
implementation is faithful to the design.  It is because there is not the
clear separation of design from implementation in the software industry that
testing is misunderstood and misused.

The issue of problem reports and their unclear relationship to software
quality is also a result of the failure of traditional methodologies to
separate design from implementation, and from their nearly exclusive focus
on process.  The best process in the world can't be expected to do more than
produce economical, consistent copies of poor designs!  The problem will be
with us until we shift from process orientation to product orientation.

I would like to take issue with Mr. Loux's characterization of the problem as
being inherent in engineering.  True engineers do not respond to absurd or
impossible situations.  Engineering, as an applied science, has been the basis
for reasonable expectations, as engineers are adverse to undertaking projects
of any kind without having a base of working models of prior solutions
(captured scientific knowledge) to adapt.  Without such models, there is
nothing on which to build a set of application techniques to apply the
knowledge, let alone a way to generate a rational set of tests and expectations
for the final product.

Which company, defense or otherwise, will be the first to refuse to bid on a
project requiring technology that it has never delivered, and which software
engineers will be the first to refuse to agree to deliver something for which
no models have been proven?

Nancy Leveson suggests that eliminating dynamic memory allocation, recursion,
interrupts and multi-processing is done in safety critical systems to make them
deterministic.  I disagree.  Software that uses those techniques can be just as
deterministic as software that does not.  Further, software without any of
those features can be non-deterministic in its behaviour.  For example, the
non-determinism associated with interrupt handling comes from the unknown
timing of the external events and is not affected by the replacement of
interrupts with polling.

The MOD restrictions do not rule out non-determinism.  Further, they do not
rule out bad programming.  If I am forbidden to use compilers or operating
systems with dynamic memory allocation and consequently write complex programs
that use "static" variables for many different purposes I am likely to
introduce more mistakes than would have been present in the mature dynamic
allocation system that I was not allowed to use.  If, because I am forbidden to
use recursion, I write a complex program that does the stacking and
backtracking hidden by recursion, I am likely to introduce more errors than
were present in the compiler's well-tested implementation of recursion.
Similarly, if I introduce busy waiting and polling in my programs because I
cannot use interrupts, I may again make things worse rather than better.

Nancy is right in saying that "it is simply untrue that these limitations rule
out real systems."  Many perfectly horrible real-systems have been written
without any of those features.

Nor, would I agree that non-determinism is bad.  Non-determinism has been
demonstrated by Dijkstra (and much earlier by Robert Floyd) to allow programs
that are much more easily verified than some deterministic ones.

These regulations remind me of the old story about a man found looking
carefully under a street lamp.  When asked, he said he was looking for a coin
he had dropped on the other side of the street.  When asked why he was looking
on this side, rather than where he dropped the coin, he replied that it was too
dark over there.

Regulations of this sort are imposed not because they are the right
restrictions but because they are easily enforced by people who do not want to
read programs carefully.  It is much easier to verify that recursion and
interrupts have not been used than to verify that the program is
well-structured, well-documented, systematically inspected (verified), and
adequately tested.  Just as it is easier to look for a ring under a street
light, it is easier to check for the absence of features than the presence of
quality.

All my knowledge of the Therac software comes from discussions with Nancy.
However, from her description the problem with that software was not the use of
multi-tasking but the failure to use well-known (and well-understood) ways of
making multi-tasking verifiable.

As Nancy says, "The most effective way to increase the reliability of software
that we currently know about is simply to make it understandable and
predictable."  "Sophisticated programming techniques", properly used, can do
just that.  Unfortunately, we cannot make regulations that define "properly
used" so some of us are throwing the baby out with the bath water.

I have great regard for David Parnas and his opinions, but we do have a 
difference of opinion with respect to this issue.

Perhaps I am using the term "non-deterministic" incorrectly.  When interrupts
are used, it is not possible to pre-determine in exactly what sequence 
the statements of the software will be executed because the interrupt-handling
code can be executed at any time.  When using polling, the programmer has
more control over when the input-handling code is executed.  It is possible
to use priorities to ensure that the code to abort a missile launch is not 
interrupted, for example, but this just complicates things further and 
introduces the possibility of different types of errors.  At the least, 
limiting the possible execution sequences allows for more extensive testing 
given a fixed amount of testing resources.  It also allows for more reliable 
timing analysis as pointed out by someone in a previous posting to Risks.  Am 
I misunderstanding something here?

With respect to Therac, it is true that the errors were involved in 
multi-tasking and its poor implementation.  But the use of the "well-known
and well-understood ways of implementing multi-tasking" do not guarantee 
errors will not be introduced.  You are assuming that they would implement 
those features correctly.  Although I have great confidence that David 
Parnas or Edsgar Dijkstra could use ANY techniques with great skill, I 
have less confidence that this is true for all the programmers writing 
military software.  

David is obviously right that using recursive constructs is safer than 
implementing recursion oneself with stacks and backtracking.  But it would be 
safest (in terms of all types of potential faults including run-time 
stack overflows) to try to find a simple, non-recursive algorithm to 
accomplish the same thing.  If one does not exist, then the argument for
this should be included in the certification procedure.  It is easier to 
grant dispensations to standards when someone provides an argument that 
it is safer to do so than it is to try to check all software to ensure 
that superfluous complexity has not been introduced.  The person arguing 
to certify their software must then provide good arguments for introducing 
complexity rather than the certifier having to determine whether simpler 
designs exist.  Remember, we are talking about a potential nuclear 
armageddon here and with certifiers who may be no more knowledgeable 
than the programmers.  

David is also right that it is better to check for the presence of 
quality than the absence of features.  I would hope that standards would
require that quality be built-in and assessed and not just include these 
simple rules.  Unfortunately, I have no way of looking at a program, even 
a well-designed one, and guaranteeing that there are no errors in it.  I 
do have more confidence that people will make fewer mistakes when their 
programs are simpler and when they use techniques that rule out various 
common types of errors.  For example, if the design they choose does not 
involve the potential for deadlock, then I need not worry about it 
occurring.  If the man had carried his coin safely ensconced in his
wallet, he would not have had to look for it on either side of the street. 
Sure, as David says, "perfectly horrible real-systems have been written 
without any of these features."  That is exactly why such standards should 
contain more than just simplistic rules.  But that does not mean that 
rules are not also useful in the context of an imperfect world.

I guess our disagreement comes down to the following:  Assuming David's
belief that these techniques, properly used, can increase reliability, 
is it more likely that errors will be introduced (1) because they are 
improperly used or (2) because they are not used at all?  Until we have
experimental data on this, it remains a matter of personal opinion.

It would be nice if the people who introduce these programming techniques
and argue that they increase reliability would do comparative studies to 
confirm their claims.  This type of experimentation is very difficult
(as we have found out by trying to do it), but long overdue in our field.

I have great respect for Nancy Leveson's work and for the great effort she has
put into increase everyone's awareness of safety issues, but we continue to
have a difference of opinion here.

1)  In fact, hardware interrupts are simply hardware implemented polling
and the use of interrupts gives the programmer  control (because 
of more rapid response) than can usually be achieved by software polling.
Nancy's impression that the programmer loses control comes from the fact
that we often use interrupt response code written by others (operating
system code) and consequently feel that we have less control.  If we allowed
someone else to write the polling code, and the code to respond when 
an event was detected, we would be in exactly the same situation, except
that there would be a slower reaction time.  Both software polling and 
interrupt handling can be done badly and both can be done well. 

Edsger Dijkstra's 1968 papers showed how an interrupt handling system could be
set up in a way that the programmers could restrict the order of events as much
as they wish.  Moreover, the beauty of his approach was that most of the
software was unaffected by the choice between interrupts and software polling.
The P and V interface hid the difference between events detected by hardware
and those detected by software.  Twenty years later I meet people who are
called "software engineers" but have no knowledge of that work or understanding
of similar techniques.  Today's hardware and software technology would allow us
to do even better than was possible in 1968.

2) Nancy is wrong when she states that I am assuming that programmers would
implement those ideas correctly.  I have too much experience to make such an
assumption.  She could equally well be accused of assuming that programmers
will avoid those ideas "correctly".  There is no idea so good that it cannot be
used badly.  

3) No one is more in favour of the use of "simple algorithms than I.  My vitae
carries a quote from A.  Einstein, "Everything should be as simple as possible,
but not simpler".  Further, I don't even believe that there are such things as
recursive programs.  They are all iterative programs in disguise.  I do however
find that recursive descriptions of programs programs are often simpler, and
easier to verify, than iterative descriptions of the same algorithm.  We must
never forget the "but not simpler" phrase in Einstein's remark.

4) If Nancy thinks that the danger of deadlock is caused by multi-programming I
must also disagree.  Every program built using pseudo-parallel processes has an
equivalent "sequential program" that can exhibit exactly the same abortive
behaviour as its deadlocking counterpart.  If Nancy, thinking that deadlock is
impossible because there is no multi-programming, does not look for those
errors, she will just be surprised and dismayed when the program enters an
unending loop or a permanent idle state at unexpected times.

I believe that organisations such as MoD would be better advised to introduce
regulations requiring the use of certain good programming techniques, requiring
the use of highly qualified people, requiring systematic, formal, and detailed
documentation, requiring thorough inspection, requiring thorough testing, etc.
than to introduce regulations forbidding out the use of perfectly reasonable
techniques.

Like Nancy, I wish we had experimental data to confirm or disprove my belief in
the potential of these techniques but I don't expect to get such data.  Other
differences, such as the qualifications and interest of the personnell will
swamp the effect of the techniques that we are debating.  Safety depends
on the use of highly qualified, disciplined personnel for the design,
documentation and inspection of softwre.   By forbidding modern programming
techniques, we could drive those people away and achieve just the opposite.

Here is a story from FEDERAL COMPUTER WEEK, July 10, 1989, pages 10,11:

DOD TARGET SYSTEMS FACE IMPROVEMENT by Gary H. Anthes

The Defense Department plans to improve substantially its planning system
for the targeting of strategic nuclear weapons.  As a first step, it is
about to award a contract for a prototype system that would identify targets,
allocate weapons and specify the timing and modes of weapons delivery.

DOD hopes to reduce the planning-cycle time from 18 months to three days,
reduce personnel requirements by a factor of 10 and increase survivability
by a factor of eight (see chart, below).

The overhaul of the process by which the plans are developed and changed
during conflict reflects a shift away from large-scale use of nuclear weapons
against fixed targets to more limited conflicts involving mobile targets.
It also reflects recent presidential requests for more flexibility in the
use of nuclear weapons.

The project, called Survivable Adaptive Planning Experiment (SAPE), is being
funded jointly by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the
Air Force.  Prime bidders on the job are Harris Corp., McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and IBM Corp.

The United States' plan for nuclear warfare, called the Single Integrated
Operational Plan (SIOP), is produced annually under the direction of the
Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS), an element of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.  The plans are developed at the headquarters of the Strategic
Air Command in Omaha, Neb., using intelligence data, force-status information
and guidance from the president, the secretary of Defense and other
authorities. 

``The president decides in broad terms the types of options and results
he wants, and the JSTPS takes the guidance and produces the SIOP,'' said
Army Lt. Col. Peter W. Sowa, SAPE project manager at DARPA.

SAPE is not intended to replace the initial planning process.  Rather, it
is geared to enabling rapid adaptation of the plan before and during a nuclear
conflict while ensuring the survivability of the planning system.  Sowa
said: ``During a conflict, the situation will be different [from the one
anticipated] especially if tactical nuclear weapons are used.  Something
is sure to be different, so you want to be able to replan quickly.''

It now takes 18 months to create a new plan.  Although it could be done
faster, Sowa said, a completely new plan could not be developed in three
days, which is the SAPE goal.  Another SAPE goal is reducing the time required
to change targets and to configure the planning network.

Retargeting time is of growing importance as the Soviet ballistic missile
force becomes more mobile.  ``Planning to hold fixed targets at risk is
straightforward in concept but exquisitely complex in detail,'' the SAPE
statement of work says.  ``[But] when targets are capable of relocation
over short time periods, accomodating those changes into strategic attack
plans becomes enormously difficult.''

SAPE specifications require the ability to change 600 targets per day during
a nuclear conflict and to reduce the time required to change a target from
eight hours to three minutes.  The system also must be able to generate
plan options involving 2,000 weapons and up to 4,000 targets in 30 minutes.

These objectives can only be overcome by powerful hardware, smart software
and a high-speed communications network --- the cornerstones of SAPE.
According to Sowa, the system will consist of several mobile processing
clusters, each possibly consisting of a large mainframe or supercomputer,
data base machines, parallel processors, and workstations.  Each local cluster
will be able to execute the whole plan, and each will connect to a survivable
communications internetwork through a gateway.

The core software, most likely written in Ada and Lisp, will consist of
mathematical algorithms and artificial-intelligence techniques, Sowa said.
``It will be a software development effort and an expert-knowledge-building
effort.  A lot of interviewing experts will be needed.'' 

But the smart software will be of little use if the system is damaged during
hostilities.  By using redundant, distributed and mobile parts, DARPA aims
to increase the system's tolerance to loss from 10 percent to 83 percent
and its communications connectivity during a conflict from 10 percent to
50 percent.

According to Sowa, the benefits of the more flexible SIOPs include the
following: 

	o Enhanced deterrence through the ability to hit mobile targets.

	o More efficient use of weapons.  ``If you don't shoot at empty
	  holes, you don't need as many weapons,'' Sowa said.

	o Smarter wargaming.  The system could be used to conduct what-if
	  analyses - predicting the effects of different options --- as
	  part of planning or negotiating processes.

Sowa said SAPE, which will require $20 million to $30 million over five
years, is a demonstration project and is not intended to field a system.
Some or all may be deployed, or the existing system might be enhanced in
some other way, he said.

A contract will be awarded in about a month, and it will call for the design
and development of an engineering development model.  The model must be
able to rapidly retarget and generate new options in an environment before
a nuclear conflict.  In subsequent phases, the model will be expanded to
include those functions needed during a nuclear conflict and to create a
new nuclear strike plan at the end of hostilities.

&gt;  [...]  Airbus [doesn't agree.  They think their stuff is great and saves
&gt;weight and can't fail; but]... the A320 does have a partial backup system: 

   "Can't fail"?  This is pretty amusing.  It's my understanding (possibly
incorrect) that Airbus made this same argument about the A-320 control
system before the manual backup systems were in place.  The US FAA indicated
that the A-320 would not be certified without those backups, no matter how
reliable Airbus claimed the fly-by-wire system to be.  Airbus gave in.  
During flight tests, the "can't fail" system suffered a total failure, and 
the A-320 prototype was flown using "peanut" self-powered flight instruments 
and the back-up manual controls (this event was reported in Aviation Week).

    Airbus reports that the failure was a freak, they've fixed the problem,
and that it won't ever happen again.  Now it really can't fail.  Right.  Do
we know that their analysis can't fail... again?

&gt;No matter how desperately he or shell hauls back on that sidestick, the
&gt;envelope protection system will not let the airplane respond beyond a certain
&gt;rate: namely, the rate that limits stress on the airframe to... 2.5G.

   This is indeed a problem.  There are situations where the crew may elect
to damage the airframe in return for avoiding a worse alternative.  The
protection system will not let them do this.  It's not clear whether we'll
lose more people from not having such a system or because of it.  One point
worth considering is that second generation fly-by-wire systems for fighters
are now being designed to allow maneuvering beyond critical alpha as the
disadvantages (high drag, loss of airspeed, structural risk) may allow the
pilot to shoot first and thus survive.

   [re: the 747 loss of control incident]
&gt;Airbus, not surprisingly, responds that an A320 never would have [entered the
&gt;dive] in the first place. 

   This contention may be incorrect.  The flight control laws prevent a 
pilot from deliberatly maneuvering the aircraft to a control departure, but 
they don't prevent one from occuring under all conditions.  

   As part of a previous job, I occasionally flew an advanced cockpit flight 
simulator.  I was curious as to the flight limits, and found them rather 
rapidly.  The flight control laws would not allow me to roll the airplane 
beyond 70 degrees of bank.  It seemed obvious to me that an aerodynamic 
departure could result in a maneuver that would exceed the control law 
limits.  I brought the aircraft to the limiting angle of attack, then 
reduced thrust on one engine to idle.  The resulting asymmetric thrust 
produced a rolling moment that caused the aircraft to exceed the control 
limits by a considerable margin.  This is virtually the same situation as 
occured on the 747 mentioned above, and could conceivably occur on an Airbus 
aircraft with control-law limits.

   One more anecdote:  Several years ago an Air Florida 737 crashed into the
Potomac River.  One of the contributing causes was faulty engine power
indication.  The crew believed that maximum power was being applied, but their
indications showed considerably more power was being generated than was
actually being produced.  There was nothing preventing them from advancing the
power levels beyond the "max power" setting other than training that
predisposed them to not do this.  It is now regarded as correct procedure to
exceed such limits in an emergency if doing so might save the aircraft.  You
can always replace the engines after the emergency landing.  If you would have
crashed without such power application, the engines (among other things) would
be lost anyway.  If they fail from excessive power application, well, you were
going to crash anyway.  This is, after all, an effort of last resort.

   It is a classic error to design systems to handle the majority of cases
correctly but omit the handing of limit cases.  Advanced systems are intended
to increase safety and efficiency.  It would be an error to design-out
application of control in limit cases that might be necessary to save lives.

There has recently been some considerable discussion of the potential risks
associated with 'fly by wire' systems in airplanes, and the way in which the
electronics prevent excursions outside a pre-defined `performance envelope'.
This sort of thing is not only found in planes - there are now on the market
(in the United Kingdom at least, not sure about the States) quite a number of
high performance automobiles which do much the same thing.

Examples are: electronic monitoring of turbocharger boost/charge temperature
to prevent detonation, monitoring of engine speed (prevents overspeed),
control of auto transmissions (to prevent shifts to low gears at high
road speeds) etc.

Most of these limitations are done to prevent possibly hazardous and damaging
operation of the vehicle, others are done to comply with the national or
regional restrictions on exhaust emissions, or to adapt to the local fuel
octane availability.  They do, in many cases, mean that the vehicle is also
operated well within its design limitations, hence helping to reduce
manufacturers warranty claims.

There are several organisations in Europe which have, by devious means, gained
access to the control programs of these microprocessors (either by
disassembling, or by blatant and unashamed bribery of the software writers) and
are thus able to modify the software and produce what they then sell as
`Superchips' that, for a couple of hundred pounds and ten minutes effort with a
chip-puller, can transform the performance of an already rapid car - examples
given in UK literature are as follows::

   Sierra/Merkur Cosworth - 388 brake horsepower
   Volvo turbos - 280 brake horsepower
   Mazda 323    - 180 brake horsepower
   Nissan 300ZX - 370 brake horsepower
   SAAB turbos  - 280 brake horsepower.

Now apart from the potential hazards of improperly programmed microprocessors
leading to the destruction of engines/transmissions due to excessive stress
that the manufacturer/designer did not forsee, i wonder about the legal
position of the car should you be involved in an accident. Cars in Europe have
to be 'Type approved', that is to say, there are national testing authorities
who oversee the safety of production cars and prevent the sale or import of
those vehicles that fail to reach certain standards.  Any modifications to a
type-approved vehicle should strictly only incorporate parts that have been
themselves type-approved.  In this context, 'software' is a rather tenuous
'part', again lawyers lagging decades behind technology.....  There are, as far
as i am aware, no provisions for policing the status of on-board software, nor
to prevent its alteration.  Since the changes are visually undetectable (who
walks round their local friendly used car lot with a signature analyser and an
EPROM blower in their pocket?)  it would be very hard to spot, either by the
licensing authorities, or the insurers who may be asked to meet claims
resulting from accidents.

Don't any of you think i am against the enhancement of performance of vehicles
- i want my 70-90 acceleration times to be as short as is humanly possible (and
anyone who has driven the motorway network here will agree on that!), its just
that i can forsee potential problems in the future (like what is the risk if
you sell such a modified vehicle and fail to disclose the modifications and the
purchaser then smashes himself up - can he sue you for failing to tell him
about the changes???)

Kevin Mitnick is the hacker once called "as dangerous with a keyboard as a bank
robber with a gun."  (See RISKS 7.95, 8.1, 8.3, 8.43, 8.65, 8.70, and 8.76.)

His first plea bargain was rejected by U.S. District Judge Mariana R.
Pfaelzer as too lenient.  He subsequently reached a new agreement, with no
agreed-upon prison sentence, in which pleaded guilty to stealing a DEC
security program and illegal possession of 16 long-distance telephone codes
belonging to MCI Telecommunications Corp.  If convicted of all counts,
Mitnick faced a maximum sentence of 20 years and a fine of $750,000.  

According to a story by Henry Weinstein in the 18 July 1989 'Los Angeles
Times', Judge Pfaelzer said Monday that she will sentence Mitnick to a year
in a rehabilitation center, where he can be treated for his "addiction."
It is believed to be the first time a person indicted for a computer
hacking - related crime will be treated as an addict.

Harriet Rossetto, the director of the rehabilitation center said that
Mitnick would benefit from the program.  She said that Mitnick's "hacking
gives a sense of self-esteem he doesn't get in the real world.... This is a
new and growing addiction .  There was no greed involved.  There was no
sabotage involved.... He's like a kid playing Dungeons and Dragons."

Asst. U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger told Pfaelzer that he was amenable to
the rehabilitation plan, in part because Mitnick has cooperated extensively
with the government in its case against DiCicco, Mitnick's one-time friend
who turned him in.  Asperger said that Mitnick had turned out to be
considerably less harmful than the government had originally thought,
particularly since he not broken into DEC's computer system out of malice
or to make money.

Judge Pfaelzer said she will rule today on whether Mitnick should serve any
additional prison time, beyond the seven months he has so far spent in
federal custody.  DiCicco still faces one federal charge of illegally
transporting a stolen program (!).

In today's copy of "The Times" (of London), there is a sketchy description of
problems which arose from the country's first flotation on the stock exchange
of a building society.  [For the benefit of non-UK readers, a "building
society" is an organisation whose purpose is to collect deposits from its
members; pay them interest on the money; provide mortgages secured on property
and collect the interest due on the loan.  Sort of like a bank, but more
restricted in what it can and cannot do.  I forget the name of the US
analogue.]  It is only recently that building societies have become allowed to
raise finance by public flotation and there has been much heated debate about
the morality of the operation.  In particular, people with accounts at the
Abbey National Building Society were guaranteed cheap shares at the flotation.
Lloyds Bank, who handled the flotation, are the third largest bank in the UK --
certainly *not* a tin-pot outfit.

The following is from "The Times", Tuesday 18 July 1989.


	Compensation offer for Abbey delay.

   Lloyds Bank Registrars are offering to compensate 120,000 Abbey shareholders
whose share certificates and return cheques have been held up in the post.
This group suffered because their addresses were jumbled up by the computer,
which was unable to read addresses with more than five lines.  It was
originally thought no more than 10,000 people were affected by this error, but
it emerged last night that 120,000 people are involved.

   The Abbey National has already said it will back-date -- to Wednesday, July
12 -- delayed cheques that are returning sums over-paid for shares, if they are
paid into an Abbey National Account.  But many would-be share owners say they
have borrowed large sums to buy shares and the delay in returning cheques is
costing them missed interest and also interest on loans.  All Abbey members who
applied for more than 600 shares at 130p were scaled down to 775 shares.  As a
result, some people who made massive applications are awaiting the return of
hefty cheques.

   Mr Charles Wootton, a member of the Abbey National Protest Group, who
applied for 100,000 shares at a cost of \pounds 130,000 [[approximately US$
200k]], said that he had lost interest on the money taken out of a higher
interest account.  "They have had our money for an awfully long time", he said.

   It is unprecedented for Lloyds Bank Registrars to offer compensation for a
bungled share allocation, but a Lloyds spokesman said: "The scale of the thing
was unprecedented".

   Lloyds is writing to the 120,000 people whose addresses were jumbled by the
computer asking if they had any special problems.  Each compensation claim will
be dealt with individually on its own merits.  Lloyds will want proof that a
loan was outstanding against the cash used to apply for shares.

   There is no question of any compensation for the slide in the Abbey share
price from a brief high on the first day's trading of 161p to 145p yesterday.


[I wonder what 120,000 personal letters and investigations are going to
cost....  
                                        Paul Leyland]

TOWN HALL'S COMPUTER SNAGS TROUBLE OAP'S    [OCL. Old Age Pensioners]
[From the Kensington and Chelsea Times, a [very] local newspaper]

    Many private tenants in Kensington &amp; Chelsea are living in poverty as
a result of the council's inability to cope with its housing benefit work-
load, claims Kensington &amp; Chelsea "Put for the Elderly".

   "Everyone who claims housing benefit must fill-in a new benefic appli-
cation form every year", says the group. "If the application is not received 
by the Housing Benefit Office within four weeks, a reminder is sent-out and
if this is ignored, housing benefit is stopped."
   "However, in Kensington &amp; Chelsea, payment is bein gstopped because council
staff are unable to feed the information into the computer quickly enough.
There is a huge backing of such information waiting to be logged into the
computer's memory."
   It is alleged that Housing Benefit payments have been stopped for "hundreds"
of people while their re-applications wait to be dealt-with. "It can be weeks
before payments resume."
   "This is particularly hard on senior citizens who are known as society's
most conscientious bill-payers. Many older people will go without, rather
than get into debt."
   The Royal Borough Council admits that there is a problem, and expresses
its intention to remedy the situation. "There has been a backlog but we
hope to have the situation under control by the end of the month".
   A report by the Royal Borough Council's Benefit Working Party analyses
the reasons for the build-up of work in the benefit's division:
" The computer is not powerful enough to cope with the heavy demands that are
being placed upon it. Consequently, the officers are struggling to process
assessments sufficiently quickly to match incoming work.
There have been a number of computer crashes in recent months, resulting
in a lot of 'down' time."

    The report continues:
"The computer software developed a fault which resulted in our inability
to produce the weekly notification letters that have to be sent to the
claimants. This continued for some eight weeks during March and April this
year, and meant that when the fault was rectified, there was a large
backlog of letters produced.
   "Statuory case reviews have brought about large numbers of claims being
processed. Between April 1988 and March 1989 it was not possible to undertake
these reviews because of computer difficulties.

I have three anecdotes related to this topic.

First:

A personal experience several years ago suggests General Motors enforces 
the "performance envelope" on its cars. 

While descending a steep mountain grade in a 1981 Chevrolet Cavalier using 
engine braking to control speed, the automatic transmission shifted into 
second gear even though the gearshift lever remained locked in first gear.  

The engine speed was near the "yellow line" when it shifted, so I suspect 
this was a feature intended to prevent engine damage.  The behavior was 
reproducible.

I had left GM for my present job and didn't ask my GM contacts about it.  

In this case, I had good brakes.  What if the brakes had failed? 

Second:

I heard of an incident several years ago where electronic component failure 
caused a vehicle to exceed the design envelope.  During quality assurance 
testing at an assembly plant (on dynamometer rollers), a cruise control 
component failure caused wide-open throttle and loss of brakes.  The 
technician cut the ignition before the engine destroyed itself. 

The design problem was apparently fixed before it recurred.

I wasn't present when this happened so I'd rather not name the company or 
plant, but the story was reported by individuals I trust to have the facts. 

Third:

Bootleg PROMs exist in North America, too.  Some auto company engineers 
have mentioned programming them for personal use.

I'm puzzled as to what Nancy Leveson means when she uses the term
``non-deterministic".  Leveson seems to be arguing that any program with hidden
side effects is non-deterministic. The dangerous techniques she mentions,
distributed processing, interrupts, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, have
in common an effect on program state that are not exposed in the program text.
That is, to verify a recursive subroutine written in Pascal, one needs to also
verify the stack management methods of the compiler, and the memory limits of
the machine. As the entire Hoare/Floyd etc. approach to verification is based
on reasoning about program text, these techniques can pose problems for the
verification method. I have 4 critiques of this analysis (3 technical, 1
horrified):
	1. The inability of a verification system to handle a programming
	technique does not imply that the technique is at fault. The
	verification method might just be too weak.
	2. Even if we give up all these very useful techniques, there are
	still hidden side effects in programs, especially real-time
	programs,  which cannot be deduced from the program text. Subroutine
	call stacks may overflow, even  without recursion,  and access to 
	statically allocated memory is not necessarily uniform ( suppose
	that  A[i] is compiled to a single machine operation 
	for i &lt; 256 and requires segments and some other mess for i &gt;255).
	3. Hidden side effects != non-deterministic. A non-deterministic
	system can react to one input in more than one way --- there is
	no way, even in principle, to deduce output from input. But, even
	poorly written programs are deterministic --- the same environment
	will cause the same execution trace. Am I confused here, or is
	non-determinism being used in some other way.
	4.  If X (name your favorite agency or company)
	is going to have the gall to develop programs that
	might kill millions of people when they fail,  e.g. nuclear reactor
	control programs or  missile control programs,  then X should at 
	least have the decency to hire the best  programmers for the
	job and have the entire system checked out by technically
	competent experts ( at least several independant certifications
	would also seem reasonable)
	Leveson seems to be saying that since military programmers, 
	and the people who certify military programs 
	are sometimes bad, we should force them to use very simple
	programming methods. The following quote (from Leveson)
	gave me the shakes.	
	&gt;Although I have great confidence that David 
	&gt;Parnas or Edsgar Dijkstra could use ANY techniques with great skill, I 
	&gt;have less confidence that this is true for all the programmers writing 
	&gt;military software.  
	...
	&gt;Remember, we are talking about a potential nuclear 
	&gt;armageddon here and with certifiers who may be no more knowledgeable 
	&gt;than the programmers.  
	
	The rational approach here is to send a check to SANE (CND for
	Brits), not to try to forbid recursion.

[Forwarder's Note: The following is a statement by a close friend, who wishes
to remain anonymous but asked me to forward this statement to risks.  His
comments do not apply to his current employer, and any identification of him
might generate misunderstandings.  My friend does read RISKS, and any personal
replies may be addressed to me and I will relay them.
                              					Tim]

I have some experience in working in a RISKy (non-aerospace, non-military)
branch of the software industry, and for this reason I have read with interest
and increasing concern the debate in risks over UK Defence Software Standard.

My concerns are not so much with the standard itself, as with the academic
viewpoint reflected in the arguments stated there and their broader
implications for those of us who worry about software quality in the real
day-to-day world.  The basis of my concern is the assumption that either all
software engineers working on RISKy projects would understand well such
concepts as recursion, multi-tasking, and dynamic memory allocation, or that
only people with these qualifications would be assigned to work on such
projects.

I do not have the academic credentials of Professor Parnas, but I do have
a number of years of experience in QA and Test of software in the real world.
I have been responsible for the evaluation of well over 100 pieces of software.
Only a small fraction of the engineers working these projects
understood well the nuances of the methods listed above.

Most of them have never heard of Dijkstra, and of the few who have, none
to my reasonably accurate knowledge have ever read anything he has written.
Many of them have only high school diplomas or AA degrees in electronics.
The point I am trying to make here is that, rightly or wrongly, the real
world does not reflect the academic one in these areas.  In my experience,
the aerospace companies generally have much better educated software engineers,
but even there, many of them have not been to school in over 20 years.

For this reason, I think that instructing or allowing the average software
enginner in industry to use some of these techniques in life-critical
applications is a lot like putting a loaded 45 into the hands of a child.
Thus, in my humble and very pragmatic opinion, statements by Professor
Parnas such as:

&gt;   Nor, would I agree that non-determinism is bad.  Non-determinism has been
&gt;   demonstrated by Dijkstra (and much earlier by Robert Floyd) to allow
&gt;   programs that are much more easily verified than some deterministic ones.

&gt;   I believe that organisations such as MoD would be better advised
&gt;   to introduce regulations requiring the use of certain good
&gt;   programming techniques, requiring the use of highly qualified
&gt;   people, requiring systematic, formal, and detailed documentation,
&gt;   requiring thorough inspection, requiring thorough testing, etc.
&gt;   than to introduce regulations forbidding out the use of perfectly
&gt;   reasonable techniques. 

To be very naive.

 Professor Parnas has experience with aerospace, but in many other software
industries with life-critical applications things are much worse.  These
industries would hire people with the kind of qualifications he discusses were
they available.  The fact of the matter is that the people are simply not
there.  Thus it seems to me that the best approach to take is to develop
standards designed to work with the present environment, rather than try to
build standards designed to work in the environment that should be.

Comments to me may be made via Dr. Shimeall.  Thank you for considering the
views of one eminently less qualified on academic grounds.  These opinions are
my own, and are not the opinions of either Dr. Shimeall or my present or
previous employers, both of whom would be very upset to find that I had
expressed them in public.

A comment on the "interrupt vs. polling" debate, if I may.
I submit that which is better is very much a matter of perspective; and 
further, that the perspective is scenario or (environment) dependent.

If one takes the point of view of the "operating system kernel" looking
from inside ONE processor, out to the world, AND *IF* that world is
simple and small, and *docile*, then polling is very straightforward.
Using Prof. Einstein's rule [... simple as possible, but no more ...]
perhaps then polling is to be preferred, in those cases.

However, as the world [system] grows larger, more complex, and less
well behaved, polling becomes enormously more complex.  Not the least
of the problems is, what algorithms does one use, when and how,
to handle emergencies [call them "interrupts" is you wish] that occur
randomly, in such a way that the priority of handling them MUST change?

Example: In a tactical combat system, implemented on several processors,
distributed among several sites (with at least 2 but at most say 7
processors per site), a normal goal is to share messages in real time;
under fire, however, most especially when one or more processors at any
given site may suffer damage, priority swiftly shifts towards defending
oneself; i.e., the "data link" module becomes somewhat less important than
the "track and shoot" modules.  However, since coordinated fire is often
more effective than "self defense" fire, some link should be maintained.

Perhaps we can learn from successful (?) systems significantly more complex
than those we seek to build; e.g., ourselves.  SOME of our sensors usually do
polling; e.g., our eyes; occasionally we get interrupted by flashes of light;
but more often, we scan the scene.  However, our ears most often operate on
interrupts.  And our brains use adequate algorithms to process and correlate
those diverse data.

In risks 9.5, Dave Parnas writes:
&gt;The non-determinism associated with interrupt handling comes from the unknown
&gt;timing of the external events and is not affected by the replacement of
&gt;interrupts with polling.

Much of the variation in interrupt handling comes from other operating
system processing, such as (in modern computer systems) page-faulting
and job/swap/memory management.  Also, in very modern systems, the hardware
instruction and data cache mechanisms introduce additional variation.
This is true in all aspects of interrupt processing: not just in the
response time as measured in the user's program.

It should also be noted that there are "real-time" operating systems
that are carefully designed to allow interrupt-driven I/O with minimal
variation.  Variation caused by the system itself (for example
"uninterruptable" instruction sequences for managing system queues)
is still a problem, however.
 
&gt; If, because I am forbidden to
&gt;use recursion, I write a complex program that does the stacking and
&gt;backtracking hidden by recursion, I am likely to introduce more errors than
&gt;were present in the compiler's well-tested implementation of recursion.

Perhaps, but these are usually the kinds of bugs that are caught during
initial testing.  "Recursion bugs" in bounded systems are often not
caught, but discovered when some combination of data causes the stack
to overflow into another variable's (or task's) data storage.  One "real-time"
system that I developed had a stack boundary check routine in its "idle
task." (This was *not* a safety-critical system, by the way.) [Confession: I
added these checks after taking Nancy Leveson's Software Safety seminar.]

&gt;Similarly, if I introduce busy waiting and polling in my programs because I
&gt;cannot use interrupts, I may again make things worse rather than better.
 
Good software engineering will make low-level mechanisms (I/O strategies)
invisible to the high-level programs.  On Unix, for example, device drivers
log errors by calling a printf() function that busy-waits output to the
console.  The format of that function is identical to the interrupt-driven
printf() that normal user programs call.

There is a rumour going round in the South of France (French Riviera) 
concerning telephone technicians servicing grouping boxes, and since
"there is never smoke without a fire", I believe it has to be taken seriously.

	The technician traces a friend's line and calls him. He then connects
the line to someone else's line, and tells his friend that he can phone free
for the next 30 minutes. As a result, that person can call free of charge.
The person who pays is the owner of the other line. After the 30 minutes,
the techinician interrupts the conversation, and eventually connects his
friend's line to another line, etc. etc. 
        The bills received by the people paying for the conversation are only
slightly higher than usual and the whole thing goes un-noticed. But the
word spread round, and it seems that the trick has gone out of hand. Normal
users are complaining of being often cut-off, or having a third person joining
in their conversation, and of varying phone bills.
        The answer from the French Telecom, is to ask for itemised bills.
And believe me, it comes as a shock when your bill says that you've been
calling St. Bartholomew and you don't even know where it is !

There have been a couple of postings about the series of New Yorker articles by
Paul Brodeur recently. I happen to work (as a researcher) in the area of
electric and magnetic fields (EMF) risks.  (The use of the term "radiation" by
Brodeur is a complete misnomer, by the way - he's talking about fields.)  I'm
not a health effects researcher - my field is risk communication and public
policies for risk management. Anyway, I would like to pass along a couple of
comments.

The first comment is that no one really knows at this point whether there are
risks (i.e., adverse health effects) from EMF.  Scientific investigation in
this field is very complex and difficult.  There have been a lot of flawed
studies (with both positive and negative results.) There are clearly
demonstrated biological effects, but no one knows whether these cause health
effects. (The alternative is that the body adjusts to the biological effects,
or that they are somehow unimportant.) There is certainly reason for sufficient
concern to continue to fund research, although money has been hard to come by
in this area as a rule. A little more support seems to be forthcoming recently.

Second, Brodeur's descriptions of the ways scientists have supposedly "cooked"
their data to suit the preferences of funding sources are, in large part, B.S.
Not that none of this has ever occurred - it has, and on both sides of the
issue. But it is the exception, not the rule by any means. There are some good
scientists working in this area, and they are men and women of high integrity.
Their's are the results worth taking seriously, and fortunately they are
getting the lion's share of the funding these days.

The third thing, in case it's not obvious to anyone who read the articles, is
that Brodeur is anything but an unbiased observer.  He has reached his own
conclusions, and is seemingly out to convince people no matter what it requires
saying. Notice that, for example, according to him it's only the scientists who
come up with negative results (on health effects) who are cooking their data. I
would caution net readers against relying on these articles as your sole source
of information if you have a serious interest in this topic. If you do, send me
email if you want recommendations for other sources.)

BTW, despite my reservations about the Brodeur articles, the most recent
posting to the net on this topic (sorry, I don't have the name handy) did pick
out some interesting points from them.

I have some real problems with Gordon Hester's recent attack on Paul Brodeur's
series of articles in The New Yorker on the hazards of electromagnetic
radiation.

Hester writes:

	The use of the term "radiation" by Brodeur is a complete
	misnomer, by the way - he's talking about fields.

Anyone who's taken a high school physics course knows that this is bull --
electromagnetic radiation IS radiation, whether it's ELF 60 Hz radiation from
power lines, or X-rays from nuclear reactions.  The only difference is
wavelength (or frequency, or energy, which are different ways of expressing the
same thing).  Calling them "fields," and avoiding the term "radiation," is an
attempt to mislead the unwary, to put some good "spin" on the story.  Sure, you
can discuss the electric and magnetic fields separately, but it is NOT a
misnomer by any means to refer to the subject as radiation.

Hester's piece was the second I read today from CMU.  The first was a booklet
by M. Granger Morgan, also of the Dept. of Engineering &amp; Public Policy,
entitled, "Electric and Magnetic Fields from 60 Hertz Electric Power:  What do
we know about possible health risks?"  The booklet was mentioned in the July
issue of the IEEE Spectrum, and is for sale by CMU for $3.

The booklet also goes to great pains never to use the word "radiation" in
connection with electric power lines, except to say that it's not like X-rays
or other forms of "ionizing radiation" (quotes in the original).  It also tries
to discount epidemiological data that establishes a correlation between ELF
radiation and cancers and birth defects, by saying that just because a rooster
crows in the morning when the temperature is rising doesn't mean that the
rooster CAUSED the temperature to rise.

There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of the Dept. of Engineering
and Public Policy at CMU to lobby the public that there's nothing to get
excited about here, that scientists don't all agree on the interpretation of
the data and that therefore we should follow a "prudent" course (they use that
word a lot), by which they mean no government regulation at all, just maybe you
should put your electric blanket back on the shelf in the closet.

To understand why an academic institution would go to such lengths to try to
dampen public interest in the health risks of ELF radiation, I had to read the
fine print in the front of the booklet, where I discovered that the research
was supported, and the production costs of the booklet paid for, by the
Electric Power Research Institute, a lobbying arm of the electric power
industry in this country.

Quoted, from the 18th July editon of the London "Daily Telegraph".

            Customs 'lose' 35.6 million wine bottles

Customs officials admitted yesterday that their computers had "lost" 35,600,000
bottles of wine, destroying the reliability of figures on how much wine Britons
are drinking.  "We never dreamed the error by Customs could be so enormous,"
said Mr.  Alastair Eadie, chairman of the Wine and Spirit Association, which
queried returns dating back to the start of last year.

It emerges that the computers developed such a liking for wine that they kept
millions of bottles to themselves. Figures were entered correctly, but not
released when needed to compile statistics.  All wines, apart from small
quantities made at home by enthusiasts as a hobby, have to go into bonded
warehouses so duty can be charged on them before they are sold. That is why
records are kept on computer by the tax collectors.

At the start of last year, Customs and Excise updated its computer methods and
something went wrong. "All the information went in but not all of it came out
again," it was stated.  It did not mean that vast quantities of wine escaped
duty. That was correctly paid whenever supplies were drawn from bond. It meant
sales were grossly understated when official returns were issued at the end of
each month.  The trade relies on these figures for a nationwide picture of how
sales are going.

Wine merchants became suspicious as official figures showed sales declining
when shop returns suggested otherwise. And the monthly statistics started to
suffer delays, being issued later and later.  "What's gone wrong?" the
Association asked. Now they have the answer.

The correction means that wine drinking in Britain rose by more than 3% instead
of declining 1% as originally reported by Customs.  "This is splendid news,"
said Mr. Eadie. "And the provisional data for the first quarter of 1989 shows a
rise of nearly 5 and-a-half percent compared with the first quarter of last
year."  Sales of sparkling wines, which includes champagne, alone increased by
22% "Three months is scarcely enough to suggest a trend for 1989 as a whole but
they make a fine start." Mr. Eadie said. "Wine trade prospects have definitely
brightened considerably."

Confessed computer hacker Kevin Mitnick was sentenced Tuesday to 1 year in
prison, followed by three years of "supervised release," the first six months
of which will be spent in a residential psychological counseling program,
according to an article by Henry Weinstein in the ' Los Angeles Times' 19 July
1989.  The 7.5 months Mitnick has spent in custody while charges were pending
against him will be credited against his one-year prison sentence.

Prosecutor Asst. U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said, " We think it's a very
fair sentence.  The sentence shows computer hacking is serious business that
can result in jail time."

&gt;	o Enhanced deterrence through the ability to hit mobile targets.

Unless the Soviets have developed mobile cities this is not deterrence.  This
is "counterforce".  This is "first strike".  One of the RISKS of developing
such technology is that in a potential East-West conflict situation the
opposing forces might implement a "use them or lose them" strategy with respect
to their delivery vehicles (as they would say in the DoD).

There is a RISK in *BECOMING DEPENDENT* on technology, instead of 
merely using it for efficiency and convenience.  (Imagine not having 
ATMs anymore and having to run to the bank before it closes.)

From RISKS-DIGEST 9.4:
&gt; Unspecified hardware problems caused 104 brief failures in a new ...
&gt; An emergency technical crew was FLOWN IN [emphasis mine] from  New Jersey 
&gt; and worked all night Monday to correct the problem.  

Wouldn't it have been funny if we REALLY NEEDED the TRACON working in order to
fly in to California?  Then the emergency crew might have had to take AMTRAK...

From the "Rumor Roundup" column in DIGITAL REVIEW (trade newspaper that tracks
DEC doings) of 17 July 1989:

    My DEC friends tell me that DEC employees now have a special way
    of traveling back in time.  It seems that a memo on the internal
    electronic bulletin board goes on at great length about how to
    take advantage of a loophole in the rules governing domestic
    discount airfares.  By booking the return flight as the departing
    flight, and the departing flight as the return flight, the airline
    computer system thinks the traveler is staying over the weekend. 
    Apparently, the reservations program does not understand that
    people have to leave before they can return.

A security hole has been found in SunOS restore.  This problem affects
SunOS 4.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.3 systems.  It does not appear in SunOS 3.5.
The problem occurs because restore is setuid to root.  Without going
into details, is sufficient to say that this is a serious hole.  All
SunOS 4.0 installations should install this workaround.  Note that a
user does need to have an existing account to exploit this hole.

There are two workarounds that will fix the problem.  The first is
slightly more secure but has some side-effects.  

1) Make restore non-setuid by becoming root and doing a 
chmod 750 /usr/etc/restore

This makes restore non-setuid and unreadable and unexecutable by
ordinary users.

Making restore non-setuid affects the restore command using a remote
tape drive.  You will no longer be able to run a restore from another
machine as an ordinary user; instead, you'll have be root to do so.
(The reason for this is that the remote tape drive daemon on the
machine with the tape drive expects a request on a TCP privileged
port.  Under SunOS, you can't get a privileged port unless you are
root.  By making restore non-setuid, when you run restore and request
a remote tape drive, restore won't be able to get a privileged port,
so the remote tape drive daemon won't talk to it.)

2) If you do need to have some users run restore from remote tape
drives without being root, you can use the following workaround.

cd /usr/etc
chgrp operator restore
chmod 4550 restore

This allows the use of restore by some trusted group.  In this case,
we used the group 'operator', but you may substitute any other group
that you trust with access to the tape drive.  Thus, restore is still
setuid and vulnerable, but only to the people in the trusted group.

The 4550 makes restore readable and executable by the group you
specified, and unreadable by everyone else.

Sun knows about this problem (Sun Bug 1019265) and will put in a more
permanent fix in a future release of SunOS.

[From the Seattle Weekly, 5/3/89]

PUT A CONDOM ON YOUR COMPUTER

Every worry that your computer might be hanging out in a network where it
will pick up some disgusting virus?  Empirical Research Systems of Tacoma
suggests you supply it with one of their "computer condoms".  This high-tech
prophylactic is a combination of hardware and software embodied in a
controller card that simply replaces the one already in the machine.  Rick
Cummings, the company's president, says the system "stops all viruses" by
monitoring the user network, the keyboard, and the program in use.  He notes
that the system is programmable to alter the parameters of its control on
any given machine, but he guarantees that, "when programmed to your
requirements, it will not allow viruses to enter."

The technology was developed through successful efforts to protect a group of
European banks from the massive virus that penetrated European computer
networks last autumn.  "Naturally these became our first orders," Cummings
says.  He has since picked up an additional 2500 firm orders in Europe, with
5000 more contingent on inspection of the product.  In the United States, the
product has been reviewed by Boeing Computer Services and computer technicians
at the UW.  It will be on the domestic market "early next autumn at a cost of
under $1000," Cummings says.

The 7/27/89 Boston Herald reports that Robert T. Morris has been indicted on
a single felony count of accessing without authorization at least six (!!)
university and military computers.  He therefore becomes the first person to
be charged under the "Computer Fraud and Abuse act of 1986", a dubious honor
at best. If convicted he faces a possible prison sentence of 5 years and a
possible $250,000 fine.

You precisely underline the risk involved - that the software engineers
working on life-critical might not be trained in "modern software
engineering".

One does not have to be an academic computer scientist to understand
recursion, dynamic memory allocation, multi-tasking, and interrupts.
One does not have to be an academic computer scientist to use them, or
to decide not to use them.

However, decisions to use or not use such techniques must be informed,
and made from knowledge, not ignorance. Turning one's back on new
techniques because they are risky in the hands of untrained people is
not the answer - training them in the new techniques is.

Yes, training people in software engineering is an expensive business
- it also takes time, and is an ongoing process. But if someone
involved in RISKy projects is not a top-flight software engineer,
isn't that a serious risk to the project? And to the lives that may
depend on it?

The terms software engineering and software engineer have clearly gotten
completely out of control if people with AA degrees or less are calling
themselves software engineers.  It is my understanding that the ABET takes
a very strong stand on who should be allowed to call themselves an engineer.
If I remember correctly, they say that the term should only be applied to
those who have one of the following qualifications:

  1) People who have passed a state professional engineering examination.

  2) People who have graduated from an accredited 4-year engineering program.

  3) People who have graduate degrees.

In the past, I have had a fairly negative feeling towards this strict rule.
As a professor of computer science in the liberal arts college of a large
university, I've always had the feeling that it discriminated against graduates
of my program in favor of graduates of similar programs that happen (usually
for historical reasons) to be in engineering colleges.

I feel strongly enough about the misapplication of the term software engineer
that, if things continue to develop the way they are currently developing, I
would even be willing to urge state regulation of the use of the designation.

Consider an analogy:  The people who design the power distribution system for
a power plant are electrical engineers.  They have college degrees in
electrical engineering, they are usually fairly senior, and they usually have
state professional engineering certificates.  The people who build the power
distribution system are electricians working under the supervision of an
electrical engineer.  They may have AA degrees in engineering technology, and
they have passed a state or local electricians examination.

I do not object to someone with an AA degree in software technology helping to
write the software to control that power plant, but I do object to their
billing themselves as a software engineer, and I do object if the power company
puts them in charge of the design of such software.  This appears to be
precisely what is happening today.

I have enjoyed the recent arguments about polling and interrupts that were
kindled by the UK defense software standards debate, but I have found them to
be incomplete.

I have written real-time software, I have worked on the design of real-time
multiprocessors, and this summer, I have even spent far too many hours counting
cycles, but I also like interrupts.

When I was involved with the Modcomp User's Group, and again, when I worked for
Rockwell International, I met many strong advocates of the view taken by the UK
software standards.  Most of them were older programmers who hadn't heard of
Dijkstra but had years of experience making reasonably complex real-time
systems work reasonably well.

Their arguments usually boiled down to the following:  When a program is
constructed as a single main polling loop and all action routines are called
from within this loop, it is easy to assure that the program meets real-time
constraints.  Each routine called from within the main loop can be given a
strict time limit, and it is fairly simple to show that each routine lives
within this limit.

Within action routines called from the main polling loop, some fairly simple
rules must, of course, be obeyed.  Straight-line code is easy to verify,
branching code is easy to verify, and definite loops can be verified, but
indefinite loops are forbidden.

If you look at typical real-time programs of the 60's and 70's, these rules
weren't much trouble.  User interfaces were crude at best, and most of the
processing was fairly simple feedback control with little algorithmic
complexity.  Unfortunately, many of the larger problems we face today are far
more complex, with significant algorithmic components.

The very coding constraints that allow straightforward verification that a
a program meets simple real-time constraints serve to obscure the algorithmic
structure of the program.  When one or more logical tasks within a real-time
program involve complex algorithmic structures, they must usually be recoded
using state machines that make a state transition each time they are called
from the main polling loop.

As a result, it remains easy to verify that the complex tasks do not consume
more than their allotted time slots in the main polling cycle, but that is
all.  All other aspects of the complex tasks are hidden in a mass of state
machines so that even simple questions can take hours to answer.  In fact,
this structure can even impede the verification that some real-time
constraints are met.  Consider the problem of verifying the real time
behavior of a logical task that, after detecting an event, must respond
after a computation that requires multiple iterations of the main loop.

The Boston Globe today (Fri, July 21) reported that the GAA has recommended
that an advisory committee be set up to run the Internet since there was "no
one as the wheel" in the latest virus incident.  It seems to me that this
potentially slows down the response time of the Internet to such problems
and creates a single point of failure (cut out communication to the
committee and now no one knows what to do).

Two points:

1. Many years ago, the single integrated target list was for a war,
 that included by implication nuclear war.  But even in nuclear war,
 NOT EVERY weapon used will be nuclear.  There are some missions 
 where conventional albeit "smart" weapons would really be better.
 It follows that we - and they - really do need to target things
 that move; e.g., large ships, and mobile missile launchers.

2. A large ship is almost equivalent in population and technical
 complexity to a small town; e.g., 5000 "residents" with enough
 "restaurants" and "movie theaters" to serve them.
 Recent news item: The USSR is developing for deployment its
 first aircraft carrier.

The technical points of "how to select" targets are a fertile question for
RISKS.  If and when we want to debate the policy, maybe we should move that
to ARMS-D@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

Two amusing computer-related security stories from the Univ. of Colorado:

1.  Bank Card Numbers for Everyone:  Continuing Education offers community
courses and unlike other units of the university is therefore compelled to
accept bank cards for payment.  This necessity was overlooked when the new
student information system was created so no protected field was allocated to
hold bank card numbers and no otherwise unused field appeared to be big enough. 
But someone cleverly decided to use an unused address field for this purpose
until it was discovered that almost anyone with any access to the system could
then read a student's name, address, and VISA number.

2.  Another Two-Word Last Name Problem:  The Colorado Association of
Research Libraries now offers an on-line database of citations for every
article in every journal any of the libraries receive.  It isn't as good
as services offered by DIALOG or ISI or other big commercial operations
but it is a boon to local researchers.  They offer it free to university
folks but want to sell the service to outside users.  Hence, all faculty
now need user ids.  They cleverly use SSN and last name and both are
displayed when you type them on a public terminal.  But mine wouldn't
work!  I called the CARL office and once I identified myself as a
confused faculty member the cheerful clerk gladly told me my proper user
id over the phone.  [I thought about asking her how she knew I was who I
said I was but the risks seem to be all theirs and not mine so I didn't
bother.]  It turns out one must add the prefix "A9/" to the SSN [maybe

Excerpted from "The Facts About ... Credit Cards," in the April 1989
issue of "Vis a Vis" magazine, "The Magazine of United Airlines, Inc.":

     "Enhancement" is industry parlance for the tie-ins, upgrades,
     rewards, automatic insurance and warranty protection for products
     bought with the card.  Issuers continuously sweeten the
     enticements ...

     Shopping for clothes?  Traveling abroad?  Do you prefer bespoke
     British tailoring?  Country inns -- in New England or France?
     Your card company will soon know a thing or two about your tastes
     in restaurants and may some day [sic] be a source of
     recommendations for lodging, dining and a host of other services.

     Card companies are investing huge sums of money to read and
     analyze your charge receipts.  The "enhancement wars" create handy
     perks, but the battle for the hearts and minds of cardholders also
     rages in computer banks across the country ...

     The payoff for issuers who successfully use technology to analyze
     customer spending will be tremendous, asserts John Love of "Credit
     Card News."  "This information is extremely personal to the
     customer," he says.  "He might begin to feel that his card company
     really understands him."

     Chenault of American Express says his company is "betting the
     ranch" on its $100 million Genesis Project.  The program's goal is
     to make sure the company's nearly 300 mainframes and minicomputers
     can create dossiers on the tastes of cardholders.  Says Chenault:
     "If a cardmembers is traveling to Paris, we could develop a
     personalized itinerary before he even gets there.  We'll know his
     tastes in restaurants, special interests and shopping, and we
     could work with establishments to arrange even big-ticket
     purchases."

Sigh.

	"Video and graphics processing is performed, and digitized
	pictures are relayed to the helmet display."

It's the graphics processing that offers the most promise.  Some
projects (sorry, I have no references) are investigating the effect on
military pilot performance when the visual display is *simplified*, to
the point where important objects in the field of view are reduced to
wireframe figures, and unimportant objects are eliminated altogether.
Thus, an approaching mountain might look like an inverted cone sticking
up ahead of you; a river underneath (or civilians about to be bombed)
wouldn't be visible at all; and aircraft around you would show as stick
figures, perhaps with color coding to convey relative velocity,
friend-or-foe evaluation, etc.  An approaching missile might look like
a line growing toward you, just like it does in the "missile attack"
video games.

The win is that humans are better at pattern recognition when the
patterns are simple and the distractions are eliminated, especially in
time-critical situations.  Look at how well we do at those video games.

Another win is that, since the pilot no longer needs visual input
besides the (relatively low-bandwidth) wireframe presentation, it
becomes that much easier to move the pilot outside the plane, perhaps
to a bunker on the ground, and run the plane by remote control.  The
only important sensory input that would be missing is acceleration
(including gravity, "which way is down"), and good pilots learn to
distrust that anyway.

But there are still occasions when you need a full-video picture, such
as evaluating damage to an enemy aircraft (is it on fire?) or locating
an emergency landing site.  And simplified video presents new
opportunities for defensive counter-measures -- you'd like the enemy's
system to classify your fighter as "unimportant," or to classify your
chass as "important."

	"... the possibility of crashing an airplane because of a
	failure in the video system, coupled with the inability to look
	out the window (because the plane doesn't have one) is
	terrifying."

This risk should be kept in perspective.  For example, on a high
performance aircraft with forward-swept wings, if the computer handling
flight stability goes down, it doesn't much matter whether the pilot
can see or not; the plane is going to crash.

Edited excerpts from an article by William Trombley in the 'Los Angeles
Times' 14-Aug-89:

A new law which takes effect Jan. 1, 1990, requires California counties to
place the source code of their vote-counting computer programs in escrow so
they can be checked by independent experts in case of disputed results.
The law is a partial response to increasing criticism that electronic vote
tabulation sometimes is inaccurate and is vulnerable to tampering because
of lax security.

The California secretary of state will approve escrow facilities and will
determine what material should be placed in escrow and under what
circumstances the source codes should be made accessible to investigators.
The escrow plan also allows election officials access to the codes should
the companies that produce the software go out of business or stop selling
that particular product, as has happened in several states.

California's new law coincides with efforts by the National Clearinghouse
for Election Administration, an arm of the Federal Election Commission, to
produce voluntary state standards for computerized elections.  The federal
standards, published in the Federal Register last week, also call for
putting source codes in escrow.  So far, Texas, New York and a few other
states have laws similar to California's.

Reactions to the new law vary:

Tom Diebold, president of DFM Associates, one election system vendor: "The
problem with escrow is that it makes it easier for someone who wants to
manipulate an election to get their hands on the source code."

Lester Jaspovice, V.P. and corporate counsel for Sequoia Pacific Systems,
another vendor:  "My company doesn't like it, but, as an attorney, I think
it's a good idea.  It provides a virgin copy of the code that the court can
call on in case of a dispute."

Howard Strauss, Princeton University computer scientist and member of
Election Watch:  If the source code in escrow differs from the one used to
count votes, "then you know something's wrong.  But if they're the same, it
doesn't tell you anything because they could both contain the same
mistakes."  Strauss also doubted that the law would protect against a
company going out of business or losing its top scientific talent.  "The
idea is that these escrow facilities will have technical people who can
read this stuff, but some of it is so badly written that, even after months
of work, you wouldn't know what it was all about."

Crew Deer, V.P. of Data Securities International, a computer software
escrow company:  "If the code has a bug in it, it will show up on both the
original and the copy, but that's good because you at least know it's a
technical problem and nobody has been tampering."  According to Deer, the
escrow fees for vote-counting source code might be about $1500 plus
$1000/year after that.  If a result is challenged and a detailed
verification process is carried out, the cost could be as much as $30,000.

Several critics said the new law does nothing to correct what they consider
to be the major flaw in computerized elections -- the presence of poorly
trained, underpaid election workers who do not understand the computerized
equipment they are using to count votes.

  [For the record, on July 2, 3, and 4, the 'Los Angeles Times' ran a very
  lengthy series by William Trombley on computers and vote counting.  Nothing
  new, but a fair summary of past troubles, present systems, and suggested
  changes.

  It includes quotes from many election officials, computer scientists, and
  statisticians.  Among those cited are RISKS contributors Gary Chapman and
  Marc Rotenberg of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, Lance
  Hoffman of George Washington University, Willis Ware of RAND, and RISKS
  moderator Peter Neumann.  (See RISKS 7.52 and 7.70 for references to past
  reports on the subject.)]

More than 6000 voters were unable to vote in local government
elections in Victoria on Saturday, August 5th, because of a 
computer error made by the Australian Electoral Commission.
Newly enrolled voters and those who had changed municipalities had
their names left of the updated electoral rolls.

The error was made five months ago, but was detected less than
24 hours before the opening of the polling booths. A full internal
inquiry has been ordered into why the error was detected so late, as
well as its original cause.

Legal opinion indicate the elections are not invalidated by the error,
although legal challenges are expected from narrowly losing candidates.
One bitter voter affected by the error noted that voting in the 
elections was compulsory - a bitter irony for those left of the rolls.

My answering machine is one that allows me to call in from a push-button
phone and signal it to play back my messages with a 2-digit code.  In
addition, there are single-digit codes that reset the machine, go forwards,
backwards, change the outgoing message, etc.

I just called in to get my messages; there was one.  Just before the caller
hung up they accidentally bumped some keys on their phone, resulting in
some digit tones being recorded on their message.  I heard this and
waited for the machine to beep to tell me it had finished playback.  Instead,
it played the message again... and again...  Apparently it was taking
input from the message tape as valid, and one of the buttons the caller
pressed was the "backwards" command.

I suppose if I were getting the message off the machine at home this
wouldn't happen, because it would not be in remote mode.  This has some
interesting consequences for the unscrupulous callers and unwary callees.

              "The New Homes Are Getting Smarter"
            "Cued by computers, they run themselves"
                        by Mark McCain
(Excerpted from the Real Estate Section of the New York Times, August 13, 1989)

    Although electronic brains these days control televisions and telephones,
offices and automobiles, the average house is still a mindless creature,
bumbling along without any effort to make itself more safe [!!!], or
economical, comfortable or convenient.

    For many houseowners, that's fine.  The thought of a house smart enough
to take matters into its own hands is absurd - even threatening.  Who's
to say it wouldn't fire up the oven after midnight just on a lark?

    But new houses are improving their IQs.  After many years of futuristic
talk without much follow-through, builders are beginning to install automated
systems that act like all-knowing butlers.  Not surprisingly, the systems
are most popular in expensive houses, where budgets are big and rooms so
numerous that even turning off lights at bedtime can be burdensome. [...]

    "When my 3-year-old boy comes out of his room at night, a motion detector
turns on the hallway light for him," says Robert Pomeranz, a banking executive
who lives in a new 7,500-square-foot house outside Washington.  "Obviously,
it's not worth buying an integrated control system for small things like
that, but it's amazing how useful the system can be as you become comfortable
with it."

    Like humans, the systems aren't perfect.  A light may turn on for no 
apparent reason or a front door may refuse to open for it's master.

    [That sounds nice in an emergency...]

    "The houses we're building today have interiors right out of the space
age, even though their exterior appearances are traditional," said Kenneth
Nadler, an architect in Mount Kisco, NY, who designs expensive houses. 
"It's Jetson on the inside and Gatsby on the outside."

    For a homeowner eager to outdo even George Jetson, the futuristic TV cartoon
character, there's a $26,000 whirlpool that accepts calls - say, from a
car phone - to start water running at bath-perfect temperature.  Too expensive?
For less than $1,500, there's a fireplace with a gas flame adjustable from
glowing to roaring by infrared remote control.

    [Could Audi 5000's order up a bath by themselves? :-) ]

    But even aficionados have their limits.

    "I'm afraid of those things," said Joel Sommer, a Maryland builder who
infuses his multi-million-dollar houses with high technology.  "What whould
happen if the whirlpool didn't shut off automatically or gas started flowing
in the fireplace without an ignition spark?  I just don't see the benefit
of some products."

    Certainly, automated devices built into houses today do not always make
practical sense.  It is a situation reminiscent of the home-computer craze
in the early 1980's, when companies promoted computers for such uses as
storing recipes, even though ingredients that only soil a cookbook page
might easily destroy a kitchen keyboard.  Today home computers are common,
but not for recipes or checkbook balancing or other uses suggested by early
promoters.

    "In similar fashion, I'm sure we'll find a great many applications for
home automation that people haven't thought of yet or haven't predicted
to be big winners," said Roger Dooley, editor of Electronic Home, a trade
magazine published in Mishawka, Ind.  "And what's being touted today as
big benefits may end up being used by only a few homeowners." [...]

    "I live alone in a 10,000-square-foot house with only my housekeeper,
so I need to feel really secure, and what I've installed is state-of-the-art,"
said [... someone who has such a system.  She also ...] has a sensor in each
room to control the temperature, and only once have things gone awry.  "During
a storm with heavy lightning the sensor in the living room got stuck at 95
degrees," she said.  "So the air-conditioning system kept trying to cool the
room. It felt like a meat locker." [...] 

    Beyond that, there's the gee-whiz appeal, like a synthesized voice in the
kitchen that anounces when a letter carrier has delivered the mail. [...]  "You
don't have to install an integrated control system," said Mr. Sommer, the
developer, who is completing an 11,000-square-foot house with such a system. "I
happen to enjoy them because my background is in computer science.  But really,
they're toys." 

    [discussion of business aspects of marketing these systems...] 

    One futuristic idea now becoming more practical is voice control.  Already,
voice-recognition devices that allow a computer to understand a vocabulary of
about 75 words are available for less than $500.  As those devices become more
powerful and less expensive, they will be an option for controlling home
automation. 

    "You'll be able to just walk up and talk to it," explained David MacFadyen,
an industry expert.  "When you say, 'Good night, house,' the temperature
controls will be set back in unoccupied areas, the hot-water heater will be set
back, the phone will go on voice-mail.  Just a couple of words will trigger an
evening shutdown sequence that is far more elaborate than anything we can think
of now.

A documentary on UK's Channel 4, 13 Aug 1989, was about traffic
problems, especially congestion in cities.

After concluding that there was no obvious and fair solution, the 
programme suggested that the best hope lay in more automation in
cars.  What's more, the programme implied that machines driving cars
would be feasible in the medium term (next decade or two).

For instance, shots were shown of a human driven automobile in
which experimenters were recording data about close vehicles, etc.
Apparently, and I paraphrase the commentator, although the 
researchers were only recording data, there's no reason in principle
why the information should not be fed into control computers.
The clear implication was that this would be much safer than letting
humans drive.

Also, with automatically or semi-automatically driven, it would be 
possible for my vehicle to refuse to let me drive into a city centre
if the centre was too busy.

The risks are obvious and horrific, but what is even more depressing
is that experts in other fields just do not see the risks, and that
TV researchers do not even think to ask anybody who might know about
these risks.

Quoted from The Dominion, Monday August 14 :

A computer virus call marijuana has wreaked havoc in the Australian
Defence Department and New Zealand is getting the blame.

Data in a sensitive security area in Canberra was destroyed and when
officers tried to use their terminals a message appeared : "Your PC is
stoned - Legalise marijuana".

Viruses are [guff on viruses] The New Zealand spawned marijunana has
managed to spread itself widely throughout the region.

Its presence in Australia has been known for the past two months. The
problem was highlighted two weeks ago when a Mellbourne man was
charged with computer trespass and attempted criminal damage for
allegedly loading it into a computer at the Swinbourne Institute of
Technology.

The virus invaded the Defence Department earlier this month - hitting
a security division repsonsible for the prevention of computer viruses.

A director in the information systems division, Geoff Walker said an
investigation was under way and the infection was possibly an
embarrassing accident arising from virus prevention activities.

New personal computers installed in the section gobbled data from
their hard disk, then disabled them.

Initially it was believed the virus was intoduced by a subcontractor
installing the new computer system but that possibility has been ruled out.

One more outlandish theory suggested New Zealnd, piqued at its
exclusion from Kangaroo 89 military exercises under way in northern
Australia, was showing its ability to infiltrate the Canberra citadel.

New Zealand was not invited to take part in Kangaroo because of United
States' policy of not taking part in exercises with New Zealand forces
since Labour's antinuclear legislation. However, New Zealand observers
were invited.

New Zealand Defence Department spokesmand Lieutenant Colonel Peter Fry
categorically denied the claim. "It would be totally irresponsible to
do this kind of thing."

In fact, New Zealand's Defence Department already had problems with
the virus, he said.

  If techies and technical management install these trapdoors to evade

unwilling to submit to the control of the access control system -- we
_will_ have users installing trapdoors for an alternative path to
high-priviledged status, despite the obvious risks.

  If 15 years of unrelenting propaganda by the vendors and gurus have
left the users so unwilling to follow the prescribed path of
righteousness, maybe someone other than the users should reconsider.  As
it is, user-installed trapdoors are almost universal on big systems, but
because they are illicit, "secret," they are seldom protected by
anything more than their obscurity.

  What is so wrong about giving the users a safe model for what they
demand -- a route around the access control system -- when just they
take it anyway, security be damned?

  Who is being more unrealistic:  the system programmers who code these
traps, or the security specialists who ignore the fact that virtually
all systems have trapdoors?  Aren't we talking about trusting people who
are already virtually all-powerful in their environment?

  Why can't we use an alternative security device to secure this
alternative access path?  Encryption seems a likely padlock.  With a mix
of synch and asynch crypto, it seems possible to set up a "one-time key"
access, supported by user authentication, separation of function, audit
trails.  Heck, add an audible alarm.  Even without the PKE frills,
simple encryption can put a lock on what is otherwise an open gate
hidden in the thickets.  Continuing the masquerade, ignoring the
existence of the problem, gets us Nowhere.

  For twenty years people have been showing me trapdoors into systems.
Now, I'm shown or told of trapdoors that open whole networks (recently,
one which popped a net of control systems for a major phone company,
installed by management.)  Now, I chat with hackers who give tutorials
on how to locate user-installed trapdoors.  One "specialist" recently
told me that it seldom takes him more than 20 minutes to identify such a
trapdoor in a typical corporate MVS system.

  The auditors are not the only ones, nor likely the most challenging
foe, these users have to outsmart.

From wire service stories in the 'Los Angeles Times' August 3 and 4, 1989:

Computer problems frustrated a record opening-day crowd at New York's Saratoga
Race Track on Wednesday, and track officials said Thursday's card might be
canceled if the problem was not fixed by Thursday morning.  Bettors were kept
in the dark about the odds, payoffs, and even the time of day.

"There's some sort of gremlin running around that software, and we can't find
it," said Gerard McKeon, president of the New York Racing Assn on Wednesday.
... The computer problem extended Wendesday's nine-race card by an hour and
cost NYRA about $1.5 million in handle, McKeon said.  Pari-mutuel machines and
the track's tote boards were also affected by the problem.

Technicians worked through the night to replace the software, and things
were apparently back to normal on Thursday.

Here's a first-hand account of an item for RISKS, since I was there on
Wednesday.

August 3, 1989,  Latham, NY

Yesterday was opening day for thoroughbred racing at the Saratoga Race
Course in Saratoga Springs, New York.

It was a computer disaster.

The beginning of the 122nd season was ruined by computer problems which
forestalled the placement of wagers for Races 5 through 9 of the 9-race
program.  The New York Racing Association, which operates Saratoga and
the other racing facilities in New York, is estimating a loss of $1.5
million in on-track, and $2 million in off-track handle.  The loss in
good will is not measurable--parimutuel systems are dependent on their
accuracy and reliability for continued patronage--chances are most fans
will be forgiving and come back.  Provided, that is, that the system
gets straightened out.

This is by no means certain.  Racing officials announced yesterday that
they had no idea what had caused the computer system to crash, and for
fans to listen for a 9 AM announcement this morning before heading for
the track.  This morning, NYRA announced that they intend to offer
wagering today, that they believe they have found the software problem
and corrected it, and that they are "80%" sure the system will work
correctly once betting begins today.

Like most tracks, betting information is displayed both on Tote Boards
(light-bulb displays) and on computer-generated video screens.  Both
types of displays were affected by the problem(s)--at one point, I
observed that odds displayed on the two types differed.  (Presumably
one was being updated from the computer, and the other not. However,
regardless of which was correct, some fans were being provided with
inaccurate information.)

Though the displays worked on and off from the 5th race on, the betting
machines did not function at all.  The machines are of two
types--terminals which are located at the regular betting windows, and
which are operated by track employees; and so-called "SAMs", which
employ touchie-feelie screens so that bettors can place their own
wagers.  The self-service machines allow a bettor to insert a
winning ticket or a cash voucher.  Under ordinary circumstances, the
value of the ticket or voucher is read and then displayed on the
screen.  At the beginning of the computer outage, machines were
displaying incorrect values for tickets, or simply eating tickets or
vouchers.  Bettors who had encountered problems at the betting windows
at least had a human clerk to complain to--those using the SAMs had to
stand around wondering what to do.

Post times for races were delayed in hopes that the computers could be
made to operate, but to no avail.  The final race took place nearly an
hour later than usual--and only those few who had made advance wagers
early in the day had any money riding.

Because the system handles both bets and payoffs, automated calculation of
prices for winning horses was also pretty much incapacitated.  People holding
winning tickets (even from previous races) were not able to cash them.

Technicians worked overnight, having flown up from Autotote in
Delaware, and apparently fixed some software problems, but officials
still are not certain of what happened exactly.

Today, Thursday, the system seemed to operate properly.  The normal $2
admission fee was waived, as a gesture to yesterday's disappointed
fans.  However, given that officials were uncertain this morning that
it would hold up, the system's performance may have been more luck than
anything else.

Other than having diagnosed the problem as a software, rather than a hardware,
one, officials are offering no explanation as to what the problem was.
However, as an outsider, one could focus on the following factors:

     When the season at Saratoga starts each year, most of the equipment
     used  is moved up from Belmont Park, near New York City.  The move,
     which includes starting gates, etc.,  as  well  as  the  computers,
     betting machines, and TV monitors, takes place in the timespan from
     the last race at Belmont on Monday to the first race at Saratoga on
     Wednesday.   Assuming  that no hardware damage occurred in transit,
     this allows very little time for testing, since some of those 30-40
     hours are taken up by travel time and installation.

     Though  officials  say  that software changes are made nearly every
     week, a number of changes--some in effect  only  for  the  Saratoga
     meet--were  made in the betting rules.  For example, Triple betting
     is now offered in the 8th as well as the 9th race;  the  number  of
     horses  required  to  be  entered  in races offering certain exotic
     wagers was lowered; and for two racing days  only,  when  important
     stakes  races  are  run,  exacta  wagering  will be allowed for all
     races, regardless of the number of horses entered.

My guess is that more--and more sophisticated--software changes were made than
normally, and that, with limited time to test a system which was asked to
handle wagers from 30,000 people yesterday, some bug went undetected until
triggered yesterday.

It will be interesting to find out what backup setup NYRA utilizes.
Officials mentioned today that, if the system broke down today, that
hopefully their backup systems would not fail, so that they could
determine what went wrong.  This leads me to believe that there was a
secondary failure of some type yesterday, such that the planned backup
process did not work.

During the present slow-down in RISKS, I was particularly happy when, this
evening, my netnews reader presented me with an `unread' RISKS digest.  It
was not until I was half way through it that I realized it was one I had
already seen.  In fact it was RISKS 8.81 from 17 June 1989.  Was this a
local phenomenon, or has the Network, not wishing to RISK lower ratings,
started airing Summer Reruns?

Just curious,

New York Times, Aug. 3 (Richard Witkin):

    Families of victims of the 1983 downing of a Korean Air
    Lines jumbo jet by a Soviet fighter may collect unlimited
    compensatory damages from the airline because of the crew's
    "willful misconduct" in straying over Soviet air-space, a
    Federal court jury in Washington ruled yesterday . . .  The
    term is legally defined as an intentional act performed with
    knowledge of likely injury to passengers or "with reckless
    disregard of the consequences." . . . Judge Robinson earlier
    dismissed lawsuits against the Soviet Government; the Boeing
    Company, the builder of the 747; Litton Industries, which
    made its navigation systems; and the United States
    Government, which employed the traffic controllers involved
    in the first part of the flight.

N.B.  The suit against the U.S. government was dismissed at the outset of the
case some years ago, on the "ground" that the court refused to countenance U.S.
government involvement; and a gag order was placed on government employees.

Summary of a lengthy article by William Trombley in the 'Los Angeles Times'
24-July-89:

The California Dept. of Transportation (Caltrans) has begun its most
ambitious research program, ranging all the way to "'Star Trek' systems
that would propel 'platoons' of vehicles down automated freeways at 70 mph
with only 50-foot separations between cars."  

"In some areas, like Los Angeles, there's no more room for new freeways and
the next advace has to be technological," says Caltrans Director Robert
Best.  "We've paved the world, especially in the Los Angeles area," says
UCDavis mechnaical engineering Prof. Andrew Frank, "and now we've got to
make much more use of that pavement."

Caltrans' new Office of Traffic Improvement has spent about $6 million so
far, with most of the money going to the Univ. of California's Institute of
Transportation Studies, which is sponsoring research by at least two dozen
faculty members on several campuses.  Most of the work has been gathered
together in the Program on Advanced Technology on the Highway (PATH), which
includes research on navigation, electrification, and automated highways.

The article reviews a number of real and imagined systems.  One real one is
Pathfinder, a straightforward CD-based navigation system soon to be tested
in 25 test cars for use along LA's Santa Monica Freeway.  Other projects
study electric vehicles, human factors ("how effectively drivers use
automated equipment") and road pricing -- charging motorists to use
automated highways, including higher rates at peak hours.

One complex project studies radar-equipped and computer-controlled cars,
held in the center of the lane by a lateral guidance system that depends on
electric sensors placed in the roadbed and provided with "a smarter version
of 'cruise control'" called longitudinal control -- moving cars at high
speed without crashing into one another.  The radar system is to be tested
later this year with a "platoon" of six cars along an interstate highway
north of San Diego (in a reversible lane unused during mid-day).  The radar
collision-avoidance system costs about $10,000 per unit now.

A few key quotes from the final sections of the article:

  A major question is this:  How will the public react to a system that
  takes decisions out of the hands of the individual driver and gives 
  them to a computer?...
  
  A second problem is what to do with all the new vehicles that a more
  efficient road system would accommodate.  Where will they park?...
  
  Then there is the question of liability... the Achilles heel of this
  research effort.  "This system would be much safer than what's out 
  there now," says PATH Director Robert Parsons, "but with this tech-
  nology, you can trace fault [for accidents].  How do you limit
  liability and keep the 'deep pockets' thing from killing us before
  we get started?"

The following brief item was in the "Regional News" section of the July 31,
1989, issue of CITY &amp; STATE, a slick-paper tabloid trade paper for local
government topics, page 22:

  COMPUTER SECURITY FAULTED

  A dearth of safeguards for the state computers that hold information on
  New York's drivers could allow system users to erase driving convictions
  and wipe out other records, state Comptroller Edward V. Regan has charged.
  The state Department of Motor Vehicles also lacks contingency plans to
  keep its computers running if a disaster shuts down operations at the
  agency's computing center, Mr. Regan said. He recently made the charges
  in an audit that reviewed security and disaster planning at the center
  between April 1987 and March 1988.

That's all the info I have; maybe some NY-state people have more info from
their local media on this topic.

After a few exciting moments with airlines and some eccentric East-coast
weather, I am back on the West coast, but backlogged with 17 days of EMAIL.
Flying is not what it used to be.  But then, as Arthur Clarke once lamented,
regarding how difficult writing good science fiction was becoming, "The
future isn't what it used to be."  On the other hand, judging from the
material waiting for RISKS-9.9, there are still lots of topics ready for
this forum, and RISKS is again in there ready to dig it out for you.

However, I see that I am not quite fully in the swing of things.  Before
everyone jumps on me, let me apologize for not setting the date on the
masthead of RISKS-9.9, which of course should have been * 14 Aug 1989 *.
With some people having gotten a net-gratuitous copy of <A HREF="/Risks/8.81.html">RISKS-8.81</A> a month
and a half late, I needn't have added further to the confusion.  Sorry!

By the way, I hope to move RISKS from KL.SRI.COM to CSL.SRI.COM this month.
The archives will probably move to CRVAX.SRI.COM, because the KL is being
decommissioned.  The mailing list differences should be sorted out very
soon, but a few of you may experience some bumps in the process.  There are
also a bunch of nonworking addresses at the moment, and I am hoping that the
CSL (Sun) mailer tables will simplify matters.  (For example, the KL does
not let me ANSwer mail from BITNET or UUCP, while the CSL does.  That is a
real pain.)  So, a little patience is in order.  Thanks.  Peter

Subject: "Radiation" or "Fields"

In RISKS 9.7, Jan Wolitzky takes Gordon Hester to task for distinguishing
"fields" from "radiation" in discussion the hazards of ELF electromagnetic
sources.

It is quite true that "radiation" is the scientifically correct word across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  But things are not quite that simple.
When we think about an electromagnetic radiator, we almost always think of
its "far field" - the region in which it behaves in the familiar way as a
traveling way of crossed E and B fields.  But there is also a "near field"
region with quite different characteristics.  It's been way too many years
since I looked at this stuff, so I can't vouch for any of the details, but as
I recall near field effects drop off exponentially, so are not an issue except
very close to the radiator.  But near enough, they are dominant.

If you think only in terms of far field effects, you are hard pressed to
explain how a transformer can possibly work at 60 Hz - the "radiator" and
receiver are tiny fractions of a wavelength long!

When one talks about shielding for appliances, one talks about shielding the
magnetic and electic fields independently.  This would be meaningless in the
far field, where the connection between the two is fixed.

I'm not certain that it was this distinction that Hester was getting at, nor
do I know exactly what the significance of the near/far field distinction in
this area is - though I expect its essential:  The far field produced by any
object the size of an appliance at 60 Hz must be minuscule.  (Note that this
may be very different from a power transmission line.)

Unlike Gordon Hester in volume 9, issue 6, I found Paul Brodeur's series of 
three articles in The New Yorker Magazine balanced and fascinating.  He
discusses the clearly-shown (epidemiologically &amp; statistically, not by
argument based on theoretical considerations) health effects of three
different types of non-ionizing radiation.  At least one of these -- magnetic
fields from CRT terminals -- most readers of Risks are probably heavily
exposed to.

These articles seem so worth reading that I will refrain from providing any
summary at all.  The New Yorker is available in most good libraries, and the
stories appeared in successive issues beginning June 12.

Rather than be dissuaded from reading them by Mr. Hester's comments, go to the
library and judge for yourself.

I have some real problems with Jan Wolitzky's comments on Gordon
Hester's review of Paul Brodeur's New Yorker article.  

Wolitzky's high school education seems to have been an example of the crisis in
science education we hear so much about.  The correct technical term is field.
(I have a Ph.D. in chemical physics, and in a former life taught some of the
introductory physics courses at Harvard, so I think I'm on reasonably safe
ground here.)

The purest example of the difference between the electromagnetic field and
electromagnetic radiation is a static charge - a charged capacitor doesn't
radiate at all but it certainly has an electric field.  Maxwell's equations
are FIELD equations that turn out to have electromagnetic radiation as one
set of solutions.  The quantum picture, with wave/particle duality and all
that, muddies the picture a little, but in quantum physics one usually says
"radiation" with the single-isolated-particle view (i.e., with single
photons, neutrons, alpha particles, etc.) and "fields" with the
collective-action view.  In fact most of the concerns about EMF concern the
near-field effects surrounding powerlines, electric blankets, computer
terminals, and so on, and not the radiation from such devices, which is
relatively small.

As an example of how the term "radiation" can "mislead the unwary," consider
the phrase marked with carets above.  In addition to its fuzziness
(wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, which is directly
proportional to energy PER PHOTON; they are intimately interrelated in
modern physical theory but not "different ways of expressing the same
thing"), it entirely misses the point of the difference between
low-frequency EMF and ionizing radiation:

Biological effects of low-frequency EMF can't have any relation at all to
individual photons -- a 60 Hz photon has a trillionth of the thermal energy
surging around in a molecule at body temperature or in one of the infrared
photons that swarm around us as thermal background.  The normal fluctuations in
a molecule's heat energy from picosecond to picosecond far exceed the energy of
such a photon.  Biological effects can only stem from the collective action of
the field and the energy (or better, the strength) of the field, which is
unrelated to its frequency and wavelength; the effects themselves may have a
frequency dependence through dispersive phenomena in the body, and might also
depend on the orientation of the field.

Perhaps Wolitzky needs to go back to school.  Now somewhere I have a copy of
Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, crammed into my head by Nico Bloembergen
(who later won a Nobel Prize for his work on lasers), that I might be willing
to part with...

The difference between radiation and fields is somewhat pedantic.  But, if your
close enough to a power line to have to worry, you are well inside the near
field and the couplings wsill be much easier to compute by field theory than by
radiation theory.

The differentiation from ionizing radiation is not pedantic.  We have some
knowledge about the damage mechanism of ionizing radiation.  We have no
knowledge about the damage mechanism of ELF fields except that they are subtle
and almost certainly different from those of ionizing radiation.

To ignore the possibility of damage is foolish, to confuse the two is to cause
confusion and unnecessary fear.  We have to keep the problems separate.

In 1963 (yes, I am that old),while doing nonlinear optical work at the IBM
research lab. in San Jose,I was invited by people at the US-Army Medical
Research Headquarters in Fort Knox, Kentucky,to give them the benefit of my
advice regarding some peculiar experimental results that they had obtained and
which some people there believed to be related to multiphoton absorption (on
which I with some others had just published some papers).

I accepted the invitation and spent a very interesting day with them. They were
a group of medical doctors and some biophysicists looking into biological EMF
effects in a variety of ways. This is not the place for a general comment
though I shall point out that I (a Canadian and thus a foreign national) was
never asked to keep anything I saw or talked with them about confidential and,
in fact, expected to see some of their work published in due course.

The specific experiment I was consulted on, looked at the the deactivation of
the enzyme alpha-amylase by extremely low intensity rf fields in the region of
about 10 MHz (they used an old General Radio rf generator)and the deactivation
occurred (in aqueous solution, I believe) at very sharply defined frequencies
that had a regular spacing with some integral relationships (I don't recall the
exact details) of the spacing, something like multiples of 150 KHz and with
widths of KHz.

While their results seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with my own
research, as an experimental physicist I looked very carefully at their
experimental setup and could find nothing wrong with it and no obvious possible
explanation for their results in terms of an experimental artifact. I found the
results extremely intriguing, particularly as they had found similar (although
experimentally more difficult and less clear in terms of confidence) effects on
gamma globulin in the region of 200 MHz.

The implications of low intensity biological effects on enzymatic activity are
profound to say the least, though by their very nature they would be very
difficult to pin down, particularly in complex organisms like rats or mice, let
alone men (or women).

Naturally, I expected to hear more about this and over the years have broached
the subject with many friends and colleagues in physics as well as biology.
None had ever heard about this.  Some in the 60s wrote to the people in Fort
Knox about it,but never received an answer.In all the writings on the subject
of biological EMF effects, for instance in reviews in SCIENCE etc., I have
never heard a mention.

This is the end of the story.

Now my questions:

Has anybody heard about this type of effect?  Is anybody interested in this?
Has someone suggestions as to how one could (after all these years) find out
more about this?  I still find it hard to believe that what I saw turned out to
be an experimental error of the cold fusion kind.  Also, I find it still
strange, that nobody should ever have tried to look for low field-strength EMF
effect on enzyme activity.  But then I have certainly no time to look into that
kind of literature. However, some of the people I talked to should have heard
about such research. None have.

A morning radio news report here in Washington, DC reported that a commercial
airline crew noted a fire alarm signal from a cargo hold in mid-flight.  Upon
returning to their originating airport, the cargo hold was examined carefully,
and no evidence of fire was found.  Apparently, a cellular telephone in a
passenger's luggage had received an incoming call, that activated the smoke (I
assume) detector via RF interference.

This occurrence shows why we have systems engineers.  That is, someone who must
consider not only electromagnetic compatibility between system components, but
also with other systems in the same operating environment.  As a result of this
event, the aircraft companies may have to redesign a lot of sensors.

From the 'Los Angeles Times' 14-Aug-89:

Phoenix police arrested four people as they continued to unravel a bogus
airline ticket ring that allegedly sold millions of dollars of stolen tickets
by advertising discounted fares in national publications.  Investigators said
the individuals put together a major conspiracy by knowing how to access
airline computers to put travel itineraries in the computer system.

</i><PRE>

I have received numerous e-mail responses, as well as the ones that have
appeared in Risks Digest, to my posting on Paul Brodeur's articles on
electromagnetic fields (EMF) health risks in the New Yorker. I am
forwarding this message to those who have asked for additional information;
references to published sources on the subject appear at the end of it. My
apologies to anyone who feels that I have not resonded adequately to their
requests. Please send me mail and I will try to respond, but I simply do not
have time to respond individually to all of the mail I have already recieved.

First, several people have quite correctly taken me to task for calling
Brodeur's use of the term "radiation" in his article titles "a complete
misnomer." You are all correct: tecnically speaking, EMF is a form of
radiation. My point, which I obviously did not make clearly, is that the use of
this term will create an association in the minds of readers who are neither
scientists nor particularly well-informed about radiation ( and I feel
confident that that includes virtually all regular readers of The New Yorker)
to atomic or ionizing radiation. Public fear of atomic radiation and nuclear
power is well known (and I say this without intending to make any judgment
about whether that fear is justified, as that is irrelevant to the issue of
EMF). I feel fully justified in characterizing Brodeur's use of the term
radiation as misleading; it is one of many instances where he gives information
that is in itself correct but that, due to a failure to include additional
information, will tend to lead many readers to draw conclusions that are not
justified.

I was considerably more disturbed by Jan Wolitzky's response to my comments on
Brodeur's articles, and would like to respond in some detail to his criticsms.
I find it very ironic that he chose not to resond to my point that Brodeur
incorrectly assumes that researchers who have done studies that have yielded
negative results on EMF health effects (that is, the results of which have been
inconsistent with hypotheses that some such effects exist) have "cooked" their
data to suit the preferences of their industry or government funding sources.
Nevertheless, he accuses those of us who are working on this issue of doing
exactly that!

In describing a booklet on EMF risks prepared by my colleagues here at Carnegie
Mellon University, Wolitzky claims to have found "in the fine print in the
front of the booklet" information that our research is supported by, and the
production costs are paid for, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). He
asserts that this is the reason we are "go[ing] to such lengths to try to
dampen public interest in the health effects of EMF."

Wolitzky omits other information that also appears on the first page of the
booklet: that our research is also sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy
and the National Science Foundation, that preparation of the booklet (distinct
from production costs) was supported by NSF, and that EPRI has NOT reviewed or
approved the contents of the booklet. (They have, of course, seen it since it
was produced.) This information is obviously relevant.  By the way, the booklet
is available from teh Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie
Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. there is a charge of $3.00 to defray
production and mailing costs. (The funds EPRI provided for production are not
separate from the research money we have; we charge this amount only to cover
costs and do not make any profit. This is definitely NOT a commercial
solicitation.) The booklet is titled "Electric and Magnetic Fields from 60
Hertz Electric Power: What do we know about possible health risks?" It is 45
pages long. It was produced, by the way, primarily for use in research on
communicating to the public about this issue. It is being made generally
available only because there is a paucity of information on the subject written
in a way that is accessible to the public.

Wolitzky also writes of the booklet, "It also tries to discount
epidemiological data that establishes a correlation between ELF [extremely
low frequency] radiation and cancers and birth defects, by saying that just
because a rooster crows in the morning when the temperature is rising
doesn't mean that the rooster CAUSED the temperature to rise." This is
simply a distortion. This analogy is used in the booklet to explain
the difference between establishing correlation and establishing
causation, but the booklet does not try to discount the cause for
concern created by the existence of positive epidemiological studies.
It does show results from nine epidemiological studies of cancer, four
of which are positive (i.e., the 95% confidence intervals fall entirely
above the level of no change in cancer risk).

Finally, Wolitzky characterizes the group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon
as trying to "lobby the public that there's nothing to get excited about here,
that scientists don't all agree on the interpretation of the data, and that
therefore we should follow a "prudent" course (they use that word a lot),
by which they mean no government regulation at all, just maybe you should
put your electric blanket on the shelf in the closet." There are four points
here, which I will respond to in the order presented.

First, no one at CMU is trying to lobby the public. We are researchers, not
politicians. We have made no attempt to widely distribute information to the
public. We do, of course, provide information to research subjects who are
drawn from the general population, both as part of our research and after their
participation in that research. It is our responsibility as scientists to do
this; it is also required by our university's policy and by generally accepted
standards of scientific organizations. We also publish results of our research.
Our publications sometimes appear in journals whose audiences include
policymakers, but I don't think it would be accurate to describe this as
"lobbying the public" by any means.  Second, we do not characterize the
possibility of EMF health risks as "nothing to get excited about." If we
believed this, we wouldn't be interested in doing research in this area in the
first place. I think it is fair to say that each of us currently is of the
opinion that a conclusion that there definitely are health risks from EMF is
not justified by the scientific evidence, although our opinions are
individually held and I cannot presume to speak for my colleagues. In the
booklet referred to here, which is the responsibility of M. Granger Morgan
(others, including me, acted as advisors), the following appears under the
heading "Do 60 Hz fields pose health risks?" "The honest answer is that nobody
knows for sure. Scientists have found that fields can produce a variety of
biological effects, like changes in the levels of specific chemicals the body
makes and changes in the functioning of individual nerve cells and the nervous
system. Whether any of these changes lead to health risks is less clear." In my
opinion, this is a fair statement of the facts. However, it certainly does not
mean that there is no cause for concern on the part of the public, government,
researchers, or the utility industry. To the contrary, the scientific evidence
now available is certainly cause for concern on the part of each of these
groups.

Third, it is a FACT that scientists don't agree on how the currently available
data should be interpreted. In his articles, Brodeur quotes the few people who
are willing to conclude that there definitely is a health risk extensively -
though I would not accept that those people as responsible scientists, any more
than I would those who are now willing to conclude that there definitely is not
a health risk. It is notable, however, that Brodeur does NOT have any quotes
from some of the quite responsible scientists he refers to in his articles to
the effect that there definitely are significant public health risks - Ross
Adey and Nancy Wirtheimer are the two examples that come to my mind. These
people do say, and quite justifiably, that there is now cause for concern and
for a concerted effort at doing more and better research - as do many other
scientists. But that is not to say that they agree on how to interpret the
available data.

Fourth, it is true that the booklet advocates a "prudent" course of action, and
devotes some consideration to what is prudent. One thing that seems like it
would probably be prudent for most people is to not use electric blankets, or
at least not sleep under them. Another is to not sleep with your head near an
electric clock that is motor driven - even small electric motors produce fairly
strong magnetic fields. These are, clearly, actions that can be taken at an
individual level, and at minimal cost. But large-scale societal action is not
prudent at this time, given the uncerainty about whether there are any health
effects from EMF and the possible extent of effects that may occur, for two
reasons. First, the public expenditures that might be required are potentially
enormous. It is not prudent to undertake those expenditures, which might
accomplish literally nothing beneficial, when there are many other public
health risks that are known to exist for which resources could be used and used
effectively.  Second, even if we were willing to take drastic measures, it is
not clear what measures would be effective. The currently available evidence is
not sufficient to give a clear indication of the measures of EMF exposure, if
any, that are biologically effective and potentially pose health risks. (For
example, the appropriate measure might involve time-averaged field strength,
magnetic but not electric fields or vice versa, the specific wave form of the
fields, the peak strength of the fields, or even exposure only to fields of
specific intensities and frequencies and no others.) For exactly this reason,
government regulation cannot be undertaken at this time with any confidence
that it will be effective in reducing public health effects, even if one is
willing to assume that such effects exist. It is quite conceivable that
government regulations that arbitrarily limit field strengths (and such limits
would necessarily be arbitrary, at least with respect to the potential for
health effects) would actually INCREASE any public health effects that do
exist. (Several states have nevertheless adopted such limits.)  There is one
action that government can undertake that would definitely be prudent, and
those of us at CMU who are working on this problem advocate it strongly. That
is to support further research. Unfortunately, it is the case that government
support in this area has been declining rather than increasing over the last
few years.

Now for some references:

that EMF exposure definitely causes health effects I would provide it, but I
don't.  For specific papers, articles, etc., please see the bibliographies in
the above sources.

I have watched with interest the discussion of the biological effects of low
frequency electromagnetic radiation although I have not followed it in great
detail or done research in the area.  I have been a participant in the
nuclear power safety debate and I find certain similarities in both the
content and the players.  [...]

While I expect that the objection to the use of the term "radiation" in this
case is basically a public relations objection, there is a possible real
distiction to be made.  For the low frequency fields much of the exposure
occurs in the near field region.  The fastidious might wish to limit the use
of the term "radiation" to the far field region.

Since I am more impressed by mechanistic explanations than I am by
statistical epidemiological evidence, I am willing to believe that the
differences in field configuration in the two regions may cause different
biological effects.

&gt;There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of the Dept. of Engineering
&gt;and Public Policy at CMU to lobby the public that there's nothing to get
&gt;excited about here, that scientists don't all agree on the interpretation of
&gt;the data and that therefore we should follow a "prudent" course (they use that
&gt;word a lot), by which they mean no government regulation at all, just maybe you
&gt;should put your electric blanket back on the shelf in the closet.

This is what I have come to expect of this group at CMU.  My own feeling
about prudence is that exposure should be minimized in the face of
uncertainty about safety.  However I think that this can be taken too far.
Wide right-of-ways under high voltage transmission lines seem reasonable to
me.  But I'm not going to get too excited about the effects of electric
blankets.  (But then, I don't use the things.)

BTW, don't be fooled by the signature.  I am a theoretical physicist by
training and spent twenty-some years of my life on the faculty of physics at
a large state university.

Here are excerpts from a story that appeared on the front page of the
Thursday, August 17, 1989 NEW YORK TIMES:

DESIGN FLAW SEEN AS FAILURE CAUSE IN TRIDENT 2 TESTS --- by Andrew Rosenthal

WASHINGTON --- The Navy believes designers made a fundamental miscalculation
in building its biggest nuclear missile, the Trident 2, which has failed in 
two of its three undersea tests, a Navy official said yesterday.

The first missile exploded on March 21, four seconds after it was launched
from a submarine off the east coast of Florida.  The second test, on August 2,
went largely according to plan, but the third blew up Tuesday.

Rear Adm. Kenneth C. Malley, head of the Navy's ballistic missile program, said
that despite computer simulations, engineers seriously underestimated how much
pressure is on the Trident 2 as it hurtles up through the water from its
submarine launcher.  He said they had also failed to anticipate the effect of
"water jets" caused by the missile's movement. ...

The Trident 2, which is 44 feet long and weighs 130,000 pounds at launching, is
much longer and nearly twice as heavy as the Trident 1 [...which is now in
service and which Trident 2 is scheduled to replace...].  Although engineers
expected the larger missile to create more turbulence than the Trident 1 as it
passed through the water, they miscalculated how much more and what effect that
would have on the Trident 2's rocket engines.  ...  During testing "water jets"
caused by the missile's movement contributed to the turbulence.  After
reviewing the tests of the Trident 1, the Navy said, such jets were present,
but had gone unnoticed because they had not affected the smaller missile's
flight.  ...

The first time the missile was tested at sea, Admiral Malley said, the
unexpectedly strong pounding from the water jet caused the (missile's rocket)
nozzles to malfunction as soon as they fired above the water's surface.  The
missile began spinning in a spectacular cartwheel until it self-destructed. ...

In the third test, ... instead of spinning end-over-end, (the missile) began
flying on what at first seemed to be a normal trajectory ... "Then it appeared
to be losing some thrust control and it self-destructed."  Admiral Malley said
he had not yet studied the full body of data from the test.  But he said it
appeared that the aft-end pressure had severed electrical connections... 

Asked whether the failures were a result of a design error or of a flaw in
manufacturing that left the rocket weaker than it should have been, Admiral
Malley said, "The device was built to specification.  There is no question that
it was designed the way it was intended to be designed."

As a result of the miscalculation, Malley said in an interview, the original
nozzles on the missile's first-stage rocket were not strong enough to withstand
the additional turbulence, and they had to be redesigned after the first test
missile exploded.  The Navy now must go back to the laboratories to determine
why the rebuilt nozzles failed Tuesday, Malley said. ...

Until the test failures, the Trident 2 was the one element of the Defense
Department's nuclear modernization program that was moving along smoothly,
having successfully completed 16 of 19 test firings from land...

Because there are so many Navy officials and subcontractors involved in the
Trident 2 program, it is impossible at this point to assess when or by whom
the miscalculations were made.  The prime contractor is Lockheed Corp. ...

Exerpts from: "Voyager and the Grandest Tour Ever:  Catching the Wave of
the Century", by Bruce Murray, California Institute of Technology's
&lt;Engineering &amp; Science&gt;, Summer 1989, (no volume number).  This article
is itself exerpted from "Journey into Space:  The First Three Decades of
Space Expolration", by Bruce C. Murray, publ. W.W.Norton &amp; Co., 1989.

[Except for inadventent typos, the following is an exact quotation
from the article, including the misused quotation marks. I shall refrain
from other remarks, leaving such to our Gentle Editor.]

	...
	Voyager 2's gyroscopes and electronic brain were alive during
the Titan/Centaur launch, monitoring the sequence of
events in order to take control upon separation.  But here the unexpected
happened: Voyager 2's brain experienced robotic "vertigo."  In its confusion,
it helplessly switched to backup sensors, presuming its "senses" to be
defective.  Still no relief from its disorientation.  Mercifully, the
panicky robot brain remained disconnected from Voyager's powerful thrusters,
so it did not cause damage to the launch.  The Centaur attitude-conrol
system -- under its normally behaving brain -- stayed in charge,
suffering no "vertigo" and, as planned, electronically correcting the
disequilibriam of Voyager's brain just before separation.
	From the control center John Casani and his terse engineers 
helplessly watched (though mostly they listened, because there were not
enough monitors available to us in Florida) the antics of Voyager 2's
disoriented brain.  One hour and 11 minutes after lift-off, Voyager 2
fired for 45 seconds its own special solid rocket to provide the final
push it needed to get to Jupiter.
	One and a half minutes after Voyager's key rocket burn ended, a
ten-foot arm holding the television camera and other remote-sensing
instruments was unlatched and deployed as planned.  Then, more trouble.
Voyager's anxious brain once again sensed an emergency.  This time it
switched thrusters and actuated valves to control the tiny bursts of
gas used to stablize its orientation.  Voyager's robotic "alter ego"
(its executive program) then challenged portions of its own brain in
a frantic attempt to correct the orientation failure it sensed.  Next,
Voyager followed the procedures JPL engineers had installed to cope with
the most dreaded emergency for a robot in deep space -- spacecraft
attitude disorientation.  (In August 1988 the Phobos 1 spacecraft of
the Soviet Union succumbed to such an emergency after receiving an
erroneous ground command, and in March 1989 Phobos 2 evidently met a
similar fate.)  Voyager shut down most communications with Earth in
order to begin its reorientation.
	Seventy-nine minutes passed while Voyager 2 stuggled alone and
unaided to find the sun and establish a known orientation.  Finally,
it radioed confirming data.  For the moment, Voyager 2 was stable.
	It was all work and no celebration that afternoon in the dimly
lit High Bay Conference Room, where, just days earlier, a seemingly
healthy Voyager 2 had checked out perfectly.  Were the redundant
sensors malfunctioning?  Was the state-of-theart brain defective?
	The technical discussion in the room was poorly illuminated too.
All the new, supersophisticated fault protection in Voyager's electronic
brain operated on the now-painful presumption that it would be triggered
&lt;only&gt; by a hardware failure billions of miles from Earth.  In that
event Voyager would be unable to establish even emergency communications
with its human handlers, who could not help it much at that distance
in any case.  As a consequence Voyager had been programmed virtually to
shut off communications with Earth during such emergencies and to fix itself.
But, somehow, these deep-space procedures had been triggered right after
the launch.
	Now, because of those disrupted communications, we were not
receiving the useful flow of engineering-status measurements.  We
simply lacked enough information to figure out the causes of Voyager's
mysterious behavior, even though the spacecraft was so close to Earth
that communications normally would have been feasible under any emergency.
	...
	... There had been no hardware problems in the brain -- just a
slight but serious missetting of computer parameters.
	...

         Computer filer got $325,000 in phony refunds, IRS claims
                          John King, Globe Staff
                   (Boston Globe of Thursday, August 17)

Clever tax preparers are one thing, but a clever bookkeeper who allegedly
pried 325,000 dollars from the Internal Revenue Service found himself on
the wrong side of the law yesterday.

In what may be the nation's first charge of electronic tax fraud, IRS
special agents yesterday arrested Alan N. Scott of West Roxbury [a part of
Boston], saying he claimed 45 fraudulent income tax refunds for amounts
ranging from 3,000 dollars to 23,000 dollars.

The IRS charges that Scott, 37, used the service's new electronic filing
system -- open only to tax preparers -- to submit phony claims with assumed
names and Social Security numbers.  In some cases, the names used were of
people in prison, according to Chief Kenneth Claunch, IRS Criminal
Investigation Division.

``The computer age has spawned a new breed of criminal,'' Claunch said in a
statement.

New in tools, perhaps.  As for the basic idea -- filing a false return in
order to snare an unwarranted refund -- that's old hat, admitted IRS
spokeswoman Marti Melecio.

``I can't say that it's a new trick.  We've had fraud cases with paper
returns,'' Melecio said.  ``The time frame is different, though.  With
electronic filings, the returns come back in two or three weeks.''

According to the IRS, Scott received electronic filing status on Jan. 31.
He did this by using a false Social Security number, and making false
statements on his application.  However, the IRS also says Scott
electronically filed 10 returns where he used his own name as a preparer,
and these returns appear to be legitimate.

The scheme was uncovered by the a [sic] ``questionable refund detection
team,'' at the IRS service center in Andover [Massachusetts].  Also, the
IRS credited a tip from an unnamed boston bank ``which reported a
suspicious electronic transfer of funds to an individual,'' presumably
Lewis [sic].

If conviced, Lewis [sic] faces a possible prison sentence and up to 250,000
dollars in fines on each of the counts of fraud.

In Friday's (11 Aug) Wall Street Journal, there was an article on cellular
telephones.  Of particular interest was the discussion of using cellular phones
to replace two way radio in police departments in "sting" operations.  It seems
that the people they were chasing listened to police band scanners and were
evading the police, so the police switched to celluar telephones to maintain
secrecy.

I'm not sure if I'm more touched or scared by such misplaced faith in a new
technology.  (The lack of secrecy in cellular phones has been discussed at
length in this forum.)

The August 7 issue of _Aviation Week and Space Technology_ has a feature story
on how well flight automation has been received by aircrews.  Earl Wiener
(co-editor of _Human Factors in Aviation_, in which similar stats were 
revealed) has released the results of a survey of some 200 757 pilots.  The
data shows strikingly opposed opinions--either the pilots love the automated
systems, or they hate them.

The article mentions one problem, which hasn't gotten much press attention, is
that the automated systems encourage a "heads-down" atmosphere under 10,000'.
The UI's are apparently so bad that a single pilot must devote all his
attention to updating and manipulating information in their flight management
and control control systems (FMCS), in effect reducing the cockpit to
single-pilot operation for substantial periods.

The article also mentions identification of various problems that need 
attention:

"* Further reduction of workload in low-workload phases of flight caused by
automation (for example, long haul over water.

* Further increase in workload in high-workload phases of flight caused by 
automation (for example, terminal area).

* A potential for substantially increased "head-down" time.

* Difficulty in recovering from automation failure.

* Reluctance of flight crews to take over a malfunctioning automated system.

* Deterioration of pilot/controller basic skills.

* Complacancy, lack of vigilance and boredom in workers.

* Introduction of unanticipated failure modes.

* Incompatibility between advanced automated aircraft, existing air traffic 
control capability and the rest of the fleet."

The article also notes some fairly critical UI problems:

"Pilots even work around aspects of the computer program that do[es] not
provide the desired performance.  For example, crews who want to start vertical
navigation descents earlier than the computed top-of-descent point simply tell
the computer they plan to use anti-ice when, in fact, they do not, or they
program in a fictitious tail wind.  The computer then refigures a new
top-of-descent poin tto the pilot's liking.  This procedure is often needed
because the Boeing 757, considered an aerodynamically stable aircraft, does not
descend as readily as earlier models.  Pilots like to avoid using speed brakes
to conserve fuel and avoid disturbing passengers."

It's interesting to note that Wiener wishes to solve the automation problem by
imposing a greater level of automation (the article is fairly vague about what
he has in mind--my interpretation is a combination of higher-level services and
better-designed user interfaces).

The article doesn't treat cockpits utilizing unconventional control laws, such
as those the A320's fly-by-wire system utilizes (but otherwise, A320 flight 
management principles are quite similar to the systems utilized elsehwere).


Some comments and opinions:

The problems at altitudes less than 10,000' are quite interesting.  Automation has generally been marketed as a "workload-saving" item.  Particularly
after the midair collision between a PSA 727 and a Cessna 172 in 1978, simplified cockpits, and consequent automation, was marketed as a means of keeping
the pilots' eyes looking out of the airplane.  In effect, however, the basic
problem is unsolved (if, indeed, it was a problem, which is another story).
Automation has done *nothing* to simplify the actual tasks of *flying* the 
airplane: the older autopilots, with heading, altitude, and airspeed select, 
were excellent aids to operating in control environments.  The key in the 
current problems seems to be in the flight management control system, which 
first started entering widespread use in 1982-83.  The idea behind the FMCS 
was that it could be programmed with economical flight profiles, and then be 
coupled to the autopilot, thus creating a highly economical flight.  Comments 
in the Aviation Week article (which, incidentally, runs counter to the gung-ho attitudes in similar technology reviews in _Flying_ and _Flight 
International_) suggest that pilots are not utilizing the system, and that 
the system itself is not selecting the most optimal flight characteristics.
In effect, they appear to be reverting to manual manipulation of the autoqpilot.

Many computers connected to the Internet have recently experienced unauthorized
system activity.  Investigation shows that the activity has occurred for
several months and is spreading.  Several UNIX computers have had their
"telnet" programs illicitly replaced with versions of "telnet" which log
outgoing login sessions (including usernames and passwords to remote systems).
It appears that access has been gained to many of the machines which have
appeared in some of these session logs.  (As a first step, frequent telnet
users should change their passwords immediately.)  While there is no cause for
panic, there are a number of things that system administrators can do to detect
whether the security on their machines has been compromised using this approach
and to tighten security on their systems where necessary.  At a minimum, all
UNIX site administrators should do the following:

o Test telnet for unauthorized changes by using the UNIX "strings"
  command to search for path/filenames of possible log files.  Affected
  sites have noticed that their telnet programs were logging information
  in user accounts under directory names such as "..." and ".mail".

In general, we suggest that site administrators be attentive to configuration
management issues.  These include the following:


o Test authenticity of critical programs - Any program with access to
  the network (e.g., the TCP/IP suite) or with access to usernames and
  passwords should be periodically tested for unauthorized changes.
  Such a test can be done by comparing checksums of on-line copies of
  these programs to checksums of original copies.  (Checksums can be
  calculated with the UNIX "sum" command.)  Alternatively, these
  programs can be periodically reloaded from original tapes.

o Privileged programs - Programs that grant privileges to users (e.g.,
  setuid root programs/shells in UNIX) can be exploited to gain
  unrestricted access to systems.  System administrators should watch
  for such programs being placed in places such as /tmp and /usr/tmp (on
  UNIX systems).  A common malicious practice is to place a setuid shell
  (sh or csh) in the /tmp directory, thus creating a "back door" whereby
  any user can gain privileged system access.

o Monitor system logs - System access logs should be periodically
  scanned (e.g., via UNIX "last" command) for suspicious or unlikely
  system activity.

o Terminal servers - Terminal servers with unrestricted network access
  (that is, terminal servers which allow users to connect to and from
  any system on the Internet) are frequently used to camouflage network
  connections, making it difficult to track unauthorized activity.
  Most popular terminal servers can be configured to restrict network
  access to and from local hosts.

o Passwords - Guest accounts and accounts with trivial passwords
  (e.g., username=password, password=none) are common targets.  System
  administrators should make sure that all accounts are password
  protected and encourage users to use acceptable passwords as well as
  to change their passwords periodically, as a general practice.  For
  more information on passwords, see Federal Information Processing
  Standard Publication (FIPS PUB) 112, available from the National
  Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
  Springfield, VA 22161.

o Anonymous file transfer - Unrestricted file transfer access to a
  system can be exploited to obtain sensitive files such as the UNIX
  /etc/passwd file.  If used, TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol -
  which requires no username/password authentication) should always be
  configured to run as a non-privileged user and "chroot" to a file
  structure where the remote user cannot transfer the system /etc/passwd
  file.  Anonymous FTP, too, should not allow the remote user to access
  this file, or any other critical system file.  Configuring these
  facilities to "chroot" limits file access to a localized directory
  structure.

o Apply fixes - Many of the old "holes" in UNIX have been closed.
  Check with your vendor and install all of the latest fixes.

If system administrators do discover any unauthorized system activity,
they are urged to contact the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).

I am aware of the RISKS attitude to redundancy, however I would like to
present an Australian viewpoint on this incident. (see RISKS 9.9)

First, some background. I have worked for the Australian Defence Dept.
for six and a half years: five and a half as a programmer/analyst on
real-time systems, and twelve months in Computer Security. I am currently
on a twelve-month posting with the NCSC, gaining experience in software
verification.

The following newspaper article arrived in the mail from home yesterday.
It is from the Melbourne 'Sun News-Pictorial', dated 8/8/89.

"Terminal virus rocks defence" by George Megalogenis.

   "Australia's Defence Department has been bugged by a computer virus
posing as a messenger for an illicit drug.
   Confused staff where [sic] greeted with the message: 'Your machine
has been stoned - Legalise marijuana' when they tried to operate infected
terminals last week.
   A spokesman confirmed yesterday that eight high-security terminals in
Canberra came down with the bug.
   The defence bug was reported as having destroyed sensitive departmental
data.
   The department is remaining tight-lipped on the source of the infection
as it does not want to encourage computer hackers to pull similar stunts.
   A computer virus begins life as an innocent program on a particular 
terminal.
   But a hacker can use it to cause mischief by spreading the unwanted or
false information to other terminals and systems.
   The programmer can also direct the virus to destroy existing files.
   The department spokesman said the technical virus had been 'isolated
and the computers decontaminated'.
   The spokesman said he could not rule out the possibility that the virus 
was created by accident.
   The department was working on programs designed to weed out future
intruders before they caused any damage, he said."

A few remarks on the preceding:

Ignoring (for the moment) the quality of the article: I am not
surprised "the department is remaining tight-lipped"; based on my
knowledge of the department, and of similar occurences in other government
organisations, the most likely explanation for the appearance of the virus
on Defence PCs is that someone brought into the office their own infected
floppies, probably to play games. This sort of thing is not looked on
kindly by the Department (to put it mildly). 

[The RISKS 9.9 posting suggested that the office, involved in virus/anti-virus
research, might have had an internal accident: certainly possible - eight
machines  infected smacks of carelessness, but obviously someone was, somewhere
along the line, whatever the actual cause.]

Now to the quality of the article: this is (fairly obviously) an appalling 
piece of reportage - lack of technical knowledge on the part of the writer 
(and sub-editor) is quite evident in (among other things) the persistent use 
of the word "terminal" instead of "personal computer", and the amazing 
statement that "A computer virus begins life as an innocent program...".

It is acknowledeged that the 'Sun' is not the highest quality newspaper
in Australia - nevertheless it is not a typical tabloid-style either.
Therefore, I personally find the lack of quality of information in this
article disturbing (especially as the 'Sun' had given good-quality reporting
and commentary on the Internet worm). 

The main RISK? the 'Sun' is the highest circulation paper in Victoria, if not 
Australia [approx. 650,000 daily]; its readership is typically blue-collar 
and secretarial/clerical type people - those most likely to be naive users of 
personal computers, and most likely to be influenced by (i.e. believe
verbatim) the contents of this article.

        W. German computer hackers accused of spying for Soviets
                 (Boston Globe of Thursday, August 17)

Associated Press (Frankfurt) --- Three computer hackers, suspected of giving
the Soviet Union information from military and industrial computers worldwide,
have been indicted on espionage charges, prosecutors said yesterday.  The West
German government called the breakup of the spy ring, which gave the KGB secret
data from 12 countries, including the United States, ``a major blow'' to the
Soviets.  In a four-page statement, Kurt Rebman, the chief federal prosecutor,
said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for endangering
national security.

Another message in the thread of comments from my friend (replies to me for
relaying, or to RISKS).                  			Tim

Douglas W. Jones states that the terms software engineering and software
engineer have gotten out of control.  He is correct, but it seems to me
that his solution, to regulate the use of the title "software engineer",
is a rather weak one.

In his comment, he gives a general outline of a set of standards that
have been suggested to restrict the use of the term engineer, and suggests
that some similar approach might be used:

&gt;  1) People who have passed a state professional engineering examination.
&gt; 
&gt;  2) People who have graduated from an accredited 4-year engineering program.
&gt; 
&gt;  3) People who have graduate degrees.

The problem with regulating the term is that it does not regulate the work
that the individual does.  In my last comment, I mentioned that I have worked
with people who had A.A. degrees or were merely high school graduates who were
called "software engineers".  What I should probably have made clearer is that
it is not simply that they call themselves that; it is what they are called by
their employers.  They will be doing the same work, with or without the title,
as long as they continue to work for those employers.

Software engineering, even compared to electrical engineering is a
very young discipline.  While I would meet the second of the criteria he
lists, most of the professors I studied under to get the degree would not.
As a group, their doctorates were in areas ranging from Physics to English, with
only the younger members of the department having degrees in Computer Science.

Software engineering is still very much in its infancy.  There are several
basic rules that derive from this fact:

1)  Acceptable levels of knowledge and techniques for today will not
    be acceptable tomorrow.

2)  There are not enough "real" software engineers available to do
    the work that requires their services.

3)  There are a lot of people out there who call themselves software
    engineers who are not "real".

An engineer, as defined by the firm I happen to work for now, is someone
with a degree in an engineering discipline from a school with a recognized
engineering department.  A software engineer is an engineer who writes
software, as opposed to a computer programmer who is a non-engineer who
writes software.  The two may work side-by-side on exactly the same task,
doing exactly the same thing, but that is the only difference.  Who gets
assigned to what task is largely dictated by what the previous experience
of the person is, not job title.  This is in a large aerospace firm.

An engineer, as defined by the last place I worked for, was someone with
a certain minimum level of experience who worked overtime for free.  The
degree was accepted in lieu of that minimum level of experience, but
that was about the only difference.  The two people, one degreed, one not
may work side-by-side on exactly the same task, doing exactly the same
thing, with exactly the same job title.  Who gets assigned to what task is
largely dictated by what the previous experience of the person is, not
degree status.  This is not a large aerospace firm, but how different is
it really?

Is the fact that the software engineer got a degree 29 years ago in
electrical engineering that significant to his job function?  Many
of the professors I studied under when I got my own degree had their
degrees in areas unrelated to computer science.

One of the most reliable (in terms of safe and effective product) "software
engineers" I had the pleasure of working with in the past is not degreed.
He learned his trade by the apprenticeship method, still one of the most
reliable methods.  He spent a great deal of time and effort in understanding
the application area in which he worked, and the effort showed.  One of the
least reliable "software engineers" I worked with went to great lengths to
make sure we all know he had a MS in Software Engineering from a good technical
school.  He was ultimately laid off because of the terrible quality of the
code he produced, and because he refused to learn from people who were
academically "beneath" him.

it is unreasonable trying to regulate something that is not be possible to
regulate.  (Sure we can limit the use of the term, but can any agency
actually place that stringent a limit on who actually does the work?
When the people are simply not there to do it?  Ask the INS about illegal
aliens doing household chores and working in factories sometime.)

I feel that a far more effective solution at this time, is to attempt to
communicate with the companies involved with RISKy projects (either building
them, buying them, or using them) about the type of expertise needed for these
projects, to develop a set of livable standards that take into account the
level of expertise presently available in the general population of "software
engineers" available in the field (as the MOD has tried to do), and to attempt
to produce enough QUALIFIED people to meet the genuine need for them.  In
this way, we have a livable (albeit painful) solution for the short term,
and a reasonable hope for something better in the future.

&gt; From: Rodney Hoffman &lt;Hoffman.ElSegundo@Xerox.com&gt;
&gt; Investigators said the individuals put together a major conspiracy
&gt; by knowing how to access airline computers to put travel itineraries
&gt; in the computer system.                           ++++++++++++++++++

In the interests of equal access to scammery to all, I will divulge some of the
deep secrets of how to access airline computers and insert travel itineraries.
This can be done from virtually any telephone nationwide (even a dial phone!).
The process is virtually immune to tracing if you use a public phone; your
identity is protected.

First, it is necessary to determine the secret access code for the airline
computer.  To do this it is necessary to penetrate the telephone company's
databases.  Pick up the phone and dial 1-800-555-1212.  This will connect you
to a human-assisted database of access codes.  Say (for instance) "American
Airlines Reservations".  The database system will read you a number,
800-433-7300.

Hang up and dial this number (probably prefixed by a 1).  This will connect you
to another human-assisted database which stores all of American Airlines'
itineraries.  Simply state the date, flight number, departure and destination
cities, and passenger name.  It's that easy!  You can later dial the same
access number and cancel or modify your itineraries.  The system even includes
search functions if you don't know the flight number, and an extensive help
system (just say "How do I make a reservation?").  It's almost like they tried
to make this sort of illicit use simple.                          Jordan Brown

  [Cute.  But I suspect unauthorized on-line access might also be parlayed 
  into other spin-offs, such as getting tickets issued without paying. PGN]

WATER SHUT-OFFS NOT INTENTIONAL
(From The Daily Spectrum; St. George, Utah, serving millions of acres
of slickrock and a few thousand people!)

Pleasant Grove, Utah(AP)

   Pleasant Grove city officials say they have found and fixed the reason
for several water users being cut off--despite having paid their bills.
   An apologetic City Recorder Charmaine Childs explained that in June,
Pleasant Grove switched to a new envelope bill, replacing the postcard
billing it had used for years.
   The new bills include an envelope for residents to mail their payments.
What officials didn't realize, however, that the bar code printed on the
                                                 ^^^^^^^^
envelope was for Orem rather than Pleasant Grove.
   As the bar codes are read electronically by automated postal equipment,
                        ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
when residents mailed their water payments they went to Orem instead of
Pleasant Grove.
   Childs said the Pleasant Grove postmaster noticed the wrong bar code
on some of the envelopes and asked postal employees to watch for the blue
envelopes and route them to Pleasant Grove rather than Orem.

This story appears in Datalink (UK Trade weekly) August 21st 1989.  It
contains no dates or references by which it can be checked.

"Some cock-ups are bigger than others.  Some are little but some come in
such gigantic proportions that they stretch credulity.  Take, for example,
the mishap that afflicted the Australian Commonwealth Bank's computer.  One
could imagine all sorts of things going wrong with such an installation
which keeps the scores on thousands of customers.  But it's hard to imagine
what went wrong when a malfunction at the bank doubled every deposit that
customers made.  As DP manager Pete Martin says: ' Of course it's a cock-up,
it's a vast bloody cock-up.  The hazards of computing are only limited by
your imagination.'  "

Is this the story of mounting a transaction tape twice, previously reported

I read with some interest the recent proposals for auto-pilot systems for
passenger vehicles.  I must confess, these fill me with horror. The thought of
a systems failure on one or more such vehicles, and the inability of the others
to do much about it, is my greatest worry.  Call me a technophobe if you like,
but *NOBODY* can guarantee 100% reliability.  The problems of power failures,
parity errors, external magnetic/radio fields, poor maintenance etc. are as yet
still serious considerations as to why such systems should not be implemented.
Systems based on digitised street maps are never going to work - i can still
remember being told by my brother, who was navigating me, `Take a 90 right 50
yards after the farmhouse...' only to discover that the farmhouse had been
demolished the week before...  This caused great amusement to the wreckers
who recovered the resultant wreck from the swamp and towed it back to
civilisation.  How an auto-navigation system manufacturer would explain this
sort of problem when 100 card ended up in the swamp, i cannot imagine.

The fewer levels of `indirection' in such systems the safer they become - to
place a (semi-)intelligent control system between the driver and the vehicle
is by definition reducing driver control (although having driven in the States
this may be no bad thing!) and increasing the number of possible failure modes.

Two things to remember::

1) Keep It Simple, Stupid!

2) If you never depended on it, you can carry on without it.

Blind trust in computer systems struck home this week.  My daughter brought her
car off-island for the initial 7500-mile dealer checkup that included rotating
and rebalancing the tires and checking the alignment.  After the return ferry
trip and drive home, she noticed a terrible shimmy and called the dealer to
complain.  The dealer claimed that they then determined that their computer had
been malfunctioning, and apologized profusely.  (Perhaps the mechanic was not
sufficiently computer literate?)  She immediately took the car to the best tire
man on the island, who said he had NEVER seen anything so badly out of balance.
(The dealer covered the cost.)

Are there no consistency checks or reasonableness checks on the results of such
computerized systems?  Are they designed to be mechanic-proof?  Are we getting
to the point that almost everyone in society is going to have to be not just
computer literate, but keenly aware of the risks and pitfalls?  Probably No,
No, and Yes.

    [I contemplated the plight of a land-locked driver having to negotiate such
    an ill-adjusted car when heavily laden, and came up with something about
    where the lubber meets the load.  As I have been far too conservative in my
    interstitial insertions of late, I thought you wouldn't mind.  PGN]

It sounds like Jordan is, like me, growing tired of all these stories about
"computer crime".  What is computer crime anyway?  Crime has existed since the
dawn of civilization, and criminals have always been eager to use the latest
technology for their sinister deeds.  Guns, knives, cars, matches, even panty
hose are used by criminals daily, but when is the last time you read a 
newspaper article about "panty hose crime?"

Crime is crime.  It took a long time before the term "computer error" fell
out of favour with most people;  how much longer will it take for "computer
crime" to reach the same fate?

The July 17 issue of Aviation Week has a very interesting letter from P.G.
Boughton, commenting on the British 737 crash in which the pilot shut down
the good engine instead of the bad one:

	"I am amazed that Boeing has taken all the blame...  I am an
	F-14/F-4 backseater with more than 3000 hr.  Twice I have had
	experienced pilots shut down the incorrect engine.  Both times
	we had enough airspeed and altitude to get the engine relit.
	The hardest obstacle... was getting the pilot to try a restart.
	He just could not believe he shut down the incorrect engine...

	"In trainers I can get about 10% of experienced aviators to
	miss a bright, flashing FIRE light at eye level for up to 5
	minutes by introducing multiple emergencies, hurried approaches,
	and frequent simulated approach-control radio transmissions...
	The British 737 pilots were in just such a multiple emergency."

Last night on National Public Radio's re-broadcast of BBC news, there was an
extensive BBC report on the hazards of airliner crew fatigue.  Although the
bulk of the report was not earth-shattering and contained nothing particularly
new to RISKS readers, there were a few points of interest:

With the increasing computerization of airliner operation, there is less and
less for crews to do.  Planes are basically flying themselves, and crews have
been reduced to monitors.  Human beings are notoriously bad monitors; we have a
basic desire to "do" things; that is, to solve problems by moving in a
step-by-step process, reaching conclusions and beginning work on a new problem.
No one is yet suggesting that airliner computerization has gone too far, but
all parties admitted that flight crews now routinely fall asleep in the flight
deck.  This is no longer unusual; studies indicate that sleeping crews are so
common that Boeing and other manufacturers are considering adding loud beepers
that go off randomly.  [Wouldn't it make more sense to give them something
constructive to DO?]  Many airlines have already adopted official procedures
whereby flight attendants are required to visit the flight deck every 15 or 20
minutes to wake up the crew.  A former RAF pilot and current editor of
_Flight_International_ discussed how in the "old days," it was necessary to
flip switches, study analog dials, and mentally compute problems.  This kept
crews busy on tasks that they knew were critical.  Today, all possible factors
are displayed on CRT screens, pre-calculated for easy access, whether the crew
has asked for the displays or not.  This leads to an attitude of complacency
and unimportance.  Biological time clocks are not well understood, and may play
a major factor in crew fatigue.  One pilot mentioned that on overwater night
flights in which the sun rises in front of the plane, it was virtually
impossible to keep awake, even if you weren't tired.  The new 747-400, which is
flown by only two crew members, always carries a spare crew, as it is designed
for extremely long-range flights.  Still, no one wants to return to the days of
the trans-oceanic flying boats, when journeys took days and everyone,
passengers and crew included, was awake during the day and asleep in hotels at
night.  We pay a price for our "instantaneous" transportation system.

In response to Rodney Hoffman &lt;Hoffman.ElSegundo@Xerox.com&gt;'s summary
  of an article by William Trombley in the Los Angeles Times on 1989 07 24:

Can anyone hypothesize any sort of fail-safe mechanism for the proposed scheme
to "platoon" vehicles at 70 mph with 50 foot separation?  50 feet at 70 mph is
less than half a second (thank heavens I made it through school before
metrification was complete :-)).  When the vehicle ahead of you suffers some
sort of catastrophic failure of the sort about which RISKS readers lie awake at
night contemplating, it seems to me that half a second is insufficient time to
reassert manual control, but that any attempt at automatic collision avoidance
in a crisis is likely to be a worse alternative.  Did the article mention how
the system was expected to behave under hazardous circumstances?

Compiled from various short articles in the British Media:

     The first person to be electronically tagged has spent the first
first night (17 August 1989) of his sentence in prison, since British Telecom
has not yet installed a telephone at his house. The man in question is
on burglary charges, and is unemployed, and the line will be paid-for
by the government. British Telecom has assured that they would
complete the installation today, 17 August 89.
     This is the first case of electronic tagging, which is on trial here
in UK. It has been presented as an alternative for minor jail sentences,
to reduce over-crowding of UK's prisons. 
Apparently, it is already practised in some states in US. The
device is an electronic beeper which is constantly worn by the criminal,
and cannot be removed. A central computer makes random telephone calls
at the house, where the criminal has to apply the beeper to the receiver,
in order to prove that he is present. In this way, the person cannot go
more than about 200ft from his phone, and has to stay in his house. There
has already been some criticism about this new method, both from the
criminal's point of view and the general public. Some say it would be
humiliating to wear the tag, since it shows in public. Some say this is
the start of "1984" by Orwell, where people's whereabouts are controlled
by a computer. Others say that the sentence doesn't have any meaning, since
the criminal can enjoy life at home.
The debate is not over, it's only beginning.

The original poster suggested using the UNIX utilities "strings", "sum", and
"last" to detect a security intrusion.  As someone who was once involved from
the other side, I would like to suggest that potential victims consider the
possibility that these programs have been tampered with.  They might be blind
to contraband files or other records.

You should also consider the possibility that a contraband file system has
been created in the unused disk space of your system.

A research and development lab located at Ft. Belvoir Virginia had their PC's
infected with the Jerusalem, Version B, Virus.  Further investigation
uncovered the virus entered the lab through a DEMO software disk from ASYST
Software Technologies supplied with a IEEE-488 board from METROBYTE.  The
infected program is RTDEMO2.EXE.

In a conversation with Mr. Dave Philipson from ASYST, to the best of his
knowledge, 50 to 100 copies of the infected software were released.  The
infection entered their facility through software received from their parent
company in England.

Mr. Brent Davis of METROBYTE informed me that the DEMO disk was supplied with
three (3) of their products; MBC-488, IE-488 and UCMBC-488.  METROBYTE is in
the process of contacting all purchasers of these products.

Many thanks to Mr. John McAfee for his assistance, SCAN34 which was used to
identify the type of virus, and M-JRUSLM which was used to eradicate the virus.

Both ASYST and METROBYTE  were extremely helpful and responded expeditiously
to the problem.  Many thanks to Mr. Brent Davis and Mr. Dave Philipson for
their action and assistance.

The following excerpts from Toronto newspapers indicate the reactions expressed
following the failure of a Tandem `non-stop' system at the Toronto Stock
Exchange August 16th. Note that the Tandem system did indeed not stop, but the
three disc drive failures prevented access to critical market information,
without which trading could not continue.

    "TSE `crash' drives trades to Montreal, Brokers curse computer system"
       (Mark Hallman, Financial Post, Thursday August 17, 1989, p. 1.)
     
A computer crash all but shut down trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange for
almost three hours yesterday, forcing tens of millions of dollars' worth of
trades to Montreal. ... [the crash] -- a multiple failure within a disc-drive
subsystem -- forced a halt at 9:41 AM. ... `Two pieces of hardware break down
and Bay Street breaks down.' said a sour Charles Mitchell, trader. ... `Who's
accountable for that?' ...

A TSE spokeswoman said the failure of both primary and backup systems had
never occurred since computers were installed 26 years ago. ...

`Today, the market floors are so automated that when you have this kind of
computer failure, there is nothing that can be done', exchange
President Pearce Bunting said. `The greater your dependence on computers, the
greater the risks.'
     
The exchange's computer assisted trading system (CATS) was not affected and
smaller stocks continued to trade.  But only about 25% of the stocks listed on
the TSE are traded using CATS. ...
     
`Everybody's very much annoyed,' McLean McCarthy's Mitchell said. `It's
costing us a lot of money.  I think the people upstairs in the exchange should
be held accountable for it.'

[Note: Exchange floor traders failed to haul out the traditional chalkboards 
to continue trading manually "in the interests of a fair market".]

                 "Fail-safe Tandem system fails"
                Geoffrey Rowan and Lawrence Surtees
                Globe and Mail, Aug. 17 1989, p. B-1

The stock market crash of 1989 -- yesterday's three-hour trading halt at the
Toronto Stock Exhange -- was caused by multiple failures in a computer [Tandem
VLX] designed to work even when some of its pieces are broken.
     
... Peter Richards, president of Tandem Computers Canada of Markham, ont.,
said the disk drives suffered three separate failures that were a `once in a
lifetime event'. ... Mr. Richards said yesterday's failure was not a computer
crash. `The whole system, minus the data on the one drive, was up and running
and available to the exchange during the entire morning.  That also meant that
recovery was done with the computers on-line, making it a quicker process than
with standard computers."
     
             "TSE seeking to prevent further computer chaos",
        Geoffrey Rowan, Globe &amp; Mail, August 21, 1989, p. B-1, B-4.

... `Fault-tolerance guarantees that you will not have a problem from any
single failure', said John Kane, vice-president for marketing strategy for
Tandem. `I've never heard of three failures at one one time.  I don't know what
the gods were doing to us.'

I've been watching the stream of messages deriding as hazardous, impossible,
stupid, etc., etc., the idea of automatic steering of cars on the highway with
some bemusement - and concern.  The purveyors of the lastest bit of technical
wizardry are always ready to call it "absolutely safe", "foolproof", and so
on.  In response, we seem to be developing a "nay-saying" attitude:  Any use
of computer controls is inherently unreliable, risky, even downright dange-
rous.  This "see no good" response is no better than the "see no evil" atti-
tude of the purveyors!

Let's try to think about the problem of controlling automobiles RATIONALLY
for a moment.  This is a problem which, WITH SUITABLE DESIGN, is MUCH better
solved by machines than by human beings!  Driving on a highway consists of
long periods of boredom punctuated by random, unpredictable moments in which
quick responses are required.  People are very bad at dealing with this kind
of situation.  They get bored, their attention wanders; few are adequately
trained to respond quickly, without hesitation or thought, to the near-instan-
taneous (on the human time scale) dangers which can arise.  Computers, on the
other hand, cannot get bored, cannot start thinking about their date that
evening, and can respond very quickly, without hesitation or panic, if
something goes wrong.

It is quite true that a system which mixed human with machine drivers would be
very hazardous:  Neither is good at dealing with the responses or the abili-
ties other.  In any case, I'll bet that MOST of the hazards of highway driving
are the result of problems with the human drivers, not with the road, the
mechanical parts, or other external factors.  In some 20 years of driving,
I've had my share of scary highway encounters.  Without a single exception,
they were all clearly the result of poor human decision-making:  Unexpected
lane changes without checking whether the lane was clear; driving way too fast
for the icy conditions of the road and going into a spin at 60 mph; wandering
to the edge of the road, touching the curb, then panicking, losing control
over the car, and wandering over several lanes of traffic before regaining
control.  And then of course there are the drunks and the druggies, who
account for a large percentage of accidents.

It is also quite true that the highway system as it is designed today was
intended mainly for human use.  Lane markers that are so clear to the human
visual system are notoriously difficult for computers to see, for example.
But if the goal is a computerized highway, there is no reason in the world to
limit yourself to systems that make sense to humans.  A lane marker is hard
to track, but a buried wire can be an absolute triviality.

Do you worry about the computers controlling elevators?  Elevators have been
controlled by digital computers - albeit relay-based - for 30 years or more.
They, too, are mechanical devices subject to all sorts of failure.

A computerized driving system, designed for such a purpose, operating in a
constrained environment, strikes me as quite practical.  It would have to be
designed carefully, with "fail-safe" modes - which should be doable since,
while tasks like finding the best route to a point 100 miles away require
global information and coordination, failing safe requires local information
(where are the cars around me, what do their computers claim they intend to
do in the next 100 ms., what do my sensors show they actually ARE doing (an
essential, and fairly simple backup) and so on.)

Any system can be implemented badly.  The structure of some systems makes bad
implementations almost inevitable.  Computer control of cars on today's road
system, in combination with today's drivers, would be such a system - and it
seems to be the system most people are commenting on.  But it is NOT the
system we must necessarily build!

     If one were to compare the potential level of hazard, based, say, on
fatalities/100,000 miles, which might arise from failure of on-board computers
as opposed to the current levels of fatality caused by intoxicated and/or
drugged-out drivers, heart attacks, strokes, vehicular suicides, driver
error, police chases, etc., I wonder which methodology (hardware vs. wetware)
would actually be safer, once all the emotional rubbish about "men vs.
machines" was cleared away? Just a thought...

Bring back the trains, buses and streetcars. These are well-proven, reliable,
non-polluting ways of moving large numbers of people from place to place.
My intuition is that the problem of controlling thousands of automobiles from
a central point would rival Star Wars in complexity.

Don't worry too much about these.  If we can't get people to ride public
transportation (like buses and subways) then they won't sit still for the
equivalent in their own cars.  And anyway, how do you get off the "remoteway"
to stop at the cleaners?

&gt;Call me a technophobe if you like, but *NOBODY* can guarantee 100% ...

Well, it must be nice to live in the UK.  Here in the US we have a very
reliable manual system.  It can be so relied upon to kill 40,000 people a year
that we simply take it for granted.  A large percentage of these deaths involve
malicious manipulation of the system, i.e., the ingestion of alcohol and other
drugs.  You may be able to tolerate these deaths in preference to the risk of
computer systems that are less than perfect.  Quite candidly, I am sick to
death of a system that tolerates and defends this carnage, while crying
crocodile tears about computer-related risks.  It is high time that we got a
system for comparing risks that is prepared to put these lives on the same
scale that we use to condemn research into alternatives.

The New York Times concluded in a front page article that the American people
are far more likely to tolerate the huge death toll from their discretionary
and recreational use of highways, tobacco and alcohol than risks which are
comparatively minuscule from automated systems.  I may be stuck with that, but
it is insane and elitist.  It is high time somebody said so.

This has been brewing for a long time.  I enjoy the RISKS forum and tout
RISKS as the best digest available on e-mail/netnews.  But sometimes I
wonder.  Submitters seem to take great glee in presenting YAHS (Yet another
horrible story), but I seldom see any constructive comments -- or much
discussion at all -- mostly it is simply story time.  And most of the stories
are about why we should not trust technology.  But the unaided human is even
less reliable than the aided one!  Surely we could use the stories as design
examples and attempt to use them to inform our design, so that we could
invent technologies that were real improvements.  Instead of using the
examples for a cheap laugh, how about using them for instruction?

Let me provide some examples, using RISKS DIGEST 9.14 as my example, both
because it is handy and also because it had an excess of scare stories and
cheap conclusions.
	- - - 
1. Misdelivered mail because the barcode had the wrong zipcode, and the
machines read it and ignored the written address.  Moral: I would say that
you should not use code that was only machine readable.  Either do like the
banks do -- invent a machine-readable text that humans can also read -- or do
as supermarkets do - print the "English" version of the bar code beneath the
bar code.  This would make it a lot easier to catch errors of this sort.
(The best solution is to make postal machines that can read the handwriting
on the envelopes, but that is another decade away, at least).  (Because
barcode is already standardized as the postoffice system, why not require
English text to be printed beneath the barcode?  No change in equipment is
required at the Post Office end.)
	- - -
2. Automatic vehicle navigation systems. RISK readers are really scared of
this one, to judge by the number of times this is raised in RISKS. But what
are the alternatives?  Today we have roughly 50,000 fatalities a year in the
auto.  If driving were all done automatically, there would be occasional
massive screwups.  But would the death toll hit 50,000?  I bet it would
improve things.  (Yes, roughly 1/2 of those deaths have drinking implicated,
but I don't see how this changes my argument.)  These systems in aviation are
reasonably efficient.

Moreover, I see no reason why we couldn't make these things fail reasonable
softly, with lots of warning.  And yes, there would still be foul-ups, but
the baseline is not zero accidents -- it is 50,000 deaths).  (Admission of
guilt: I am consulting for a company that is designing one of these automated
systems.)
	- - -
3. One submitter's statement that "I am amazed that Boeing has taken all the
blame... " for pilot's shutting down the wrong engine.  The submitter than
cites other examples of pilots shutting down wrong engines, implying that
this is clearly pilot error (since it happens often and in various aircraft).
So Boeing -- or any particular manufacturer is clearly not at fault.  I
disagree.
    
This error has long been noted, first well documented in the 1940's.  But it
is the design of the cockpit controls that leads to the error.  So I would
still blame Boeing (or cockpit designers in general).  I have long thought
that many control panels are designed as if to increase the chance of error
(my experience is mostly in nuclear power and aviation), and that there are
redesigns -- perhaps using better technology -- that would minimize these
errors.  Shutting off the wrong engine is so common (relatively speaking),
that more design effort should have gone into finding better systems.
Instead, folks just blame the pilot.  That is the wrong attitude.

Look, people make errors.  Fact of life.  Therefore, good design will
anticipate those errors and make them either impossible or less likely, or
easier to detect and correct.

(Admission: I am off to Boeing next week to discuss cockpit design.  This
note will not win me friends at Boeing.)
	- - -
4. The report of airliner crew fatigue.  Cockpit crew fall asleep and so
cabin crew are now supposed to wake them up, or there are systems that blast
them with loud sounds.

My solution is quite different: let them sleep!

It is well known that the circadian rhythm has two minima -- about 2PM and
2AM.  And flying long hours across time zones is hard on the system.  Suppose
you let crew take naps.  As long as at least one member stayed awake, and if
the nap were announced and known about, there is likely to be no problem.
Modern aircraft can be flown with one crew member: more are needed only in
emergencies and in periods of high workloads (e.g., takeoff and landing or in
crowded airspace at low altitudes).  In fact, some airlines are experimenting
with allowing short naps.  The point is, human biology should be lived with,
not faught against.  Naps are natural, and overall efficiency will be
improved if you allow very short naps.  And I suspect we can develop schemes
whereby this improves safety, not hinders it.  (Citation: Somewhere buried in
my office is a reference to a paper on this topics I just heard at a meeting
of the (British) Royal Society on Human Factors in High Risk Technologies.)
	- - -
FINAL STATEMENT:

My argument is that human physiology and psychology are reasonably fixed: we
have to design systems to take account of our properties.  But too many of
our technologies are designed with only the technology is mind, and the human
is forced to cope.  Then when the problems ocur, we blame either the
techcnology isteslf or the person.  But neither is to blame -- it is the
design and use of the technology that is wrong.  We could design technologies
that inproved our lives and considered our strenghts and limitations.  That
is what I am after!
     (I was told just yesterday by a visiting NASA researcher that modern
     Air Traffic Control Centers are clustering operators based on
     considerations of cable lengths and cabling neeeds, even though this
     is non-optimal in terms of operator performance -- people who must
     communicate with one another are thereby put far apart.  It is this
     attitude I am fighting -- it isn't the technology that is wrong, it is
     the lack of consideration of the human side of the operation that is 
     faulty.)
People are especially good at some things, bad at others.  Creativity,
adaptability, flexibility, and extreme reliability are our strengths.
Continual alertness and precision in action or memory are our weaknesses.
Why not use technology in ways that take advantage of the former and allow
for the latter?  And in reviewing the cases presented in RISKS, why not use
them as guides to better designs and better technology, not as excuses to
lash out against the use of technology in general.

  [By the way, even in RISKS Volume 1 there was a complaint that RISKS dealt
  only with problems and not with solutions.  I have on several occasions noted
  that RISKS is limited by what is submitted, and that very few people have
  ever submitted success stories.  On the other hand, I frequently quote Henry
  Petroski's statement that we learn NOTHING from our successes and at least
  have a chance to learn from our failures.  But the real -- and not even
  subliminal -- purpose of RISKS is to make us all aware of what the risks are
  so that we can intelligently try to avoid them!  No disagreement there!  PGN]

APPENDIX A    Autonomous Systems: the Case of "Star Wars" 

                     Preface and Acknowledgements

     The aim of this book is two-fold: (1) to describe some of the problems
created for society by computers and (2) to show how these problems present
ethical dilemmas for computer professionals and computer users.

     The problems created by computers arise, in turn, from two main sources: 
from hardware and software malfunctions and from misuse by human beings. We 
argue that computer systems by their very nature are insecure, unreliable and
unpredictable -  and that society has yet to come to terms with the 
consequences. We also seek to show how society has become newly vulnerable to 
human misuse of computers in the form of computer crime, software theft, 
hacking, the creation of viruses, invasions of privacy, and so on. 

    Computer Ethics has evolved from our previous writings and in particular 
our experiences teaching two courses on the human and social context of 
computing to computer science students at Griffith University. One lesson we 
quickly learned was that computer science students cannot be assumed to possess
a social conscience or indeed have much awareness of social trends and global
issues. Accordingly, these courses have been reshaped in order to relate more 
closely to students' career goals, by focussing on the ethical dilemmas they 
will face in their everyday lives as computer professionals. 

     Many college and university computer science courses are now including -
or would like to include - an ethics component, but this noble objective has
been hampered by a lack of suitable teaching materials. Computer Ethics has
therefore been designed with teaching purposes in mind in an effort to help
rectify the shortage of texts.  That is why we have included numerous
up-to-date references, as well as scenarios, role-playing exercises and
`hypotheticals' in the `Suggestions for Further Discussion' at the end of
each chapter. The creative teacher should be able to build on these.

     Readers will notice that we have not adopted an explicit theoretical
framework and have avoided philosophical discussion of ethical theory. The
reason is that this book is but a first step, with the simple aim of
sensitizing undergraduate computer science students to ethical issues.
Neither will readers find a detailed account of the legislative position
around the world on the various topics discussed. This is because in each
country the legal situation is often complex, confused and changing fast -
and again this is not the purpose of the book.

     Finally, a note on sources. First, we have to acknowledge an enormous debt
to Peter G. Neumann, whose "Risks to the Public in Computer Systems" sections
in Software Engineering Notes, the journal of the Association of Computing
Machinery's Special Interest Group on Software (ACM-SIGSOFT) have provided
inspiration, amusement and a vast amount of valuable information. Long may he
continue. Second, we have to caution that many of these and other sources are
newspaper and media reports, which, like computers, are not 100 per cent
reliable.

Automated Planes Raising Concerns, by Carl Levin

Airlines are starting to fly a new generation of highly automated jets, raising
concerns among safety researchers that pilots will rely too much on the
technology and will lose or never learn the sharp skills and reflexes needed in
emergencies.

The first scientific study to compare pilots' performance in highly automated
and traditional cockpits began Tuesday In Atlanta. Researchers at the Federal
Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said the results would help them improve training for pilots who fly the
advanced planes and suggest ways to better design future craft.

The most advanced planes, like the Airbus A320 and Boeing's 757 and 767 models,
require little of the hands-on flying skill that older models need. For years,
planes have had autopilots to keep level and make simple turns, but with the
newest equipment pilots can push a few buttons and lean back while the plane
flies to its destination and Iands on a predetermined runway. Virtually every
calculation is made by computer.

More Control to Machines

"We're taking more and more of those functions out of human control and giving
them to the machines," said Dr. Clay Foushee, the chief F.A.A.  scientist for
human performance Issues. "The question becomes whether humans will really
respond when something goes wrong."

Aviation experts cite the performance of the pilots of two disabled United
Airlines jets in recent months as examples of how basic flying skills and years
of experience can make a big difference in emergencies.

After a disintegrating tail engine crippled the hydraulic system on a DC-10 on
July 19, Capt. Altred C. Haynes, a 33-year United veteran, and his crew devised
a way to crash-land the plane in Sioux City, lowa. Of the 296 people aboard,
185 survived.

Capt. David M. Cronin, also a United pilot for three decades, cited his crew's
extensive experience in the safe landing of his Boeing 747 in Honolulu in
February after a cargo door and large section of fuselage blew off the plane,
knocking out two of its four engines and killing nine passengers:

Airlines See New Planes as Safer

"Here's two examples of unforeseen Qand in fact some engineers would have said
impossibleQtypes of failures that were dealt with creatively by human
operators," said Bob Buley, a flight standards manager at Northwest Airlines.
"If we have human operators subordinated to technology then we're going to lose
that creativity. I don't have computers that will do that; I just don't."

Airlines like the equipment because it keeps a plane closer to its course than
a pilot can, cutting costs and increasing safety in some operations.

The head of pilot training for United William H. Traub, said that the carrier
had been flying highly automated Boeing 767's since 1982 and that he knew of no
deviations greater than 300 feet from assigned altitudes. "In that respect it's
a safer system," he said in a telephone interview.

Leading the parade of new technology is the A320, a jetliner made by the
European consortium Airbus Industrie, which began passenger service in this
country last month. Northwest is buying 100 of the jets and has started flying
the first two. Braniff, with 50 on order and 50 on option, plans to put its
first A320 into service this month.

In addition to the increased use of automatic cockpit controls, the A320
eliminates virtually all direct mechanicaI or hydraulic Iinks to movable
surfaces on the wings and tail that direct a plane's speed and angle of flight.
Five computers translate a pilot's actions into electronic commands that move
surfaces, changing the plane's speed and direction.

Computers can control the speed and direction of flight more accurately than
any human pilot but even aviators who defend the A32O say the extensive use of
automation raises questions about a pilot's ability to respond quickly in an
emergency.

Looking for 'Ideal Balance'

"In my perfect world we marry the advantages or automation and the creative
attributes or human operators," said Mr. Buley of Northwest.  "The A320 is a
quantum leap ahead.  What I'm looking for is the ideal balance, and I'm not
sure we've reached that with that airplane."

The equipment on the new planes is more reliable than before, and it can
relieve pilots of routine duties that might distract them from more important
tasks. For example, in the Boeing 767, computers automatically calculate and
adjust the descent speed to use the least fuel for the distance traveled, one
pilot noted. In the older Boeing 727, pilots go through "constant mental
gymnastics" to make the calculation themselves, the pilot said.

But just as some educators argue that a pupil with a calculator might not learn
basic principles of mathematics, aviation researchers say pilots who depend too
much on computers might not be as quick to determine the correct descent speed
on his own if the computer fails as would the 727 pilot who does this on every
flight.

Cockpit crew complacency and boredom are another issue, and these problems are
highlighted by a separate airline industry study of automation and pilot
performance. The F.A.A. and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
are building on the airline study and the Atlanta research to develop a
national program to improve the ways technology is used in aviation.

Other concerns listed by the airline group, Ied by Mr. Buley of Northwest,
include the problems pilots face when automated equipment fails and the
deterioration of basic flying skills.

Pilots Share Concern

Pilots themselves share these concerns, according to a recent space agency
study of 200 pilots who have been flying the Boeing 757 for airlines.  about
half agreed with the statement "I am concerned about a possible loss of my
fIying skills with too much automation." Even so, nearly 90 percent of the
pilots agreed that the new instruments were "a big step forward."

Many of these questions will come up again Sept. 18-19 when Dr. Foushee and
representatives from manufacturers and airlines meet to discuss the national
plan for improving the way people use technology in aviation.

Adding to the urgency of the research is the current boom in pilot hiring. Over
the next decade a new generation of pilots will be climbing into cockpits, and
virtually all their airline training will come in the new jets.

"What happens when the automation fails?" asked Earl L. Wiener of the
University of Miami, an expert in pilot performance who is directing the
Atlanta study. "A collision is coming between very inexperienced pilots and
very sophisticated aircraft."

To be sure, today's pilots have the advantage of extensive training on advanced
cockpit simulators, which duplicate every movement a plane would make. A pilot
in a simulator can practice fIying after losing various computer and control
systems.

"There have been many simulator advances that hopefully will give pilots
training advantages that an older generation of pilots didn't have," Dr.
Foushee said.

Still, while simulator training could help for some kinds of emergencies,
others, like the loss of the hydraulic system in the DC-10 in lowa, are
considered so remote that pilots do not train for them on simulators.

Besides examining how well pilots respond in emergencies, researchers hope to
examine any differences in the ways pilots work with one another in automated
and conventional cockpits, said Dr. Everett Palmer of NASA's Ames Research
Center, which is financing the study led by Dr. Wiener.

Mike Trout quotes BBC News, ...  pointing out that flight crews need to do
something "critical" to the success of the flight.  The solution may be right
under our noses.

How often, in this forum, have we discussed applying tests of "reasonableness"
to computer-generated answers to problems?  It seems that such tests are
critically needed in the cockpit, the most obvious example being Flight KAL
007.  Such reasonableness checks as humans would be capable of performing,
would be far from "make work" and would reduce significantly some of the risks
associated with increasingly automated flying.

...or so it seems from here.

RISKS 9.15 highlighted a phenomenon [I am tempted to say, "problem."]
that I've noted in RISKS for some time: 
 We tend to want computerized systems to be very much more reliable than 
 non-computerized systems.

For example, is my Seiko watch reliable? Yes.  Has it ever failed?
Yes; the original battery ran down after 5 years.  Does it run
exactly in synchronization with the Naval Observatory master clock?
No; it gains about a second a week.  Is that OK?  Yes!  It's great!

Is my old '66 Pontiac reliable?  Yes.  Has it ever failed? Sure; batteries 
have gone dead; a tire blew out; water pump failed (at about 90K miles);
alternator failed (about the same time); tune ups needed every 3 years;
... I've probably belabored the point too long already.

Folks, we've been spoiled by our own successes.  I'm all upset with the
maker of the hard disk in my Mac II, because it needs to be replaced after
only 18 months.  I have to stop and think about where I began, in 1960.
The computer we had then was less than 10% the horsepower of my Mac; it
had a miserable collection of "user tools" - the best being a FORTRAN II
(yes, "2") compiler.  And it went down at least 4 hours every week for
"maintenance."  And it cost a million dollars (or so); so the whole base
[not China Lake] got by on just one.

But can we improve?  You bet.  My Norelco shaver [first one] lasted 7 years;
that's a lot better than the hard drive in either my old Mac +, or this Mac II.
Maybe Norelco should teach "brand X" disk drive maker about motors?
                                                                         Bob

We seem to have more than our share, in the Digest, of horror stories
about computer failures in stock exchanges, motor vehicle records,
aircraft control systems, weapons control systems, and banking
applications.  While I have not sampled the subjects scientifically, it
seems as if we've not had quite so many horror stories in medical
applications.  (Of course, I'm not asserting that there have been none!)

Several years ago, a few colleagues from the Lab and myself consulted
with the Shock-Trauma Unit of the Maryland Institute for Emergency
Medical Service Systems regarding their use of computing in clinical
applications.  At the time, they used a DEC computer for patient
records, testing results, pharmacy and medical orders, etc.  It included
software which "integrated" these applications so that the attending
physician could trace the effectiveness of medicines and therapies with
time.  (Shock-Trauma gets the most seriously injured patients, often
flown in by the MD State Police in helicopters landed on premises.)

An important concern of the medical personnnel at the time was computer
failure.  Although the physicians initially resisted the machines'
intrusion into their domain, they had ultimately been "won over" and
became quite fond of and dependent upon the computer.   Virtually every
medical person in the unit learned, voluntarily, how to re-boot the
system in the event of a crash -- which was relatively often.  This was
the late 1970s.  They wanted to know if they could justify the funds to
purchase a fully redundant system.  There were two interchangeable
computers doing different functions (one was not critical).  They felt
that a third machine would give them the security of always having their
data available, but they needed justification and support from so-called
"experts," i.e. us.

Well, we gave them what they needed, but that is not the point of the
story.  The points are:

	1.  Is my perception correct?  Are there proportionally more
life and property threatening computer-related faults in banking,
transportation, and national defense than in medical applcations?

	2. If there's even a modicum of truth in #1, then why? Certainly
the hardware and software aren't unique in the hospital.   Is it a
matter of how they're used?  Is there more emphasis on redundancy and
reliablilty and less on moving it faster and making another buck?  Are
the machines introduced into new applications more gradually, so that
users are assured of correct operation at every step of the way?

	3. Or are the physicians merely burying their mistakes again?

I like the Petroski book ["To Engineer is Human: The Role of Failure in
Successful Design"].  It is an excellent example of design and the problems
that are inherent in pushing technology beyond what science can yet (ever?)
provide.

This is especially true when people chide me about human interface technology
and say something like "How come interface design isn't `scientific', like, say,
bridge design."  I tell them to read Petroski and then tell me about bridges.

I recommend Petroski to all my friends and students.  (I am happy to say that
someone told me that he, in turn, recommended my book.)

The quoted reports on the problems with the Tandem system at the
Toronto Stock Exchange are a good example of the difficulty the
news media have with reporting on complext technological stories.

As someone who works with a Tandem system, I can point out a few
things that may be of value to Risks readers:

Tandem computers do not have "backup systems" as such.  Instead,
the design incorporates redundant components -- all of which 
perform work under normal conditions.  The minimum system Tandem
will normally sell you is one with TWO CPUs, and at least one of
the discs ($System -- the one with the operating system) mirrored.

How failsafe a system is depends a lot on how the system is
configured.  Most Tandem systems have at least some of the discs
unmirrored.  (That's usually an economic decision.)

With mirrored discs, data is always written to both discs.  However
since it neads to be read from only one, there are situations
where different reads can be performed at the same time on the two
halves of the mirrored pair -- which will actually provide a gain
in performance for some operations.

Based on the quoted reports, I assume that the failures at the
stock exchange involved both halves of a mirrored disc pair --
though that's not obvious.  I'd be interested in hearing additional
details, if they are reported.  (Mail to me, if you don't think
this is of interest to the Risks audience.)

My opinions are my own and probably not IBM-compatible.--ehr

In RISKS 9.15, Peter Roosen-Runge brings us the following quotes:

 A computer crash all but shut down trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange for
 almost three hours yesterday, forcing tens of millions of dollars' worth of
 trades to Montreal. ... [the crash] -- a multiple failure within a disc-drive
 subsystem -- forced a halt at 9:41 AM. ... `Two pieces of hardware break down
 and Bay Street breaks down.' said a sour Charles Mitchell, trader. ... `Who's
 accountable for that?' ...

 A TSE spokeswoman said the failure of both primary and backup systems had
 never occurred since computers were installed 26 years ago. ...

My rough calculations indicate that the system availability has been 99.9986%
for those 26 years.  Who, indeed, IS responsible for that -- give them a
reward!

 `Everybody's very much annoyed,' McLean McCarthy's Mitchell said. `It's
 costing us a lot of money. I think the people upstairs in the exchange should
 be held accountable for it.'

How much were these people making with the chalkboard system?

It is human nature to demand perfection from everyone and everything else.
Have these folks ever heard of business insurance?  It should have been very
inexpensive given the prior availability of the system.

Along with our efforts to reduce risks in our trade, do we not need to
educate users in risk management?

I few weeks ago, I spent a couple of nights at a fairly nice hotel on
the East Coast.  You could tell it was a nice place because the remote
control for the TV was not bolted to a table.

I was intrigued by the notice that was pasted to the remote:

	CAUTION: The frequency of this television remote will
	damage the internal electronics of any set not programmed
	to receive the spectradyne signal.

My first reaction was to chuckle at this rather obvious attempt to
scare light-fingered but gullible clientele out of "offing" the remote.
But I got to wondering.  Is there any possible truth to this?  If
there is, how do I know that my VCR remote, say, won't damage my TV?
And if my TV was damaged, wouldn't that be evidence of really poor design?

I suspect that the worst "risk" here is that some guests of this hotel
are going to get a very warped idea of reality.

Actually, many computerized balancing/alignment systems are very, very simple
(even for mechanics :-).  Monitoring devices are attached to the wheels while
the car is on a lift.  The car's data is looked up in a book and entered in by
hand on a large number of the machines.  (I have a car not in "the book" and
have had to provide my own data.)  Then you procede to align/balance by looking
at a rather basic "under/correct/over" meter for each wheel.

There are probably a half-dozen other ways to do balancing/alignment, and
probably a thousand variations on the above theme...

More likely, the mechanic was not "machine literate".  I ran into a similar
problem: I had a flat repaired, and the shop (run by the company that made the
tires) balanced the tire as part of the repair.  At the same time, I purchased
a "lifetime balancing and flat repair" contract.  Driving home, I noticed a
slight shimmy that wasn't there that morning.  The next morning, I took the car
in for a complete rebalancing.

And when I drove home, the shimmy was worse - much worse.  The next day, I went
back to the shop and complained.  This time I watched as the tires were
balanced.  What had happened was that the "mechanic" (I use that term loosely)
did not have a properly sized chuck for the wheel balancing machine.  So he
used one that was "close".  As a result, the wheel was able to move from side
to side while it was being tested, with the result that the weights were put in
random (?) locations.

The moral?  If you don't trust computers, don't trust the people that do.
                                                                            -kdg

  &gt;Such reasonableness checks as humans would be capable of performing,

Such reasonableness tests in software are not easily constructed.  It is

No.  No, there are not.  There are proportionally the same given the relative
complexity of the systems and the amount of use.

   &gt; 2. If there's even a modicum of truth in #1, then why? 

There is no truth in it.

   &gt; 3. Or are the physicians merely burying their mistakes again?

Be careful to have your facts before attacking a group of people.  In fact,
medical computer problems are more carefully reported because the FDA requires
this while there are not similar requirements in other applications.  There
are large numbers of reported computer errors and recalls in the FDA database.

I have noticed, however, that many medical equipment manufacturers take quality
control more seriously than some other industries because of the potential
liabilities and costs involved in an FDA-ordered recall of a medical device.

memory.  Don's statements reminded me that the BBC report included considerable
discussion on the subject of allowing aircrew napping.  The basic argument was
generally that which Don raised, i.e., that minor aircrew napping would
actually make things safer.  It did, however, sound like the "powers that be"
were rather reluctant to allow the public to know that the folks up front may
be sawing logs.

As an aside, a few weeks back NPR had an extensive report on napping.  The
contention was that studies conclusively show that napping dramatically
improves concentration, productivity, and the ability to deal with problems.
Yet society strongly disapproves of napping, and anybody caught napping on the
job will be very lucky if they don't get fired.  Napping is viewed as "wasted
time"; time which could be spent doing something "constructive."  Never mind
that major portions of most workers' afternoons are often spent in an advanced
state of bleary-eyed semi-coherence.  It will be a long time before this
attitude changes, despite the fact that some of history's most effective
personalities, such as Winston Churchill, took frequent naps.

  &gt;... It is well known that the circadian rhythm has two minima -- ...

1.  It's extremely difficult to apply simple principles of the analysis of
circadian rhythm when the crew in question might be transiting multiple time-
zones, on a continuous basis, on irregular schedules.

2.  Part of the problem is cockpits that lull their pilots to sleep.  In _The
Journal of Navigation_, an oft-repeated statistic through 1983 and 1984 was
that Britannia Airways found that 767 cockpit crews were far more sedate (lower
heart rates) than those flying the 737.  This was ascribed to better-designed 
seating, noise reduction, and low workload.  

In cruise, modern crews are given very little to do.  To address this problem, 
very positive steps are being taken--such as having the stewardess check in, 
airline policy requiring manual calculation of navigation problems, mandatory 
(unnecessary) radio call-ins every fifteen minutes, etc.  I see no reason to
criticise such measures: they attempt to make the best of what is becoming 
increasingly clear is a bad situation.  

3.  Operational practice on many airlines (even if it's not *policy*) IS to 
let a pilot take a snooze if he just can't keep his eyes open.  The other
pilot's notified, and the guy takes a nap.  Great.  But that reduces the
redundancy in a modern cockpit by half.  So what happens if the remaining guy
(often on the same sleep-schedule) falls himself nodding off? (if you've never
flown long-distance, it's quite startling, after being *awake* 25 hours or so,
to suddenly wake up--without ever discovering you had fallen asleep).  Modern 
autopilots are incredibly reliable, and it's easy to argue that there's nothing
wrong with even *both* pilots napping for a while.  The problem is that, 
even in cruise, even with modern flight assist mechanisms, problems can manifest
themselves faster than the crew can "get back into the loop."  One of the rec-
ommendations of the NTSB report on the China Airlines flipover over Los Angeles
a few years ago was to bring pilots closer into the control loop.


My personal gripes with flight automation are:

* Lack of experience.  Automation's a new concept.  We have little experience
  dealing with the human factor in automation design.

* Economics-oriented vs. safety-oriented design.  It's always possible to fund
  a study that supports the manufacturer's viewpoints.  Even if backhanded tech-
  niques aren't used, genuine divisions exist within the industry on the place
  and role of automation.

* Lack of human-factors influence in system design (letting the engineers have
  at it).

* Too much human-factors influence in system design (psychologists pushing 
  pet theories in safety-critical situations).

(the above really boils down to lack of *operations* influence in system des-
ign, but even that's not always a help--consider a system designed to pilot
specifications, which leaves the pilots with precious little to do).

* Relatively low lack of computer literacy among pilots (the more microproc-
  essors the better), and consequent over-reliability on automation (Cf. my
  article in RISKS 9.13).

* Unfounded fault-probability claims by manufacturer (both in program ver-
  ification and hardware reliability).

* Lack of standardization.  How one airplane does something is not necessarily
  how another one does it (look at airspeed displays on the 747-400, Fokker 
  100, A320, and A310).  Not even COLORS are standardized.


In my opinion, not nearly enough muckraking is being done on the risks of
automation in aviation (and other disciplines).  When computers are marketed 
on the mere basis that they're high-tech, and purchased, respected, and put in 
safety-critical situations solely on that basis, it's time to worry.  I think 
RISKS serves a purpose by bringing such problems to our attention.  And I, for 
one, do not "get a laugh" out of reading about how yet another implementation 
has been botched up.

Another opinion on "drive-by-wire" systems:

I, like many other submitters, am against them, but for a reason not yet
brought up.  Designers of automated traffic-control systems have an unfortunate
tendency to design for cars, and forget about other road users, like cyclists
and pedestrians.

A case in point is the "smart" traffic light, which is actuated by automotive
traffic.  There are a lot of these menaces where I live.  They work fine for
cars, sure.  But try to make a left turn when you're riding a bike.  You get in
the left-turning lane, right on top of the sensor, in hopes that it will notice
you.  If you are riding a steel bike, you have about a 70% chance that the
light will turn for you.  The sensors, I believe, work by magnetic inductance,
so if you're riding an aluminum bike (as I do) you have a less than 50% chance
that the light will turn for you.  Of course, if the light doesn't turn, you
are forced to run it.  This is more dangerous than if there were no light
there, because the drivers going straight through think they have the right of
way, and aren't expecting turning traffic.  Another problem for cyclists is
that "smart" lights often go green for only an instant, so that if the road is
crowned, it's difficult to get through the intersection while the light is
still green (or, in some egregious cases, while it's still yellow).

These smart lights often endanger pedestrians, too.  A block and a half from my
office is a "smart" T intersection.  For a long time, the light was adjusted so
that left-turning traffic and pedestrians would be in the same place at the
same time.  (I think the designers forgot that this was a T intersection, so
that all the traffic would be turning left.)  Again, it was particularly
dangerous because the drivers thought that the pedestrians were jaywalking,
when in fact the pedestrians had a green light.  Finally, after at least three
years, the problem was "fixed" by barring pedestrians from crossing there at
all.

Technology lovers might argue that these are design flaws that could be fixed.
This is true, but they haven't been.  (I, and other members of my bicycle club,
routinely call the cities and couties when we find lights that don't turn for
us, but we rarely get satisfaction.  And why should it be up to us to make sure
the lights work, anyway?)  I don't believe that "drive-by-wire" systems would
be any better.

By the way, where I live, the number of cyclists is not insignificant.  In
Santa Clara County, twice as many people commute by bicycle as commute by mass
transit.

I would be happy to hear from Donald Norman, or other people working or
consulting for companies that are designing "drive-by-wire" systems, on how
such systems will allow for cyclists.

My long diatribe in RISKS has generated the proper result: numerous people have
written me and several, as this piece from Anne Paulson indicates, have
elaborated in the spirit of my remarks.

Although my piece in RISKS argued that technology was not all bad, my main goal
in life is to convince the technologists to consider the human side of things.
There is a tendancy to let the technology dominate, forgetting the
inconveniences this causes for people.  How do I convince anyone?  Well, I
write, preach, and evangalize.  In my consulting, my entire emphasis is on ways
of understanding the needs of the users, and then finding ways to bend the
technology to fit the people (instead of the other way around).

Consider Paulson's point, that designers of traffic lights (intersections and
traffic flow) do not properly consider pedestrians and bicyclists.  Actually, I
think she underestimated the problem: I suspect these designers consider
pedistrians and bicyclists a nuisance that are best gotten rid of.  The best
approach I ever saw to these concerns was in a letter to the editor in a local
nespaper.  The author asked why we had "pedestrian crossings" at streets.
Shouldn't pedestrians come first?  We should have "car crossings."  That is,
the pedestrian should automaticlly be considered to have the right of way, and
cars would have to have special places where they could cross the pedestrian
stream.  The same argument goes for bicycles.

Paulson concludes by saying: "I would be happy to hear from Donald Norman, or
other people working or consulting for companies that are designing
"drive-by-wire" systems, on how such systems will allow for cyclists."  That
isn't the right approach.  The correct approach is to change the entire mindset
of the city planners and people who purchase these devices to put in the proper
emphasis.  The engineers and designers are often very good, with proper
motives, but they can't overcome the mindset of cities that compute traffic
flow, and purchase from the lowest bidder -- even if the equipment thus
purchased is inferior and the system considerations neglected.

     [In addition, I think that automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians have
     such different characteristics that they simply should not be in the
     same traffic streams.  We need special bicycle ways (separated from
     roadways by more than a painted line) and special walkways.  (Some
     European cities -- espcially Scandavian cities -- seem to take this
     approach.)  And we should separate diffrent kinds of vehicles as well.
     And as we get more and more elderly drivers who tend to drive slowly,
     we will need either efficient point-to-point mass transit or special
     driving lanes for these elderly "super cautious" drivers (reaction and
     decision times slow with age, and attention is limited, with less
     ability to divide attention among several tasks.  Those of us in the
     attention business sometimes say that the elderly have "less
     attentional resources.").]

The problem faced by RISK readers, designers, and users, is that society puts
cost and efficiency first, and cost and efficiency are measured by local,
monetary variables.  Real cost and eficiency would take into account accident
rate, long-term pollution, long term recycling, long-term learning, and
employee comfort and job satisfaction.  In the end, I think proper attention to
these factors increases morale, decreases sickness, increases efficiency,
lowers turnover (which thereby lowers training costs), and lowers the cost of
cleanup and technological fixes by society.  But society is driven by
short-term views.  It will be hard to change this mindset.  But I am
optimistic.

mrotenberg@cdp.uucp quotes a recent article by Carl Levin.  Briefly,

  "Airlines are starting to fly a new generation of highly automated
  jets, raising concerns among safety researchers that pilots will rely too
  much on the technology and will lose or never learn the sharp skills and
  reflexes needed in emergencies."

Most of the article quotes the fears of "experts" and cites recent examples
where a pilot's skill overcame emergency conditions, saving many lives.
However, the article does not objectively cite balancing situations in which
automated systems handled sets of conditions that were too complex and changing
too fast for humans ever to respond satisfactorily.

The article includes an irrelevant reference to the old saw that calculators
prevent pupils from learning the "basic principles of mathematics," neglecting
the fact that one does not do "mathematics" on calculators.  One does
"arithmetic" on calculators!

Only near the end of the article are cockpit simulators discussed.  

  "A pilot in a simulator can practice flying after losing various computer and
  control systems...Still, while simulator training could help for some kinds
  of emergencies, others... are considered so remote that pilots do not train
  for them on simulators."

One wonders, "Why not?"  Can the great minds of the aircraft industry not
postulate virtually any kind of emergency?  Can not the simulators be
designed/programmed to handle any kind of emergency?  This sounds very much
like a failure of will, not of ability.

Much of the problem expressed is not new.  For years, the US Air Force has been
flying high performance tactical jets using significant amounts of automation.
If the automated system fails, the game is over.  The demands made upon the
pilot/airplane system are too demanding ever to be met by humans.  These pilots
are among the best in the world, and their training heavily depends upon
cockpit simulators.

The entire article is a good example of the warped treatment afforded a
complex, scientific topic by the popular press.  That example, how the public
is told about these issues, is probably the best contribution made by such an
article to the dialog in the Risks Digest.  Perhaps, instead of writing to one
another so much, the well-informed among us might write to such as the NY
Times, giving more accurate pictures of the issues.

After reading much discussion on the subject, I'd like to call to attention the
cancelled "Skybus" project that would have replaced the old streetcar lines in
Pittsburgh.  [A feature story on the subject was aired on KDKA-TV Eyewitness
News last night; some of the facts presented here came out of the story.]

20 years ago, Westinghouse designed and built a prototype "Skybus" system,
which involved driverless, electric rubber-tire vehicles on an exclusive track.
This system was billed as being the cheapest and most efficient public
transportation system available.  However, many politicians and citizens were
opposed to the idea of robot vehicles operating on tracks, "not being able to
tell whether an object on the road is a newspaper, a concrete block, or a human
body".  Of course, this doesn't take into account the fact that the roads were
elevated and, for the most part, isolated from the rest of the world.

As a result of the public hysteria, the system was canned, and the new
LRV system was built, at five times the cost of Skybus.

There is no doubt in my mind that such a system can and will work,
with the proper safeguards taken into account.  By isolating the
track, there is little need to risk collision with humans, although
there would be a need to scan for foreign objects that could serve as
obsticles.  As for the spacing and switching of vehicles, this is
already an automated function for many railroads.  What recent
railroad accidents can be directly blaimed on computer failure?

The point of this story is that the problem can go both ways.  We can easily
get burned by relying too much on automated systems that can be prone to
failure.  By the same token, we can get burned economically by refusing a
technological advancement that might present a few risks, but at the same time
would solve many others (as I feel the Skybus project would have done).

In fact, since then, Westinghouse has teamed up with a German firm (the name
evades me at the moment), and has implemented Skybus-like systems in many
locations, including Morgantown, WV.  In fact, the new mid-field terminal at
Greater Pitt. Intl. Airport will be implementing such a system when the
terminal opens in '92.

`Drive-by-wire' - YES i agree that the `human controlled' system causes
fatalities at an unacceptable level - YES i agree that the druggies/alcoholics
should be kept off the roads, YES i agree that there is a place for civilised
public transport (tramcars, buses) and YES i agree that theres a place for
automated navigation systems.  BUT i don't think they will solve the worlds
transport problems.  Most journeys (in Europe at least) are of less than 10
miles - taking the kids to school, collecting groceries, popping out for a
pizza, and it is the case in the UK that most accidents happen within 5 miles
of your home.  These are the very situations where the `blocks' of automated
vehicles travelling close up, just will not work - they are in most cases urban
areas with too many hazards (stop lights, school buses, intersections).

The instances when the bunched, automatic vehicles WOULD be of use are on
long-distance journeys. Paradoxically, on a basis of fatalities per thousand
miles, the motorways, autobahns and autoroutes of Europe are the safest roads.
For the long journeys, there are trains and planes.  Having only been to the
States once, and only driven on minor roads, i can't really get a feel for
Stateside freeway conditions. But how can a `civilised' country have a 55MPH
limit?

Come over to Europe, drive round the London orbital motorway (where the speed
limit is 70MPH, but the police turn a blind eye to anybody doing less than 100)
and sharpen up your driving skills!  The human brain, if it is working
properly, is still the best real-time adaptive guidance system we have.  Whats
more, it comes fitted as a standard, no-cost feature in most people.  Its
catastrophic failures are thankfully rare, and if it does suffer one, then you
aren't going to be worrying any more in any case!

I would like to echo some of the sentiment expressed by Tim Shimeall in
RISKS 9.13.

I am a non-degreed "software engineer".  I started programming as a kid in 1968
and although the term was not used at that time, I was a "hacker".  After
graduating high school in the early seventies I began attending a community
college, the best that I could afford.  Unfortunately the draft was on and when
I got that compelling notice I enlisted.  I honed my craft while in the
service, bypassing the service's programmers school because of very high test
scores.  Within six months, I was appointed the system administrator at a
scientific research and development facility.  When not handling system matters
I was tasked with helping others with their debugging problems.  Interestingly
enough, there were very few "uneducated" enlisted folk at this site and most of
the college trained junior officers were my best clients.  They could not
program their way out of the proverbial paper bag.  When I decided to leave the
service, it was decided that my job would be converted to a GS civilian slot.
I applied for the job and was turned down because of my lack of a college
degree.  The base personnel office told me that I was unqualified for a job
that I had been doing so well that I was recommended by my supervisor and
selected for commendations, as well as NCO of the quarter.  I eventually went
to work for a large computer vendor who sold me back to the Government to fill
my old job.  They got $100,000/year for my services and the facility management
people who I worked for as an NCO were thrilled with my encore performance.

In the past twelve years in this business I have held the following titles:

  Computer Programming Specialist,   Systems Analyst,   Senior Systems Analyst,
  Associate Software Engineer,   Software Engineer,   Senior Software Engineer,
  Principal Software Engineer,   Computer Security Engineer,  Systems Engineer,
  Senior Computer Scientist.

I have always felt proud of the work that I have accomplished.  I am a
published author and have attended invitational conferences.  I have always
been employed based on my reputation, not on my formal education.  I have
managed people with far more formal education (and less talent) than I.

I have tried to obtain a degree over the last twelve years but it has not been
an easy road.  My work has caused me to travel a great deal and to relocate
often.  At one point I was asked to work abroad for a couple of years.  Each
time I have moved I have attempted to matriculate to a new university only to
lose a substantial number of credit hours to a version of the "not invented
here" syndrome.  This has made obtaining my "credentials" not only near
impossible by very costly.  I have taken three different courses in "operating
system design" from three different schools and gotten an "A" each time.  In
one course I corrected the professor's misstatements (discreetly of course)
about the operation of the virtual memory demand paging algorithms of a system
that I helped to maintain.  Don't get me wrong, I feel that formal education is
a worthwhile experience.  But, for those who must pursue this science without
the benefit of a college education, self education is a viable alternative.

I think the software engineering community places too much stock in formal
education and not enough in the proven ability to do the job.  As Mr. Shimeall
pointed out in <A HREF="/Risks/9.13.html">RISKS-9.13</A>, apprenticeship has long been recognized in this
country as an extremely reliable measurement of one's ability to perform.  An
office mate of mine who holds an advanced degree in computer engineering once
told me that obtaining a degree just proved that you could "play the game".

I apologize for the personal nature of this transaction but Mr. Jones' comments
brought to a head the frustration that I have felt for a number of years.  It
seems that people in this field are more interested in where you went to school
than in what your opinions on various design issues are.  I remember an
incident a couple of years ago when I submitted a paper to a conference.  It
was reviewed and I received a letter of acceptance in the mail along with a
request for a biography to be published with the paper.  Shortly after sending
my biography I received a curt reply explaining that my paper was being dropped
from the schedule and would not be published.  The explanation was that this
was a "professsional" conference and surely I would understand.  My protests
went unanswered.  I was recently rejected voting membership to the IEEE because
they questioned my professional status because I was non-degreed.

I guess my point is here is that the degree doesn't make the engineer...

This is an item from the newsletter Advanced Military Computing, 8/28/89, p.6:

Strategic Defense Initiative managers wrestling with the computer aspects of
nuclear war plan to develop a Strategic Defense System software center to meet
their application needs.

"If there is an Achilles heel to SDI, it is the critique that we can't make all
the software work; if we do get it to work, it may not work right; it won't be
reliable; and it will cost millions of dollars and comprise millions of lines
of code," said Lloyd Acker, associate department head National Testbed Systems
for the MITRE Corporation.

Acker expects the center to be fully operational by 1991.  He said
identification of the center's software engineering environment requirements
should be completed this year with early prototypes identified and in
development.

He said the software center, which get off the ground soon, can help reduce SDI
software development risks as well as improve software productivity, integrity,
integration, security, practices, standards, and training.

Acker said the software center would:

*       Be a training center for software managers and engineers.  "A
        significant turnover in experienced software managerial and
        engineering personnel can be expected in the next decade, while
        software engineering practices will undergo rapid change."

*       Exhibit software engineering environments to include tools 
        supporting methods and standards, and serve as a testbed for
        SDS software quality.

*       Be a research center for software technologies suited to the SDS
        mission.  Acker said some of the areas of research include
        parallel processing, neural networks, object-oriented program-
        ming, and expert systems.

*       Track the technology development in other programs that could
        have an effect on SDI including those of DARPA, NASA, Software
        Engineering Institute, industry, and academia.

*       Be a trusted repository for SDS software as it is validated and
        certified.  An early focus will be how to prevent the injection
        of computer viruses into the system.

                                ------------------

Jeez, where have I heard all this before?  I thought this was what the National
Test Facility in Colorado Springs was supposed to be doing.  Now we're going to
build something with an identical mission, a facility which will do world-class
research on parallel processing, neural networks, object-oriented programming,
and expert systems to boot.  Sounds like yet another SDI boondoggle to me.

The center will "Be a trusted repository for SDS software as it is validated
and certified."  How do they expect to do this?

"An early focus will be how to prevent the injection of computer viruses into
the system."  If this center has to be built, it would seem to me that a more
reasonable place to start would be to figure out whether the SDI makes any
sense at all, or whether it's just a screwball idea designed to "bucket
brigade" taxpayer money to defense contractors and think tanks like MITRE.  Who
cares if there are viruses in something that's not designed to actually
"work"?

Risks readers should be interested in an article in COMPUTERWORLD (August 21,
1989, Vol. XXIII, No. 34, page 1) by James Daly of the CW staff entitled
"High-tech weapons, low-tech GIs".  The article contains few surprises for
readers of this newsgroup, but it neatly summarizes many of the risks
associated with computerized weaponry.

The article's main thesis:

  Despite the investment of huge amounts of training time, effort and money,
  some critics argue that today's super-sophisticated armaments have become so
  complicated that they have outgrown the ability of sailors and soldiers to
  use them effectively.

It also explains why we may be irrevocably stuck with high-tech weapons:

  Reports ranging from a B-1 bomber crashing when it hit a pelican to the
  embarrassing Divad project -- a computer-operated anti-aircraft gun that once
  identified a rotating latrine fan as the closest threatening target -- have
  initiated brass-filled investigative hearings....  The trouble is, the
  military culture may already be too infatuated with leading-edge devices to
  ever turn back....  [The] Pentagon's electronics procurements have more than
  tripled since the beginning of the decade and now account for more than 40%
  of the military's production costs.
	
The Pentagon's "solution":

  Because the list of the Pentagon's high-tech goof-ups is long, the Defense
  Department has begun to seriously investigate the use of artificial
  intelligence.

Undercover police in San Jose, California, have been tracking BBOARDS for
several years, looking for computer users who boasted about their criminal
exploits.  It was such activity that led them to Virginians Dean Ashley Lambey,
34, and Daniel T. Depew, 28, who have been accused of conspiring to kidnap a
young boy to be filmed as they molested him and then killed him.  [Source: San

In previous installments in RISKS, we have discussed the relatively open
availability of the database of the California Division of Motor Vehicles.  In
response to the July 18 murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer by someone who
tracked her down through DMV records (via an Arizona private investigator),
Gov. George Deukmejian has directed the DMV to restrict release of information,
to protect individual privacy and safety.  (The DMV had 41 million requests in
1988, mostly seemingly business related.)  New rules take place 1 Oct.  They
require bulk users to register and sign restrictive agreements, and impose a
10-day delay on the response in certain cases.  The current practice of
notifying the driver when an individual request is made will thus give the
driver a little warning before the record is mailed out.  (DMV information is
all public record info, but the home addresses of certain drivers -- judges,
law-enforcement officers, etc. -- are supposedly not released.  Whether they
are actually on-line but suppressed by the system is another matter.)

More on vehicle guidance: The following is summarised from an article
in 'Personal Computer World' september 1989.

A description is given of a system called AUTOGUIDE, being developed by the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) near Reading, England.
The pilot system uses a digitised map of the area concerned, and a set of
'beacons' (which use an infra-red digital link to inform passing vehicles of
their position, and local traffic conditions).
Passing vehicles presumably 'poll' the beacons which respond by sending data.
Information ('Take the next left', 'Road closed at intersection') is displayed
on an alphanumeric LCD display on the vehicle instrument panel.
Information from the beacons is relayed back to a central computer which
is able to compute vehicle speed by the time taken for individual cars to
pass between the beacons.  In this way, the central computer can identify
congested areas as the congestion develops, and be able to determine
alternate routes.

Siemens, Logica, GEC and Plessey are all involved in the development of
the system, the RAC and AA (both British motoring organisations)
are also part of the various consortia doing the development. The
British government are currently deciding on which consortium to
choose to award the pilot study project to.  Initially, around 300
beacons are likely to be needed in an area the size of London, at
an estimated cost of 5 to 10 million UK pounds.

Possible things to consider as potential risks with such a system::

1) Such a system COULD be made to identify individual vehicles, hence allowing
   the authorities to 'track' individuals as they drive around cities.
   Civil liberties people will no doubt have some comments on this indirect
   'electronic tagging'.

2) Since the system can 'divert' traffic, there is a risk that residents who
   suddenly find a high-speed stream of vehicles diverted down their normally
   quiet streets and may get somewhat uptight about it.

3) I dont know about the details, but it sounds like such a system could
   be easily tampered with.  Criminals who wished to could, for example,
   operate a very powerful beacon and create either congestion or open
   roads to foil police chases. Anyone remember the film 'The Italian
   Job' in which the robbers crashed a trafficlight computer to cover
   their escape by creating traffic chaos?

4) Governments/city authorities could 'fiddle' the system to give an
   unfair advantage to public transport by unethical means - make the
   roads *APPEAR* more congested whilst creating congestion-free zones
   for buses.
                                        Pete L.

	I was a bit astounded by Brint Cooper's story of medical personnel in
the hospital he was consulting for being willing to learn the basics of
booting and caring for the computers that held their medical database.
	In my experience, this shows an uncommon amount of good sense on
the part of the medical personnel, and a sharp departure from the normal
behavior of (non-computer-literate) professionals who use computers.  One
wonders how many gripes there would have been in the Toronto stock
exchange if the stockbrokers had been willing to take a similar interest
in the machines on which their living depends.

In RISKS 9.17, mentat@walt.cc.utexas.edu (Robert Dorsett) has a gripe
with flight automation:

* Unfounded fault-probability claims by manufacturer (both in program ver-
  ification and hardware reliability).

This is not necessarily true.  Many aircraft manufacturers believe
they have a very firm foundation for the reliability of their
hardware.  One of my former employers leases programs for this very
purpose.  However, these programs are known to have bugs in sections
that ``no one uses'' [read: no one's complained about it being wrong].
Also, in the theoretically working sections, they are using data for
components that was out of date 10 years ago.  By the way, the
justification for all this was that ``the numbers are only used for
advertising anyway.  No one believes them.''

So, the manufacturers are reporting in good faith what the reliability software
tells them, but the software lies.  I was amazed to find out this software
producer has never been sued as a result of the software's claiming a product
would last X amount of time, when the product actually failed much more often.
Maybe no one *does* believe the numbers, but it isn't noised about much....

I have seen at least two incidences of RISKS contributors decrying the fact
that they had to deal with systems provided by a "lowest bidder".  It seems to
me that if the specifications are complete and correct then there should be no
problem.  And I cannot think of another decent way to buy systems (the
next-to-lowest bidder?  the highest bidder?)  that will solve the problems.

I realize that formal software techniques are considered
pie-in-the-sky, and the "iterative design techniques" are what really
happens, but isn't the process of analysing and writing specs, and
checking that a purchase meets them, a sufficiently important thing?

I know it takes more effort to specify what you *really* want and
it'll cost more when suppliers give you bids, but at least you're not
trusting something you don't want to. 

    [It was of course John Glenn who commented on how he felt knowing that
    he was astronauting around in something that was built by the lowest
    bidder.  The real problem is the extent to which corners have been
    cut so that the contractor does not lose money, or indeed tries to
    maximize profits.  If the "ethic" is that anything goes if you can get 
    away with it, then THAT is a problem.  If systems are really built to 
    spec, then you should certainly worry whether the spec was adequate.  PGN]

RISKS received a huge flurry of stuff as follow-ups on this topic [singular],
with considerable overlap, as well as second-order and third-order discussion.
I'll try to cull out the highlights.  Sorry to you contributors who might have
thought there was a big black hole out here where RISKS is supposed to be.

By the way, the cutover to the new system and its mailer has improved my life,
and has resulted in only a few dropped subscribers.  Thanks for your patience.

The Guardian newspaper (London, U.K.), Thursday 24th August
(reprinted without permission).  My comments follow.
Any errors in the transcription are entirely mine (but the
Guardian's reputation for poor proofreading is of no help).

	A daily changing password is a simple but ridiculously
	under-used anti-hacker device, argues P. Nath

			GIVE US THIS DAY ...

  There is a growing acceptance of the view that little can be done
to deter hackers, since they have successfully penetrated so-called
secure systems including those of the US and Nato commands.

  But computer users could take some measures which are ridiculously
simple and will only need a couple of minutes each week, to stop
more hackers than armies of policeman ever could.  These measures
could be put into operation immediately and do not involve any new
hardware of software.

  All computer systems allow information to be protected with passwords,
but this facility is not properly exploited.  To be effective a password
should be unguessable and temporary, and yet most passwords are based on
names or addresses familiar to the users, and very seldom, if ever changed.
It's like hiding the keys of the house under the doormat in the belief that
no burglar will be clever enough to discover them.

  The fact that hackers arrange meetings where they exchange, sell and
circulate interresting passwords proves that those passwords are not
changed often enough.  If passwords are selected carefully and changed
every two or three days, even the most experienced hackers will find
it impossible to discover them.

  Although every protection system should be different, some general
rules for coining and deploying the passwords can be easily laid down.
Perhaps the users may even learn to derive as much thrill in coining
un-hackable passwords as hackers noe get in breaking them.

  Ideally a password should be based on things which are in no way
related to the user or his organisation, and the word should be new,
pronounceable and easy to remember.

  The easiest method is to start with common names like Mexico, Dublin,
France, Durham, London, Moscow, Cyprus etc, and form new words like
Icomex, Lindub, and Cowmos by interchanging their first and second halves.
A better group of new words can be made by combining halves of different
words; for example Lonlin, Frarus, Mexrus and Mosham.  Such words become
very easy to remember if a large item is paired with a smaller one, and
the two are linked in some way.

  A better idea is to use two passwords.  Easily remember pairs of words
may be made up by linking an item with one of its features.  For example,
the onion domes of Moscow being to mind words like Onimos and Onicow.
A pair of words like this can be used interchangeably as passwords,
by an individual or a group.

  Other members of the group will not be inconvenienced, since even
the strictest computer system allows two or three attempts to key-in
the password correctly.  By just typing Onicow as a guess, a user will
happen to be right about half the time.  If the computer rejects this
word, he is sure to gain access by typing Onimos.  This tolerant nature
of computers is well exploited by hackers, and there is no reason why
users should not take advantage of it as well.  Computer users suffer
from an irrational fear of forgetting their passwords, so they adopt
unforgettable names like those of their wives or children, and sometimes
their own names.  The idea of a password which changes frequently,
say once or twice a week, seems like mental torture, but it is not.
The underlying rules for such passwords are so simple the once learnt
they become very easy to recall.

  Consider a hypothetical international company and imagine that all its
salesmen are enjoying a new year party.  All the data concerning products
and prices are kepy only in the central computer, the password for which
is to be changed every day.  The salesmen do not wish to spend more than
five minutes to learn the password rules and they insist that no written
record of the rules should exist, and that no member should ask or divulge
the rules to another member or anyone else.  Is it possible for them to
invent a totally reliable but unwritten set of rules which will churn
out a new password every day?

  Yes, and the procedure is quite simple and easy to remember.

  To be chanageable daily the password must be linked in some way to the
calendar, but the information has to be coded in such a way that hackers
will not be able to crack it in 24 hours.  As a starting point take an
uncommon three-letter base word, for example, ULM.  This leaves room for
three letters or digits to codify the date, for example, Sunday, April 30.
This day is in the 17th week of the year, is the 120th day of the year,
and is 245 days from the end of the year.  The password can be any of
the following:
	ULM30S (30th, Sunday)
	ULM30A (30th, April)
	ULM304 (30th, April)
	ULM430 (April, 30th)
	ULM17S (17th week, April)
	ULM301 (30th, Sunday) (1=Sun, 2=Mon, 3=Tue etc)
	ULM125 (difference between 245 and 120)
and so on.

  These passwords may be modified by taking the code letters for days
and months from another language (for example, German) or by adding a
fixed number to the digits relating to dates and months; or by multiplying
these digits by a 2 or 3; or by writing them differently, for example in
an octal base.

  Other combinations can be obtained by putting the calendar information
inside the word.  ULM30S can be written as UL30SM or U30LMS or U30LSM.
Reversing this order provides another set of words.

  The attraction of such a system is that although the users have to agree
on only one of these simple rules and remember it for a year (assuming the
system is renewed annually), the hacker will need, if he is very lucky,
hundreds of trials to find out how the daily information has been encoded
and 24 hours will not be long enough to do this.

  If by some miracle a hacker breaks the daily code, he still has to
discover the fixed letters U L M in their correct order, and this task
will need thousands of additional trials.  By that time he may decide
to give up hacking as a bad job.

	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Whilst this column gives some good advise (e.g., "a password should be
unguessable and temporary"), reasonable suggestions for chosing decent
passwords (e.g., invention of "Onicow"), and implies other sensible
precautions (e.g., no written records or disclosure), it is flawed.

Ignoring the factual errors (passwords exist only on MS-DOS via add-on
products; ergo, new software and/or hardware may be required), it omits
several key points.  The most obvious omission, perhaps, is that with
the ULM scheme the rules must be changed everytime a salesman leaves
the company.  (If the information is so valuable to require daily passwords,
then it would be unacceptable for any former employee to still efectively
know the password.)  For the type of company described, this could be rather
frequent, presenting the problem of how to distribute the new scheme
(which is, quite sensibly, neither written down nor ever divulged).

The column also supposes that unauthorised agents (called "hackers",
but I refrain from that debate) gain access only by guessing passwords.
I suspect that such (random) guessing is the among the rarest attacks.
(But the problems with short passwords and restricted alphabets are
hinted at.)

Assuming that the passwords control the ability to log onto the system
(i.e., authenticate system access) then the implication that passwords
should be shared (amongst all the salespeople, in the ULM example) is a
disaster.  Shared passwords imply shared accounts, which frustrates any
concept of accountability -- since no one is individually responsible
(for a shared account), a breach cannot be traced back (assuming some
auditing facilities exist) to an individual person actions or inactions.

It is good to see passwords discussed in the mainstream press, and even
better when the discussion includes sound instruction.  But it unfortunate
that the discussion is so flawed that the good points are overlooked.

Brian Foster, SCO Trusted UNIX Project, The Santa Cruz Operation, Ltd., London

   [We have also mentioned in past isseus the risks that the passwords may 
   be stored unencrypted in accessible places, may be transmitted unencrypted
   via easily readable transmission media, and that passwords are intrinsically
   vulnerable.  But you should not be surprised to see a technical topic mauled
   in the press...  PGN]

From the Middlesex News, Framingham, Mass, Aug. 29, 1989
By Michael Sereda
NEWS STAFF WRITER

MetroWest police, more accustomed to battling crime, are battling a broken
Registry of Motor Vehicles computer that hasn't spit out information since
Sunday.  So far, 6,000 inquiries on licenses and registrations have backed up,
handcuffing police and leaving Registry officials to crank out renewals on
paper.  

``It's a real pain in the neck, particularly on a busy night and there's so
much going on,'' said Medfield Police Dispatcher Shirley Rossi.  ``You're able
to check the status of someone on a warrant ...  but you can't check the status
if they have a suspended or revoked license, and you can't check the status of
a vehicle, if it's unregistered, registered. It just basically makes it
difficult if they want to write a ticket.''  ``This is an ongoing thing with
(the Registry),'' Rossi said.

Trouble began, spokesman Kathi Connelly said, on Sunday morning when the
Registry shut down the electronic brain for four hours of scheduled
maintenance. After the maintenance was performed, the computer came back on
line for about an hour and then started acting up, she said.  The 4-year-old
computer, which stores information on the state's 3 million drivers and 6
million vehicles, was operating off and on throughout Sunday, before
``crashing'' late that night or early Monday morning, she said.

The glitch meant that police throughout the state could not check on a person's
driving record or the validity of a registration.  ``It gets very difficult,''
said Framingham Lt. Wayne McCarthy. ``There've been several times that it's
down, and later it comes up (after a suspect is let go) and it comes back that
someone's license is revoked or suspended.  ``They may have had a license on
them and we couldn't check on it,'' McCarthy said.

``It kind of stops the checking process out on the road,'' said State Police
Sgt. Joseph Parmakian.

While the computer was down Sunday and Monday, the system automatically stored
the inquiries and answered them when operation resumed between 4 p.m. and 6
p.m. Monday, Connelly said.

At the Registry, customers who wanted to renew their licenses went away with
temporary paper renewals and without the laminated photo license, which is
computer-generated, Connelly said. Those drivers can return for the photo
license, she said. She said she could not estimate how many customers might
have been inconvenienced. Other Registry transactions involving the public were
done on paper, she said.  ``To be frank, we were kind of worried that something
like this would happen,'' Connelly said. ``The computer has been operating at
100 percent capacity for more than a year. Generally, computer systems are
supposed to operate at no more than 85 percent of capacity.''

The computer's maker, Amdahl Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif., flew parts and repair
technicians to Boston to help out, she said. The repairs did not cost the
Registry additional money because they were covered under a maintenance
agreement, she said.

Permanent help is on the way for the Registry in the form of a new computer
with an expanded memory, Connelly said. The new computer will have the ability
to handle 40 million instructions per second - in computer lingo, that means
it's real fast. The Registry will be going out to bid in 10 to 12 weeks for the
$7 million machine. The money for the computer, Connelly noted, has already
been budgeted and will be paid over a five-year period.

Connelly said that David Lewis, the Registry's computer boss, ``feels secure
the problem has been taken care of.''  ``We'll be happy when it's replaced,''
she added.

The following article appears in NEW SCIENTIST, 5 August 1989, p. 24:

CEGB Rebuffs Critics of Safety Software by Susan Watts

The Central Electricity Generating Board has responded to critics who doubt the 
reliability of the software that will protect Britain's latest nuclear power
stations from accidents.  Specialists in computer safety systems fear that this
software does not meet current standards for such "safety-critical" software,
published recently by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).  The CEGB has been
reluctant to publish details of the protective system.

At a special session of the Hinkley Point inquiry in Bristol, Martyn Thomas,
the chairman of the committee on safety software at the British Computer
Society (BCS), urged the CEGB to allow an expert committee to make an
independent assessment of the software.  This software, which the board ordered
from Westinghouse in the US, might one day be solely responsible for shutting
down pressurized-water reactors should something go seriously wrong.

The MoD's draft standard, Def Stan 0055, stipulates that all software for
systems which protect human life must be analyzed mathematically, rather than
simply relying on estimates of the probability that such software will not
fail.

Thomas fears that the systems could not meet the requirements of MoD's new
standard (THIS WEEK [a section in NEW SCIENTIST] 1 April 1989).  The only way
to allay concern about the protection system among computer experts would be
for the CEGB to publish details of the system and to allow the expert committee
to scrutinize it, he says.

The board rejects charges that the emergence of the new standards invalidates
or renders inadequate its designs, which have been under development for some
time.  The board points out that it has its own independent assessment team,
which includes a member of the safety systems group of the BCS.

But Thomas says that this "Independent Design Team", although independent of
Westinghouse, is made up of employees of the CEGB.  This is not good enough,
says Thomas, who wants the inquiry to open an extra session on the safety
aspects and reliability of the software which will control the reactor.

In Bristol, Thomas said that the Health and Safety Executive, whose team at the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) has to approve the system before it is
allowed to operate, is severely short of skilled resources for assessing
programmable electronic systems of any sort.  He also has serious reservations
about whether the NII has the staff and skills to evaluate safety of the
protection system.

He says that the CEGB has not answered the substantive point of his evidence;
that this important area of the design, where opinions within the computer
community have been maturing quite rapidly over the past six months, ought to
be examined by public inquiry.  He says that he asked the CEGB several months
ago for information about the design of the system.

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has responded to the evidence submitted
by Thomas, and says that it has adequate expertise and resources to do its job. 
The HSE says that it has addressed the potential problems with software
identified at the time of the Sizewell inquiry, and that the NII expects the
CEGB to make use of new checking techniques as they become available.

Last Saturday (August 26, 1989), ZDF (=2nd German TV, one of the 2 nationwide
TV channels) asked there spectators whether smoking should be banned in the
public. The spectatores could answer by telephone, dialing for "yes" a
telephone number nnnnnn1, or nnnnnn2 for "no". Within a time slot of 14
minutes, 52.942 telephone calls came in, with a quota of 54:46 in favor of a
smoking prohibition. That means, that 29.669 voted in favor of a prohibition,
and 25.273 opposed.

On Monday (August 28, 1989), a group of South German hackers said that they
manipulated the quota by dialing the "yes" number with from 83 PCs at a rate of
4 times a minute; virtually all of their calls came through so that about the
maximum of 4.648 Yes-votes came from their computers.  The result was thus
significantly changed: without the computer votes, the result would be:
Yes=25.021; No=25.273, which is a small majority of the opposition.

German news media (only) now start a debate about the "security" (not
about the quality!) of the German Post Office's "TED" =TEleDialog system
used for this TV transmission. The system was developped in 1979 (and
used several times, mainly for entertainment purposes, e.g. vote on
the Saturday movie). TED consists of 11 regional computers which count
how often a specific number is dialed; the count is transferred to the
TV station which rented this service, after a given time limit is reached.
The maximum capacity for a nationwide counting procedure is 350.000
"votes" per hour. On Saturday, only slightly over 50% of the capacity
was used, probably due to vacation time and missing interest in the
corresponding TV show.

The system can easily be hacked; probably, some more hackers tried and
practicised such hacks earlier. There have been some discussions before
when, at a local election in the Federal State of Hamburg, some strange
results about political themes came up. But only now, as leisure time
themes and activities of hackers are involved (and other catastrophy 
themes are not visible), a discussion is started about the "security". My
prognosis:the essential question about the quality of the results 
produced by such a tool and  procedure will only be discussed when 
questions of common (national?) interest are asked, such as: shall we
replay Steffi's or Boris's last winning game.

I thought this article from humanist was worth posting to risks and to security.
What risks do we suffer if our engineers/scientists are unethical, or are taught
to subscribe to conflicting sets of ethical principles? Is it likely that 
societies like ACM, BCS, IEEE, etc will have incompatible ethical codes, each of
course incompatible with whatever is taught in the computer science schools?

   If I may, I would like to reopen the question of "computer ethics." Let me
try to formulate the question this way: "Is there a rational and consensual
basis for computer ethics?"
 
   The older I get, the more I feel the poignancy of this exchange in The
Brothers Karamazov:
 
      "Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the
      disappearance of the faith in immortality?" the elder asked Ivan
      suddenly.
 
      "Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no
      immortality."
 
Absent a consensual reality, on what basis can we construct a system of
computer ethics for our students?
 
   Do we reduce ethical questions to the merely legal ones? If it ain't
illegal, is it OK?
 
   Do we point to a series of mini-consensuses? The ACM says ...., and the MLA
says ...., and the Department of Redundancy Department has published yet
another statement of computer ethics. Are students to choose one ethics
position from Column A and one from Column B as they see fit?
 
   Are computer ethics merely negative ("Thou shalt not..."), or are they also
positive? Are there ethical statements which are unique to (or apply with
special force to) the field of computing, or are they the general ones of
"intellectual honesty, curiosity, an eye for detail, a respect for theory, and
delight at discovery" (Miller quoting Ryle on 20 June, 1989).
 
   If computer ethics can be taught, then I have these questions:
      * Who is doing the teaching? People in the Humanities? Engineers?
        Computer Scientists?
      * What are the people who are teaching computer/engineering/scientific
        ethics teaching?
      * What texts?
      * What contexts: part of many courses or a separate required/elective
        course?

The sci.aeronautics newsgroup has been formed on usenet.  It will be dedicated
to discussions of various aspects of aviation, such as human factors, airliner
oprations, avionics, and aeronynamics.  It is intended to complement the
existing rec.aviation newsgroup, not replace it.  

There is also a mailing list.  Submissions should be mailed to
	aeronautics@rascal.ics.utexas.edu
Administrative details (requests to subscribe, unsubscribe, questions) should
be addressed to:
	aeronautics-request@rascal.ics.utexas.edu

The "aeronautics" mailing list will be a moderated version of the 
sci.aeronautics newsgroup.  It will be a one-way feed (sci.aeronautics -&gt; 
mailing list), unless sufficient demand requires that it go in the opposite 
direction.

Recent articles and letters in "Linn's", a weekly philatelic newspaper,
give an interesting view of problems in the US Postal Service.

A recent scam has people paying as much as $40 to find out about a
"little-known regulation" that allows people to send first-class mail for $.02
instead of $.25.  There is no such regulation, at least not specifically.

Nowadays, stamps are printed with phosphorescent inks (sometimes the colored
ink contains phosphor and sometimes a clear overcoating is applied).  Automatic
cancelling machines detect the phosphor, rejecting envelopes that have none.

The result is that any stamp with the phosphor will trigger the cancelling
machine: a $.25 stamp, a $.02 stamp, a $.01 stamp, a piece of selvage (stamp
sheet edge), some used stamps, and some foreign stamps.  In fact, one political
candidate's secretary used this trick to "save money".  No charges were made
("It's a simple mistake").

On the other side of the coin (as it were), overzealous postal
clerks refuse valid stamps:

 * The 1987 Stamp Collecting issue, which shows a 100-year old
   cancel as part of the design ("We don't accept cancelled stamps").

 * The 1947 100th anniversary souvenier sheet contains stamps with the same
   designs as the US 1847 issues (5 and 10 cent values).  The 1847 stamps were
   invalidated during the Civil War.

 * The 1989 souvenier sheet showing a reprint of the 90 cent Lincoln stamp
   of the 1880's is expected to have similar problems.

 * Any postal customer with the proper permit is allowed to use precancelled
   and fractional-valued stamps, but obtaining and using the permit is not
   always possible with some clerks and postmasters.

On 31 August Johnny Carson did an impression of Abe Lincoln as a budding young
standup comic, wearing a two-foot top-hat.  The end of the skit involved
triggering a radio-controlled device that blew the hat upwards off of his head.
A long delay arose during the taping of the show when the hat kept blowing off
Johnny's head backstage before his entrance.  His technicians figured out that
RF interference from nearby kids with remote-control robot cars kept triggering
the hat.  The obvious solution was to get the kids to stop transmitting during
the skit.  Honest, Abe had some good lines, but Johnny's hair-raising gimmick
top-hatted them all.

By George C. Wilson
Washington Post Service

The USS Vincennes, which shot down a civilian airliner in the Perian Gulf on 
July 3, 1988, killing 290 people, had gained a reputation for being an overly
aggressive "robo-cuiser" and probably provoked the sea battle with Iranian gun-
boats which preceded the shootdown, according to a commander of a ship on the
scene at the time.

Writing in the September issue of the US Naval Institute magazine _Proceedings_,
Commander David Carlson said the radar on his ship, the USS Sides, a patrol and
escort frigate, showed that the airliner was climbing in a non-threatening way
inside the designated commercial airline corridor.

He said he would not have ordered his own crew to fire missiles at the plane,
as did Captain Will Rogers III, skipper of the Vincennes.

In another part of his remarkably frank account, which is likely to refuel con-
troversy generated by the shootdown, Carlson wrote that the Vincennes started
the sea battle in response to what may have been nothing more than warning 
shots from Iranian gunboats feeling threatened by the cruiser's helicopter.

Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month before the 
incident," Carlson wrote, "my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of
restraint was not her long suit.  Her actions appeared to be consistently
aggressive and had become a topic of wardroom conversation.  "Who's driving
the problem in Vincennes?" was a question asked on numerous occasions prior
to 3 July.

"'Robo-cruiser' was the unamusing nickname that someone jokingly came up with
her, and it stuck,' Carlson said.  My guess was that the crew of the Vincennes
felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis (the highly sophisticated anti-
aircraft system on the cruiser) in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered
for an opportunity to show their stuff..."

The Vincennes crew misidentified the civilian airliner as an Iranian F-14 
fighter plane, which does not carry anti-ship weapons, and shot it down with
missiles, to the horror of Carlson watching the same plane on radar.

"We locked up and illuminated" the approaching Iranian airliner "with our
missile fire control radar," Carlson wrote.  "The aircraft continued climbing
on a southwesterly course that would take it directly over the Vincennes
position.  Based on closest point of approach to the Sides (range and 
altitude), lack of any significant known F-14 antisurface warfare capability...
lack of detected radar emissions and precedent, I evaluated the track as a non-
threat...

"The Vincennes announced her intentions to take TN 4131 (Track NUmber 4131, the
Iranian airliner) with missiles at 20 miles.  I wondered aloud in disbelief,
but I did not do the one thing that might have helped.  I did not think to push
for a re-evaluation of IFF (identification of friend or foe)..."

Yesterday the University of Colorado at Boulder newspaper carried an article
entitled "Officials say CU keeps records confidential." The article was in
reaction to reports that a murderer obtained his former girlfriend's course
schedule by giving a University of Washington clerk the victim's Social
Security number and name.  The point of the article was to assure students that
"that couldn't happen here." In interviews CU officials reviewed employee
training on the Family Education Rights and Privacy Law and said that reminders
about the law are consistentlly sent out.  A course schedule would not be
released to anyone other than the student and only if the student had ID.
Every one of administrators interviewed was confident that no one else could
obtain a student's course schedule.

The RISK involved is that no one seems to have thought about our on-line
course registration system.  This system allows a student to review his
or her schedule by phone.  And what do you need to access that
information?  The student's Social Security number and a secret PIN.

Unfortunately, the PIN is assigned as the student's birthdate...

&gt;From: David A Honig &lt;honig@BONNIE.ICS.UCI.EDU&gt; [writing in RISKS]
&gt;It seems to me that if the specifications are complete and correct then
&gt;there should be no problem.  

It seems to me that much of the grief in our industry, and many of the
risks, stem from the assumption that every system has an "a priori"
specification, if only you can find the right person to ask.  In my
experience, specifications change as people understand the implications of
what they have asked for. Specifications also change because new ideas come
along, or the users change, or the constraints change.

Most of all, specifications change because every useful system mirrors the
real world in some aspect, and the real world changes. So specifications (in
the sense of *real, current needs* ) change throughout the development of any
useful system and throughout its service life, too.

This is why "lowest compliant, fixed-price bid" is a poor way of purchasing
systems.

How about "most trusted bidder with a reasonable price"?  The problem
with many lowest bidder schemes (particularly those often legislated by
well-meaning government bodies) is that they do not provide an adequate
mechanism to separate competent bidders from incompetent bidders.  What
good are detailed specifications if you don't honestly believe that the
contractor will be able to meet them, or if you believe you're going to
have to pay enormous legal fees to force the contractor to meet them?
There's plenty of opportunity for abuse if you let public officials
hire their "favorite" contractor regardless of price, but a pure lowest
bidder scheme is not the solution, either.

A somewhat jaundiced view of the process from the viewpoint of an employee of
several large and small contractors (who shall remain nameless) is that first
of all, the going practice seems to be to ask the developers what it will cost
to develop a system to the spec provided, then say "no, try again" to realistic
estimates until the bid comes down to less than the program office believes the
competition will bid.  The same, of course, applies to schedule.  In short,
it's a low-ball contest with the award going to whoever makes the most
audacious bid.

Next comes the engineering challenge of devising an implementation which
can be done in the time and budget which was bid, and which can somehow
be construed as meeting the requirement.  A specification calling for
on-line error diagnostics may be met by having the terminal beep, or
some such travesty.

Of course, there is the problem of divining what the spec does ask for.
I have been at a design review where our customer was a procurement
agency who was acquiring a system on behalf of the end-user agency, and
there were anguished cries from the end users who didn't even recognize
the system the bean counters had specified, let alone what we were
proposing to provide.

The solution to all the above comes about in engineering change
proposals in which the necessary features are finally added at a price
which brings the total cost about up to where it should have been bid in
the first place.

I think David Honig has pointed out a kind of naivety about the process of
quality software that allows government and management to persist procurement
through lowest bidder.

&gt; It seems to me that if the specifications are complete and correct then
&gt; there should be no problem.

The problem is that specifications are never complete.  The human users
and implementors are always finding changes that need to be made.  The
procurement process must take into account that the spec will evolve
over time.  The procurement is not only for the product specified, but
for the team that builds it, and revises it as it goes along.

&gt; And I cannot think of another decent way to buy systems (the
&gt; next-to-lowest bidder?  the highest bidder?)  that will solve the
problems.

Indeed, this is a hard problem.  Here's a suggestion for a procurement
process that will do a little more to keep vendors honest:

1. Sealed Bids (same as now)

2. Discard the highest and lowest bids. (Since all bidders are bidding
on the same job, if the bids are wildly out of range there's either a
problem with the spec or the vendor.)

3. Have those who produced the spec visit the remaining vendors and
judge whether the vendor can do what they say they can.

4. Have management choose either the lowest bidder, or the highest
quality based on the recommendation made in the previous step.

Any procurement process that reduces to a simple mechanical process engenders
RISKS.  Although there is the possibility for human error in the process I have
suggested, it is designed to address the faults of the existing procurement
process of "lowest bidder", while minimizing the risk of doing worse than
"lowest bidder".

If, on the one hand, pilots in modern automated planes risk falling
asleep from boredom, and on the other hand, they never seem to get
enough simulator training in really oddball failures and problems,
maybe future cockpits should be designed with simulation software
built in, to allow them to practice while they fly.

They couldn't be as good, naturally.  Real cockpit simulators simulate
everything, including the motions of the simulated airplane, but perhaps going
a few rounds with something more modest, along the lines of a video game, would
be useful nonetheless.  And it would certainly keep the pilot awake!  You just
need to make sure the simulation is never confused with the real thing...

&gt;However, the article does not objectively cite balancing situations in which
&gt;automated systems handled sets of conditions that were too complex and changing
&gt;too fast for humans ever to respond satisfactorily.

That's probably because such situations don't tend to exist.  Automation in
airliner cockpits serves to reduce workload, such as when entering congested
terminal areas.  To insinuate that the pilots *could never* handle such sit-
uations is to ignore that single-pilot general aviation IFR operations do it
all the time.  There may be two exceptions to this generalization:

(1) Extending routine automation into critical weather situations, namely
0/0 (Category III) landing.  Airliners can now land in weather that most of
us wouldn't be caught dead driving in.  Think about it...:-)

(2) A secondary layer, usually transparent to the pilot, when his airplane
itself is so aerodynamically unstable that he could not hope to control it in
a consistent manner over time.  In this case, the flight-control system "sim-
ulates," in-flight, either traditional (as in the case of the 747, which tries
to provide the "feel" of a 707, through control-force dampers or amplifiers)
or untraditional (A320/330/340) flying characteristics.


&gt;&gt;  Still, while simulator training could help for some kinds of emergencies,
&gt;One wonders, "Why not?"  Can the great minds of the aircraft industry not
&gt;postulate virtually any kind of emergency?

Writing simulators is extremely difficult.  The computational ability may
not be available to accomodate higher-fidelity simulations, even if a satis-
factory method existed to write the billions of lines of code required to rep-
resent *every* fault situation.  The most cost-effective method, and the current
trend, has been to identify those factors which are most likely to occur in
a flight (emergency and otherwise), and represent them as realistically as
possible.  In certain cases, "classic crashes" (such as windshear incidents)
may be simulated and pilots run through them.

Rolfe's text, _Flight Simulation_, is a nice overviews of the problems and
promise of flight simulators, both military and civil.


&gt;For years, the US Air Force has been
&gt;flying high performance tactical jets using significant amounts of automation.
&gt;If the automated system fails, the game is over.

The automation is an essential component of the flight control system for these
types of aircraft.  And if it fails, like you say, the game is over: EJECT.
That option does not exist in civil situations.


&gt;The entire article is a good example of the warped treatment afforded a
&gt;complex, scientific topic by the popular press.

The article was largely on-base.  If anyone would like to see what other "so-
called experts" have to say, I recommend Nagel and Wiener's _Human Factors
in Aviation_ (Academic Press: 1988, $65 or so, hardcover).

I was delighted by Don Norman's piece in RISKS 9.15, since I too feel
that RISKS could and should be even better, and I very much liked the
illustrative examples he gave of the sorts of discussions
that it would be nice to see in RISKS. (Peter Neumann's comment,
stating that RISKS by its very nature attracts stories of failures
rather than successes is also true, but somewhat misses the point.)

I have in the past tried on occasion to stimulate discussion of general issues,
rather than just of the details of specific incidents, but without much
success. Let me try again, on the subject of risk assessment this time, using
some points that I made during a panel session at the recent IFIP Working
Conference on Dependable Computing Systems for Critical Applications.

Ideally, deployment of any potentially risky computer-based system will be
preceded by the sort of careful assessment of the risks involved that is
typical in a number of engineering disciplines. There are a number of
well-established techniques for such risk assessment, such as Failure Modes and
Effects Analysis, Event Tree Analysis, and Fault Tree Analysis. As I understand
it, all of these involve enumeration and consideration of possibilities, and
identification of dependencies, which are then represented in some sort of
graph structure, but none of the ensuing analyses take account of the
possibility that this graph structure will be incorrect. To my mind, this makes
these techniques of limited value for systems employing computers running large
suites of software.

In making this statement, I have three characteristics of such systems in mind:
(i) their great logical complexity, and hence the danger of their harbouring
potentially risky design faults, (ii) the largely discrete nature of their
behaviour, which means that concepts such as "stress", "failure region",
"safety factor", which are basic to conventional risk mangement have little
meaning, and (iii) the almost ethereal nature of software, which makes it much
more difficult to identify appropriate components and to understand their
interactions (both planned and accidental) than with many physical systems.

It is of course good practice to design software with a highly modular
structure, and to try to isolate critical parts of the software in as small and
simple a subsystem as possible. However with a really complex system such
structuring is again essentially ethereal and by no means simple. There will
therefore remain a significant and unquantifiable likelihood that such
modularisation and isolation is itself faulty.

I thus believe that the graph structure which purports to represent, at any
significant level of detail, the internals of (especially the software in) a
complex computing system, is likely to be wrong, in that it will not represent
any residual design faults properly, so that such faults will remain an
(unquantified) contributor to overall system risks.

The question of whether we will ever able either to guarantee that a complex
computing system is entirely free of design faults, or alternatively able to
quantify the likely impact of residual design faults is moot. The point I am
trying to make here is that in present circumstances, I see no current
alternative to basing the assessment of the risks of the overall system on a
worst case scenario for the behaviour of the computing system, based on the
physical capabilities of the its interfaces to the outside world, rather than
on mere hopes about its internal activities - and to taking appropriate
precautions externally to the computing system. Yet, unfortunately, one sees
these days the opposite trend: namely the increasing use of computing systems
in situations where there is little or no ability of some surrounding system to
mask the failures of the computing system.

It would be nice to learn the reactions to the above comments of people who
have tried applying conventional risk assessment and management techniques to
systems involving really complex software.

Last evening I visited a local hospital ICU to check on the status of a patient
I had treated and transported eariler in the day (I am a certified paramedic,
in my copious spare time).  The patient was on a state-of-the-art mechanical
respirator.  While discussing the patient's case with the attending physcian at
the patient's bedside, the respirator failed, accompanied by a visual and
auditory fanfare of alarms.  The physcian quickly reset the device and we
continued our discussion.  Moments later the device once again failed and had
to be reset (it should be noted that a number of differing events can cause
alarms in these devices and they occasionally need adjusting and service).  By
the third occurance of this failure I had noticed a pattern.  Each time I heard
radio traffic on my portable radio (in the 800 MHz band) the respirator failed.
We were not transmitting mind you, only receiving but this seemed to be enough
to set off the alarms.  Just then we received a call and when my partner keyed
his mike to transmit several other respirators in adjoining rooms also becamed
alarmed and prompted a flurry of activity to reset them.  Needless to say, our
radios are now banned from the unit.  Unfortunately, I had to leave abruptly

'Business Week' magazine for Sept. 4, 1989 features a cover story entitled
IS NOTHING PRIVATE?  The teaser line says "Computers hold lots of data on
you -- and there are few limits on its use"  

The article focuses mainly on financial data, especially credit records.
It includes some good sidebar pieces:  
  * THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY: THERE'S MORE LOOPHOLE THAN LAW 
    (reviewing existing privacy laws)  
    
  * NEVER MIND YOUR NUMBER -- THEY'VE GOT YOUR NAME 
    (guarding your Social Security Number is almost pointless today)
    
  * THE SCOOP ON SNOOPING: IT'S A CINCH
    (it's easy for almost anyone to get almost anyone else's credit
records)

In that last piece, the reporter posed as an employer checking out potential
job candidates.  He was required to produce almost no verification.  He then
requested, among other things, the credit record for one Dan Quayle (at an
Indiana address taken from an old "Who's Who in the Midwest").  This raised no
alarms.  It turned up an "a.k.a. J. Danforth Quayle" with a Washington-area
address, who charges more at Sears than at Brooks Brothers and has a big
mortgage.  It gave his credit card numbers, etc.  The Vice President's office
was not amused.  "We find the invasion of privacy aspect of the credit
situation disturbing.  Further controls should be considered," said a
spokesman.

Donald J. Weinshank in a recent posting (via Tom Thomson) to RISKS
asks if the law is all we can appeal to in teaching ethics.  The
answer, at least in U.S. taxpayer-supported institutions, must be
"Yes".  The law *IS* the current ethical consensus.  To go beyond the
law in a course taught at a taxpayer-supported institution is to
begin to mix state and religion which we in America have agreed
through law making that we wont' do.  A teacher in a institution
receiving U.S. taxpayer support is legally obliged to state from the
front of the classroom that if it isn't illegal it is by definition
ethically correct.

The following story appeared on the front page of THE SEATTLE TIMES, Monday
September 4, 1989:

WORK IN US: HIGH DEATH RATE --- Associated Press and United Press International

... The National Safe Workplace Institute found that more workers are killed on
the job in this nation than in most other industrialized countries. ... US
workers are 36 times more likely to be killed than a Swede, and nine times more
likely to be killed than a Briton, it said.   The report said one out of 14
workers will be killed or seriously injured at work. ...

[ Such a big difference is surprising to me.  Is this for real?  It is often
noted that European safety regulations are generally more stringent than those
in the US.  Does this contribute to the reported difference, or is the effect
dominated by some other factor - e.g., proportionately more people employed
in hazardous industries in the US?

This report may seem only marginally related to RISKS; at COMPASS '88 last year
someone cited a study that said about two percent of industrial accidents  were
attributable to control system failures.  - JJ]

Quite regularly I receive mail from sources in the U.S., whose computer
systems are obviously unable to handle European-style postal codes (not
fitting the two-letter-plus-five-digit scheme).

Coming in the mail today was something new:  A mass mailing from a North
Californian company, directed at my street address in

  Switzerla, ND 08008    (my four-digit Swiss postal code zero extended)

I still wonder, whether the typist who entered my address that way acted
out of ignorance or in a flash of genius...

Interesting enough, the U.S. Post Office people in California must have
believed that "Switzerla" is somewhere in North Dakota.  I don't think
that "Bulk Rate U.S. Postage PAID" mailings are usually transported
overseas...  All other mail of this type that I receive has some extra
postage added.

This should be investigated.  How about writing a letter to those friends
of yours in Germa, New York or those in Brita, Indiana...   :-)

Recently, my beloved (and elderly) Porsche 924 Turbo expired at the
roadside. It has a electronic engine management system, and after some
initial investigation (including discovering that the hardware doesn't
match the manual!), I realised that the problem was (a) in the EMS, and (b)
beyond my ability to diagnose. I had it towed to the nearest dealer.

After a few days, I rang the dealer to find out what had happened. They
said "We can't find out what's wrong with it". I rang back the following
day, and the day after - Same story. Then I went there. The service manager
sheepishly admitted that their diagnostic computer was faulty, and after
several attempts to diagnose my car, they'd tried it on one of the new 944s
in the showroom, and it had diagnosed that as faulty. They'd had to return
the diagnostic computer to Porsche UK Headquarters for replacement, before
they could fault-find my car.

Motto: "Who will diagnose the diagnostics?"

(P.S. Oh yeah, the fault. New EMS, H.T. module and other bits and pieces.

The discussion to date has been long on complaints, but short on workable
suggestions. I would like to put forward a system which was in use in Canada,
back when I freelanced.

Each bid was assigned points. There were points for having been in business a
while (stability). There were points for having completed past contracts
successfully (competence). There were points for having the necessary employees
in hand.

Note, by the way, that bids are not necessarily just dollar values.  They may
also contain specific plans, which differ in both the proposed method and the
proposed result. These can be evaluated, and given merit points. For example, a
bidder may have seen a way to reduce costs, or may have argued that a danger to
the public safety must be reduced, or whatever. These proposals may try to
justify a lower bid, or a higher bid. The proposals might be judged to have low
merit, because e.g. the review board wasn't willing to cut costs in the
proposed manner, or didn't want to buy that much public safety.

Since this was the government, they could also assign points for "agenda"
items: Canadian content, number of jobs created, minority and regional issues,
being a small business, development of a useful technology, whatever. I never
learned exact details, but then, I am putting this forwards as a workable
general idea, not as some sort of precise formula.

For example, it is possible to give security points to computer purchases.
Bids proposing MSDOS would lose all of these points.  However, if the product
didn't require much security, then MSDOS might still be in the winning bid.

A friend of mine who has his own business has this quote from John Ruskin
(the 19th Century English social critic) on his office door:

"It's unwise to pay too much ... but it's worse to pay too little. When you
pay too much, you lose a little money ... that is all. When you pay too
little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was
incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.

The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a
lot. It can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to
add someting for the risk you run. And if you do that, you will have enough
to pay for something better."

(From "The Guardian" - National Daily Newspaper) Wed 6-Sep-1989

A crusading computer has taken the law into its own hands and caught 41,000
Parisians on charges of murder, extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking and
other serious crimes.  But the big round-up ended in embarrassment after an
admission by the City Hall yesterday that the electronic Batman could not tell
the difference between a parking offfence and gang warfare.  "The accused
persons will be receiving latters of apology." an official at the City Hall
Treasury department said. "Instead of receiving summonses on criminal charges,
they should have been sent reminders of unpaid motoring fines in April. Somehow
or other the standard codes we use for automatically issued reminders got mixed
up."

The first hint of the avenging computer's self-appointed mission to clean up
the capital came at the weekend.  Hundreds of Parisians received printed
letters accusing them of big crimes, but demanding only petty fines for the
major crimes of between #50 and #150 (pounds - UK equivalent).  "About 41,000
people are involved and some of the charges are quite weird."  the official
admitted.  "One man has complained of being accused of dealing in illegal
vetinary products. Unfortunately, other accusations went much further, like
man-slaughter through the administraion of dangerous drugs."  "There were a lot
of cases of living off immoral earnings, racketeering and murder."  The
official said an inquiry had been started to see if the caped computer had a
human accomplice.  So far, no one has asked the Joker if he was in Paris last
week.

I'd like to add one postscript to Brian Randell's observations about the
difficulty (impossibility?  perhaps) of analyzing the failure modes and latent
defects of complex computer systems.  Fault tree analysis, etc., may well be
valid and useful if all one is doing is estimating the probability of failure
under "normal" (even if stressed to the extreme by incompetent operators or
"acts of God") operation.  One must note, however, that if the system is being
"stressed" by a conscious, knowledgeable, determined, perhaps well-funded,
"enemy" even his pessimistic analysis is too-optimistic: if the system has
exploitable flaws they WILL be found; it's only a question of time and energy.

If your radio was part of an 800MHz "trunked" radio system, it may have
transmitted even when you were not keying the microphone.

Trunked radio systems work by sharing a pool of channels between many users.
When a user transmits, he briefly interrogates the controller and is
temporarily assigned one of the pool of channels for his use.  After some idle
time, the channel is considered available for use by other members of the
trunked system.  Normally each mobile (which includes portables, etc) is
monitoring a "home" channel, but when any unit in the system transmits, the
repeater controller sends a signal out that directs ALL the units of that
customer to switch to the channel chosen, typically for the duration of the
dispatch.  The mobiles normally do NOT acknowledge this switching, so they
don't transmit for that reason.  In this way they differ from a cellular
telephone.

However, it is possible to equip mobiles with unit status reporting that allows
the base or repeater to poll each unit for its current status and can even be
used (in wide-area multiple-receiver trunked systems) to guess a rough location
of the unit.  If your system were equipped with such an option, it might well
cause your walkie to key up even if you aren't talking on it.

There are, of course, other reasons for radios to key inadvertently.  I recall
a prime example when the local fire department kept getting jammed; it turns
out that water from the fire hoses was spraying into a gap in the external-
microphone plug in their walkies and keying the transmitter.  Of course it only
happened when they needed a clear channel most: at a working fire.

However, NO piece of life-support equipment should be as RF sensitive as you
describe that respirator to be.  There is simply too much RF in the world
around us to allow that kind of shoddy design.
                                                  	- Brian

The UK experiment with electronic tagging does apply ONLY to remand prisoners
who are not necessarily 'criminals' in the sense of killing/attempting to kill
someone. I referred to them as criminals, since in the English language, you
can call any breach of the law a crime. Speeding on the highway is a 'crime'.
Anything which is punishable by law can be put under a general heading of
'crime'. However don't take my word for this since I am French, so I am sure
that other people are more qualified than me to decide about this. I thank
Geraint Jones for pointing this out. I just didn't think people would get
confused about this.

A recent RISKS reported the experiment with electronic "tagging" of a
suspect awaiting trial in the UK. The system seemingly involves a transponder
permanently attached to the suspect's leg, interrogated at random by a
transmitter attached to a phone. If the transponder fails to respond, the
police are alerted that the suspect may have "escaped".

Datalink newspaper (September 4th) reports that "the only person to have
been tagged [ ... ] was woken in the early hours last week when a fault in
the [ ... ] system keeping tabs on him alerted the police to an 'escape'. "

&gt;2. Discard the highest and lowest bids. (Since all bidders are bidding
&gt;on the same job, if the bids are wildly out of range there's either a
&gt;problem with the spec or the vendor.)

Unfortunately, discarding the low bid *sometimes* disqualifies precisely
the people who are best suited to do the job:  the ones who have found a
new approach that radically simplifies the problem.  The Douglas proposal
for what became the A-4 Skyhawk (1950s carrier-based light bomber) specified
half the weight -- and half the price -- that everybody else thought
reasonable.  In the beginning, everyone thought Ed Heinemann (the chief 
designer at Douglas) was either crazy or trying to pull a scam.  The
Skyhawk arrived on schedule, on spec, on budget, on price, and on weight,
and was built by the thousands in an enormously successful program.

If the bids are wildly out of range, it may be because somebody's got more than
usual insight into what's going on.  This might be either a realistic
assessment of the real cost of the project, leading to a high bid, or a new
approach, leading to a low bid.  Either way, accepting the out-of-line bid
could be the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, it's really hard to tell for
sure.  You can't just look for some radical difference in the proposals,
because there may not be one.  Heinemann didn't coat the Skyhawk with
antigravity paint; he was just unusually firm and thorough about finding ways
to reduce weight.

I must take issue with Scott Guthery's piece in RISKS DIGEST 9.21,
dated 4 Apr 88 (no doubt, due to unusual congestion somewhere in UUCP).
He says that
&gt;  The law *IS* the current ethical consensus.
I will not argue that point, leaving that issue to those more versed in
both the law and ethics.

He goes on to conclude that
&gt; A teacher in a institution receiving U.S. taxpayer support is legally
&gt; obliged to state from the front of the classroom that if it isn't illegal
&gt; it is by definition ethically correct.
This is nonsense.

I am an associate professor at the University of Iowa, supported totally by
tax dollars.  Like most publically supported universities, we teach courses
on ethics and on religion, and even in our computer science classes, we
occasionally discuss ethical issues that are not addressed by the law.
Although the public school systems of our country have seemed to have an
incredibly difficult time with doing this, the universities have always done
it.  The key do doing so is fairly obvious.

The University of Iowa College of Liberal Arts Classroom Manual (1983) governs
the conduct of classes in my college.  It states
&gt; No limitation is placed upon the teacher's freedom of expression in the
&gt; exposition of the teacher's own subject in the classroom or in statements
&gt; made outside the classroom, so long as these statements are in good taste.
&gt; However, members of the faculty are morally bound not to take advantage of
&gt; their positions by introducing into the classroom provocative discussions
&gt; of irrelevant subjects that are clearly not within their respective fields
&gt; of study.

Note that we are not bound by any written contract to obey these rules, nor
are these rules legislatively sanctioned.  These rules do not represent the
"moral consensus" of the state.  Rather, they represent the "moral
consensus" of the college.  In a sense, the faculty of the college have
imposed this rule on themselves in order to avoid situations that might
force the state to reach it's own "moral consensus", codified in law, that
might limit our freedom to teach.

If I were to follow the logic Scott Guthery proposes, the fact that the state
has taken no legislative stand on what I can teach would imply that it is
completely moral for me to teach anything I want.

It is pretty obvious that the statement in our classroom manual is not really
restrictive enough, especially for those teaching in the departments of
religion, economics, political science, and philosophy.  In those departments,
our code would suggest that faculty members would be entitled to advocate or
even require adherence to particular religious, economic, political and
philosophical stands, but doing so is clearly dangerous because it could bring
a legislative reaction.  Faculty members in those departments almost always
have personal stands on such issues, and they are allowed to make their
personal views clear, but at the same time, they are expected to tolerate
students who disagree with their personal views and not try to impose those
views.

Fortunately, we have ethical traditions (most of which are not written into
law) which allow us to retain our freedom of expression.  It might almost
be appropriate to state the following rule as an alternative to Guthery's
statement:

  Laws are enacted when people fail to adhere to reasonable self-imposed
  ethical standards.

Peer groups (friends, neighbors, fellow professionals) can all act to
reenforce such standards.  For example, we have an ethical consensus that
stealing is bad, but no laws would have been enacted if it hadn't been for
the fact that, despite this consensus, some people steal.  In the professions,
we have the opportunity to promulgate ethical codes, and in most mature
professions, we can impose these codes on ourselves, providing methods to
discipline our peers who fail to adhere to these codes.  The more we succede
in our efforts at regulating our own behavior, the less need there is for
society as a whole to reach a "moral consensus" about how we should have
behaved, and encode this consensus in law.

Scott Guthery [...] is confused.  (1) The law *IS NOT* the current ethical
consensus.  (2) The current ethical consensus, if there were one, is not the
same thing as what is ethically correct.  (3) What is ethically correct is
distinct from what is required by one or another religion.  (4) A teacher in an
institution receiving U.S. taxpayer support who says that, "if it isn't illegal
it is by definition ethically correct" should be dismissed for incompetence
both in ethics and in knowledge of definitions.

Religion is not the only other source of ethics in the world.  Philosophy, the
largest such source, is not the same as religion nor is it the same as the law.
Do not blur the distinction between ethics and morals.

The ethics as found in the law should be the _minimum_ required.

It is said that in Soviet Russia everthing that is not explicitly permitted
is implicitly restricted.  Mr. Guthery suggests that in the U.S. everything
that is not illegal is implicitly permitted.  He seems to feel, indeed claims
to know, that in public institutions to claim otherwise is to violate the
constitutional ban on state recognition of religion.
 
Of course, the implication is that law and religion are the only sources of
ethical and moral norms.  If the source is not law, then it must be religion.
For the state to espouse such a norm is to recognize religion.
 
If indeed state institutions are behaving this way, it would explain a great
deal.  It would explain viruses, drug abuse, a quarter of a million teen
pregnancies, and a million abortions.  It would explain 200,000 deaths per
year from the use of tobacco, and 20,000 deaths a year from driving under
the influence of alchohol.
 
If state institutions are behaving this way, it would have to fall into the
category that Bob Courtney calls "malicious compliance,"  conforming to the
law only when compliance will make the law appear absurd.
 
Of course, there are other sources for judging right behavior besides law and
religion.  They include community interest, enlightened self-interest,
legitimate national interest, contract, professional ethics or practice, and
other concepts of fairness, justice or equity.  To that list one can add
tradition and religion.  However, I confess that when I first created the the
list, I forgot tradition and religion; they did not even occur to me until I
read Mr. Guthery's posting.
 
Now, I confess that I erred grievously.  I suggest that all those that would
suggest that law and religion are the only sources of norms of right conduct,
err even more.  The position is so absurd, that had I not left religion off my
list, equally absurd, I might be tempted to conclude that they were malicious.
That is, they took their position in order to demonstrate that the state must
recognize an establishment of religion.

In his article, Scott Guthery states that a Professor at a tax 
supported institution is required to assert that Law == Ethical behavior.

This is not true, and does not reflect either the law or the ethical
guidelines of any of the major professional societies.  I agree that the
proliferation of non-legal guidelines does not provide a good basis for teaching
ethics in computer science.  However, the separation of Church and state does not
prevent the teaching of a course on Ethical behavior of computer scientists.  Nor
does it restrict such a course to an explaanation of the legal constraints.

(Not that there are Religion departments at most major tax supported
institutions.  Also, most philosophy departments have several course on ethics,
including history and modern thoughts.  These courses often deal with the
question of whether certain behaviour is ethical under a certain theory.  Often
this is reflected against the background of the students and professors natural
inclinations and insights into the topic.)

Some of you were fortunate in receiving just one copy of <A HREF="/Risks/9.22.html">RISKS-9.22</A>, but the
reported record thus far is TWELVE.  Apparently the mailing stumbled on a bug
in SENDMAIL that gets activated only rarely on LONG lists (but never before for
RISKS on the Sun CSL.SRI.COM -- although I had just added a bunch of new
addresses before mailing out <A HREF="/Risks/9.23.html">RISKS-9.23</A>!).  

The RISKS list is LONG despite my continual efforts to consolidate multiple
addresses at the same site through redistributions and BBoards, with
considerable volunteer help from around the net as well (for which I am
enormously grateful -- for example, Ted Tso on behalf of MIT readers and Marc
Shannon unwedging the BITNET LISTSERVers have been active far beyond any
reasonable expectations).  I hope that the few of you who still get private
copies can convert to other means of reading RISKS.

Thanks to all of you who reported the multiple mailings, some even observing
from the time stamps that the problem had to be at the CSL end.  (Surprisingly,
nobody asked if I would CATCH 22 before it went any further.)  Unfortunately
the repetitive mailing started happening late Wednesday afternoon, and we did
not get a chance to kill it until Thursday morning when SENDMAIL was still
merrily trying to send out even MORE copies!  Sorry.

Yes, this is just another risk of running RISKS.  (Some of you may remember a
few years ago getting two or three copies of one issue due to a system crash in
the middle of processing the list.)  But for this one there may be some help.

The following message from Bill Sommerfeld was very helpful.

  Date: Thu, 7 Sep 89 00:10:57 -0400
  From: Bill Sommerfeld &lt;wesommer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;
  Subject: Retransmissions of RISKS Forum noticed

  I noticed that we got several copies (nine, as of last count) of Risks
  9.22 at Bloom Beacon today.
 
  There is a bug in sendmail that causes it to dump core (with a longjmp botch)
  in the middle of processing long mailing lists, with the result that the
  addresses earlier in the list tend to get multiple copies.  	         Bill

     [Bill enclosed a patch, which I omit, that was due to Jeff Schiller of
     MIT Telecommunications.  I thought SENDMAIL users might be interested, 
     but did not want to bother eveyone with the code.  However, Jeff's comments
     in the code should be quite interesting to you all as an example of a
     subtle timing problem.    Many thanks to Bill (and Jeff)...    PGN]

 	**  JIS: We change the global variable ReadTimeout to be 5
 	**      minutes. This variable is used by the lowlevel routine
 	**      sfgets to determine how long to wait for input.
 	**      when we get our greeting we return ReadTimeout to its
 	**      previous state. IMPORTANT: The older code I replaced
 	**      used a separate timeout (via a setjmp and longjmp)
 	**      this LOSES REAL BIG if the 5 minute timeout goes off
 	**      for then sfgets gets its stack unwound and leaves
 	**      a lingering event that will eventually cause a longjmp
 	**      to some ancient stack history, sendmail then dies horribly.
 	**      This usually happens only when dealing with large mailing
	**      lists ("xpert" in this case &gt; 200 recipients), which is
 	**      the LAST place you want to dump core, for then the queue
 	**      files are out of date and LOTS of people get a duplicate
 	**      copy of the message that was in progress.

  [We were ready to do a major upgrade on SENDMAIL anyway, so I held off
  on distributing this message awaiting the inclusion of the fix.  But
  in the process of trying to rebuild our SENDMAIL, a NEW old bug was 
  found, so I am sending <A HREF="/Risks/9.23.html">RISKS-9.23</A> to get this news to you -- albeit with 
  some trepidation, and with the mailing list split in twain.   I hope no
  one gets run over by the twain.  PGN]

Medical electronics not RF-proof - doesn't surprise me one bit. It's not just
the medical electronics that get troubled this way.  There was a case some
years back where the fire alarms of a large London hospital were triggered by
low level RF (from walkie-talkie radios operating at about 440 to 470MHz - the
Police band).  A policeman standing in the hospital foyer could easily trigger
the alarms if he used his radio.  The threat to life of an `accidental'
trigerring of fire alarms and the disturbance to treatments consequent on
patient evacuation is just as great as direct perturbation of the medical
equipment itself.

Manufacturers of electronic equipment just don't realise how RF-hostile the
world is.  I can crash my IBM PS/2 by operating a 5-watt handheld UHF radio in
the same room.

On the off chance that no-one else has provided this, I came across
some background information on the infamous French Farce.  Here are
some extracts from "The Australian", Tue Sep 12, 1989:

	The ministry said the mixup occurred because a central computer
	misread magnetic bands on some 41,000 files [ mag stripes? ].
	... the amount of the fines was not affected by the mishap,
	meaning that speeding tickets were transformed into pimping
	offences but carried only a F360 fine.

	Motorists ticketed for failing to stop at a red light were
	fined for "importing unauthorised vetinary medications",
	while those whose only offence was crossing a solid white
	line on the road were charged with "night fishing in a place
	reserved for fish breeding".

Some food for thought.  Some decades ago hospitals and the medical professions
suffered credibility problems both within the health care industry and with the
public.  The industry attempted to solve these problems through the process of
accreditation, which has so far proved fairly successful.  I suggest that this
model could be effective for software development.  Rather than just
prescribing development protocols or requiring exhaustive testing, or certified
practitioners, or relying on product history, why not combine these into a
comprehensive evaluation?  The results could establish a basis for confidence
that an organization produces quality software.
 
Some preliminary thoughts on the model:
 
ACCREDITATION MODEL
 
GOAL
 
     TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF SAFETY, SECURITY, AND
     "RELIABILITY" PROBLEMS IN CRITICAL COMPUTER PROGRAMS.
 
INITIAL SUGGESTED ITEMS FOR EVALUATION
 
     1.  Credentials (of personnel and management:  e.g.,
education, experience, PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION, etc.)
 
     2.  Process (of software development, a la SEI evaluation
questionnaire)
 
     3.  Product (independent evaluation and test of)
 
     4.  Performance (safety and reliability records on released
products)
 
ADVANTAGES
 
     Multidimensional evaluation factors (four to start) avoids
the "single scoreboard" syndrome of maximizing the quantity being
measured regardless of its relevance to performance.
 
     Criteria are not entirely orthogonal, therefore each
criterion provides a safety net to catch problems that one or
more of the other criteria might miss.
 
     Acquiring a significant body of data, a statistical basis
for correlating performance with the other criteria.
 
     Flexible evaluation criteria and flexible standards to allow
for continual improvement.
 
     Establishing a historical reference for measuring progress
toward the goal, to reduce the incidence of ...
 
DISADVANTAGES
 
     Requires significant investment of time and effort to
establish credibility.
 
     Requires cooperation from major customers.
 
     Requires a substantial corps of volunteer firms that are
willing to fund the accreditation process by paying subsantial
dues to the accrediting organization.
 
     Requires that dues paying members be committed to the
accreditation process, that is, be willing to accept negative
outcomes and strive to achieve the standards set by the
accrediting organization.
 
EPILOGUE
 
Such a model has worked for hospitals and health care
organizations, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health-
Care Organizations (JCAHO, formerly JCAH).  The Joint Commission
at one time was so strong that accreditation was a significant
factor in eligibility for Medicare payments.
 
The College of American Pathologists carries on a similar
accreditation for clinical laboratories.
 
Neither of these examples is perfect, but they do work to the
extent that they force their members to focus on important
success factors and continually measure and report the quality of
their products and services.  Thus, the accreditation body
obtains a window on the norms of practice and can stimulate
improvement where necessary.  The ultimate lever for
accreditation is the willingness of paying customers, Medicare, to
accept accreditation as a sufficient guarantee of quality
service.

My sincere regrets for the annoyance to you (and to me receiving triple the
BARFMAIL) for the multiple mailing of <A HREF="/Risks/9.23.html">RISKS-9.23</A> -- especially when that issue
contained an explanation for the fact that readers received from ZERO to as
many as (at least) 12 copies of <A HREF="/Risks/9.22.html">RISKS-9.22</A>.  The problem this time was NOT the
long-list time-out problem, but rather the crash-in-the-middle problem with TWO
server crashes, resulting in many of you getting THREE copies.  (Strangely, a
few of you apparently got MORE!)

Although the first of yesterday's two crashes was accidentally human induced,
the second was intentional, necessary for our wizard to unwedge a serious
catastrophe that had downed an entire subnet of machines for most of the day.
But these were circumstances vastly beyond my control -- which is very annoying
for someone who really tries to do things carefully.

There are some strong lessons for RISKS readers.  Distributed systems are full
of tricky problems (synchronization, timing, distributed atomicity, recovery,
fault tolerance, security, etc.) that are very demanding.  Furthermore, even if
everything were done right in the first place (which is most unlikely), there
would still be extreme difficulties in ensuring that such systems would
continue to work dependably in the presence of on-line evolutionary
development.  It is important that computer researchers and developers be
subjected to the use of the systems and networks that they develop, under
really stressed conditions.  Even then there will be lurking problems that are
not triggered.  So, it is time for some widely used really rugged, secure
network software that is hardware-fault tolerant and system-crash-tolerant.
For example, SENDMAIL should be resistant to time-outs, system crashes, certain
human screwups, debug option attacks, etc.  (Maybe such a version already
exists?)  Overall, you RISKS folks, whose awareness is already heightened, need
to play a stronger role in ensuring that R&amp;D is really concerned about
stringent requirements.

[End of SoapBox]   Peter

P.S. In case you were wondering, I have no intention of making a career of
writing notes to RISKS explaining new ways for you to get multiple copies.  But
I certainly hope this does not recur.  [ReCur ==&gt; doggedly persistent ?  No, I
do not want to be a REcur of havoc.  And NO, I am not trying to overflow the
mailboxes of private subscribers so that they will cancel their subscriptions.]

Your story of the sendmail bug reminded me of a somewhat similar bug in the
UUCP network smart mailer program SMAIL.  As nearly as I can tell, if there
is an address that needs automatic resolution near the end of an alias file
with many (~100) addresses, *that* recipient receives one copy of the mailing,
but a few of the other recipients in that part of the file get an extra copy.
Not nearly as extreme as the sendmail problem, but an irritant nonetheless.

Had you split the RISKS list BEFORE sending out the previous digest, would it
have been a 22 twain?

&gt;From SCIENCE Vol 245, 8 September 1989 p1045

On 27 March ... the spacecraft was passing near Phobos for what was, by then a
routine session of imaging. "It was on automatic operation" he [Kremnev,
director of the soviet spacecraft manufacturing plant] said. "To conserve
energy, the transmitter was off during imaging. But at the time it was due to
restart, no signal was heard on Earth." the control group hurriedly sent up
emergency commands," Kremnev said, and they indeed were able to reestablish
contact. "They got 17 minutes of telemetry data. But the spacecraft was
tumbling so that the only communication was through the spacecraft's small
antenna.. Therefore they couldn't decipher the telemetry. Then they lost the
telemetry". Phobos 2 was never heard from again.

But since then, said Kremnev, "Considerable time has been taken, and we have
been successful in deciphering the telemetry." There is now no doubt that
the failure lay in the spacecraft's on board computer, he said, and was not
due to, say, a meteoroid collision. "after the failure of Phobos," he said,
"People at Babakan said 'We have luck only with women - not spacecraft!'"

Kremnev also offered new details as to how the Phobos 1 spacecraft was lost
last year on the way to Mars. As part of the ground checkout prior to launch,
he said, the spacecraft computer had been loaded with a program for testing its
steering. Once the test was completed, of course, the program was no long[er]
needed. However it was in "firmware" - read-only memory - which could only be
cleared with special electronics equipment. "We would have had to remove the
computer from the spacecraft and take it to the people who could do it," said
Kremnev. "[But] we had VERY little time before the voyage. So the program was
'locked in a safe.'" That is, it was sealed off and rendered harmless by other
software in the spacecraft computer.

Unfortunately, said Kremnev, "the key was found to unlock the safe." On 29
August 1988, not long after launch, a ground controller omitted a single letter
in a series of digital commands sent to the spacecraft. And by malignant bad
luck, that omission caused the code to be mistranslated in just such a way as
to trigger the test sequence. Phobos 1 went into a tumble that was not noticed
until the next attempt at contact, 2 days later. It was never recovered.
Kremnev said that future versions will have more on-board safeguards.

And what happened to the controller who made the error? Well Kremnev told
SCIENCE with a dour expression, he did not go to jail or to Siberia. In fact,
it was he who eventually tracked down the error in the code. Nontheless, said
Kremnev, "he was not able to participate in the later operation of Phobos"

A previous RISKS posting suggested that aircraft be programmed to simulate
various flight conditions for "practice" while in "routine flight", but
stressed the importance of not confusing reality and simulation.  How about
deliberately confusing the two - a pilot in an emergency situation would
not know if it was real or simulation, and could therefore be expected to
behave in a calm, professional manner without panic.  (Sort of like not
telling school children if the fire bell is a true alarm or a drill).
The computer would record response to simulated emergencies for review and
evaluations by the rear echelon boys.

There is also a vast untapped market for an "aircraft passenger simulator".
(get come cramped seats, small rest rooms, hard to view movies and poor food
for a few hours).  The market would be large, and there are many more aircraft
passengers than there are pilots.

Digital Speed Limit Signs Malfunction, Set 75 mph Pace on New Jersey Turnpike

    NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen's fabled
muscle cars might have a field day on the state's turnpike these
days, where digital speed limit signs are mistakenly sanctioning
speeds of 75 mph.
    State police and turnpike authority officials said the erroneous
speed limit has been showing up on about half a dozen of the signs in
northern New Jersey because of a computer programming error. The
legal limit is 55 mph.
    Gordon Hector, a spokesman for the authority, says technicians
were trying to correct the problem. He said workers have also been
correcting the signs manually while technicians ponder the trouble.
Meanwhile, some motorists found the problem amusing.
    "It was kind of strange to see everybody below the speed limit
for a change," joked Casey Raskob, a Springfield, N.J. attorney.
A state police spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said no
traffic problems were reported as result. "But I don't think any
judge is gonna buy that excuse," he said.

In RISKS 9.23, Frank Houston, discussing the accreditation of
professionals, writes:

    The ultimate lever for accreditation [in the medical domain] is the
    willingness of paying customers, Medicare, to accept accreditation as
    a sufficient guarantee of quality service.

I suggest that this is an understatement. A stronger phrasing would be

    The ultimate lever for accreditation is the action of government in
    defining non-accreditation as proof of the absence of quality, and,
    ultimately, banning non-accredited service on that basis.

That's the way it works in U.S. medicine.  

First, it's not that Medicare accepts accreditation as quality-proof, but
will accept real proof too -- rather they accept (as I understand it) _only_
accreditation.

Second, there's the crime of "practicing medicine without a license."

I was kind of watching Mission Impossible the other night (the episode had
something to do with a "man of 1000" disguises trying to frame the gray haired
guy).  For some reason the MI team wanted to access to the personnel records of
a facility (a prison?).  The electronic/computer penetration whiz (the black
fellow) says "Unfortunately, they're not on a computer system so I can't break
into the records [or words to that effect]."  The MI team go on to get the
records in a more mundane way (impersonation, breaking and entering, etc).

I was pleased to note the general effect of stating that computerized record
keeping was a security risk especially with regards to penetration from outside
the physical facility.  This mention of "computer fallibility" is a positive
change in the entertainment industry.

This message will self-destruct in five minutes....   ;-)

Peter on his soap box notes the "tricky" problems of distributed systems.
Anita Jones in her March 1982 survey of multiprocessors in Computing Surveys
noted that programming parallel (or distributed) processors as in the Cm*
system was no more difficult than other programming.  This has been challenged
by other authors (numerous), BUT the software engineering community has by and
large ignored issues which might be "unique" to distributed and parallel
systems.  The education of most students does not include distributed systems,
there being a) no standard product lines, all home grown in different ways from
standard components, and b) no consistent standard software (despite rough
standardization on protocols).  One does not buy a distributed system as one
buys a computer system (although there aren't many differences); one builds
from "scratch." People do not address issues such as synchronization,
atomicity, security, etc. in software design classes, these are issues for the
"operating systems" class.  And it isn't the researchers and developers of
distributed systems who need exposure, we have plenty, it's the students who
need this (as if there really were much of a distinction 8).

In short, I believe programming is going to get harder before it gets easier.
I believe this, because I am grappling with these issues NOW.  I only have to
move my mouse cursor into the appropriate window on my workstation to one of my
parallel processors.

In RISKS 9.23, Frank Houston suggests that software shops use an accreditation
system modelled on that used by hospitals.  The suggestion is interesting, but
there are some big differences between hospitals and software shops.

One primary difference, from the accreditation point of view, is that most
hospitals are big, while many quite competent software shops are small.
Hospitals with fewer than 100 employees are rare, while there are many
corporations in both the software and hardware fields that are smaller.  Many
of these corporations are some of the most creative ones in the field, and the
development of major ideas in both hardware and software can be credited to
them.  The administrative overhead of seeking and maintaining accreditation may
be easy to adsorb into a large organization, but it is likely to be prohibitive
for such small organizations.

Another difference is that most hospitals have only a small number of staff
physicians.  Most physicians practicing in a hospital are not on the staff, but
instead, have an associate relationship.  The analogous structure in a software
shop would be to have the secretaries, machine operators, and a few of the
programmers on the payroll, but to have the majority of the programmers working
there on a contract basis, paid by the customers (patients) and not by the
software shop.  I don't know what effect this has on the notion of hospital
accreditation versus software shop accreditation, but I have a hard time
believing the effect is small.

Finally, a hospital is a clearly defined organizational unit; even if it is
part of a hospital chain, the physical and staff boundaries are easy to define.
Many software organizations are far harder to circumscribe.  Finding
accreditable units in a large corporation may be quite difficult, and I doubt
that entire corporations (say Ford or Xerox) are appropriate units of
accreditation.  From three job interviews I did at Xerox in 1980, I can state
that some software groups in that company were clearly among the best I've
encountered, while others were horribly staffed and poorly managed.  I would
hope that these different groups would be separately examined for accreditation
purposes, but that brings up the problem of size and expense, because the
largest group (and by far the poorest, by all my measures) had only 60
programmers.

Bob Ayers comment in RISKS 9.24 on Frank Houston's accreditation proposal in
RISKS 9.23 was representative of a number of previous comments on my own
and other programmer certification proposals in earier RISKS issues.  He said:

    The ultimate lever for accreditation is the action of government in
    defining non-accreditation as proof of the absence of quality, and,
    ultimately, banning non-accredited service on that basis.

Similar comments were made in response to earlier proposals for programmer
certification.  These comments are reasonably representative of a fairly
extreme libertarian view that government regulation of the free market is
inherently inept and has a corrupting influence on the quality of services
offered by the market.  I believe that these comments need to be answered.

When there is one big customer, I will agree that such a customer has unusual
clout.  Charles Babbage wrote extensively on this, pointing out in his book, On
The Economy of Machinery and Manufacturies, that the theory that the free
market is optimal works only if there are both many competing suppliers and
many competing customers.  The market price will not be the optimal price for
goods in the presence of a monopoly among either the buyers or sellers.

Medicare is certainly a large customer for medical services, and it is indeed
a government program, but it does not follow that government is the "ultimate
lever for accreditation".  In most states, the Blue-Cross Blue-Shield
insurance organization is a bigger customer than Medicare, and their policies
are certainly a bigger lever.  It might be argued that such huge insurance
conglomerates can be viewed as pseudo-governmental, but they are largely
products of the free market at work regulating itself.

Charles Babbage pointed out a second factor that corrupts the free market, the
inability of a customer to discern the quality of competing products.
Babbage's examples were largely drawn from early 19th century scandals
involving milk adulteration, but what he said applies just as well to medical
practice, where I, as customer, am ill equipped to judge the quality of medical
care I purchase.

Babbage said that, in the presence of quality problems and in the absence of
easily discernable indicators of quality, customers will pay prices well
above the market price to buy from a vendor in whom they have confidence.
In such a situation, both customers and vendors benefit from independent
certifying authorities such as, in the classic case of agricultural products,
the USDA.  With colleges and universities, accreditation arose largely
without government involvement, although the US Department of Education now
accredits accrediting agencies.

My favorite example of a purely non-governmental regulatory agency is
Underwriters Laboratories.  They are a creation of the insurance industry, and
they are the primary and oldest regulator of consumer product safety in the US.
The insurers involved cover the manufacturers liability in case of lawsuits
over faulty products, while others offer fire and casualty insurance to
consumers.  Both profit from reduced claims when manufacturers submit products
for UL certification, and customers buy only UL certified products.

My point is this: When it is in the best interests the buyers and sellers of a
product to have a regulated marketplace, the marketplace will be regulated, and
government has little to do with it.  Of course, in times when governments are
big and all powerful, government becomes a natural choice as a regulatory
authority, but in the absence of strong government involvement, insurance
companies, market cooperatives, and other organizations will emerge to regulate
the market.

Government did not invent the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, and it
did not invent the Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals.
Right now, nobody is forced to seek accreditation or certification, but it is
not hard to imagine a few court cases establishing the principle of strict
liability for losses caused by software failures, and if this happens, I see
little hope for avoiding forced adherence to some kind of accreditation or
certification standards in the software industry.  If government does not force
these on us, the insurance industry that emerges to provide malpractice
insurance for programmers will do it.

A mentor from early in my career once told me that if we made a system
idiot-proof, only an idiot would want to use it.  Are modern software systems
directed toward that end?  Is it really too much to ask for people to read and
understand, and even use, documentation?  That's the question at the heart of
the article which follows.

Tom Comeau, Space Telescope Science Institute     |    tcomeau@scivax.stsci.edu


  &gt;From _The DEC Professional_, September, 1989, p. 160.  

   John C. Dvorak, "The Stupidity Factor"

    ....I recently read [an] aricle...about research on the topic of stupidity
being done by Jon MIller of the Public Opinion Laboratory at Northern Illinois
University.  He discovered that 36 percent of the American public believes that
boiling radioactive milk will make it safe to drink.
    The more we study stupidity, the more we realize that the technological
society toward which we're headed must protect itself from its own inability to
keep up with things because of its own stupidity.  The public will be
overloaded with bad information and will be unable to distinguish hokum from
fact.
    People involved in the PC revolution aren't any smarter.  Like the general
public, they suffer from an overall incompetence that stems from lack of
intiative, fear of the unknown, and plain old sloth.  ...
    Watching Microsoft Windows try to turn the corner on its quest for
popularity reflects this.  As easy as Microsoft Windows is to use, it's still
too hard to use.  ...
            [Discussion of the difficulties in bringing up Microsoft windows, 
            and consumer resistance to the product.]
    The attitude seems to be that if the machine booted Windows automatically
and if a lot of extra work wasn't needed, people might like it.  Currently,
it's too much trouble.  The biggest fear is that you'll go through a lot of
effort only to be disappointed with the results: The package won't work as
advertised, or run your favorite program, or it crashes.
    The only computer that has overcome this sloth factor is the Macintosh,
with its logical interface.  Steve Jobs realized that many people don't read.
He put the documentation in pamphlet form.  Plenty of information was omitted,
but who cares?  ...
    People don't read documentation.  This is part of a national trend towards
stupidity, because people don't read anything!  ...
            [Discussion of author's son, who has difficulty reading and 
            following installation instructions for a software game.]
    Is he different from anyone else who refuses to read documentation -- the
majority of today's users?  In the past, it was easy to condemn documentation
writers for their mediocre and hard-to-understand prose.  But much
documentation today is well-organized, simple and easy to follow.  Still,
nobody reads it.  Even sophisticated users -- the ones who used to read
documentation -- have joined the forces of the illiterate.  They argue that
life is too short and that a good program doesn't need documentation.
    What do we end up with?  The market demands bulletproof software that's
extremely intutive.  Can software be so intuitive that it communicates its
commands through some nether world of non-verbal signals?  We can expect
researches to find out.  Meanwhile, interface engineers will make a lot of
money.
    What does the future hold?  Windows will have to change drastically to be
popular, and soon 50 percent of Americans will believe that boiling radioactive
milk makes it safe to drink.

&gt; ... not confusing reality and simulation.  How about
&gt;deliberately confusing the two - a pilot in an emergency situation would
&gt;not know if it was real or simulation, and could therefore be expected to
&gt;behave in a calm, professional manner without panic.  (Sort of like not
&gt;telling school children if the fire bell is a true alarm or a drill).

I think this would be a very bad idea.  Pilots in emergency situations should
indeed behave in a calm, professional manner, but they should not necessarily
behave the same as if it were a practice simulation.  I can't give a good
example because I don't know anything to speak of about planes, but I certainly
can give a fire alarm example.

In a fire situation, you might jump from a second or third-story window, and
sprain some muscles badly, or break some bones.  In a fire drill, you would
never do such a thing.  In extreme situations you would say, "and at this point
I would jump from the window, possibly breaking my leg."  You wouldn't do it.

The trade-offs during practice and emergencies are different, and should be.
It's sad that this means that you can't really simulate emergencies fully.
Nevertheless, it's *true* that this means that you can't really simulate
emergencies fully.

ajr

p.s. when I was in public school, we were always warned about drills.  We knew
whether fire alarms were real or not.

&gt; [SAME QUOTE AS CITED BY ROSENTHAL]

The successful resolution of emergencies invariably results in the aircraft 
being landed ASAP, which isn't terribly profitable.  An *emergency* continues 
until the aircraft is stopped and the passengers deplaned.

As for mucking with the readouts to provide "fault-solving" practice,
the problems are that (a) if we have a system so sophisticated, why bother
with pilot control in the first place; and (b) once pilots learn to distrust
an instrument (say, through negative training), accidents can happen (look
at the recent British Midlands 737 crash last January--it was partially 
attributed to pilot reluctance to trust the new Smiths Industries 
engine vibration indicator, which replaced a device that, on older aircraft, 
had proved to be quite unreliable.).

&gt;There is also a vast untapped market for an "aircraft passenger simulator".
&gt;(get come cramped seats, small rest rooms, hard to view movies and poor food
&gt;for a few hours).  The market would be large, and there are many more aircraft
&gt;passengers than there are pilots.

Before launching an airplane, the large manufacturers do extensive "comfort"
studies on real-scale cabin mockups.    They have employees (or volunteers)
play the part of victims, etc.  They've experimented with some pretty wild
layouts, covering seat-back TV to evacuation scenarios.  By the time the 
aircraft is ready for a "launch" decision, a mockup is prepared for customer 
inspection, and entire "flights" are flown, complete with uniformed stewardesses
and meal service.  I may be wrong on this, but I believe Boeing pioneered the 
practice.

Lest anyone credit Mission: Impossible with advancing the state of computer 
literacy, here's a review I wrote a few weeks back on rec.arts.movies...

Mission: Impossible looked interesting this evening, so I watched it.  My 
mistake.

Tonight's episode was concerned with computer viruses.  It starts up with
a US nuclear submarine "under attack" from an emergency buoy they went to
investigate.  The buoy infected the ship with a "virus," which screwed up
all the control systems.  The ship was ultimately destroyed when torpedoes
(shot to destroy the buoy as a last-ditch measure, no pun intended) blew up
in the loading bay--the sub was destroyed.

The IMF (no not the International Monetary Fund) is called in.  Phelps strolls
up to an F-111, just landed, and chats with the pilot.  The pilot says "climb
on in!"  What does Phelps find, but his CD player!  (the CD replaces the 
tape recorder/envelope used in the old series).  The CD player informs him
that this nasty A-rab arms dealer is in the market for the virus.  He wishes
to market it to "clients in the Gulf," so as to disrupt American warships.

This provides an opening.  The arms dealer is going to Hong Kong to bid for
the virus.  They arrange for him to be detained and a surrogate sent in his 
place.  The person doing the dealing is a US admiral, the ex-head of the 
American-Russian team on "computer virus disarmament," and is an expert on 
"digital warfare."

Still with me? :-)

Anyway, bidding starts.  The IMF gasses the estate where the bidding's
being held, right after the admiral explains that he's giving out the virus
for free-it's the *antidote* that he's offering for sale.  Bidding goes up
to $12 mil before everyone passes out.  The admiral crushes the 3.5" Sony
disk in his hands before passing out.  The evaluation of the man on the 
spot is that "He's destroyed the disk!" Phelps: "We have to go to Plan B."

Plan B involves setting up a sub simulator.  In clasic IMF style, the admiral
is fooled into believing that the collision of two supertankers caused the gas
cloud that knocked everyone out (some combination of chemicals, you see :-)).
A Russian warship is also taken out, as are various airplanes.  One airplane
which crashes is a Russian sub-hunter, which the American sub intercepts.  One
of the crewmen bring a distress buoy on board.  "No, you fools!  Don't bring
that on board!"  Anyway, one thing leads to another, the admiral is
conveniently fooled, and, at the last minute, as the ship's about to be
"destroyed," he enters the "antitote" by hand: he jumps in front of a computer
terminal, types in raw hex at about 150 character per second, and saves the
simulator.

IMHO, this show pushed computer literacy standards back to oh, 1950's science
fiction standards.

(Incidentally, someone mistakenly concluded that the above "jumping in front
of terminal" incident involved a miraculous use of a password...  there was
no password!)

SICK SOFTWARE CHECKS IN AT 100 HOSPITALS
Programming Error Affects Admissions

About 100 hospitals around the country, including Washington Hospital
Center, were forced yesterday to switch from computers to pen and paper
for major bookkeeping functions because a software program could not
figure out what day it was.

Officials said there was no permanent loss of data or threat to treatment
of patients.  But the incident, apparently caused by a mistake in programming,
demonstrates how institutions are accepting the risk that major disuptions
might occur in the workplace as more and more functions are handed to
computers.

The incident affected hospitals that use software and services provided
by a Pennsylvania company called Shared Medical Systems Corp.  The
company stores and processes information for hospitals on its own mainframe
computers and provides software that can be used on IBM equipment.

Problems began to appear at numerous hospitals early yesterday morning.  
As call after call for help arrived at SMS headquarters, technicians there 
realized a pattern was emerging and advised clients to shut down parts of
their computer systems as they searched for the cause.

The problem was traced some hours later to a program that allows hospitals
to automate the ordering and reporting of laboratory tests.  Due to a 
fault in the aging software, the machines were unable to accept as valid
the date September 19, 1989, and went "into a loop," refusing to work,
spokesman A. Scott Holmes said.

By day's end, computer services at about 100 of SMS's 600-700 client
hospitals had been disrupted.

One computer specialist described the problem as a "birth defect", an
accidental fault put in a program in its early days that later threatened
the system's health, in contrast to a "virus," a program that is written
with the deliberate purpose of replicating itself and causing disruption.

The incident also underlined how exacting the computer programmer's art
can be.  To build a system that handles routine tasks of hospital
administration, programmers must write thousands of lines of "code," or
computer instructions, that are intended to let the machine know what to
do in every conceivable circumstance.

At Washington Hospital Center yesterday, nurses used paper forms to admit

restored.  Staff members also had to manually request lab tests because
the automated system would not work.

Delays caused inconvenience but "patient care was not affected," said
Claire Fiore, directory of public affairs and marketing for Washington
Hospital Center.  By about 5 p.m., the hospital's admissions computers
were up and running again.

Also hit was Capitol Hill Hospital, which reported minor disruptions.  "We
were able to function normally," said spokeswoman Lisa Poulter.  "It may
just take a little longer to order services."

In the Petite Finals of the 1989 World Rowing Championships in Bled,
Yugoslavia, five strokes into the Coxed Fours race the microphone wire came
loose from my cox-box (an amplifier and tiny computer).  I lay in the bow and
coxed the entire race unaware that the speaker in the stern was out.  Some of
my crew could hear me, some could not, and in the confusion we rowed vacantly,
far below our potential.  The truth of a loose wire discovered just after the
finish, that I had not fastened the connector well enough, and that a year's
worth of hard work and good speed had just been wrecked, contained enough pain
and horror to burn in my soul forever.

  A varety of Risks messages have discussed medical risks, military risks and
software accreditation.  A recent one from Douglas Jones triggers me to present
a different perspective on the issues of risks and accreditations.  A
fundamental feature of the current medical systems including accredited
institutions is that Doctors have a very high level of personal responsibility
for what happens.  It is not the institution on the line, it's Dr. XXX and in
most larger institutions there are reviews of any "failure" that the Dr. must
answer to peers that understand the issues quickly after such a failure.  There
are are drawbacks to this system, in many cases Dr's over compensate to this
Command responsibility by disregarding or belittling input from patients or
nurses with more contact with patients.  In the military also there is a
somewhat corrupted notion of command responsibility, officers involved in major
incidents/accidents are brought to trial with both career and freedom on the
line if there have been fatalities. The breakdown in the military system comes
in the fact that the line officiers are often in catch 22, if they don't use an
automated system they are risking their ship and if they do and it is used to
attack the wrong targets they are still at risk.
   There are two different messages that come out of consideration of the
medical and military systems, one that creator/providers be made more
personally responsible and two that users themselves bear major responsibility
for results.  This would have a multiplicative effect on lowering risks,
personal responsibility (ownership) of creators tends to drive craftmanship and
quality and usage responsibility tends to slow down the adoption of risk edge
tools.

In hope of stimulating more thought and discussion, I submit the following
responses to comments about my "food for thought" message.
 
 &gt;Date: Fri, 15 Sep 89 08:51:05 CDT
 &gt;From: Douglas W. Jones
 &gt;Subject: Medical accreditation: good for big shops only?
 &gt;...
 &gt;One primary difference, from the accreditation point of view, is that most
 &gt;hospitals are big, while many quite competent software shops are small.
 &gt;Hospitals with fewer than 100 employees are rare, while there are many
 &gt;corporations in both the software and hardware fields that are smaller.
 
I suggest that Dr. Jones look around his home state and the neighboring states.
Many hospitals are not large, and university hospitals are exceptionally large
compared with hospitals in general.  It may be true that hospitals with fewer
than 100 employees are rare, but they are held to standards like JCAHO's
to receive Medicare and insurance payments.  Moreover, JCAHO accredits
many other organizations and facilities, such as nursing homes, which are
small.
 
 &gt;Another difference is that most hospitals have only a small number of staff
 &gt;physicians.  Most physicians practicing in a hospital are not on the staff,
 &gt;but instead, have an associate relationship.
 
Good point.  It is also true that many software and engineering shops
supplement their staff with consultants, which sets up a similar situation.
Nevertheless, I believe that JCAHO reviews credentials and records of both
staff and associates when considering renewal of accreditation.  The task of
reviewing staff credentials for an engineering firm should not be any more
difficult.
 
 &gt;Finally, a hospital is a clearly defined organizational unit; even if it is
 &gt;part of a hospital chain, the physical and staff boundaries are easy to.
 &gt;define.  Many software organizations are far harder to circumscribe. Finding
 &gt;accreditable units in a large corporation may be quite difficult, and I doubt
 &gt;that entire corporations (say Ford or Xerox) are appropriate units of
 &gt;accreditation.
 
I do not suggest that accreditation will be an easy concept to implement.
Consider, however, the impact of a customer requirement that an organization
be "accredited for the development of critical software/systems."  I am sure
that Ford or Xerox would find a way to identify the appropriate units if FAA
made accreditation a prerequisite for award of ATC contracts.
 
 &gt;These comments are reasonably representative of a fairly extreme libertarian
 &gt;view that government regulation of the free market is inherently inept and has
 &gt;a corrupting influence on the quality of services offered by the market.
 
I must point out that my proposal does not specify accreditation by a
government agency.  In fact, having close up and personal experience with
government regulation, I share some facets of the "libertarian view."
JCAHO is not a government agency; it is more like an industry consortium;
another reason why I suggested it as a preliminary model.
 
 &gt;Government did not invent the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, and it
 &gt;did not invent the Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals.
 &gt;Right now, nobody is forced to seek accreditation or certification, but it is
 &gt;not hard to imagine a few court cases establishing the principle of strict
 &gt;liability for losses caused by software failures, and if this happens, I see
 &gt;little hope for avoiding forced adherence to some kind of accreditation or
 &gt;certification standards in the software industry.  If government does not
 &gt;force these on us, the insurance industry that emerges to provide malpractice
 &gt;insurance for programmers will do it.
 
I believe that government would be quite willing to defer to a private
sector institution for regulating developers of critical software and systems,
as it has in the case of JCAHO for medical practice.  Product liability
underwriters and other insurers probably would also.
 
 &gt;Date: Wed, 13 Sep 89 10:46:37 PDT
 &gt;From: Bob Ayers
 &gt;Subject: Medical accreditation: based on "customer" clout?
 &gt;...
 &gt;First, it's not that Medicare accepts accreditation as quality-proof, but
 &gt;will accept real proof too -- rather they accept (as I understand it) _only_
 &gt;accreditation.
 
Legally Medicare and, therefore, Medicaid accept JCAHO accreditation in lieu
of their own reviews.  JCAHO accredited hospitals are "deemed" to be in
compliance with most of the Medicare Conditions of Participation for Hospitals.
 
I suggest that both individuals and organizations need to be accredited.  If you
look carefully at my outline, I suggest that an accreditation board might
examine professional certifications.
 
Nancy Leveson has argued very persuasively that, paraphrasing, "...someone
competent must bear responsibility for software in critical systems ... some
sort of professional licensing or certification is needed."  I have been
skeptical, but now I think that, with the further incentive of accreditation,
professional certification could be made to work.
 
I do not think accreditation is a "silver bullet."  It is just as corruptible
as any system of standards; however it uses the power of the marketplace to
make corruption counterproductive.  Both industry and customers would soon
mistrust a corrupt accreditation system.
 
The views expressed above are my own and do not reflect in any way the policies
of FDA.

idea was, the whole organization would be certified, rather than particular
people or products.  

Does something like this already exist in the UK?  Inside the front cover of

an ad from a systems house bearing an official-looking seal that says "BSI -

	Lots of things in lots of places depend on having a consistant time
reference distributed to many places.  Lots of people have worked out high-tech
solutions to the problem.  Most of them don't work very well.  When's the last
time you saw a master clock system that worked?  The one in our building
certainly doesn't.  Well, today, I saw an interesting solution in Mt. Sinai
Hospital in New York.  Take any of the thousands of closed circuit TVs in the
hospital and set it to channel 6 and you get a picture of a clock.  And not a
digitized, computer generated picture either.  Somewhere there is a TV camera
pointed at a good old sweep-secondhand analog clock, and that's what you see on
channel 6.  Sometimes low-tech solutions are the best.

In RISKS 9.25, Eugene Miya writes (about the special risks of parallel and
distributed systems) that ``[I]t isn't the researchers ... who nead exposure
[to parallel/distributed issues], it's the students who need this [...]''.

There are a growing number of schools that are using Ada to replace Pascal and
Modula-2 in the introductory programming courses.  Using Ada gives a
standardized mechanism for introducing issues such as exceptions and
(concurrent) tasks.

I think that everybody will agree that distributed/parallel is
under-represented, under-standardized, and over-risky.  There is hope, however.

In Risks 9.21, Brian Randell asks for the reactions to his comments from 
people who have tried applying conventional risk assessment and management 
techniques to systems involving "really complex software."  I have had 
experience applying such techniques to many real systems involving software, 
although I am not sure what Brian means by his qualification "really complex."
My arguments in this forum have always stressed the need to eliminate 
unnecessary complexity in safety-critical systems, and I usually refuse to be 
involved in the analysis of overly complex systems until they have been 
simplified.  Brian writes:

  &gt;Ideally, deployment of any potentially risky computer-based system will be
  &gt;preceded by the sort of careful assessment of the risks involved that is
  &gt;typical in a number of engineering disciplines. There are a number of
  &gt;well-established techniques for such risk assessment, such as Failure Modes 
  &gt;and Effects Analysis, Event Tree Analysis, and Fault Tree Analysis. As I 
  &gt;understand it, all of these involve enumeration and consideration of 
  &gt;possibilities, and identification of dependencies, which are then  
  &gt;represented in some sort of graph structure, but none of the ensuing 
  &gt;analyses take account of the possibility that this graph structure will 
  &gt;be incorrect. To my mind, this makes these techniques of limited value 
  &gt;for systems employing computers running large suites of software.

Any type of analysis can be wrong, whether applied to hardware or software.
In some respects, safety analysis applied to software may actually be less
prone to error than that applied to hardware.  Software represents the
logical structure in itself and, therefore, the analysis is performed on
the actual thing that is being analyzed.  For systems involving hardware and
physical devices, abstract models must be formed first on which the analysis 
is applied.  This extra step (building the logical representation of the 
hardware) adds an additional possibility of introducing error.  In my 
experience, safety analysis on software is no more error-prone than that 
performed on complex hardware systems.  For example, I have found that it is 
much easier to build correct software fault trees than system fault trees.

It has also been my experience that the system safety analyses and control 
devices do take into account the possibility of errors in particular analyses 
and failure of safety protective devices.

By the way, not all risk assessment techniques involve graph structures.
Of the three mentioned, FMEA records information in the form of tables and 
does not include identification of dependencies.  Event Tree Analysis is 
equivalent to reachability analysis in computer science models and does 
represents reachable states in the form of a tree or graph structure.  Fault 
Tree Analysis uses a tree in a very different way -- the tree is just a 
convenient notation for representing a boolean expression that records the 
relationship between states or events.  It could easily be replaced (and often
is) by formal logic expressions.

  &gt;In making this statement, I have three characteristics of such systems in 
  &gt;mind: (i) their great logical complexity, and hence the danger of their 
  &gt;harbouring potentially risky design faults, (ii) the largely discrete 
  &gt;nature of their behaviour, which means that concepts such as "stress", 
  &gt;"failure region", "safety factor", which are basic to conventional risk 
  &gt;mangement have little meaning, 

As I understand it, safety factors are built into hardware systems because 
of the possible inaccuracies of calculations on continuous models, the
limitations of these models in representing real systems, and the possibility 
that the basic assumptions of the models are incorrect for the actual physical 
systems that the models represent.   

Because software can be analyzed using discrete mathematics and logic,
some of the need for safety factors in the analysis are eliminated.
It is, of course, always possible for the underlying assumptions (e.g., that
the computer hardware does not experience failures) of software analyses
to be violated.  Brian is correct that safety margins may not useful to 
protect against this.  However, run-time checks on basic assumptions (using 
built-in test, assertions, TMR, etc.) can be used in computer systems to
provide the same function as safety margins in continuous systems.  Failure
regions and safety envelopes are easily applied to software. Furthermore,
many, if not most, of the safety devices used in conventional risk management 
are applicable to discrete systems.

  &gt;and (iii) the almost ethereal nature of software, which makes it much
  &gt;more difficult to identify appropriate components and to understand their
  &gt;interactions (both planned and accidental) than with many physical systems.

I don't know what is meant by the "ethereal" nature of software here.  Floyd,
Hoare, and others who have followed them have demonstrated that the formal
semantics of software can be specified and that software can be treated
as a mathematical object.  Admittedly, analysis on semantically complex 
software is difficult.  This is why the argument has been made that the 
semantic complexity of the software used in safety-critical systems must
be limited as long as our analysis techniques are limited.   However, I have 
rarely found that this limitation is not possible, even when the system of 
which the computer is a component appears quite complex at the system level.  
(This goes back to my recent discussion with Dave Parnas in Risks).

I think it is a mistake to underestimate the complexity and difficulty of
identifying unplanned interactions in physical systems.  Perrow's book
on "Normal Accidents" argues that such interactions (stemming from complexity 
and coupling) are inherently not possible to identify and control in complex 
physical systems, and he provides many examples of accidents that have 
occurred as a result.  Again, given that at least the software can be thought 
of and analyzed as a model of itself, in the future we may find that it is 
actually easier to identify and control such interactions in software than in 
physical systems.

  &gt;It is of course good practice to design software with a highly modular
  &gt;structure, and to try to isolate critical parts of the software in as small 
  &gt;and simple a subsystem as possible. However with a really complex system such
  &gt;structuring is again essentially ethereal and by no means simple. There will
  &gt;therefore remain a significant and unquantifiable likelihood that such
  &gt;modularisation and isolation is itself faulty.

Again, I do not understand the use of the word "ethereal" with respect to
software structure.  Of course, modularization and isolation may be faulty
in software.  It may also be faulty in hardware.  Engineers also use 
analysis techniques, e.g., Sneak Circuit Analysis, to attempt to identify
unplanned interactions in electronic systems.  Unfortunately, this type of
fault is as unquantifiable for hardware as it is for software.

John Shore in the Sachertorte Algorithm has argued that physical systems 
often have simpler interfaces because of the inherent difficulty of building 
complex interfaces in such physical systems versus the simplicity of making
complex interfaces in software.  But that does not mean that it is not 
possible for software engineers to exercise discipline in order to control 
and limit the complexity of the software interfaces to that which we can
analyze with some degree of confidence.  Modularization, information hiding, 
and isolation applied to software are essentially the same procedures that 
are used to control complexity in hardware.  

  &gt;I thus believe that the graph structure which purports to represent, at any
  &gt;significant level of detail, the internals of (especially the software in) a
  &gt;complex computing system, is likely to be wrong, in that it will not 
  &gt;represent any residual design faults properly, so that such faults will 
  &gt;remain an (unquantified) contributor to overall system risks.

I am not sure what Prof. Randell here means by a "graph structure" representing
the "internals" of software.  For example, a Software Fault Tree represents a 
boolean expression of events that can lead to a hazardous condition.  It does 
not represent residual design faults (although the process of building the tree
may identify some critical ones) or the structure of the software.

I agree that all design faults cannot be identified with high confidence for 
software.  But safety analysis does not require this.  In my experience in 
using software fault tree analysis on real software systems, the most useful 
aspect of the technique may lie in its ability to identify hazardous states 
that need to be detected at runtime (perhaps by assertions or acceptance 
tests) regardless of the actual design faults (or underlying computer hardware 
faults) that caused them.  

I should add that most safety analysis techniques on physical systems are 
not able to quantify the contribution of residual hardware design faults
on system risks either.  They basically quantify only risks based on physical
failures, not design errors.

  &gt;The question of whether we will ever able either to guarantee that a complex
  &gt;computing system is entirely free of design faults, or alternatively able to
  &gt;quantify the likely impact of residual design faults is moot. 
  &gt;The point I am trying to make here is that in present circumstances, I 
  &gt;see no current alternative to basing the assessment of the risks of the 
  &gt;overall system on a worst case scenario for the behaviour of the computing 
  &gt;system, based on the physical capabilities of the its interfaces to the 
  &gt;outside world, rather than on mere hopes about its internal activities - and   &gt;to taking appropriate precautions externally to the computing system. Yet, 
  &gt;unfortunately, one sees these days the opposite trend: namely the increasing
  &gt; use of computing systems in situations where there is little or no ability 
  &gt;of some surrounding system to mask the failures of the computing system.

I agree with this conclusion.  It is something I have preached for a long time,
and, in fact, it is exactly this worst case scenario analysis that is involved 
in the application of safety assessment and management techniques to software 
and to systems containing computers.  For example, it is what I was suggesting 
in my discussion in Risks with Bev Littlewood about using a probability of "1" 
for software failure in system fault trees.  Unfortunately, it is not 
sufficient, and "taking appropriate precautions externally to the computing
system" often requires the same type of system level safety analysis including
the internal design of the software that Brian seems to be arguing above is
not possible.

In particular, risk assessment and management techniques for physical systems 
may be no less error prone than that applied to software.  The hardware backup
systems that Brian (and I) suggest may themselves fail or contain design 
faults.  This does not mean that they should not be used; it merely means 
that multiple "levels of defense" (a term common in the nuclear industry) 
are necessary including both hardware and software safeguards and analysis.
We should not rely entirely on hardware safety devices.  Risk assessment
and management at the system level that excludes the behavior of the
software in the analysis and in the design of the software is incomplete
and thus potentially dangerous.

Furthermore, it is not always possible to design physical devices to mask 
completely or with high confidence the failures and errors of the computing 
subsystem.  One reason this is true is that the software is usually controlling
the other components of the overall system, and it is difficult to build 
physical devices that are able to identify and mask control errors (versus 
total failures) before a hazardous system state is reached.  When it can, this 
should obviously be done.  But what will we do about other very desirable 
systems (e.g., medical systems that could in themselves save lives) where 
this is not possible?

&gt;...  Using Ada gives a standardized mechanism for introducing issues such
&gt;     as exceptions and (concurrent) tasks.

Ah yes, Ada* has a standardized mechanism for (concurrent) tasks, but Ada*
unfortunately does not have a good (IMHO) model for concurrent activities to
communicate. Their rendezvous is as bad as the "remote procedure call"
technology. We also need to discuss asynchronous IPC which is done at even
fewer places. This message is an example of asynchronous inter process
communication. I can guarantee you that i'm doing other things until you
respond or acknowledge (or this message gets dropped in a bit bucket somewhere)
and neither RPC nor the rendezvous allows that. So please don't tout Ada* as
the cure-all for concurrency. We all know that
		"dod created ada and it was good."

&gt;Due to a fault in the aging software, the machines were unable to accept as
&gt;valid the date September 19, 1989, ...
&gt;One computer specialist described the problem as a "birth defect", ...

Just what we need -- more jargon for the media to splash around. "Birth defect"
instead of just simple "error" or the traditional "bug".

Does anyone know if this was one of the built-in magic-number date breakdowns
that have previously been mentioned on RISKS? That is, the ones where the
system date/time is maintained in a field containing the number of seconds
since some arbitrary start-date in the past, and which will fill up and trip
back to 0 at some predictable future date (at which time all applications using
that OS or system will trash their date processing and mangle any data based on
dates... :-( ).

I was hoping that someone out there has kept track of and will post a note
listing those magic dates for various OS's and systems. It will be a useful
reference for all of us.

Two articles in RISKS 9.26, namely "Man-Machine Failure at 1989 World Rowing
Championships", and "An Interesting Answer to the Distributed Time Problem"
reminded me of a certain performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on December
12, 1988, in which I sang in the tenor section offstage in Montreal. The
National Film Board of Canada has just released a video documentary about
this event, entitled "Satellite Symphony --- One Woman's Dream".

The dream in question was to conduct an orchestra in Montreal, with choirs in
San Mateo, Geneva and Moscow. Unfortunately, as the links between these places
were via satellite, there were perceptible delays in satellite transmission,
making it difficult to get everyone in sync.

One solution tried was to send a cue to the remote choirs ahead of the conductor
in Montreal, so that their sound would come back in time with the orchestra.
This proved to be unworkable, for the delay required was in terms of
milliseconds, and not in terms of beats and fractions thereof. Also the
response times of the remote choir conductors and their singers was difficult to
assess, and the main conductor might not be at the same tempo from one
performance to another.

The solution that was finally adopted was to transmit a recording of the dress
rehearsal of the previous evening to the remote choirs, ahead of the live sound.
With the aid of an earphone, the conductor in Montreal would hear and follow
the same recording, with a delay to compensate for the two-way satellite
transmission of her cues and the choirs' singing in response. (I'm glossing over
the technicality that number of satellite "hops", hence the delay, was different
for each choir.)

So far, we have seen the master-clocking difficulties. What happened on concert
night? Yes, a proverbial loose wire. The conductor's earphone malfunctioned,
although the choirs heard the recorded sound by satellite! After a 45-second
wait, and a fruitless call for assistance (she couldn't get a reply on the
defective earphone without leaving the podium, or having someone come out on
stage), she decided to start anyway. Radio Canada technicians sent the live
sound to the remote choirs. The end result was that the choirs missed their
first entry. Fortunately, the Montreal Symphony's choir was on hand backstage
in Montreal as a backup, providing the illusion to the audience that the other
choirs had indeed come in. The rest of the choirs managed to come in further
on, more or less on time. The resulting sound was, as Spock of Star Trek would
say, "Fascinating".

Following Hollywood hi-tech practice, and minimizing the real-time risks, next
time you might try videotaping the orchestral dress rehearsal in Montreal --
with the option of the local backstage chorus being heard only on ear-phones by
the conductor and players, and recorded on a separate audio track -- then
letting San Mateo, Geneva and Moscow dub their contributions independently
(while each watched the videotaped conductor and heard the dress rehearsal
orchestra audio), and finally mixing the whole thing together in a `live'
performance.  That way the conductor would not have to rely on ear-phones --
she would be mimicking herself on the tape monitor while the sound of taped
choruses and the prerecorded orchestra filled the hall.  The Montreal orchestra
folks could synch their playing (especially the wind players, who would indeed
be lip-synching) to the recording -- or simply fake it altogether!  With a
little computer processing you could even do real-time resynchronization to
compensate for recording machines that were slightly off speed.  However, the
whole thing seems somewhat silly because the conductor could not influence the
performance in progress, which was presumably her original intent.  And the
results had to be MURKY!  With the transmission delays, you cannot really
afford to let anyone hear another group anyway unless recorded; because the
time delay from `ictus' (low-point of the beat) to sound attack generally
varies with the tempo, and because it is very difficult to anticipate
adequately from auditory cues alone, the visual cues are much more important --
even if tape delayed.  Furthermore, if there is no live playing or singing
except maybe locally, you can afford to run everything tape delayed with
variable delays in the premix.  (I hope they weren't singing in English, French
and Russian!  But I am reminded of two high-school bands getting together
unrehearsed in 1949 for the Star Spangled Banner, with one playing in Bb, the
other in Ab.)

Perhaps I got parODied away.  It happens every now and then.  But this is
really a marvelous real-time synchronization problem, and the risks in pulling
it off are considerable.  On the other hand, if you lose one chorus completely,
probably nobody in the audience would ever know -- except that the Russian
accent in German might suddenly disappear.

Freud would have been amused with the aural fixation.

     ``Freude, Freude, got 'er, 'funken,     {as in RundFunk = broadcast}
       Sighed, `umschlungen, millionen'!''   {THAT's a lot of singers.}

At the very end of an article in the 22 Sep 89 San Francisco Chronicle from the
NY Times ("Cause of Accident a Mystery; Probers Can't Find Pilots in USAir
Crash") is this:

  ``Aviation experts said the controls of the 737-400, a modified and
  modernized version of a plane that has been one of the most reliable in
  commercial aviation for many years, are unusual in that they are integrated
  with computers.  Instead of pushing a throttle to accelerate, a pilot uses a
  computer-like keyboard to enter in a set of commands that set the power of
  the engines on takeoff.  It is possible, experts said, that an erroneous set
  of numbers was entered and that this accoutned for the insufficient power on
  takeoff."

Earlier in the article was this:

  ``... the pilot had flown the planes for only two months, and the co-pilot
  was said to have been in a 737 cockpit for the first time. ... initial
  reports indicated that the co-pilot was at the controls during the take-off
  ...  the co-pilot told the Port Authority police shortly after the crash that
  the pilot had been "mumbling" and "acting irrationally" just before
  takeoff.''

    [Saturday's and Sunday's papers stated that officials had indicated that a 
    wrong button had been pushed, although Sunday's paper suggested that there
    might have been mechanical failure as well...  The pilot and copilot have
    been suspended for disappearing afterwards.]

In RISKS-DIGEST 9.27, Will Martin asks:
&gt;Does anyone know if this was one of the built-in magic-number
&gt;date breakdowns that have previously been mentioned on RISKS? ...

I'm sure that many people will respond to Will Martin's question.  My lucky
guess was that September 19, 1989 was 32767 days past a certain magic date, and
I was off by one: September 19, 1989 is 32768 days past January 1, 1900.  I'm
shocked that the programmers for this system didn't think it would be used all
the way into 1989, or even worse didn't consider how long it would be used at
all.

The only other date limit that I know of is the UNIX time() limit of Januray
19, 2038 at 3:14:08 AM, when the value returned by time() will become negative
if you treat it as a long.  If we start treating the value returned by time()
as an unsigned long, we push the magic moment back to February 7, 2106 at
6:28:16 AM.

All calculations were performed on my trusty HP-41CV with its time module,
which stores alarm times as the number of seconds past midnight, January 1,
1900.  Therefore, it can only represent times up to November 20, 2216, 5:46:39
PM.  However, the programmers put in a software limitation of December 31, 2199
on times.  This means that my HP-41CV clock will work longer than UNIX clocks
without modification; not bad for a handheld computer that's showing its age
even now.

I've recently seen reports of the proposed new Canadian goods and services tax
which raise some disturbing questions.  It appears that a major part of the
proposal is to levy the tax on essentially all occasions when goods or services
are sold, and hence to make tax collectors of small businesses such as piano
teachers and people who do house cleaning.  Of course, such people are already
expected to pay income tax. The new proposal seems to be that they should also
collect 9% off the top and send that to the friendly feds without waiting for
April.

I somehow doubt if the visionary stupidity necessary to develop such a proposal
to the point of law could have existed unaided by computers.  I have no inside
contacts in the Canadian finance department, but I envisage beaurocrats working
over spreadsheets projecting total annual cash flows, no doubt consolidating
all the char ladies in the country into one cell, and eagerly taking the
results to weekly 5 minute sessions with the minister, refining all the guesses
until the spreadsheet projects exactly what the minister wants to hear.

The beauty of a spreadsheet is that it doesn't require any common sense to
operate.  I'm sure that if it occurred to anyone to question the validity of
lumping all the char ladies into one cell, he kept it to himself if he valued
his career.  After all, it should be easy enough for the char ladies to change
the accounting packages on their PCs to deal with the new tax, and surely they
would have no trouble delivering their collections by electronic funds transfer
at essentially no cost to anyone - in fact, surely, time spent thinking about
the char ladies at all was time wasted?

I'm not sure what one can hope to do about this sort of thing.  I suppose
ethics and social responsibility courses at university might help, but it may
be too much to hope that government officials would concern themselves with
such issues, even if we could get them into computer science curricula.
Perhaps all we can hope is that our universities will find ways of increasing
the small minority of all their graduates in whom they have developed the habit
of occasionally thinking about what they think.

It should be obvious that these views do not represent those of my employer, or
probably even myself on a sunnier day.

I cannot resist adding a note of industrial archeology to this discussion.
People interested in how grandpa solved these problems should look into the
design of the Synchronome clock, invented in the 1920's by one F.  Hope-Jones.
This consisted of a master pendulum unit (accurate to a second a year or so)
electrically driving any number of slave dials.  One ran as a siderial clock at
Greenwich from 1926 to 1935 without failure, a total of 284 million swings of
the pendulum.  Plans and instructions for making one of these magnificent
beasts can be found in the old Scientific American "Amateur Telescope Making"
series, Book Two, pp 427-446.

Gears and casting sets used to be available to amateurs from the (presumably)
long-gone supplier.  [The Synchronome Co., Alperton, Wembley, Middlesex,
England is given as the 1935 address, in case any of our British Correspondents
wish to go hunting for the site.] Today you would have to gain access to gear
cutting machinery; the castings (mainly brackets) could be built up from bar
stock using modern adhesives.

This is a rather common misunderstanding (at least) of RPC.  With the RPC
model, the idea is to separate concurrency from communication mechanism.  If
there are concurrent activities (e.g., sending-message-receiving-reply and
doing-other-work), each of them can be encapsulated in a concurrency unit
(process or thread) while communication is done synchronously by RPCs.  In
fact, it's the very synchronous nature which makes a lot of things simple in
such a situation.  So please don't tout RPC is bad because of its
synchronousness.

In RISKS 9.27, the Peters Jones and Neumann suggested ways of faking a
distributed performance of Beethoven's 9th so that it would appear to be
synchronized.

Film-music recording has a virtually identical problem.  Here, it is critical
that the music is precisely synchronized with the action onscreen.  Rather than
depending on the conductor for cues, each musician has her own headphone and
listens to a click track: one electronic click for each musical "beat".  The
film-music conductor's job is then reduced to course-grain musical issues, such
as volume balancing.

(This itself is an exaggeration of the traditional conductor/performer
relationship, wherein the performer takes care of the fine-grain details of her
particular instrument while the conductor concerns herself with the orchestral
sound as a whole.)

For the Beethoven example, you would need &lt;n&gt; copies of a common click track
which a local conductor would have the responsibility of following.  Now the
problem has been reduced to starting the performances "together".  I quote
"together" because to make the final performance sound synchronized, the click
tracks startup would have to be staggered to overcome the satellite delays.

Finally, I think that this sort of synchronization has a lot of precedent in
human endeavors.  Consider trapeze artists who get synchronized at the
beginning of a complicated stunt and must then rely on their own "internal
clock" to be at the right place at the right time.  Same for well-tuned sports
teams.

Jon Jacky asks for UK input on the ISO 9000 accreditation system.

ISO 9000 is the international standard for quality management systems. It
does not define a system, it defines what a system must contain. ISO 9000 is
actually a series of standards, and ISO 9001 covers all of design,
manufacture, test and maintenance.

ISO 9001 is not specific to software - it is generic, and needs to be
interpreted for each industry (or "economic sector"). It is based on British
Standard BS 5750. The EC (European Commission) has directed that each sector
should introduce a "sector certification scheme" to certify compliance with
ISO 9000/9001. In the UK the software sector certification scheme will be
called TickIT. [ just the tickit ... getting your tickit ... ...]

In the UK the BSI (British Standards Institute) has run a Registered Firms
Scheme since 1979. To get BSI accreditation you have to have in place a
quality management system which complies with BS5750 (now ISO 9001), and BSI
audit you to ensure that throughout your organisation, every project and
activity complies with your quality management standards in every respect.
It's fairly tough to get.

To retain your registered firm status, you have to agree that BSI auditors
can come in to the company without notice (we get 24 hours, usually) up to
four times a year (we have had three each year) and repeat the spot audit.
Typically they may ask what projects are active, and inspect the current
list; choose a project and look at the latest status report; select a recent
deliverable and look at the review reports; select an identified defect and
demand evidence that the defect was corrected before delivery.  Or they may
pick a standard and look at how it has been applied on several current
projects across the company.  If they find discrepancies they insist that
they are corrected, and they may withdraw accreditation.

It's good consultancy - ISO 9001 is a *process* standard, and the Praxis
quality management system is heavily based round formal reviewing, so it
seems right that the application of the quality standards should themselves
be subject to formal independent review.

Some clients take comfort from the accreditation and do not themselves audit
our standards; some make BS 5750 mandatory in requests for tender. The EC
will mandate iso 9001 compliance in all public procurement at some point in
the future.

And yes, before someone else points it out, it is Praxis that advertises as
"the first systems house to achieve BS 5750 (ISO 9001) certification for all
software development". We believe in formal QA as an essential component of
software engineering, so we built a company round it.

The following is a description of a toxic spill that came close to having
disastrous consequences for the California Department of Education.  The State
learned a lot form this experience and I thought others might find it
interesting.
 
   Joe Pujals, State Information Security Manager, Office of Information
   Technology, 915 L Street, Sixth Floor, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 445-1777,
   ...UCBVAX!UCDAVIA!CALDWR!JOEP
 
THE EVENT
 
At 3:02 AM, Tuesday, February 21, an electrical switch located in a vault in
the garage of the California Department of Education arced.  The resulting
explosion spewed 10 gallons of coolant oil containing polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB) through the electrical equipment vault.  The loss of the switch and
associated transformer was immediately noted in the control room of the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and a repair crew was dispatched
to the trouble area.
 
Three minutes later, at 3:05 AM, heat and smoke sensors located in a computer
room on the third floor of the building activated.  The fire detection system
sounded an alarm at the office of the California State Police.  Following
procedure in responding to the alarm, State Police called the fire department.
In addition they called two Department of Education Supervisors, telling them
that the fire detection system in the computer room had alarmed and requesting
that they send personnel with appropriate keys to the building immediately.  A
passing taxi cab driver, hearing the explosion and seeing the smoke, also
reported the incident to his dispatcher who in turn called the fire department.
 
By the time Department of Education employees arrived, approximately 40 minutes
later, the smoke had cleared and locks to the garage and electrical vault had
been cut.  Fireman and SMUD crews had determined that there was no immediate
danger from fire or loose electrical wiring.
 
The switch and transformer involved in the incident also provided power to the
State Office Building one (Jesse Unruh Building) located one block away.  The
loss of power forced closure of that building until approximately 1:00 PM that
afternoon.  The California State Treasurer, Department of General Services and
several other agencies were affected by the power outage.
 
The fire department had cordoned off the building to keep all but emergency
personnel away.  Education personnel gave fire department personnel their keys
to the 3rd floor computer room and requested that they check for a fire in that
area since the fire detection system had sounded.  Firemen dressed in
protective clothing went to the computer room.  On entering, they did not see
any smoke and they noted that the room temperature was normal.
 
The computer at the department of education consists of a TANDEM EXT25
computer, printers and terminals.  The computer is used as a remote processor
and print driver.  Data files are maintained and computer processing is done at
one of the State's two major computing centers located a few miles away.  The
department has approximately 475 personal computers in the building that are
mainly used as productivity enhancement tools.  The department spokesman
indicated that some production jobs were done on microcomputers but were not
sure how many applications or what they were.  However, they did feel that the
impact to the department, if they should be lost, would be minor.
 
Within hours, SMUD called the American Environment Management Co. to begin the
cleanup and PCB decontamination process of the electrical vault and garage
area.
 
Because this was an industrial accident CAL-OSHA was called.  CAL-OSHA
recognized that there could be additional problems associated with the PCB
spill.  PCB produces the carcinogens, dioxin (polychlorinated dibenzo dioxins)
and furan (polychlorinated dibenzo furan), when subjected to high heat.  At
this time, it was unknown if the heat generated by the arcing and subsequent
explosion was sufficient to generate dioxin.  One other nagging question raised
concerns: what had set off the fire detection system in the computer room?  Was
it toxic material or had the sensors been activated accidentally?  At the time
of the explosion, the air conditioning system in the computer room and in
another computer support area had been operating.  Had toxic material been
sucked into the return air intake and contaminated other parts of the building?
 
SMUD representatives at first believed that the toxic material had been
contained in the electrical vault but could not explain the coincidental
activation of the fire detection system.  Examination of the vault revealed
that there was space between holes cut in the vault for conduit and the conduit
which carried the electrical cables.  It was possible for toxic material to
have escaped through the gap.  The conduit lead into switching equipment in an
adjoining room.  After passing through the switching equipment power was
transferred to the electrical closets located on each of the five floors
directly above the switching equipment room.
 
Toxic experts from the Department of Health Services were called for advice.  A
consensus was reached that extensive tests would have to be conducted to insure
that the building was safe before employees could be allowed to return.  Tests
were started immediately.  Test material was taken from around the holes cut
into the electrical vault and from various areas throughout the building,
including the computer room.  The tests conducted were extensive and would not
be completed before Saturday, February 25th, five days following the toxic
spill.
 
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSE
 
Within a few hours of the incident, it was recognized that normal operations of
the Department of Education's staff housed in the affected building could not
resume that day.  The decision was made to inform employees to remain at home.
Critical management staff were told to report to another location of the
Department of Education, some blocks away, to begin the recovery planning
process.
 
Space was cleared at the new location for the director and executive staff.
Training rooms and additional space in the same building were obtained from the
building owners and from a local University to house the essential displaced
staff.
 
A public information office established a media information center in order to
provide accurate and timely information to radio, television and newspaper
reporters.  One of the first and most important steps was to enlist the aid of
the radio and television stations to make announcements requesting people to
stay at home.  The announcements also contained a special telephone number for
emergency information.  The special number was for a voice mail system.
 
The voice mail system proved to be one of the most valuable tools in providing
staff with information.  The voice mail system, capable of handling 50 incoming
calls at a time, handled approximately 2500 during a seven hour period.  This
is considered to be a volume of calls handled in 53 hours of normal operation.
 
As is normal in an emergency, the situation is not always clear, information is
not always timely and new problems always seem to appear from nowhere.  The
possible release of carcinogenic toxic substances, such as PCB or much more
dangerous dioxin and furan, in a public building was considered by the various
emergency response offices to be a unique event.  As a result, there was not
much past experience to guide the authorities in their actions.  Because of the
many unknowns concerning the toxic spill, the decision was reached to be
cautious in the reestablishment of normal operations in the building.
Extensive testing would be required, and that would take time.  If the tests
proved to be positive, that is, if toxic elements were found in other parts of
the building, a relocation of personnel to a new site would be necessary.
 
The Space Management Office of the Department of General Services was alerted
to the problem and was asked to begin the process of finding space for
approximately 650 people.  Potentially usable space was found, but lease
negotiations were held off until the results of the tests were determined.
 
The immediate problem was what to do with 590 people until normal operations
could be reestablished. Of the 590 staff, 150 people were on business trips
throughout the State and would not represent a placement problem until they
returned.  The department examined travel plans and attempted to reschedule
planned business where it was reasonable.  Others were asked to take scheduled
vacations.  Where it was practical, staff were directed to do their normal
office work at alternate sites within the department or other agencies.  The
remaining employees were simply put on administrative leave.  Since the
decisions affected both professional staff as well as nonprofessional staff,
the department included the California State Employees Association when
bargaining unit staff were involved.
 
By the end of the second day, the department was reasonably sure that toxic
substances had been contained but could not be certain until more definitive
tests were concluded. If the toxic material had not been contained as it
appeared, but had indeed spread to the rest of the building then there would be
a number of new questions to be answered.  For example, could the tons of
documents, paper files, magnetic tapes and floppy diskettes be decontaminated
or would they simply be buried?  Could the hundreds of microcomputers,
terminals, typewriters and other pieces of office equipment be decontaminated
or would they have to be replaced.  How do you, or should you, replace
information contained in the paper files?  These and many more questions would
have to be answered in the next few days if any test came back positive.
 
On Saturday afternoon the results of the tests came in; they were negative.
Employees could reenter the building on Monday.
 
The cost of this disaster probably will not be known for a few weeks.  It will
take time to calculate the cost of lost time.
 
It is interesting to note that in the course of the week the process of cleanup
and recovery had involved the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the
American Environment Management Co., the Sacramento Fire Department, the Toxic
Substances Control Division and Hazardous Materials Laboratories of the
Department of Health Services, CAL-OSHA, Sacramento County, the State
Architect, the divisions of Buildings and Grounds, and Space Management from
the Department of General Services, and the California State Employees
Association.  If toxic tests had been positive, there would have been many more
organizations involved and many more very difficult decisions to be made before
recovery could have been completed.
 
CLOSING COMMENTS
 
PCB, dioxin, and furan were found in the switch equipment room and in the
electrical closets on the floor above.  But no trace of the toxic material was
found outside of the electrical closets.  Since the conduit passed through all
six floors, SMUD has been asked to decontaminate the electrical closets on each
floor.
 
The reason that the fire detection system activated will probably never be
known. It is assumed that the system was activated as a result of fluctuations
in the electrical power.

(From the Easy Reader, a weekly newspaper in the South Bay section of L.A.)

A Redondo Beach resident, Martin Lee Dement, spent almost two years in a Los
Angeles County jail because of a botched use of the state's computerized
fingerprint-matching system, ALPS (Automated Latent Print System).  Arrested
for robbing a Radio Shack, Dement was jailed, his girlfriend sold her condo to
raise money for defense lawyers, and the experience may have contributed to his
recidivism (he had been an habitual offender, and speculation is that the 21
months he spent incarcerated wiped out the progress he had been making since
his last release).

There was much thrashing by two consecutive public defenders and finally
attorney Charles Maple (who defended Onion Field killer Gregory Powell) to get
the D.A. or police departments involved to match prints lifted at the scene of
the robbery with those of another suspect, Dennis Passon, also arrested about
the same time, for a string of similar robberies (including a Radio Shack
store).  None of the law enforcement officials would make a direct comparison
between the lifted prints and those of Passon, even though they had him in
custody.  Instead, the lifted prints were sent through ALPS --- and no match
was produced.

Finally, two weeks into Dement's trial, the prints were produced and the judge
ordered a comparison to be made with those of Passon.  A match was immediately
obvious, and charges against Dement were dropped, after he had spent 21 months
in jail.  The D.A., Julie Sulman, blamed ALPS, which had just come online.
Investigators had just assumed that since Passon had an extensive criminal
record that his prints would be online, also.  Sulman said, "I think we made an
erroneous assumption that Passon wasn't the guy because he would have been in
ALPS ... and we were wrong."

Attorney Maple said recently that "ALPS is bull**** and it doesn't take care of
anything."

[From page R6 of the _Wall_Street_Journal_, Friday, 22 September 1989 comes yet
another story of the perils of computerized translation of natural languages.
The text below appeared in a sidebar to a story about the problems encountered
in trying to resolve differences between European countries preparing for the
1992 amalgamation into the EC...]

                            TOWERING BABBLE
      Automatic translation system proves that to err isn't just human

Interpretation and translation gobble up a huge hunk of EC's central budget, so
the Eurocrats have been trying to save money by using an automatic translation
system.  Systran is its name.  Bloopers are its game.

To the unconcealed delight of those whose jobs it first appeared to threaten,
Systran, acquired from the U.S. Navy about 10 years ago, still has a bit to
learn about French-English translation.  A few howlers:

* Commission President Jacques Delors asked in French whether he could address
  a certain committee.  Systran had him asking whether he could "expose 
  himself to the committee."

* Crown Prince Jean of Luxembourg, invited to offer a royal page of prose
  to the computer, used the words _nous_avions_, which in context only
  meant "we had."  Systran made it "us airplanes."

* In one screed about farming, the writer used the phrase _les agriculteurs_
  _vis_a_vis_de_la_politique_agricole_commune_, which means "farmers, in
  the light of common agricultural policy..."  Systran, suffering either
  a blown microprocessor or an uncanny flash of insight, rendered it as
  "farmers live to screw the common agricultural policy."

[The article goes on for another nine column inches discussing non-computer
related problems of translation, which are significant.  In the headquarters
of the Council of Ministers there are about 2000 bureaucrats, half of whom
are translators.]

A friend of mine regularly reads RISKS which I print out for him (He is not on
a network.)  He has asked me to pass on the following message which he typed in
on his pc and downloaded onto our system.

DISCLAIMER: I would like to point out that no members of this group have any
connection with the author or his story, except as a friend.

       - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Having read with interest the articles in RISKS 9.26 and 9.27 about
loose wires, I thought I would readers might like to share my own
story of a similar incidence.

Some years ago, I was exploring in Africa hoping to trace a long-lost relative;
when due to a peculiar set of events I found myself in a great deal of trouble.
I was part of a team of explorers: all of us searching for our own and the
other team-members relatives.

We each had a portable radio and could be contacted by another team-member who
was stationed at "base camp".  Anyone who discovered anything interesting was
supposed to radio the base camp, the news being relayed to the rest of the team
when they contacted base camp.

The radio I had was supposed to be what was then a very modern design
incorporating a primitive computer which was supposed to switch in the full
power when a signal was received, conserving energy while no information
transfer was occurring.  Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, when the
novelty of using the radio to call up for regular status reports had worn off,
one of the wires on the radio worked itself loose and as a result, while I was
capable of radioing base camp, they could not contact me as the power was not
sufficient to raise me without the computer working properly.

I did not call base camp for several days/weeks (I forget how long it was).
Imagine my surprise when I did get to call, however, and discovered the
following:

While I had continued my search, the other members of the team had returned to
camp, some successful, but in the main unsuccessful.  I was the only one left
searching and the team leader decided to call me back. Unfortunately, my radio
did not respond and so, fearing the worst, the remainder of the team set out to
find me.  By the time I next called the camp, the whole team was searching for
me, searching the many miles of land in which I could possibly be.

During their search, one of the team members (a chap called Maurice [I don't
remember the surname]) was bitten in his sleep by a sloth (he alone in the
team thought he was safer sleeping in a tree) and had to spend several weeks in
hospital on our return.

Although we laughed about the whole affair afterwards, it did make us realize
how dependent on the technology we were.  Since then I have been understandably
wary of computers (though I do now own a small wordprocessor) ... and have
taken a keen interest in discussion groups which talk about the potential
problems of computers.

How can we study "real software" for verification, among other purposes?
Can we read a listing in some programming language?  Can we read a memory
dump - if that is not a lost art?  Can we monitor execution under control
of an interpreting debugger?

I submit that these and other forms of "studying software" amount to the
study of an abstraction of what really counts; viz. the system.  
The software, without a processor to run it, is but an abstraction
of what the programmer wants the system to do; the hardware, without the
software to guide it, is but a potentially versatile idle tool.

The system runs in real time; i.e., as fast as the processor and its 
input/output allow.  When one slows that process down to the pace that 
a human can observe in detail, subtle timing problems behave differently.

That is not to say that interesting subsets of a system cannot be isolated
into time invariant forms, and then analyzed rather thoroughly.  And that is
very valuable; it has given us better compilers and math libraries, among
other things.  But systems that deal with things that directly affect human
life, like hospital monitors, and flight controllers, run in real time.
Yes, it is far better to build them insofar as possible with parts that are
verified; but the whole remains an abstraction, until we develop other tools
which may depend on our first developing other paradigms.

Since the reliability of the power system relates directly to the reliability
of many computer systems, the following info is probably of interest.

I spoke with a friend who used to be in charge of building large power projects
for Southern California Edison (SCE).  He said that, due to increasing
competition and decreasing ROI, over the past ten years or so SCE has planned
its power grid to "N-1" standards, whereas previously they planned to "N-2".
"N-1" means they can lose only one major transmission line without a major
system blackout.  He added that even "N-1" is marginal in some cases.

Of course, they DID learn a lot from the big (1964?) blackout in the Northeast,
where the system wasn't smart enough to partion itself in the face of
unexpected overloads, and so the whole system went black and huge generator
bearings melted down and were out of commission for months because the power
plants had no UPS's to pump lubricating oil.

Still, my experience is that most blackouts are small, localized ones due to
things like a car knocking down a transformer.  We seem to suffer three or four
per year here in El Segundo, CA.

In summary: keep buying those UPS's for your data center.

Subject: Subject: Computers, Planning, and Common Sense (Re: <A HREF="/Risks/9.28.html">RISKS-9.28</A>)

A Goods and Services Tax has been in operation in New Zealand for several
years now.  The scale was recently lifted from 10% to 12.5%.  Somehow this
is supposed to be compatible with the Labour(!?) commitment to free markets
and reduced government intervention.

As near as I can figure out, if Farmer A trades a pig to Farmer B for Farmer
B's cabbages, they both owe the government 10% (now 12.5%) of the monetary
value of the deal.

The bottom-line tax-payer just loses money, although personal income tax levels
were reduced, so it more or less evened out.  Everyone above that layer pays in
paperwork.  The theory is that each item should have GST paid on it once, so
that GST on inputs can be claimed back from GST on outputs.

&gt; I somehow doubt if the visionary stupidity necessary to develop such a
&gt; proposal to the point of law could have existed unaided by computers.

I don't know what's involved inside the Government, but charladies don't
need spreadsheets to carry out _their_ paperwork.

My objection to GST is that it hits the poor relatively harder than the rich,
but this is apparently compatible with NZ Labour's ideals.

In <A HREF="/Risks/9.25.html">RISKS-9.25</A>, Alan Rosenthal says:

&gt; The trade-offs during practice and emergencies are different, and should be.
&gt; It's sad that this means that you can't really simulate emergencies fully.
&gt; Nevertheless, it's *true* that this means that you can't really simulate
&gt; emergencies fully.

This is quite true.  The whole point that makes this idea unworkable
is that you are putting a multi-million dollar aircraft (and the lives
of its passengers, if passengers are being carried -- and I assume they
would be, as the original proposal mentioned ``routine flight'') at risk,
simply for training purposes.  This is not acceptable.

On the other hand, when they _are_ available, simulated emergencies can be a
very effective tool for pilot training.  I will certainly never forget the
first time I was subjected to one: climbing out from the airport on perhaps my
sixth or seventh flight as a beginning pilot, I reached the altitude at which I
had been taught to conduct after-takeoff checks.  These were quite simple:
speaking aloud, they went: ``Flaps up (pointing at flap indicator), fuel pump
off (turning it off), fuel pressure holding (pointing at fuel pressure gauge),
engine instruments green (pointing at each in turn).''  About ten seconds
later, my instructor said: ``Did you forget something?''  I knew I hadn't, but
I also knew the right thing to do: start the checks again from the beginning.
``Flaps up, fuel pump off (reaching down and pushing the switch off, where it
already was), fuel pressure...''  The fuel pressure gauge was reading zero.
``NO FUEL PRESSURE'', I shouted, practically breaking my hand turning the
auxiliary (electric) fuel pump back on.  I was all ready to push the nose down
when the engine failed, and for a fraction of a second I took my eyes off the
fuel pressure gauge, which wasn't coming up, to look at my instructor.  He was
gazing outside, cool as a cucumber.  I couldn't understand it.  After another
fifteen seconds or so I began to catch on.  The gauge still read zero, but
there was no way the engine was still running with no fuel pressure.  ``OK,
Eric, what did you do?''  He pointed to the circuit-breaker panel, where one of
them was sticking out.  I checked that it was the right one and reset it.  Then
he said to me: ``When you check an instrument, don't just glance at it.  Take a
good look, five seconds at least.  It's not just the instantaneous reading you
want to see: there may be a visible rate of change, and if so, you want to know
about it.''

It certainly drove the point home, and I always follow that practice.
But you can't do that to the pilot of a B747 en route.
                                                                John.

I would point to the vast abuses in the medical, legal, and teaching
professions as reasons why some form of accreditation *should not* be created.
The legal process has been codified to such a degree that the only way to
challenge the legal profession is to convince a lawyer to blacklist another
lawyer; the medical and teaching professions have both had vendettas with
professionals who were not politically correct, while allowing *many* abuses to
go unchecked.

We come down to a very simple problem if we wish to teach ethics at all:

  Whose ethics do we teach?

Meanwhile, of course, we are ignoring one very simple fact: Data Theft and
industrial espionage and security are all higly lucrative fields... and they
are becoming more so.  With many of the wealthiest companies in this country
resorting to highly illegal tactics on a regular basis, can we realistically
think that we will stem the tide by saying "nice programmers don't do that?"
Especially when these are *still* some of our most talented people!

  The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage,
  by Cliff Stoll, Doubleday, 1989, ISBN 0-385-24946-2              $19.95

Book Review by Louise Bernikow, Cosmopolitan, Oct. 1989

Here's a first -- the true story of a man who notices a seventy-five cent
discrepancy in a computer's accounting system and runs the error down until it
leads to a real live spy ring.  Even if you don't know a byte from a bagel,
this book will grip you on page one and hold you as ferociously as the best
mystery stories.

It is astrophysicist-turned-systems-manager Cliff Stoll's first week on the job
at a lab in Berkeley, California.  The error turns up, and he tries to figure
out why, partly as an exercise in learning about the computer system he's going
to be working with.  Almost immediately, he discovers that somebody had been
breaking into the computer network using a fake password.  That discovery leads
him to other break-ins in other computers, including some in military
installations.  He alerts the FBI, which, since he has lost neither half a
million dollars nor any classified information, says, "Go away, kid."

Stoll presses on, sleeping under his desk at night, monitoring the system -- a
hound waiting for the fox to come out in the open.  There is suspense aplenty,
but it's the intensely human, often funny voice of the man on the trail that
makes this book so wonderful.  Stoll's girlfriend, Martha, a law student, seems
like one smart and delightful cookie, and she puts up with his obsession pretty
well.  In the end, Stoll becomes a national hero.  The play-by-play is nothing
short of fascinating.

There is a cracker on the loose in the internet.  This is the information
I have so far.  Traces of the cracker were found at the Institute for 
Advanced Studies in Princeton.  He also left traces at one of the Super
computer centers.  Both CERT and the FBI have been called.

The technique that is being used is as follows:

1) He has a modified telnet that tries a list passwords on accounts.  Username
   forwards and backwards, username + pw, etc.

2) He seems to have a program call "ret", that is breaking into root.

3) He seems to be getting a list of victim machines via people's
   .rhosts files.

4) He copies password files to the machines that he is currently
   working from.

5) He is good about cleaning up after himself.  He zeros out log files
   and other traces of himself.

6) The breakins are occurring bwtween 10pm Sunday night and 8am Monday
   morning. 

7) He seems to bring along a text file of security holes to the
   machines he breaks into.

8) Backtracing the network connections seem to point to the Boston
   area as a base of operations.

The sys admin at IAS found a directory with the name "..  " (dot dot
space space).  The files I mentioned above were found in this
directory.

It's another late night of system administration.  Tonight the task is
time consuming, but relatively simple:  Repartition the disks on a
Sun4/280 running 4.0.3 to distribute the load to a new disk.  No big deal.

I partitioned the new disk and dump|restore'd most of the stuff from
the old disk onto it and rebooted off of the new disk.  I then
proceeded to repartition and newfs the old disk.  No problems so far.

I was about to dump|restore /usr from the new disk back to the old disk
(yes, / and /usr are on two different disks) so I mounted xy0g onto
/mnt.  At least, that's what I *intended* to do.  My fingers typed
"mount /dev/xy0a /usr" instead.  OOPS!  Well, no real harm done.  I'll
just pop over to /sbin and umount the device.  WRONG!  It seems that
/sbin has enough programs in it to get you into trouble, but not enough
to get you out of it.  No dump, no restore, no umount.  I couldn't even
sync;sync;halt the system.  Oh, mount is there.  I could mount more
newly newfs'd filesystems onto /usr until my face turned blue.  I can't
believe it.  It was as if I had just stumbled into a cul-de-sac.  The
only damage done was to me, not the machine.  Sigh.

Sun, if you're listening, please, please, please put statically linked
umount, dump, restore, sync and halt in /sbin.  Nine times out of ten,
those are the programs I want when I *need* /sbin.

Date processing; anyone interested in digging out some definitive works should
try the following:

Ohms B.G (1986) 'Computer processing of dates outside the twentieth century'                 IBM systems journal vol 25 no. 2

Uspensky J.V. and Heaslet M.A. (1939) 'Elementary Number Theory'. Mcgraw-Hill

Whitrow G.J. (1988) 'Time in History'     Oxford University Press, Oxford U.K.

Much of the relevant work in Whitrow (1988) is based on the works of
the French astronomer Jean-Baptiste Delambre (1749-1822).

Anybody who is interested, I have robust examples of routines for the
manipulation of dates, and examples of routines (written in REXX
but easily translated to FORTRAN if you so desire).
It has been suggested that if the year is divisible by 4000 then it
should NOT be considered a leap-year.  Anyone writing code thats likley
to be around 2000 years hence???

&gt; Take any of the thousands of closed circuit TVs in the
                  *******************************
&gt; hospital and set it to channel 6 and you get a picture of a clock.  
&gt; Somewhere there is a TV camera pointed at a good old sweep-secondhand
&gt; analog clock, and that's what you see on
&gt; channel 6.  Sometimes low-tech solutions are the best.

Thousands of TVs?  An expensive television camera doing nothing but sitting
there focused on a clock?  All those cables, monitors, all that power,
bandwidth to burn on the network, etc.?  

And you call this a **low tech** solution because the clock is analog?  Egad.
Perspectives have been rather skewed.

(Low tech would be a human being walking around with a chronometer re-setting
all those clocks by hand.)

     On the other hand, I am surprised that in a sport so close to being
     natural (apart from computer designed shells) a computer would be
     permitted on-board.  

A ``natural'' sport?  With exotic materials used in the fixtures and in some
oars, tanks designed as artificial rivers to row in during the winter,
nautilus machines for strength training, attention to nutrition, etc., etc....
Sports haven't been ``natural'' since the Greeks ran the Olympics in the buff.

     Technology knows no bounds!  PGN]

Indeed, much like imagination.

  [I think no sports are natural anymore.  The use of computers in baseball
  is startling.  Basketball may be fairly natural.  However, with all the 
  steroids, drugs, etc., however, one is never sure what is going on.  PGN]

&gt;From the 'Los Angeles Times' 2-Oct-89:

Hundreds of independent employees who worked for Wells Fargo Co. two years ago
were stunned to learn of a computer error that multiplied their earnings by 100
before passing on the information to the Internal Revenue Service.  The IRS,
eager to collect Uncle Sam's share, has written to the taxpayers, demanding an
explanation for the discrepancies between the Wells Fargo reports and the
recipients' 1987 tax returns.  "I was panicked.  They moved the decimal point
two places to the right," real estate appraiser Harold M. Samuelson told the
Salinas Californian.

This item, taken from "Computing Australia" 2nd October, should warm
the cockles of a few hearts...

``Hackwatch spokesman charged

  Self-styled computer security expert Paul Dummett, alias Stuart Gill,
  has been charged with making false reports to the Victoria Police
  following an investigation into claims he made in the daily media late
  in 1988 and early this year.  The articles often quoted Gill,
  introducing himself as a spokesman for either "Hackwatch" or the "DPG
  monitoring service".

  Gill claimed hackers in Australia had gained access codes from others
  in the US and lifted $US500,000 from the International Citibank, US.
  Other claims: credit card numbers had been posted on bulletin boards
  for BBS users' access; drugs, including steroids, were being sold
  using bulletin boards; evidence of this had benn given to the police
  by informers; and in response, the police had raided several hackers'
  homes.  The police, including the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the
  Fraud Squad's Computer Section, repeatedly denied the claims.

  Gill had disappeared, but returned again on September 22 and was
  charged in the Frankston Magistrates' Court under his real name, Paul
  Dummett.  According to court documents, police investigating Dummett's
  claims allegedly found Citibank's computer network had not been
  illegally accessed on its New York number as Dummett had claimed.
  When Dummett appeared in court his legal aid counsel Serge Sztrajt
  applied successfully to adjourn the case to October 20.  Dummett did
  not enter a plea.''

&gt;It has been suggested that if the year is divisible by 4000 then it
&gt;should NOT be considered a leap-year.  Anyone writing code thats likley
&gt;to be around 2000 years hence???

This is actually just a specific manifestation of the fact that calendar
reform requires altering timekeeping programs to match.  Leap millennia
are *not* officially part of the calendar, last I heard; anyone who writes
code on that basis has goofed.

I do recall some amusing ads for digital watches (back when they were new)
whose timekeeping was guaranteed accurate to the year 2099.  That is, the
designers didn't feel like allowing for leap centuries, and lucked out on the
year 2000 following the same rules as normal leap years.

In Risks Digest 9.30 Randall Davis decries the practice of transmitting
an image of a clock:

&gt; Thousands of TVs?  An expensive television camera doing nothing but
&gt; sitting there focused on a clock?  All those cables, monitors, all that
&gt; power, bandwidth to burn on the network, etc.?

What a waste of resources indeed!  That expensive equipment was meant for
Geraldo Rivera, "Roseanne," and reruns of "Family Ties"--not for frivolous
ends.

I can't wait till we have high-definition television....

A recent report "Macintosh S/W markets: productivity S/W review &amp; forecast,
1998-1993" (International Data Corp, 8/89) predicts that, in 1993, the U.S will
buy so many millions, nine hundred twenty-nine thusand, five hundred AND
FIFTEEN dollars' worth of Mac word-processing software. The leading digits have
been suppressed to protect the publisher's interests; but given that all nine
digits have been published, I wouldn't trust them that far anyway. This is a
reasonably expensive report (a few hundred $) which probably affects a good
many high-level management decisions.

I think this tomfoolery is relevant to comp.risks on two grounds: (1) it's a
textbook demo of common sense abdicating in the face of "the computer says so";
(2) I was told "that's Excel's default-mode for output" (and -- I think --
other spreadsheets' too).

I was also told "that's what they learn in business school!". I hope not.

On the day that New Jersey Transit inaugurated service to Atlantic City, there
was a grade crossing accident that provoked a discussion of crossing gate
technology on the newsgroup rec.railroad.  It is interesting to note how an
"old" industry operating in difficult conditions (equipment outside, subject to
all sorts of environmental problems, not to mention vandalism) solves a safety
problem.
                                        Chuck Weinstock

&gt;From: beyer@holin.ATT.COM (Jean-David Beyer)

I have some notes from General Railway Signal Company on railroad signalling.
There are separate sections on Wayside Signals, Crossing Gate Signalling,
Cab Signals, Frequency Shift Overlay Signalling, and so on.

The stuff is fool-proof, but not damn-fool proof. It cannot keep people
from going around crossing gates.

If the power source of signalling goes out, signals fail to stop.  If rails
break, signals fail to stop. If vandals short out the rails, signals go to
stop. If insulating joints fail to insulate, signals go to stop. If relays
springs break, signals go to stop. If relay coils open, signals go to stop. If
a lamp burns out, this is detected and the least restrictive aspect more
restrictive than desired is displayed.  Get the idea?

However, a suitably well-informed vandal could break the rail, having
previously put heavy electrical bonds around the gap, and wreck a train.

Or he could make his own code transmitters and couple them into the
rails (after disabling the real ones). But it is a lot of trouble to
do this without attracting the notice of the dispatcher.

Basically, when things go wrong, they fail safe. Even when someone around here
bumped an extruded aluminum crossing gate so that when it went up it hit the
12500 volt 1500 ampere catenary. It melted the gate and fried a couple of
relays in the control bungalow. The gates stayed down until that was fixed.  On
the other hand, if the gates stay down longer than an unreasonable driver
thinks is a reasonable time, he will go around the gate and get hit by a train.
Sometimes a train is coming the other way from one that is stopped in a
station, such as at Bridge and Monmouth streets in Red Bank. An eastbound train
was stopped in the station with the intersection apparently clear.  The driver
could not wait a few seconds (less than 60) for the train to pull out and
started around the gate. Only then did he see the westbound train and stop
clear of the other track. That is the kind of damn-fool proof the system is not.

Engineers must assume a signal improperly displayed is displaying the most
restrictive aspect that the signal is capable of (under most conditions).  Car
drivers should assume that if a gate is down, that they do not have time to get
around the gates. Sometimes they do, but it is a dumb thing to bet your life on.

&gt; From: lsheldon@cup.portal.com (Laurence Larry Sheldon)

On the SP Penninsula Line (and others--it seems like) there is a white light
that shines down the right-of-way in each direction--if it is a bells and
lights only crossing, the light blinks in concert with one of the red lights
(in many cases it is a lens in the side of the red lights case).

If there is a gate, the white light does not flash unless the gate is down.

There seems to be a rule that the train must stop (or maybe it's run dead-slow)
if the white light is not blinking.

This is based on observation, not knowledge of the facts.

&gt; From: lsheldon@cup.portal.com (Laurence Larry Sheldon)

On the SP again--if a train stops at a station (or in areas where switching
activity is high) the gates open up again if the train does not cross within
some time limit.  The engineer has to "whistle" the gate back down (there are
post-mounted microphones--actually loudspeakers-used-as- microphones) before
proceeding.  On some non-main line tracks there is a "STOP" sign at the
pavement (White on rectangylar red)--when the train gets to the stop sign, the
gates come down.

&gt; From: beyer@cbnewsh.ATT.COM (jean-david.beyer)

G.R.S. have some motion detector circuits available. I do not know if they use
doppler detectors, or rate of change of signal amplitude, or what.  But they
are used where there is a lot of switching activity near a grade crossing. If a
train starts toward a crossing at over 2 mph, the gates come down. If the train
stops, the gates go back up. If the train resumes, the gates come down again.
If the train reverses (goes away from the intersection), the gates stay up.
Costly enough that they are not used much around here. But there is little
switching on the NJ Coast Line.

I have been told that some such units estimate the speed of the train, and wait
a while before putting the gates down if the train is coming slowly. This seems
theoretically possible, but I have seen no written information about that.

&gt; From: beyer@holin.ATT.COM (Jean-David Beyer)

None of the Operating Rules I have read (but I have only about a 1974 Central
Railroad of New Jersey and a NORAC from early 1988) specifically discuss such
lights.  &lt;&lt;The blinking white light referred to previously...CBW&gt;&gt;

However, my G.R.S. notes say that if the white light does not flash (the one
you can see out the side of the red flashers for motorists), the signal
maintainer should be notified. (I.e., the signals are not working.)

There are rules dealing with flagging over grade crossings. I do not remember
them exactly, but they deal with situations where the flagman has defeated the
crossing protection (by putting a key in a lock switch) for local switching.
Then he must provide flag protection until the train physically blocks the
intersection (unless he can resume the crossing protection for some period of
time before the train movement is resumed).

&gt; From: rich@linus.UUCP (Richard L. Piazza)

I have noticed that the amount of time between the lowering of the gates and
the actual passage of the train is sometimes VERY long.  I never would go thru
the gates, but I am sometimes tempted -- especially when everybody else is
doing it.

I bet less people would try to go thru the gates if there was less of a time
lag.

Has anybody else noticed this?  Is there a standard for the amount of time that
the gate must be down before the train arrives?

&gt; From: beyer@holin.ATT.COM (Jean-David Beyer)

I think you are right: if gates went down only a short time before the arrival
of the train (or, more exactly, before the train occupied the crossing), and
then went up as soon as the train departed, less people would go around.

I do not know what the standard times are, but I am sure they exist.  I do know
that around here, they flash the lights and ring the bell for 6 seconds before
the gates come down. Unless the lights and gates are coupled to the municipal
traffic signals. Then they get a little more time, so the traffic signals get a
chance to go red across the tracks.  For ordinary crossing circuits, the gates
come down when the train hits the approach track. Since, around here, no
insulated joints are required for the gates (Frequency Shift Overlay circuits),
the approach can be any length decided upon by the railroad. But it must be
long enough so that the fastest train will get the gates down in time. Since
rules prohibit speeds in excess of 79 miles per hour where there are grade
crossings, you can calculate the amount of approach track needed if you know
how much advance warning you need (someone who got on the tracks as the gate
closed behind him needs time to get off before getting hit by the train).

But if a train is going significantly slower, the gates can be down quite a
while. My "calibrated eyeball" says the approaches to the Red Bank New Jersey
crossings are about 1/2 mile long.

What seems to annoy people around here is when the train is stopped in the
station. The gate is down because the train is about to leave. But it may be
there a while if people take a long time to get off and on.  THis makes people
want to go around the gates. By Murphy's law, there will be an unseen train
coming the other way that will hit them. Luckily, I have never seen an accident
like that, but I saw a close one recently.

Also, if it has not rained for a long time, lots of potentially conductive crap
builds up on the ballast. When the rain first starts, this can bring down the
gates until it washes off.

When you figure that the resistance between the rails can go as low as 1/4 ohm
from rain and dirt, and that the shunting resistance of the trains can go up as
high as 0.06 ohm, it does not leave the signal system with a lot to work with.

Movement detectors could put the gates up if a train stops or slows down
appreciably. But they cost much more.  At Long Branch, the gates are up even
when the train is on the approach to the crossing, since the trains stay there
to wait for the shuttle from Bay Head. To make the signal go from Restricting
to Approach-Limited, the conductor operates a key in a lock that puts the gates
down. This is a nuisance, but it must have been considered to be cheaper than
motion detectors.

There may well be a grandfather clause that permits old stuff to be used.
The railroads do not seem to have a lot of money to pay for capital
improvements whenever something new comes out.

``Missing zero blamed for aircrash

  Brazilian crash investigators have concluded that a data input error
  caused the Varig Boeing 737 disaster that killed 12 people last month.
  Pilot Cezar Augusto saved the lives of 54 passengers by ditching his
  aircraft in the Amazon jungle tree tops after running out of fuel.

  An investigating team from Rio de Janeiro believe Captain Augusto
  miskeyed his computer-controlled flightpath on take-off, omitting the
  first zero from his true course of "0270" when en route to Mexico.
  The computer navigation system directed the aircraft south instead of
  north without the crew realising until it was too late.

  The findings have been slammed by the Brazilian Airline Pilots'
  Association which says the true fault lay in the computer.  A spokesman
  for the association said it had evidence that a flight course computer
  print-out had detailed the wrong course.  The association is calling
  for a re-examination of Rio de Janeiro Airport's flightpath-mapping
  system to check on its safety.''

The Washington Post has run an extraordinary three-part series on the
development of the Stealth bomber and the subsequent political turmoil as the
project faces increasing public scrutiny and Congressional skepticism.  The
article was written by Rick Atkinson and appears in the 10/8,10/9, and 10/10
issues of the Post.

These two paragraphs are from today's article:

. . .

"Because of the unique, three dimensional computer design system, Northrop felt
confident enough to skip the usual step of building master tools for a bomber
prototype; instead, AV 1 [Air Vehicle 1, the first B-2 off the production line]
would be a full production plane built with the same 'hard tooling' used on the
rest of the fleet.  Boeing and Northrop tested internal aircraft systems, such
as fuel and hydraulics, on huge 'Iron Birds' that resembled full-sized bombers
with their skins peeled away.  Beginning in 1985, navigation and avionics
equipment was tested in the air of NKC-135 aircraft flying out of Edwards Air
Force Base in the Mojave Desert.

"Northrop believed that it could reduce the number of construction man-hours
from 3.5 million on the first bomber to 1 million on the 11th.  New aircraft
often are plagued with production gremlins; those hiding in AV 1 caused another
six months of delay.  A computer software miscalculation meant that electrical
wiring had to be done over because the first set of wires was cut too short,
according to a former Northrop executive; a pressurized line blew out an took
two weeks to fix because it lay in an inaccessible cranny of the plane." ...

The AP wire service provides financial page tables for many newspapers.
As part of the process, they filter out trades that are more than 3%
off of the current price.  That didn't work on Friday, when the market
plunged; they were forced to adjust their filters to accept 50% differences.
The data was manually filtered before the weekend editions to eliminate
trades that were ``clearly reported incorrectly''.

One of the shuttle Atlantis' engine computers was replaced (on Friday the 13th)
and the new one (230 pounds and $6M -- or about $25,000 per pound) installed
and checked out the next day.  The launch is now scheduled for 17 October, a
five-day delay.  (A Federal appeals court may consider the challenge to last
week's ruling that the launch can go on despite the risk of plutonium
contamination in the case of an accident, the subject of the earlier case.)

Indian computers and Japanese software are about to be used in the first
computerized voting in India.  The opposition party leaders launched a protest,
being concerned about how easily the party in power could manipulate the
elections.  They cited Ronnie Dugger's New Yorker article (7 Oct 1988) noted in
<A HREF="/Risks/7.70.html">RISKS-7.70</A> and 78, and displayed a list of some of the ways in which elections
could be rigged electronically.  [Source: NY Times, 15 Oct 1989, page 5.

Once again, the voices of Light and Reason have triumphed over those of the
Press.  It seems that speculation of large amounts of data loss due to the
Datacrime virus has been unfounded.
 
That being said, if you are not in the habit of backing up your computer's
hard disk periodically, this would be a good time to start!  Had Datacrime been
widespread, and you had lost your system's hard disk's contents, where would
you have recovered the information from?

Backups cannot *prevent* malicious software from destroying or corrupting data
stored on your computer's hard disk, but backups are *crucial* to recovering
the data lost to such an attack!  There is an undeniable risk in believing that
your computer is safe from malicious software simply because you practice safe
computing.  Our defenses are only as good as the problems we have seen.  If
tomorrow a vandal writes a new application to attack a computer system in a 
novel fashion, or a system that has not been subjected to many attacks, your
data is as vulnerable as if you used no or minimal protection.

I am not trying to be an alarmist here, but the best strategy to safeguarding
your data is a diversified one, and backups are a conerstone to any strategy.

And besides.  Halloween is just over two weeks away.

In RISKS 9.28 Earl Boebert suggested that a UK subscriber to RISKS might care
to investigate whether the Synchronome Co. of Wembley, Middlesex, still
existed.  I have - to the extent of confirming that no company with the name
and address he gave is now listed in the telephone directory.

I was motivated to investigate because of the problems we have with a
master/slave clock system that is installed in building in which my office is
located - though on checking I find that this identifies itself as having been
made by "Gents of Leicester". The Gents system is in fact an appalling example
of a good idea gone wrong. It was selected and installed by the University, I
would guess about 25 years ago, with the aim of assisting avoidance of
synchronisation errors in lecture start/stop times. Unfortunately, it now has
exactly the opposite effect!

The problem is that individual slave clocks occasionally fail to receive, or
react to, pulses from the master, and there is NO means of synchronising the
slave clocks from the master. So, over a period of months, the various slave
clocks gradually get further and further behind the master clock, and only get
re-synchronised when a technician is sent to correct each of them manually - a
job that in a building this size takes many hours if not days, and so is
performed only rarely, when many of the slave clocks are hopelessly slow.

The solution we have adopted in the Computing Laboratory has involved a
unilateral declaration of independence from the central maintenance services.
This is the replacement of those slave clocks which matter to us by ordinary
quartz crystal-controlled wall clocks. These are quite cheap, far more
dependable individually, and subject only to common mode failures which are
likely to cause situations in which the clocks' accuracy is irrelevant, e.g.
collapse of the whole building.

Tuesday's Loma Prieta earthquake continues to have a devastating aftermath,
particularly in parts of Santa Cruz, Hollister, San Francisco and Oakland.
However, there have been some encouraging success stories of organizations with
computer/communication contingency plans that worked successfully following
Tuesday's earthquake (17 Oct 89).  Furthermore, it appears that the area was
spared much greater devastation because of anticipatory construction
improvements.

The San Francisco Chronicle kept publishing despite a complete power outage at
the newspaper's headquarters, which ground their computer and main printing
facility to a halt.  Material for the Wednesday and Thursday editions was
assembled using Macintosh disks and an emergency generator.

There was building damage at SRI.  Most of the SRI Computer Science Lab
computer facility survived.  However, the RISKS file server was down until
Thursday; when it was resurrected, the disk on which RISKS operates was
discovered to be messed up as well, so I could not put an issue out until now.

For the second time in a week air traffic at Dallas-Forth Worth International
Airport was disrupted.  The Thursday 19 October computer outage (1950s-vintage
computer system) lasted at least twelve hours, and caused delays.  [Source:
Washington Post, 21 Oct 89, p22]

FAA officials said Thursday's breakdown happened when one of four data proces-
sors on the computer failed to start after routine maintenance.  The processors
feed specific information about each plane from the radar to the controllers'
screens.  Flights continued at a reduced rate during the outage.  

The previous week's outage, on 14 Oct 89, lasted for 19 minutes.  It was traced
to a technician who mistakenly tried to program a radar computer from the wrong
terminal.  

Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Association of Air Traffic Control-
lers, said the FAA is trying to upgrade computer systems across the country.
But the process is painstakingly slow, he said.  "I think if you go to any
terminal across the country you'll find some older equipment mixed in with some
new equipment," Dresden said.  "So this is not just confined to terminals at
the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, but to terminals across the country."

Norm Scroggins, tower manager at D-FW airport says the FAA is looking into the
problem.  "We're in an interim mode," Scroggins said.  "I don't think it's
particularly useful that any government agency is unable to stay up with the
technological industry.  It's just hard to get the stuff in.  "And you have to
keep in mind that this same equipment is working quite well in Houston.  They
just don't have the demands that we (D/FW) have."

[This is interesting as an experiment in using AI - or more specifically neural
networks - in a safety-related application, though not in any safety-critical
fashion.]

        BR USES `COMPUTER VISION' TO MONITOR LEVEL CROSSINGS
The Independent, 17 Oct 1989, by Mary Fagan, Technology Correspondent

British Rail will use computers to monitor level crossings to see if cars
should be allowed to cross them, in an attempt to assess how artificial
intelligence and `computer vision' can be used more widely on the rail network.
As part of a major experiment to be announced today, computers emulating the
human brain will monitor the level crossings, deciding when it is safe to lower
and raise gates, and when cars and pedestrians should be allowed to pass
through.

Dr Alan Cribbens, head of safety systems at BR, said such systems would be used
only to help and augment human control.  But he hopes computer vision and
artificial intelligence may also be used for examining the condition of rail
tracks and tunnels, and for inspecting the conditions of the brakes on rolling
stock.  `Computers would never be allowed to take decisions alone in the
primary safety loop, at least not in the short term.'

Level crossings are currently monitored by closed-circuit television and
controlled by an operator.  There is a limit as to how many crossings one
person can cope with, and the computer monitoring could dramatically increase
the efficiency.

The experiment also acts as a tough test for computer vision, because it has to
cope with variable lighting and weather, and to decide whether a scrap of paper
or rubbish on the track constitutes a serious obstruction.  The computer is a
`neural network' - a machine which attempts to emulate the way the brain works.
The network is made up of layers of tranputers, each of which is a computer in
its own right, and which represent a computer neuron or brain cell.

According to Colin Hebden of SD, the company supplying the system, the neural
network can be trained to recognise patterns and interpret images - things
which traditional number-crunching machines are not good at.  The transputer is
also ideal because it communicates well with other transputers in the ntework.

The BR experiment is said to be pushing forward the frontiers of neural network
computers.  `If it has potential we will have it in use as soon as possible,'
Dr Cribbens said.

Last night I went into a hardware store (Builder's Emporium in Redwood City,
CA) and walked past a kiosk providing advice from "Pop Larsen", probably a
fictional character.  In additional to little brochures ("How to unclog
drains") the kiosk contains a touch-screen system that apparently allows the
user to navigate through some menus to get home-repair information.

What caught my eye was that, superimposed on the flashy 3d-ish color
"buttons" on the screen, was a black &amp; white message in a crude font:

	Overflow in line 0 of module 1W4200YC at

	Hit any key to return to system

Of course, hitting "any key" was difficult, given that there were none.

             BANK ERROR HANDS OUT #2BN IN HALF AN HOUR
    Computer Weekly, Thursday 19 October 1989, p.1, by Tony Collins, 

A UK bank has accidentally transferred #2bn to UK and US companies because a
software design flaw allowed payment instructions to be duplicated.  The
organisation has asked customers to return the money, which is more than the
annual profits of any clearing bank, but so far not all of the cash has been
recovered.  The error, described by the Computing Services Association (CSA) as
probably the most serious to have hit the IT industry, led to the #2bn being
paid out to customers over 30 minutes.

Within an hour the bank discovered its mistake, but by then the cash had been
transferred to other banks and into accounts of corporate customers in the UK
and US. The funds were sent on the high-speed Clearing House Automated Payment
System (Chaps) which allows high value payments, typically #2m, to be
transferred in seconds from one bank to another via a computer system linked
through British Telecom's Packet Switched Service.

Although Chaps refuses to name the bank it confirms that the accidental
transferral of #2bn occurred "in the past few weeks" and involved one of its 14
memeber banks. The membership includes all major clearing banks together with
the Bank of England, Girobank and the TSB.  Jim Reeves, Chaps technical
manager, says funds transferred on the network are guaranteed payments and are
technically irretrievable. "If a bank decides it has made a mistake, it is
still bound to settle the funds at the end of the day."  He adds that, as far
as he knows, most of the #2bn has been recovered as a result of the goodwill of
the close-knit banking community and its corporate customers.  "One bank
managed to send a number of payments it had sent the day before," says Reeves.
"It only noticed this because of a very high outflow of money early in the day.
It was a question of getting in touch with customers and asking them if they
minded payment going back."

Richard Allen, chief executive of the Association for Payment Clearing Services
(Apacs), which controls Chaps, says security and reliability have become
increasingly important in payment mechanisms, especially as more institutions
began using such systems.  "This is particularly so in high value mechanisms
such as Chaps," he says.  Reeves says the #2bn involved mostly foreign exchange
and money market transactions.

The error was due to a software flaw which allowed the system to choose a date
for payments rather than insisting that the operator made the selection.

In the event the system chose the wrong date.

The software has since been redesigned to avoid a repetition of the incident.

Following the wild drop on the NY Stock Exchange on Monday, Quotron reported at
10:30 AM on Tuesday, 17 October 1989, that the Dow Jones industrial average was
DOWN 71 points.  An unwitting NYSE VP announced this figure live on CNN, which
caused quite a stir.  However, almost all of the stocks (except the American
and United Airlines companies) were UP, and the average should actually have
been UP about 20 points.  

Quotron gets live feeds from the market mainframes, and calculates the averages
every 15 seconds.  However, the heavy volume on the NYSE "overloaded" Quotron's
software.  The problem apparently corrected itself half an hour later.

"Nonetheless, the incident underscored how modern telecommunications have come
to tie investors and markets together around the globe and the threats to
market stability when the systems malfunction."  (John Burgess, Washington
Post, 17 October 1989)

Excerpts from:
	Traders Who Can't Believe Their Eyes Win Vindication
	Heavy Stock Volume Makes Some of Quotron's Data Veer
	Away From Reality
		by Georgette Jasen,
		Staff reporter of The Wall Street Journal
	The Wall Street Journal, October 17, 1989, page c23

	Traders ... were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial
	Average plummet 99 points in seconds.  A minute later
	it soared 128 points, then zoomed back down 113 points,
	69 below Friday's close.
	...
	Quotron Systems Inc., a Citicorp unit, blamed the 30-minute
	foul-up on "a timing problem in our software" caused by
	the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the
	first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading.  The prices
	of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct,
	Quotron said, but the average was wrong. ...
	It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has
	had problems calculating the industrial average. ...
[The earlier problem was attributed in a previous article to human error.]
	A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have
	contributed to yesterday's problems.  She said Quotron
	switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected.

In Risks 9.32, Olivier Crepin-Leblond &lt;zdee699@elm.cc.kcl.ac.uk&gt; asks if the 13
October 1989 drop in the average price of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange
could have been triggered by electronic vandalism of some form (he specifically
asks about a virus).

The possibility does exist, but (1) in this instance I do not believe that was
the case and (2) if it were the case, we would know about it by now I should
think.

Friday's plunge (as I understand it) was caused by preprogrammed selling of
stock by computer.  The rules and conditions under which these programs
operate are well understood.  If those programs had made transactions "outside
of their envelope", the institutions that set the rules for the programs would
be screaming bloody murder, and we would see the SEC all over the evening news.

Expanding this a bit, I find it less than likely (although I doubt it is
impossible) for electronic vandalism (viruses, logic bombs, or time bombs) to
effect these applications unnoticed.  [I might add that when I say "less than
likely", the basis of my comparison is the computing community in general,
which is far more open than the NYSE's computers.]  Again, preprogrammed
trading occurs only under known conditions.  It should be possible to put in
some minimal amount of safeguards to prevent these automated trades to occur
outside of their defined envelopes.  This is not to say NYSE has done so
though.

Today's ComputerWorld contained a number of articles on the impact of the 1989
San Francisco earthquake on computers.  I thought the following note about the
impact of computers on the earthquake was interesting.

"It is a measure of the dependence of a bank's customers that even after
crossing a foot-wide crack in the sidewalk in the city's Mission District, one
customer complained bitterly that the teller machine would not work.  When
reminded that the system's cables had to span the quake-torn area, the customer
replied, "You'd think they'd know how to do something about this."

And, of course, they do.  The answer is to have many ATMs.  A nearby article
reports that eighty percent of the cities ATMs were up and running.

While driving to work the Monday after the 190-point Friday-the-13th drop in
the Dow Jones index, I heard on WBUR (public radio morning news in Boston) an
interview with one of the managers of the Boston Stock Exchange, said in the
program to be one of the fastest-growing in the United States.

He remarked that the Boston Exchange had no difficulty keeping up with the
volume of trading nationwide, because their computer system could be turned off
gracefully so that trades could be done manually -- apparently the only way to
keep up with high volumes.  (Remember all those stories of computers unable to
keep up with the volume of trading?)  He remarked further that the Boston
exchange was able to keep up with the business on the day of the 500-point drop
because the computer system wasn't yet installed.

Sounds very sensible to me, and though I'm tempted to editorial comment, I'll
refrain.

THE NEW YORK TIMES (National edition) for Monday, October 23, has a front-page
story headlined "Kasparov Beats Chess Computer (for Now)." The story (written
by Harold C. Schonberg) reports that Gary Kasparov, the highest-ranked player
in the history of chess, beat a computer named "Deep Thought" in the first game
of a two game match. Commenting on the prospect of a more powerful machine
being developed in five years that could scan a billion chess poisitions a
second, Mr. Kasparov was reported to have said: "That means I can be champion
for five more years....But I can't visualize living with the knowledge that a
computer is stronger than the human mind. I had to challenge Deep Thought for
this match to protect the human race."

In many respects, a computer already is "stronger" than the human mind. Perhaps
what Mr. Kasparov fears is that a computer might become more "creative" or
"original" than the human mind...that it might become something more than an
"extension" or "tool" of the human mind. Clearly, a lot of terms will have to
be defined before that fear can be addressed...terms like "stronger,"
"creative," "original," "tool," "extension," and, perhaps most in need of
definition, "human" and "mind."

			  CERT Advisory Update
			    October 18, 1989
			DEC/Ultrix 3.0 Systems

This is a repost of the Ultrix 3.0 advisory.  We have received the sum
output for DECstations.
=============================================================================

Recently, the CERT/CC has been working with several Unix sites that have
experienced breakins.  Running tftpd, accounts with guessable passwords
or no passwords, and known security holes not being patched have been the
bulk of the problems.

The intruder, once in, gains root access and replaces key programs
with ones that create log files which contain accounts and passwords in
clear text.  The intruder then returns and collects the file.  By using
accounts which are trusted on other systems the intruder then installs
replacement programs which start logging.

There have been many postings about the problem from several other net
users.  In addition to looking for setuid root programs in users' home
directories, hidden directories '..  ' (dot dot space space), and a modified
telnet program, we have received two reports from Ultrix 3.0 sites that
the intruders are replacing the /usr/bin/login program.  The Ultrix security
hole being used in these attacks is only found in Ultrix 3.0.

Suggested steps:
	1) Check for a bogus /usr/bin/login.  The sum program should report
	   the following for the DEC supplied login program.
		27379    67	for VAXstation Ultrix 3.0
        	35559   116     for DECstation Ultrix 3.0

	2) Check for a bogus /usr/etc/telnetd.  The sum program should report
	   the following for the DEC supplied telnetd program.
		23552    47	for VAXstation Ultrix 3.0
        	45355    84     for DECstation Ultrix 3.0

	3) Look for .savacct in either /usr/etc or in users' directories.
	   This may be the file that the new login program creates.  It
	   could have a different name on your system.

	4) Upgrade to Ultrix 3.1 ASAP.

	5) Monitor accounts for users having passwords that can be found in
	   the /usr/dict/words file or have simple passwords like a persons
	   name or their account name.

	6) Search through the file system for programs that are setuid root.

	7) Disable or modify the tftpd program so that anonymous access to
	   the file system is prevented.

If you find that a system that has been broken into,  changing the password
on the compromised account is not sufficient.  The intruders do remove copies
of the /etc/passwd file in order to break the remaining passwords.  It is best
to change all of the passwords at one time.  This will prevent the intruders
from using another account.

Please alert CERT if you do find a problem.

			    CERT Advisory
			  October 17, 1989
                     "WANK" Worm On SPAN Network
 
On 16 October, the CERT received word from SPAN network control that a
worm was attacking SPAN VAX/VMS  systems.  This worm affects only DEC
VMS systems and is  propagated via DECnet protocols,  not TCP/IP protocols.
If a VMS system had other network connections, the worm was not programmed
to take advantage of those connections.  The worm is very similar to last
year's  HI.COM  (or Father Christmas) worm.
 
This is NOT A PRANK.  Serious security holes are left open by this worm.
The worm takes advantage of poor password management, modifies .com files,
and spreads to other systems via DECnet.

It is also important to understand that someone in the future could launch
this worm on any DECnet based network.  Many copies of the virus have been
mailed around.  Anyone running a DECnet network should be warned.

R. Kevin Oberman from Lawrence Livermore National Labs reports:
     "This is a mean bug to kill and could have done a lot of damage.
     Since it notifies (by mail) someone of each successful penetration
     and leaves a trapdoor (the FIELD account), just killing the bug is
     not adequate.  You must go in an make sure all accounts have
     passwords and that the passwords are not the same as the account
     name."

The CERT/CC also suggests checking every .com file on the system.  The
worm appends code to .com files which will reopen a security hole everytime
the program is executed.
 
An analysis of the worm appears below and is provided by R. Kevin Oberman of 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Included with the analysis is a 
DCL program that will block the current version of the worm.  At least 
two versions of this worm exist and more may be created.  This program 
should give you enough time to close up obvious security holes.

If you have any technical questions or have an infected system, please
call the CERT/CC:

                          Report on the W.COM worm.
                               R. Kevin Oberman
                            Engineering Department
                    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
                               October 16, 1989

The following describes the action of the W.COM worm (currently based on the
examination of the first two incarnations). The replication technique causes
the code to be modified slightly which indicates the source of the attack and
learned information.

All analysis was done with more haste than I care for, but I believe I have all
of the basic facts correct.

First a description of the program:

1. The program assures that it is working in a directory to which the owner
(itself) has full access (Read, Write,Execute, and Delete).

2. The program checks to see if another copy is still running. It looks for a
process with the first 5 characters of "NETW_". If such is found, it deletes
itself (the file) and stops its process.

                                     NOTE
A quick check for infection is to look for a process name starting with
"NETW_". This may be done with a SHOW PROCESS command.

3. The program then changes the default DECNET account password to a random
string of at least 12 characters.

4. Information on the password used to access the system is mailed to the user
GEMPAK on SPAN node 6.59. Some versions may have a different address.

5. The process changes its name to "NETW_" followed by a random number.

6. It then checks to see if it has SYSNAM priv. If so, it defines the system
announcement message to be the banner in the program:
      W O R M S    A G A I N S T    N U C L E A R    K I L L E R S
    _______________________________________________________________
    \__  ____________  _____    ________    ____  ____   __  _____/
     \ \ \    /\    / /    / /\ \       | \ \  | |    | | / /    /
      \ \ \  /  \  / /    / /__\ \      | |\ \ | |    | |/ /    /
       \ \ \/ /\ \/ /    / ______ \     | | \ \| |    | |\ \   /
        \_\  /__\  /____/ /______\ \____| |__\ | |____| |_\ \_/
         \___________________________________________________/
          \                                                 /
           \    Your System Has Been Officically WANKed    /
            \_____________________________________________/

     You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.

7. If it has SYSPRV, it disables mail to the SYSTEM account.

8. If it has SYSPRV, it modifies the system login command procedure to 
APPEAR to delete all of a user's file. (It really does nothing.)

9. The program then scans the accounts logical name table for command
procedures and tries to modify the FIELD account to a known password
with login form any source and all privs. This is a primitive virus,
but very effective IF it should get into a privileged account.

10. It proceeds to attempt to access other systems by picking node numbers at
random. It then used PHONE to get a list of active users on the remote system.
It proceeds to irritate them by using PHONE to ring them.

11. The program then tries to access the RIGHTSLIST file and attempts
to access some remote system using the users found and a list of
"standard" users included with the worm. It looks for passwords
which are the same as that of the account or are blank. It records all
such accounts.

12. It looks for an account that has access to SYSUAF.DAT.

13. If a priv. account is found, the program is copied to that account and
started. If no priv account was found, it is copied to other accounts found on
the random system.

14. As soon as it finishes with a system, it picks another random system and
repeats (forever).

Response:

1. The following program will block the worm. Extract the following code
and execute it. It will use minimal resources. It create a process named
NETW_BLOCK which will prevent the worm from running.
-------
Editors note:  This fix will work only with this version of the worm.  
Mutated worms will require modification of this code; however, this 
program should prevent the worm from running long enough to secure 
your system from the worms attacks.

You must then edit the file SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM, and add the line

        CLEAR OBJECT TASK ALL

AFTER the line which says

        SET KNOWN OBJECTS ALL

This has the side-effect of disabling users from executing any command
procedure via DECnet that the system manager has not defined in the
DECnet permanent database.
---------
2. Enable security auditing. The following command turns on the MINIMUM
alarms. The log is very useful in detecting the effects of the virus left by
the worm. It will catch the viruses modification of the UAF.
$ Set Audit/Alarm/Enable=(ACL,Authorization,Breakin=All,Logfailure=All)

3. Check for any account with NETWORK access available for blank passwords or
passwords that are the same as the username. Change them!

4. If you are running VMS V5.x, get a copy of SYS$UPDATE:NETCONFIG_UPDATE.COM
from any V5.2 system and run it. If you are running V4.x, change the username
and password for the network object "FAL".

5. If you have been infected, it will be VERY obvious. Start checking the
system for modifications to the FIELD account. Also, start scanning the system
for the virus. Any file modified will contain the following line:
$ oldsyso=f$trnlnm("SYS$OUTPUT")
It may be in LOTS of command procedures. Until all copies of the virus are
eliminated, the FIELD account may be changed again.

6. Once you are sure all of the holes are plugged, you might kill off
NETW_BLOCK. (And then again, maybe not.)

          Offensive Message Flashes at Busy City Corner
                        By Linda Wheeler
                Washington Post, October 25, 1989

An offensive message that mystified the owners of an electronic information
board was flashed Monday at Connecticut Avenue and L Street NW, one of the
city's busiest intersections.
     A Georgetown University law student, Craig Dean, said he saw the message
"HELP STAMP OUT A.I.D.S. NOW: KILL ALL QUEERS AND JUNKIES" flash five times in
25 minutes.  Minutes after seeing the message, he called the city Human Rights
Office and the Washington Blade, a gay community newspaper.
     Doug Hinckle, a staff photographer for the Blade, saw the message flash
once and photographed it.   ...
     Judith Miller, president of Miller Companies, which own the building at
1101 Connecticut Ave. NW and the message board, said she did not know how the
statement got onto the board.  She refused to believe it had appeared until
told of the photographs.
     Her company has complete control of the board and does not accept any paid
messages or advertisements, Miller said.  "I would never do anything like
that," she said.  "There is no way I would allow such a statement to appear."...
     Yesterday, Keller, a five-year employee of the Miller Companies, said he
did not write the statement and does now know how it became part of the normal
flow of headline news.
     Miller said she believes her computer system may have a "virus" and will
have experts search to find where the unauthorized statement originated.  "How
absolutely awful," she said of the message.      ...

  [Also noted by John Crider,  crider@itd.nrl.navy.mil, who added:

    Possibly another case of how media-induced heightened awareness, this time
    about viruses, can lead to the emergence of a new scapegoat; years ago the
    operator would have been fired on the spot, but now it's a viral infection.
    Both are knee-jerk reactions - conclusions should come AFTER the facts are
    examined.    -John Crider]

Condensed from a story by Jennifer Warren in the 'Los Angeles Times' 18-Oct-89:

A 14-year-old Fresno, CA boy obtained secret "access codes" to the files of TRW
Credit from a bboard and used them to pose as a company or employer seeking a
credit history on an individual whose name he picked randomly from the phone
book.  From the histories, he obtained credit card numbers which he then used
to charge at least $11,000 in mail-order merchandise (shipped to a rented
storeroom) and make false applications for additional cards.  He also shared
his findings on bboards.

Police began investigating when TRW noticed an unusual number of credit check
requests coming from a single source, later found to be the youth's home
telephone number.  The high school freshman, whose name was not released, was
arrested at his home last week and later released to his parents.  His computer
was confiscated and he faces felony charges that amount to theft through the
fraudulent use of a computer.

"Here's a 14-year-old boy with a $200 computer in his bedroom ... and now he
has shared his data with countless other hackers all over the nation," said
Fresno Detective Frank Clark, who investigated the case.  "The potential [for
abuse of the information] is incredible."

Computer Sex Game In Ambulance System (Associated Press)
The Washington Post, Tuesday, October 25, 1987

  NEW YORK, Oct. 23 -- A sex-oriented game is in the computer that monitors
city ambulances, but an official dismissed speculation that the game could
distract dispatchers or lead to computer problems.

  John Petrofsky, a computer consultant for the Emergency Medical Services,
said in the New York Post that "Foreplay" has been in the EMS system since
September 1988.  The program could slow the computer or stop it for 30 minutes,
Petrofsky said. It also might carry a "virus" that could shut down the computer
for two days, he said.

  EMS spokeswoman Lynn Schulman said the inspector general of the Health and
Hospitals Corp. had confirmed that the game was in the system, but she said it
had no effect on response time, which has been reduced in recent months.

Readers of RISKS might be interested in a rather strange article in the October
'89 issue of DEFENSE ELECTRONICS, p. 75, entitled "Computer Virus
Countermeasures -- A New Type Of EW" [EW = Electronic Warfare], by Dr. Myron L.
Cramer and Stephen R. Pratt (both of Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc.).

The reason I consider this "strange" is because the whole thrust of the article
is how computer-based ECM [Electronic CounterMeasures] and EW systems could be
infected by viruses which are transmitted over the air and enter those systems
or their components via the normal sensing channels -- that is, they would pick
up a digital stream the same way they would pick up an enemy radar signal, and
that digital stream would contain code which would somehow find its way into
the executable code for the system's processor(s). That whole concept seems
very odd to me.  Maybe I just don't know enough about the field to really
understand this, but I cannot see how input data, which the system designers
already know could be any electromagnetic signals or noise impinging on the
system's sensors or antennae, could get intermixed with or interfere with the
operating executable code of the sensor device or a central processor that is
collecting and analyzing such data.

It is certainly obvious that an enemy agent working in or having access to the
source of the software controlling such a computer-based EW system could
implant a trojan horse or backdoor access into that software before it is
fielded. Perhaps then the enemy could transmit a special sort of signal that
woud trigger the execution of such code in fielded systems, which would then
self-destruct or provide erroneous results or otherwise misbehave. But I find
it hard to envisage how some signals from outside, within the operational
environment of such an EW system, could do anything to the executing code
within embedded microprocessors or larger support computers. [Except of course
something like EMP or an electromagnetic-signal barrage that would just
scramble the memories or damage the components of inadequately-shielded
devices.  But that would just render them inoperative, and would be the EW
equivalent of blowing some holes in them. :-) It wouldn't surreptitiously
install new code...]

The article does mention the idea of letting the enemy steal EW equipment or
designs which have embedded in them trapdoor or other methods for allowing
their functions to be subverted or controlled after they have been installed in
enemy operational systems. I think this idea was used by Tom Clancy in
_Cardinal of the Kremlin_ or another of his books. Other methods mentioned
include contaminating maintenance or diagnostic software with a virus. Those
all seem fairly straightforward paths into executable software, but I still
have problems trying to understand how sensed data could interfere with or
modify executable code. Getting some virus program in the input data to go
inside the operating code seems to me to be practically impossible, unless
there is some sort of doorway or hole in that code that had previously been
illicitly hidden there. It's sort of like the "blood-brain barrier" that makes
it hard to deliver drugs into certain parts of the nervous system.

Is there something basic here I'm just not understanding, or is this article's
basic premise flawed?

Regards, Will Martin

    [Trapdoors abound.  The sendmail debug option and the gets missing bounds
    check are recent reminders of the nature of the problem.  Out-of-band
    signals also may trigger trapdoor effects.  Furthermore, whether these 
    effects result from an accidental flaw in the system or a preplanned Trojan
    horse program that would wait for the attack to be triggered, the results
    could be serious in either case.  PGN]

Synopsis: Two systems - same day, same symptoms. Hackers? No, hardware!

Dateline, Monday 20th September 1989, Bentley, Western Australia.
Curtin University of Technology.

The VAX-11/750 computer in the Geophysics Laboratory refused to allow any user
to log in. All passwords, including SYSTEM were declared invalid. The system
manager contacted me and I showed him how to break in. There appeared to be some
disk damage, but after setting all passwords to known values, the system was
apparently usable. Shortly thereafter all was not well. Indeed, after any two
users were logged in the system refused further logins, complaining that the
licensed number of system users had been exceeded. Given that this particular
machine (running VMS 4.7) has never been a microVAX, the only class of system
which imposed such a limit, I naturally suspected foul play. At this stage I was
sure that the system had been hacked, and was recommending a total
re-installation of all the software, starting from known, reliable distribution
tapes.

Then I read on the net that Columbia University Plasma Physics Laboratory has
the very same set of symptoms and on the same date:-

&gt;From: IVERS%CMR.MFENET@CCC.NMFECC.GOV
&gt;Subject:Virus or coincidence?
&gt;Date: 20 Sep 89 03:41:04 GMT
&gt;Message-ID:&lt;890919204104.47800129@CCC.NMFECC.GOV&gt;
&gt;
&gt;On Monday morning, our users (including the system manager) were surprised to
&gt;find that they could no longer log in to our VAX 11/750 (VMS V4.5).
&gt;Coincidentally, one user reported the appearance of several files in
&gt;his directory with names like WARNING., VIRUS., and ATTACK..  He thought
&gt;it was a joke and said nothing at the time the files appeared.
&gt;
&gt;The system was booted with UAFALTERNATE =1.  It appeared that SYSUAF.DAT 
&gt;was intact, but the passwords were no longer valid.  A SYSUAF.DAT file
&gt;was restored from a backup set and new passwords were issued.  The problem
&gt;is that now when more than 2 users attempt to use the system, a message
&gt;of the type LICENSED NUMBER OF SYSTEM USERS EXCEEDED appears.  
&gt;
&gt;As for the "virus" files - all that remains are subdirectories of names
&gt;similar to the files reportedly seen by the user (one of them is called
&gt;[.DEADLY-VIRUS]). 
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas as to the cause or cure of the LICENCED NUMBER OF... problem,
&gt;or insight into the nature of the "virus" would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;                                        Thanks in advance,
&gt;                                        Tom Ivers (system manager)
&gt;                                        Columbia U. Plasma Physics Lab

My confidence in the hacking hypothesis rose by leaps and bounds. Then the
advice starts to roll in:-

&gt;From: coburn@clovax.enet.dec.com (John T. Coburn)

&gt;Date: 20 Sep 89 23:25:20 GMT
&gt;Message-ID:&lt;836@mountn.dec.com&gt;
&gt;The LOGINOUT.EXE image in SYS$SYSTEM would seem to be damaged, probably by the
&gt;virus attack that occurred. This may not be the only image damaged or changed.
&gt;You should restore the disk from a good backup tape. This is the only way you
&gt;can be sure of removing all artifacts of a virus attack.
&gt;A short term fix for the LICENSED NUMBER OF... problem is to get a good copy of
&gt;LOGINOUT.EXE off a backup tape (or your distribution tape VMS V4.4 - be sure to
&gt;check the V4.5 upgrade to see if it changed LOGINOUT.EXE).

&gt;From: dragon@NSCVAX.PRINCETON.EDU (Richard B. Gilbert)
&gt;Subject:Re:Virus or coincidence?
&gt;Date: 21 Sep 89 00:57:49 GMT
&gt;Message-ID:&lt;8909210036.AA10261@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU&gt;
&gt;    I think you've been well and truly screwed.  The safest thing to do
&gt;is to scrub your disk and restore from a backup that you are certain is
&gt;clean.
&gt;
&gt;    I have this horrible feeling that SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE has been
&gt;patched or replaced.  Only extensive checking would reveal what else has
&gt;been tampered with.  You had better assume that any sensitive information
&gt;on your system has been compromised and that _anything_ may have been
&gt;tampered with!
&gt;
&gt;    Even after you restore your system, you will still be vulnerable to
&gt;a repetion of the same attack!  You will need to read and heed the "Guide
&gt;to VMS Security".  You should probably have security alarm ACLs on
&gt;SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM or SYSTARTUP_V5.COM,
&gt;SY$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM and perhaps a couple of other things.  This will
&gt;not prevent a breakin but it will make it tougher to do it tracelessly.
&gt;Check your modem lines if any.  Are they all set /MODEM /HANGUP /DIALUP?
&gt;If not, they provide a potential entry point for a cracker.
&gt;
&gt;    Priveleged accounts such as FIELD, and SYSTEST should be kept turned
&gt;off with /FLAGS=DISUSER and enabled only when needed.
&gt;
&gt;    The default DECnet account also provides a potential point of entry.
&gt;
&gt;    I'm real glad I'm not in your shoes.


&gt;From: @YMIR.BITNET:KVC@FRIDAY.A-T.COM ("Kevin V. Carosso")
&gt;Subject:Re: Virus or coincidence?
&gt;Date: 21 Sep 89 00:57:00 GMT
&gt;Message-ID:&lt;4EA69B97FB5FE04D85@YMIR.BITNET&gt;
&gt;The fact that you are running VMS V4.5 and getting the "USERS EXCEEDED"
&gt;message is an important clue.  User limits for MicroVMS were enforced by
&gt;code in LOGINOUT.EXE.  When you upgraded your license on your MicroVAX,
&gt;say from 2 users to 8, DEC sent you a VMSINTAL kit which patched LOGINOUT."
&gt;
&gt;The fact that your 750 suddenly has a user limit of 2 (indeed any limit at all)
&gt;and is not running VMS V5 means that you may be running with a LOGINOUT.EXE
&gt;copied from a MicroVMS system.  One distinct possibility is that someone
&gt;took the LOGINOUT.EXE from a MicroVMS system, possibly patched in their
&gt;own trapdoor, and copied it to your 750 replacing the standard
&gt;SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE.
&gt;
&gt;A couple of years ago there were a rash of breakins to VMS machines
&gt;characterized, in part, by patched LOGINOUT.EXE's being left behind.
&gt;
&gt;You should consider restoring LOGINOUT.EXE from tape.  You also might want
&gt;to save the suspicious one and check it out with ANALYZE/IMAGE (which will
&gt;report PATCH information unless the image was patched without using
&gt;the standard VMS PATCH utility).
&gt;

Finally Tom Ivers contacts me:-

&gt;From:	IN%"Thomas.Ivers%CUPLVX.APNE.COLUMBIA.EDU@munnari.OZ"  2-OCT-1989 10:53:09.83
&gt;To:	CROBW@acad.cut.oz
&gt;CC:	
&gt;Subj:	Coincidence (not virus)
&gt;
&gt;Rob,
&gt;	Our problems have been traced to a bad floating point accelerator in
&gt;our /750.   Evidently, the virus files were a benign coincidence.  You can
&gt;check this on your system by pulling your FPU and rebooting.  (You'll have
&gt;to do a CONVERSATIONAL BOOTSTRAP because you'll find the passwords are mangled
&gt;after pulling the board).  Otherwise, things should work fine without the FPU -
&gt;a bit slow, perhaps.    Hope this helps.

Sure enough, when the FPA was replaced in our Geophysics machine the problems
vanished. Apparently the FPA is used for password encryption. No one has
satisfactorily explained the 'licensed users exceeded' phenomenon.

As to the failure mode of this subsystem, one presumes that those computing at
the time of the failure would have some wrong answers, but further users were
spared this worry by not being able to access the system.

This morning's San Francisco Chronicle notes that there is a flaw in the
trigonometric functions in the new 486 chip.  It was discovered by Compaq in
testing its new system, expected to be announced on 6 November.  New chips
without the flaw will begin to appear next week, with volume production a few
weeks away.  This may delay some of the applications that are in the works.

The chip contains 1.2 million transistor equivalents, and at 12 to 15 MIPS is
three times faster than the 386 chip.  200 companies are reportedly actively
designing new computers using the chip.  

                     [Which chippies could talk about a better MOS TRAP
                     with everyone making a beaten path to their door?]

There has been a follow-up article in Computer Weekly (Oct 26, 1989, p.9) to
the story about the software error which caused #(pounds)2 billion in duplicate
payments, which I posted to RISKS (UK Banking Error, RISKS 9.33) last week. The
new article, though quite lengthy, doesn't add much detail. However it does
reveal that the bank concerned was Citibank, that 95% of the #2bn payments were
reversed within the same day, that delays only occurred where Citibank was
"acting through intermediaries or other branches", and that all the money was
returned within three days.

The nicest bit in the new article is where it indicates that the story was
originally broken in a speech by Jim Reeves, technical manager of the Clearing
House Payment Systems (Chaps) to a gathering of bankers and other financial
industry delegates at the Compsec computer security conference:

 "Reeves struck observers as the most unlikely bean-spiller in the
 financial industry. His voice was so unexpressive that his Compsec
 speech left one immaculately dressed banker in the audience slumped
 across two seats, snoring loudly.

 The enormity of the #2bn error was lost on his audience. Yet Reeves
 was saying, in effect, that in a matter of minutes a systems or
 operator error could cost a bank more than its annual profits."

And the article ends:

 "Citibank insisted that there had been no financial loss to the bank or
 any third party as a result of the error. But this comment begs many
 questions which Citibank would not answer. What about the lost
 interest on the #2bn? Even a day's lost interest would amount to more
 than #500,000.
 ...
 To most people the idea that systems could be so vulnerable as to
 allow a criminal, perhaps organised criminals, to divert
 electronically hundreds of millions into false accounts would be
 inconceivable - just as incredible as the notion that a bank could pay
 out #2bn by mistake."

Background:
I have written a paper, "A Comparison of Commercial RPC Protocols" (RPC
stands for Remote Procedure Call, and it is a simple way of writing 
distributed applications).  This paper contained two sections: one 
comparing the speed of various RPC products, another comparing their 
reliability.  This paper has been read by dozens (hundreds?) of people, 
and I have gotten a lot of feed back about it.

Problem:
The problem is that everyone ignores the reliability section of the paper.
People are constantly discussing the relative speeds of the RPC systems,
but they ignore the differing reliability measures.

I am in the process of writing the second version of this paper, and I 
want people to pay more attention to RPC reliability, but since I do not
know why they ignored reliability in the first paper, I do not know what
to change in the second paper.

Discussion:
In the first version of the paper the speed section came first and was
longer than the reliability section (3 pages vs. 1 page).  For the second
version, I plan to put the reliability section first, and try to run more
reliability tests.  Unfortunately reliability is, in many ways, simpler than
speed, so I doubt the reliability section will ever be as long as the speed 
section.

A second possible problem is that my wording was to neutral or too clinical,
and that I should replace it with stronger or more emotional language.

I have a bad feeling that the reaction I am seeing is just a reflection
of the fact that programmers and programming companies care much more about 
speed than reliability.  I'm worried that no matter how I present the 
information, the reliability numbers will be ignored.  

If you have any thoughts (answers or just comments) please email them to
me, even if you send them to RISKS.  (I do not seem to get every RISKS
issue.)  I will summarize responses sent to me.  Tell me if you do not
want your response summarized, or if you want to be anonymous.  Thanks.

Availability:
The paper in question, comparing RPCs, is available by sending email to 
archive-server@joshua.atherton.com.  The body of the message should contain
the lines "send other comprpc.shar" or "send other comprpc.txt".  The first
line will give you the paper in troff's me macros, the second in plaintext.

&gt;Sure enough, when the FPA was replaced in our Geophysics machine the problems
&gt;vanished. Apparently the FPA is used for password encryption. No one has
&gt;satisfactorily explained the 'licensed users exceeded' phenomenon.

	If your FPA is like the one on our dual 780's, then it is also used to
speed up integer math -- therefore, inode calculations and the like can be
affected.  Since file system damage was reported, this probably was the
case.  So, the 'licensed users exceeded' might be caused by the system looking
at the wrong disk sectors.

&gt;As to the failure mode of this subsystem, one presumes that those computing at
&gt;the time of the failure would have some wrong answers, but further users were
&gt;spared this worry by not being able to access the system.

	Yup, they do get wrong answers... and sometimes even notice it (which
is another computer "risk" -- people assuming that computers *never* make
math mistakes).

A couple of points regarding the notes from Rob Wright and Tom Ivers
regarding wholesale password failures and multi-user licensing problems
caused by a faulty floating point accelerator:

(1) The FPA implements integer multiply as well as the floating point
    operations, since a fast integer multiply helps array references
    often associated with floating-point intensive applications.

(2) The Purdy algorithm [CACM, August 1974] VMS uses for one-way
    encryption of passwords makes extensive use of integer multiply
    operations.

(3) The multi-user license validation algorithm used in VMS V4.* also
    uses the Purdy algorithm in checking its license database.

Thus the bad FPA causes both user passwords and the multi-user licensing to
fail. (Actually, a bad FPA can cause all sorts of things to fail because of the
multiply implementation. Just another unfortunate consequence of an operating
system's assumption that the CPU works.)

In issue 9:35, Will Martin reported on an article which suggested that a data
stream could somehow corrupt the workings of a computer system.  He also
expressed skepticism about this claim.  From what I've heard recently, his
skepticism is correct, as the claim itself is the product of confusion.

At a recent seminar hosted by the Greater Boston Chapter of the ACM, Pamela
Kane and Andy Hopkins of Panda Software discussed this notion briefly.  They
cited a magazine article where someone had speculated that a spreadsheet
overlay might contain malicious actions.  Since spreadsheet files are commonly
considered data, the Incautious Reader could jump to the conclusion that
malicious data could take over a computer's operations.

Pamela Kane was quick to point out that a file which contained executable
instructions--even if they were to be interpreted by another program, rather
than run directly by the hardware--shouldn't rightly be considered a
"data file."

			    CERT Advisory
			   October 26, 1989
			Sun RCP vulnerability
 
A problem has been discovered in the SunOS 4.0.x rcp.  If exploited, this
problem can allow users of other trusted machines to execute root-privilege
commands on a Sun via rcp.

This affects only SunOS 4.0.x systems; 3.5 systems are not affected.

A Sun running 4.0.x rcp can be exploited by any other trusted host listed in
/etc/hosts.equiv or /.rhosts.  Note that the other machine exploiting this hole
does not have to be running Unix; this vulnerability can be exploited by a PC
running PC/NFS, for example.

This bug will be fixed by Sun in version 4.1 (Sun Bug number 1017314), but for
now the following workaround is suggested by Sun:

Change the 'nobody' /etc/passwd file entry from

nobody:*:-2:-2::/:       
to
nobody:*:32767:32767:Mismatched NFS ID's:/nonexistant:/nosuchshell

If you need further information about this problem, please contact CERT by
electronic mail or phone.

In RISKS 9.34, CERT once again passes along advice on checking for security
holes.  Once again CERT recommends use of the UNIX utility "sum".  Forgive me
for shouting, but THE UTILITIES ON A POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED SYSTEM SHOULD NOT
BE USED TO EVALUATE THAT SYSTEM'S SECURITY.  This is especially true when CERT
publishes the output the utility should produce.  Another possibility is that a
compromised file might be constructed in such a way as to produce the same
output as an uncompromised file, even when viewed with an uncompromised
utility.

A poor security procedure is worse than no procedure, because the poor
procedure may produce a false sense of security.  It's better not to know the
truth and remain paranoid, than to know a false truth and feel comfy.

Sometimes I wonder whether CERT has been penetrated by a hacker.

When I was using ULTRIX, we had the same problem after a system upgrade - the
system would only allow 2 users to log in before reporting that the number of
licenced users had been exceeded.  Calling DEC confirmed this was the case, as
they had just (in that release) installed a mechanism to check this.  They
promised they would ship us a tape to allow us to carry on using the system as
before, but said it would take "several weeks".

I wasn't happy with this as we needed the system back online that morning (!)
so I broke the protection system.  Essentially it used a file in / (called
/.license, I think) which contained 1K or so of "random" junk.  This is the
file you buy from DEC for a certain fee depending on how many users you want to
enable on your system.  The file gets opened by /etc/init and the number of
licensed users read out and checked for every time a new login process is
started.  This number is also printed at boot time.

GOTCHA: The number printed is NOT the same as the number used in the check!
For a "real" license shipped by DEC, these numbers will be the same.  The idea
is to stop crackers disassembling init and patching the obvious number printed
at startup.  The real number is stored in several places in a suitably tricky
way.  Even so, armed with a couple of genuine licence files, it's fairly easy
to crack.  I ended up with a 10-lines-of-C utility that would forge any licence
you liked...

If init reckoned the license was not valid, it would default to the
minimum, i.e. 2 users.  I suspect the VMS mechanism is similar, and is
defaulting to 2 users as the value returned from the (bad) FPA is not
matching the proper encrypted value in the system license.

This message is being sent to both RISKS and VIRUS lists.  Apologies to those
who receive both digests.

	I was well shocked in finding-out that there was actually a virus
running on the Apple II family of computers ! Where could the LODE RUNNER virus
have infected such a small machine, with no integrated hard disk, and the
possibility of rebooting the machine quickly by using a simple sequence of
control codes ? (open-apple-ctrl- reset ). In FRANCE, of course !

	The Apple II did very well in France. It is very widely used over
there. This success, like in the U.S.A., triggered a large market for pirated
copies of programs.

	I have been an Apple II owner since 1982. It is absolutely amazing how
many copies of programs went around since that time. I guess that virtually
every program for this type of computer was available as a pirated copy in
France. This is because of the following:

1. There are laws about unlawful software copying, but they are very hard to
   enforce. In addition to that, it is extremely difficult to find the
   originators of the software. ie: The "top" pirates are well hidden,
   and if the police was to catch every person who copies a program,
   then they'd probably have to prosecute virtually *any* computer user !
2. Most software was copied and "exchanged" against other software, a bit
   like a one to one swap. Commercial pirate factories were discovered in
   Lyons a few years ago. There, the programs were deprotected, copied, and
   then protected again, and sold to customers for a fraction of the price.
   The pirates were arrested and heavily fined (and given a prison sentence).

SOME SORT OF COMPETITION

	There were many independent groups of pirates. The average age was
16-22 years old. All of them were experts at Apple II's Disk Operating
System. The most "advanced" of these "crackers" were the CCB.
CCB for "Clean Crack Band". From the number of programs that they have
cracked, they seemed to spend their days and nights cracking games and
software. Some French magazines and newspapers wrote articles and
interviews with them. They even went on national French TV. Of course,
they were in hiding; a bit like drug dealers, really. The quality
of their "work" was unbelievable. The program was as good as new, only
it had their name in the presentation page. Often, they added pretty
graphics, and additional options in some cases. In fact, it looked
as though they had completely re-written the program entirely.
At the end of 1985, I think, they renamed themselves, the SHC,
"Solex Hack Band". (A Solex used to be a cheap moped at the time)
They hacked a few French Computers by using dial lines; they did
one "Hacking" direct, on TV, showing the journalists how vulnerable 
computers were. Since that time, I don't know what happened to them.

OTHER GROUPS

	There are a lot of other groups of pirates around France. The CCB
were based in Paris (according to the press), and the two most famous
members of this group called themselves: Aldo Reset, and Laurent Rueil.
Other groups include:

- Johnny Diskette: this name was used by many anonymous pirates who had
  formed some kind of club in Paris, where they had competitions (!)
  on who would be the fastest to unprotect a disk.
- BCG (Baby Crack Gang): funny name. They seemed to like Karateka games.
- CES (Cracking Elite Software): They added features to games from time
  to time. 
- Chip Select and the Softman: These pirates went as far as including a
  digitised picture of themselves wearing dark glasses and saying:
  "I am Chip Select". A Certain Eric IRQ (Interrupt Request) was also
  part of this group.
- Mister Z (Geneva): These were Swiss pirates, but for some reason, they
  were sending copies to French crackers, telling them to change the
  title page that they had made-up. It was some kind of competition of:
  "We can protect this program; can you unprotect it ?"
- MAC (Marseilles Association of Crackers): group based in Marseilles.
- P.Avenue Nice: and this one is in Nice...

These groups deprotect the software. Once deprotected, it can be copied
very easily using a normal copy program.
Most copying goes-on in large computer centres, where machines can be
used free of charge. There is no supervision there, and no control on what
goes-on. Somes places are popular just because it is such an easy way
to get hold of any program for no charge (well... just the cost of a
diskette). Since 1987, though, the shops are more careful since they
could be held responsible for what happens on their machines.

HIDDEN INFO

If you use a track/sector disassembler, you can see the information on
the tracks of the disk displayed as ASCII characters. Often crackers would
converse between themselves in this way. Software is copied through a
string of intermediaries, and the messages can therefore be passed this way.
It is impossible to know if there is some hidden information on the
disk if it is not analysed by using a track/sector disassembler.
It is therefore very easy to hide other programs within the disk, whether
they are games, or even viruses !

IN CONCLUSION

So in fact, considering the level of expertise that these crackers have,
it would be very easy for them to hide a virus within a floppy disk,
which would be triggered by the actual program. I am talking here about
the APPLE II computer, but I am sure that other computers (including PC's)
have their "expert" crackers, who no doubt, would be very happy to write
viruses/worms/trojan horses/time bombs etc. 
Why do they do it ?
My idea is that they do it for "fame", just to see other people talk
about "their" virus. Any suggestions ?

The following is copied from our internal "humor" distribution list, condensed
from Flight International:

A DC9 with 104 people aboard made an emergency landing in Colorado last week.
The aircraft, Northwest flight 109 from Minneapolis to Phoenix diverted to
Monte Vista municipal airport after losing both generators and the auxilary
power unit in mid-air.

The aircraft landed safely on the 1,830m runway, with no injuries, although it
overan the runway by about 300m. The airline says the captain was forced to use
an axe to open the forward cabin door, after the cabin began to fill with
smoke.  After evacuating the passengers, the captain then had to walk to the
terminal and use a payphone to summon help.

        Car gadgets overwhelm, expert says (by Mary Gooderham)
             (Toronto Globe and Mail, Sept. 14, 1989)

Car drivers are being overwhelmed with technology that could endanger lives, a
conference was told yesterday.  Car telephones, facsimile machines, computers
and navigation systems that can even allow drivers to check the menus of
restaurants are providing more information than people can handle, Alison
Smiley, an expert in the field of human factors, told the Vehicle Navigation
and Information Systems conference in Toronto.  "High technology hasn't added
anything to safety and efficiency, it's detracted from it," said Ms. Smiley,
head of Human Factors North Inc., a Toronto consulting firm.  "The potential
for providing people with information in the car is limitless," she said,
adding that the capability exists to give drivers tips on the closest Chinese
restaurant and its menu. "You don't want people to do some things while they're
driving."

Since the early 1980s, the automobile and the computer have become increasingly
integrated. Today, cars are being equipped with "head-up displays" (HUD) that
project speed readouts before a driver's eyes while he looks through the
windshield and video screens that display maps that tell drivers where they are
and help them get where they are going.  

The navigation systems, which would eventually be linked to "smart" systems to
give drivers information about current road conditions, are already being
produced by a California company, Etak Inc.  Etak manufactures a device for
keeping track of car movements: a map is displayed on a video screen and
updated frequently as the car moves, showing the driver where he is and giving
him the ability to get information about approaching features.

Ms. Smiley said three areas of limitations must be considered when designing
such products: physical problems, a driver's perception of the instruments, and
cognitive problems relating to how the information is processed.  She said the
main problem with communication and information in the car and HUD readout is
that it distracts the driver.

One delegate told the conference that navigation displays require more, not
fewer skills than a traditional printed city map, especially if the driver is
unfamiliar with the area.

Acceptance of the systems may also be limited by its cost -- $1,500 to
$3,000 (U.S.)

  [This reminds me of a) a recent accident report in which a woman was killed:
  she didn't see a turn because she was putting on mascara, and b) the fact that
  my father would not even have a radio in the family car because he felt it
  stole a driver's attention away from *driving*.
                                                         Alayne McGregor   ]

Continuing with the problems of the FPA on a VAX 11/750....  I once used a
machine which had a FPA attached. Unfortunately the building the machine was in
had an air-conditioner that was subject to FREQUENT breakdowns.

What used to happen was that if the temperature fell below a critical value the
FPA would shut itself off. The rest of the machine did not know that the FPA
was off. As a result any program that used the FPA would behave weirdly (in my
case a graphics program IGL/PLOT10) but programs which did not worked just fine.

This was discovered when programs known to be correct would arbitrarily crash
when the temperature was high but work fine when the ac was ok.

The last thing you expect is a temperature sensitive behavior for programs.
Have people encountered similar problems or has the bug been fixed?

	In RISKS Vol 9 Issue 34 kaiser%cheese.DEC@src.dec.com reported that the
Boston Stock Exchange had little problem during the 10/13 stock crash, since
the exchange had the capability to return to (faster) manual transaction
handling.  For me, this is believable.

	I worked for several years in hotel work, auditing and front desk work
mainly.  At a couple of sites I worked with computerized desks and experienced
the advantages and disadvantages of them.  The biggest single disadvantage was
at checkin, where being forced to rely on the computer to find rooms slowed
check-in down to as little as one fifth the capacity I could handle manually.
Eventually the manual system was reinstalled as a backup, and fast check-in
speeds were again available...  At the cost of more work, as the check-in
infomation still had to be typed into the computer.

	So, while I can easily believe that the BSE could handle manually more
transactions than they could by computer, I'm also sure that there was also
some overtime that evening/night as the computers were brought up to date...

There's an excellent article on the Deep Thought - Kasparov chess match in the
24.Oct.89 issue of the Wall Street Journal (page A16).  It analyzes the
development of the two games and the strategies involved.  Apparently Kasparov
studied Deep Thought's games and developed strategies to blow the computer out
of the water, such as diverging early from established play patterns to get out
of the computer's "book".

As various electronic services are brought by phone lines or cables directly to
the home, there will be an increasing need for folks to deal with passwords. 
And concomitantly there will be ever more lists of passwords for the nefarious
to try to crack.  RISKS readers may be interested in the following stories
about passwords for two electronic services that recently arrived over the
wires at my house.  From the aspect of security, one story is good and the
other bad.

1.  Voice Mail.  The local Bell company is offering electronic voice mail from
the central switch to residential customers.  Many advantages over an answering
machine.  Not only are both capacity and reliability better than for tape
machine but there are also some nice features that an answering machine could
not have such as answer when busy and a differential ring that lets the caller
know he or she is being switched to voice mail with enough warning that he or
she can hang up to avoid toll charges.  The good story:  on first use the
system requires you to enter a password (min 4 digits, max 8 digits) of your
own choosing.  In contrast, my old answering machine had a 1 digit security
[sic] code.  The password is also easily changed.  I wish my multiple ATM cards
would let me choose my own passwords so that maybe I could remember some of
them.

2.  PRODIGY.  IBM and Sears have teamed to offer a modem-accessible information
and shopping service.  I think we are a test market but maybe lots of you have
this available.  Slick, but slow, graphics, available in either IBM-PC or Mac
versions, offer information on sports, weather, etc. and, depending on locale,
home banking, grocery shopping, and catalog shopping from places ranging from
Sears and Penneys to REI.  One particulary nice feature is access to American
Airlines' Sabre reservations system through a front-end that although is
sometimes tedious is much easier to use than a terminal in a travel agency. 
This week I received a promotional letter from AA proffering goodies if I
booked my own flights and paid for them with a credit card through Sabre.
And just in case I had forgotten my password (which they told me never to write
down) they had *printed* it at the top of the promotional letter!  That clearly
means they don't encrypt the passwords they collected from all of us (oh, they
also have our credit card numbers and frequent flyer numbers for faster ticket
ordering).  I wonder how many AA people have access to the password list? 
Certainly everyone in the mail room!  But if someone uses my password and
credit card number to order tickets, will I at least get credited for the
frequent flyer miles for the flights they steal?

From a conversation overheard a few days ago at the Duke University student
center -- yes, this is real; I'm not clever enough to make up something like
this -- a new version of the "my dog ate the homework" excuse for not getting a
project done:

     "I told the professor that with the medication I was taking
     it wasn't advisable for me to drive a car, operate heavy
     machinery, OR FORMAT FLOPPY DISKS."

My opinions are my own and probably not IBM-compatible.--ehr

    giving him the ability to get information about approaching features.

Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab used this very application as an
example of the need for speech interfaces to computers.  In his opinion, it's a
terrible idea to have a separate map screen that requires the driver to take
his eyes off the road.  It's much better for the map to talk to him: "Turn left
at Elm Street, 1/4 mile ahead."  Even a heads-up display isn't good enough --
don't overload one channel of communication, use two channels that don't
overlap.

This week's Economist (28 oct - 3 nov issue) has a leader article on computer
crime (p18), saying that the rush to define new laws on computer crime is
leading to inappropriate suggestions for punishment They say the `real menaces'
are not mysterious or new, but `old-fashioned trespass, vandalism and theft',
and that laws against the former two are hard to apply because ` the "space"
and "property" inside a computer are intangible'. They point out two nonsenses
that have been created by the proposal of Britain's Law Commission, note that
extra-territoriality is a special problem posed by computer crime, and suggest
(platitudinously) that the basic issue of how to protect (rather than how to
punish) needs to be addressed further. In the usual Economist style, it is
well-written and coherent, apart from the conclusion, which is hardly that.

I don't have a scanner, and am unwilling to type it all in. Copies should
hit the bookstores wednesday.

I'm a newcomer to risks (not the net) but I've followed the discussion of
slow computer vs. fast manual systems.  This is a subject which I've some
familiarity with, and right now I'm just finishing the installation of a
very high-volume POS (point of sale) system implemented on (can you believe
it?) a network of Macintoshes, with receipt printers, cash drawers, and
bar-code scanners.

I have done other systems before which demanded speed, but this job was the
most interesting and difficult I have faced.  From it I have learned a
number of things about the speed that can be achieved with computer systems
in the face of real-world problems.

Problem #1: Careless and unintelligent employees.
Many employees, especially in the kinds of positions that wind up being
automated (cashiers, tellers, etc.) are somewhat less than brilliant. If they
were smarter they'd be rocket scientists, right? :-)  There are many who are
not dumb, and they can be worse, because boredom can make them incredibly
careless.

Solution: Management has to be involved in maintaining a decent workplace,
but there are still many things you can do to keep new technology from adding
to the trouble (which would exist no matter what).  I followed the "spirit"
of the Mac interface, which really just means being aware of human factors-
I could not use a mouse *at all*, so goodbye menus and icons. In general,
_everything_ has to be 100% bulletproofed and idiotproofed. These are not the
same thing at all- one protects against illegal values completely, while the
other warns against (but usually doesn't forbid) stupid values.

Example: After a couple of days, employees become aware of the general flow
of events in the program, so they stopped looking at the messages for them
on the screen- in fact they often didn't look at all. They were often unaware
of conditions that required immediate action (bad price entered, for example).
One solution to this particular problem was to create three distinct sounds
that notified users of acknowledgement, notification, and error conditions.

Problem #2: Forgotten Features (and other training issues)
If the system can do so much, how come it's used for so little? Because nobody
remembers how to do this, that, and the other thing. So they all do _this_
instead of _that_ and simply keep paper notes, or figure out some other way
to do less work and screw up the system. Don't fight it, because you'll lose.

Solution: Make sure everything is accessible. Write software that requires
a minimum of training. You want specifics? Start with the Apple Human Interface
Guidelines, and then there's _lots_ of other literature. But to begin with,
don't hide features, don't use cryptic codes when simple english will do, and
don't expect your users to know what they're doing- literally. Either tell
them where they are at all times (unobtrusively, of course) or failing that,
allow them to back out gracefully.   *** BE CONSISTENT ***  and don't expect
users to be the same.

Example: My POS system replaces standard cash registers. It does much much more
and yet takes one-quarter the time to learn. And the features aren't forgotten.
One Mac-ish thing it does is use title bars on all of the windows which aren't
instant-response windows (modal dialogs). The title bars say who is logged in
and what they're doing at all times.

Problem #3: Slow and/or increased data entry
Many computer systems require the tracking of much more information than the
old manual systems.  This can create the illusion of lethargic system speed
even if the hardware is quite fast. Users can be frustrated by the extra
load, which may well feel like makework to them.  The speed of entry itself
may be slow if data is validated on-the-fly as it's entered.

Solution: First, tune the software. You can acheive remarkable things by
using (or, unhappily more often, faking) multi-threading -- do the validation,
but _don't_ stop data entry while you're validating. Overlap various hard
delays- print while you're writing to disk, or calculate while verifying a
credit number with a remote machine.
   After all this helps, but isn't good enough, start buying hardware. This
may well be the best part of the system to invest in. Special data-entry
hardware can make a _huge_ difference.

Example: After tuning the POS software, there was still an inevitable slowdown
since the cashiers were entering price and item information instead of just
the price (as on the old registers). This was costing up to fifteen seconds
_per item_, which was completely intolerable. The solution was to buy bar-code
scanners, which could enter both item # and price (both of which are typically
on the item to begin with). This dramatically improves the performance of the
item-entry process.

Problem #4: Lazy programming.
Yes, I am as lazy as the next guy. Often, I'd like the real world to fit a
neat conceptual model I have developed for it. When a case comes up that I
can't handle, I'd rather contort it to fit my code rather than the other way
around. Sometimes this is feasible, and once in a while, it can lead to
marked improvements- but if so, it just identifies an improvement that should
have been realized earlier in the design process. Most of the time, shoehorning
real procedures into flowcharts is a recipe for disaster.

Solution: In that case, recode.  It's as simple and as painful as that.
Sometimes you'll wind up with pages and pages of code to deal with a handful
of exceptions that won't come up but once a year. Tough luck- that's what
being a good programmer is all about.  

Example: I designed the POS system so that every item sold would already be
in the database. I went to great lengths to insure this, since it would make
life much easier for both myself and all of the users.  Unfortunately this
can't always work- at times items may be checked in with faulty item codes,
for example.  Modifying the system to deal with unexpected item codes was
one of the most annoying and inelegant things I have ever had to do, but now
it works, and people no longer complain about having to work around a system
which is supposed to make their work easier, not harder.

There is more, but I think that this is more than enough for my first risks
posting.  The point of this is that the system I built is not only more
capable and useful than the old, but is considerably more efficient up front,
as well.  I think that this achievement could easily be duplicated elsewheres
if programmers were more aware of the real-life processes they are trying to
model, and the real-life problems their systems will have to deal with.

A news article in the Boston Globe [last Sunday 29 October, with photo]
describes a new computer system, named Argus (after a mythical multi-eyed and
vigilant beast), which is being used to catch local drivers with stolen license
plates.  The innovation is that a sensor is used to observe license plates and
a program turns the image into numbers (so they claim).  A database is then
searched and a match signalled to the operator.  The system is set up at a toll
booth at the harbor tunnel and the suspect is somehow pulled over by the State
Police at the other end as the car emerges.

The article goes on to quote the operators as saying they have proven the
system "works" by matching on six offenders in one day.  Unfortunately, five of
the six were errors caused by Registry backlog or other policy inconsistencies
such as re-using old numbers for new car owners.  The sixth case was bona fide.

Their current experiment uses one camera and a floppy database of some 40,000
registrations. They say they are looking forward to installing the list of
200,000 suspended licenses or registrations and increasing the number of
cameras to enable them to watch all eight lanes. 

When five out of six hits are human errors, imagine the complaints! It can be
very humiliating to be hauled out of your car and treated like a felon.  This
could turn out to be embarrassing for the overworked database managers.

At least we can look forward to less tunnel traffic someday as Argus evaders
find alternate routes.

Friday evening's air traffic around Washington DC was awful.  As most of you
now know, both the primary computer system AND the backup were seriously
degraded for at least two hours during the evening rush hour, stacking up and
backing up air traffic extensively.  (I was in DC that day.  I'm at MIT today,
Home tonight, hopefully.) The scuttlebutt seems to blame a buffer overflow, but
I hope someone can contribute the real inside story.

Last night the one-hour TV documentary in the Equinox series, entitled "Fly By
Wire" was shown on Channel 4 in the UK. Since it was identified as "A Box
Production for Channel 4, in association with WGBH/Boston, copyright 1989", I
assume it will soon be shown in the States; I recommend looking out for it.

In my opinion it provided a reasonably complete and well-balanced (and also
visually very attractive) account of the various incidents and opinions
surrounding the A320, using a lot of well-chosen film clips, together with
interviews with, or at least "sound-bites" from, about twenty different people.

&gt;From Airbus Industrie there was Bernard Ziegler (VP Engineering), Roger
Betaille, and Gordon Corps (Engineering Test Pilot) and, from Aerospatiale,
Gilles Pichon (Chief Engineer A320) and Jacques Troy (Flight Control Manager).
Four A320 pilots took part, including Michel Asseline, who alleged that his
crash was due to the control-system over-riding his command to the plane to
ascend. (The others were somewhat critical of the flight control system, but
did not back up this allegation.)

The computing science community was represented by Mike Hennell, Bev
Littlewood, John Knight, and John Cullyer. There were also representatives from
Boeing, the FAA, CAA and DGAC, and Flight International.

The overall impression given was (i) that Airbus had been rather daring in
introducing fly-by-wire, but had probably got away with it, and (ii) that their
rivals would now follow suit, but that the next logical step, that of active
control, was even more controversial and should not be rushed.

     According to a news release heard a day or two ago, MI is now considering
legislation permitting local communities to establish and maintain data bases
of "suspected" child abusers, or those meeting another of the nebulous
"profiles" used to identify all sorts of persons and ethnic groups in our
society. Aside from permitting hearsay from neighbors, teachers, co-workers,
associates and assorted third parties to be entered and disseminated about any
particular individual or family, the framers of this legislation are also
attempting to gain back-door access to medical records. One profile criteria
disclosed for "identifying" child abusers is use of multiple doctors/hospitals
by the same family.  Physicians are threatened with legal sanctions for not
reporting the simple fact that one or another patient HAS SEEN ANOTHER
PHYSICIAN without their knowledge/blessing. I don't think that implies any sort
of involvement by Physicians or the AMA in this legislation.

Obviously, the privacy considerations and potential for misuse and/or
malicious use, such as slanderous reports by neighbors against an unpopular
neighborhood resident, inherent in this legislation are enormous.

    Yesterday, I was surprised to find over a dozen messages from the internal
technical mailing list of a company I worked for in 1982 in my inbox.  As it
turned out, the reason was that the mail alias a friend at this company used
for me was duplicated in the systemwide alias file for a new employee.
Fortuitously, nothing which was a sensitive matter (save for their code
indenting style :-) happened to be discussed in the block of messages I
received.

     Ministry of Public Safety of People's Republic of China found this
summer that one tenth of the computers in China had been contaminated by
three types of computer virus:  "Small Ball", "Marijuana" and "Shell", China
Daily reported.  The most serious damage was found in the National
Statistical System, in which "Small Ball" spread in 21 provinces.
In Wuhan University, viruses were found in *ALL* personal computers.
     In China, three hundred thousand computers (including PC's) are in
operation.  Due to premature law system the reproduction of software is not
regulated, so that computer viruses can easily be propagated.  Ministry of
Public Safety now provides "vaccines" against them.  Fortunately, those viruses
did not give fatal damage to data.

First Virus Attack on Macs in Japan

     Six Macs in University of Tokyo, Japan, were found to have caught
viruses, newspapers and radio reported.  Since this September, Prof. K. Tamaki,
Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, has noticed malfunctions on the
screen.  In October, he applied vaccines "Interferon" and "Virus Clinic" to
find his four Mac's were contaminated by computer viruses, "N Virus" type A and
type B.  He then found ten softwares were also infected by viruses.  A Mac of
J. Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo, was also found
to be contaminated by N Virus and Score Virus.  Those are the first reports of
real viruses in Japan.

     Later it was reported that four Mac's in Geological Survey of Japan, in
Tsukuba, were infected by N Virus Type A.  This virus was sent from U. S.
together with an editor.

NTT: Calling All Hackers

Tokyo - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. has issued a provocative
challenge: the Japanese communications giant will give 1 million yen
($6803) to any computer hacker anywhere in the world who can break its
FEAL-8 data communications security code by August 1991. Why the unusual
move? The company wants to debunk a rumor circulationg in Europe that
its security code has been cracked. The FEAL-8 code, developed by NTT in
1986, is widely used in Japan and overseas to protect datacom systems and
integrated circuit cards from illegal access.

Last week I received this letter from my bank:

    GREAT NEWS FOR THE HOLIDAYS!

    Dear Bryce C. Nesbitt:

           You are important to us.  And, because of the excellent way you've
   handled your finances, we are pleased to increase the credit limit on your
   Meridian Open Line of Credit to $0.  Now you have more buying power when you
   need it most - in time for the holidays.
				...

Thanks a lot.  Before the promotion my credit limit was $5,000.00.  The rest
of the letter talked about the free Mini-Vac that could be mine if I'd just
borrow $1,000 (funny, there was no mention of the over-limit penalty :-).  

The bank had little to say about the event.  I assume the calculation was
based on a number of factors, including the "high credit" on the account.
Since I have never drawn on this account, high credit would be zero.

I was strolling through the Unix Expo show at the Javits Center in NY this
morning, shortly after it opened for its third and final day, when all the
power went out.  My first reaction was that, boy, now we're gonna get to see
whose systems really ARE uninterruptable.  My second reaction was that there
must be a VMS hack around somewhere.  My third reaction, after it became clear
that the lights weren't coming back on right away, was to move toward the
daylight at the front of the convention center, with disturbing thoughts of
panicked crowds, the San Francisco earthquake, and other paranoia in mind.  As
I approached the front of the hall, the big steel roll-up overhead doors
started coming down.  Quite a few people, apparently believing that their only
exit was disappearing, rushed forward and ducked under the closing doors.  It
turned out that there were lots of other, conventional exit doors still
available, but it still seemed to me a poor choice of failure mode: when the
power fails (who knows, maybe because of a fire or other condition
necessitating evacuation), close off the biggest and most obvious escape route.
There was no panic this time, but after more than an hour, there was no power,
either, so I gave up on the show.  On the bus back, I was reading the issue of
Unix Today that was being handed out at the show.  A non-cover story described
some of the problems experienced by the people who tried to set up an operating
network (Ethernet?) at the show: apparently, some vendors were using unassigned
net addresses, so that they could access other systems, but their competitors
couldn't access theirs. And then there was the problem they had in actually
laying the cable: normally a 4-hour job, it turned out that in NYC, it had to
be performed by members of the Electrical Workers Union, who took 36 hours to
do it.  I found the juxtaposition of the appearance of a story blasting the
Electrical Workers Union and the power failure to be curious....

Oh yes, almost forgot, Unix is a registered trademark of AT&amp;T.

The headline on the November 9, 1989, Durham Morning Herald is
	Computer Twists Election Results
According to the article a "computer error" caused eight precincts
to be counted twice.  The correction actually changed the result
of one city council race twelve hours after it was assumed settled.

It's difficult to determine the nature of this computer error
from the newspaper article.  Another front-page article entitled:
	"Haywire Machine Counted Precinct Vote Totals Twice"
quotes Jo Overman, the chairman of the County Board of elections, as saying:

    One terminal used Tuesday apparently counted twice
    each precinct entered into it....
    What was called in was correct, the computer just added it twice....
    It was not added by an operator, it was a glitch in the program.

Ms. Overman, also added that the "errant terminal was an extra unit put on
election duty as part of a last-minute effort to process returns faster."

Interestingly, the precinct-by-precinct breakdown given to the media was
correct, even though they did not match the totals.  The mistake was
discovered in a later hand check of the results by the Board of Elections.
Apparently, no one else bothered to check the totals.

The director of the county's Management Information Services department,
which would be responsible for any programming errors, was instructed
by the elections supervisor not to say anything about the election.

The only information I have to add is that the local TV media kept referring to
it as a "computer error" without ever mentioning that the original source of
the error was a person.  The newspaper never explicitly made this link, but at
least mentioned it was a programming error.  Interestingly enough, the man who
became the winner after he had been declared the loser did refer to it as a
"human error".  The number of votes that had been double added was slightly
more than 6000.

[...] I find it most fascinating and troubling that it took over a day for
anyone to notice that the correctly reported precinct votes duly tabulated in
the paper the morning after the election did not add up to the numbers reported
as totals at the bottom of the columns, and the errors were not small - the
Mayor's race vote, for example, had been reported as 19,381 to 17,118 when in
fact the real totals of the votes as listed were 16,136 to 13,356!  To the
credit of the elections board, the errors were apparently found during manual
verification of the automatically reported "unofficial" results.

In the Nov. 7 Virginia gubernatorial race, Doug Wilder (D) appears to have
defeated Marshall Coleman (R) in a close race.  Currently out of a total of 1.7
million votes, AP reports a difference of 5,533 votes and UPI reports a 7,755
vote gap.  The Post article referenced below discusses the reasons for the
discrepancies and the mechanism for official vote tallies.  Buried within the
article was the following gem: (Washington Post, Thursday, Nov 9, 1989, pp.
A37, A40.)

  Vote Counting Methods, Race Factor in Polls Leave Plenty of Room For Error
  Disparities Remain in Va. Governor's Race Tallies
  By Stephen C. Fehr, Washington Post Staff Writer

  [discussion of discrepancies between AP and UPI vote tallies]
  ...
  For an hour on Tuesday, [AP's director of planning Evans] Witt said,
  a computer glitch caused some of Wilder's votes in predominantly black
  precincts to be counted twice; the error was fixed and the vote total
  was adjusted.
  ...
  AP's Witt said that "there's almost always a variation between the
  official and the unofficial count," but said he could not think of an
  instance in which the results of an election had been reversed because
  of a mistake by the wire services.
  ...

Comment:
There were many surprises and mistakes in the projections and reports of
election results; the type of problem cited above is minor, but, left
undiscovered, potentially quite serious.  The decision to call for a recount,
as well who bears the cost of a recount, depends upon the closeness of the
election (according to the official tally, of course, which is due on the
fourth Monday of November).

On October 29-30, elections were held in Rome for a new city administration.
Unofficial results published at first gave an important victory to the Christian
Democrats, but at the end of the tallying this victory almost vanished. The
publication of wrong results was attributed to a data-entry operator error.
Since then, the political parties have been exchanging accusations of
intentionally manipulating the data for political advantage (the supposed
advantage would be a short-term boost in popularity for the Christian Democrats,
or casting suspicions on the Christian Democrats, for the Communist). To set
things in context: besides deciding who will manage the capital city of Italy,
these elections were regarded as an important indicator for national policy, and
the major parties had put much effort in a combative, venomous campaign.

Now the details. (Disclaimer: this is my interpretation, checked with a few
colleagues, of very imprecise press and radio reports.  I'll look for more
precise reports, and send in corrections if I can)

Voting and vote counting are by hand, with paper ballots.  After the count
started, and as partial results were transmitted from the individual "electoral
sections", an EDP center of the City of Rome added them to obtain partial
accrued results (without official value) and transmitted them to the press,
radio and TV.

Very soon in this process, the published results showed a marked gain for the
Christian Democrats. Later, it turned out that a few tens of thousands of extra
votes had been erroneously given to them.  The error became evident because the
sum of the votes was greater than the number of voters. In an interview, the
director of the EDP center stated that he had received from the computer program
warnings about the discrepancy, but had ordered the publication of results to
continue, assuming the problem was temporary and it would disappear later on.

Two days ago, the operator was found that allegedly caused the problem. He had
to type in a screenful of data, send them to the computer and wait for it to
clear the screen and prompt for new data (or to unlock the keyboard?). He found
that pressing a certain combination of keys allowed him to clear the screen and
restart input sooner, so speeding up his work. But by this trick he sent wrong
data ("this affected the votes for 4 parties, and in particular the
number of votes for the Christian Democrats -line 18 on the screen - was
substituted with the number of the electoral section").  The program would
complain about receiving inconsistent data, but give him an override option,
which he used.

Now my comments. Funny: everybody is complaining about evil intentions (of which
there's no proof), not about incompetence. From the news stories, some
technical/organizational flaws are evident:

- the input routines checked for transmission overruns, or the application
program ran consistency checks on each individual transaction (the entering of
the results from a given number of ballots) but allowed the operator to override
them (there was a log of the override requests, though: all inputs were logged
to tape; but the log of part of the session was lost because tapes were scarce,
and some were used twice).

- the director of the EDP center ignored the warnings (it is unclear whether
these were from a global auditing of the data base or were the same error
messages sent to the operator) about inconsistent data.

But, most important: in their greed for early results, both the press and the
politicians trusted a non-trustworthy system.  It appears that the only checks
applied to this unofficial counting procedure were the consistency checks
mentioned. If one were to bribe the operators to shift votes _consistently_ from
one party to another, this could go undetected until the official tally was
available, several days later. The vulnerability so created is great: news
reports of, say, an 80 % victory of the Communist Party would certainly hit the
Stock Exchange hard; the resulting allegations of fraud would cause a political
earthquake (in the '50s, they might well cause a civil war).  As things are, the
effect on the public appears quite serious: according to an opinion poll, some
30 % of the voters interviewed said that, if the election were held again after
the news of the mix-up was known, they would refuse to vote.

I received the following information from a friend of mine, William Power,
who works as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal.

  The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX)
  opened for trading approximately one hour late this morning (November 10) due
  to an inability to receive information from or transmit information to the
  Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC), the jointly owned computer
  processing subsidiary of the two exchanges.  SIAC suffered equipment damage
  due to a fire in its building at 55 Water Street in lower Manhattan.  The
  fire apparently damaged equipment in a basement electrical vault, resulting
  in power outages to some areas of the building.

  The initial fire alarm was posted at 8 am; the NYSE and the AMEX officially
  opened for trading at 10:30 am, one hour later than usual.  The delayed
  opening resulted in a "domino effect," including the partial shutdown of the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

The Nov. 7 issue of the *Washington Post* carries a front page article on the
failure of long-term EW development projects to deliver on their goals and to
adequately counter 20-year old threat techniques.

The article describes a Congressional study, to be published soon, that looked
at the B-2 bomber, and a service-wide EW system, now in its thirteenth year of
development.  Of particular interest is the criticism of the test methods,
described as not keeping up with teh technology to be tested.

Although the article doesn't mention software specifically, the B2 software has
been a significant issue.

My own experience in EW systems is that black projects seem to engender the
attitude that since the project is not as visible, we can get away with less
formal control and more ad hoc technical approaches.

Disclaimer:  the truer it is, the stronger the denial.

in RISKS  Volume 9 : Issue 39 said:

It goes to show the importance of considering the total effect of a system
change, not just the project at hand. It was a serious design error to assume
that licence numbers, even if they could be read accurately from a TV camera,
could be used to positively identify wanted vehicles, if the database that
indicates which numbers are "hot" is unreliable.

Numerous stories have been reported on this list under the title "computer
error" and "computer risk," that seem to me to have nothing essential to do
with computers, and a great deal to do with very different issues.

Consider this story, for instance, from 9.39:

&gt;Subject:      new computer risk: child abuse data base proposed
&gt;     According to a news release heard a day or two ago, MI is now considering
&gt;legislation permitting local communities to establish and maintain data bases
&gt;of "suspected" child abusers, or those meeting another of the nebulous
&gt;"profiles" used to identify all sorts of persons and ethnic groups in our
&gt;society. Aside from permitting hearsay from neighbors, teachers, co-workers,
&gt;associates and assorted third parties to be entered and disseminated,
&gt;the framers of this legislation are also attempting to gain back-door access
&gt;to medical records. One profile criteria disclosed for "identifying" child
&gt;abusers is use of multiple doctors/hospitals by the same family....
&gt;
&gt;Obviously, the privacy considerations and potential for misuse and/or
&gt;malicious use, such as slanderous reports by neighbors against an unpopular
&gt;neighborhood resident, inherent in this legislation are enormous.

If this is essentially a computer risk, there is an easy solution: get rid of
the computer and we get rid of the risk.  Modify the legislation to require
that all database records must be kept manually on paper.  If this story is
really about computer risk, then all the problems noted above will disappear
when the source of risk is removed.  But do they?

Of course not.  Because the problems are privacy, vague definitions, hearsay,
backdoor entry, and interference in our lives.  The technology used to
accomplish those things is of some consequence (typically it changes the
economics), but it is not of the essence.  The real problems existed long
before this particular technology and are largely independent of it.

It matters how we describe these things because descriptions implicitly set
the agenda for discussion.  To call it a "computer risk" is to set an agenda
for discussing computers.  This is particularly misguided when the questions
that ought to be asked are: Should we collect such information at all?  HOW we
collect and store it will eventually matter, but the first and fundamental
question is, shall we do it at all?  What rights to privacy do we have?  What
modifications are we willing to make to those rights in pursuit of other,
clearing conflicting goals in society?  

In Mass., for example, (and perhaps elsewhere) doctors are required to report
to a state agency evidence of child abuse (not just obvious cases, evidence).
This is clearly a risky violation of the privacy of the doctor/patient
relation, one that includes most of the problems noted above.  The risks are
reduced here because the information required is a professional opinion based
on physical evidence.  In this case it is a risk we accept, presumably because
we believe the tradeoff is worth it.  And *that's* what the discussion ought
to be about: the risks and benefits of what we are doing, not what technology
is used.  The risks and benefits are often magnified by the technology, but
the essential question is the risks/benefits of various sorts of privacy and
the character of the information collected, not the technology that happens to
be employed.

Of all groups, this list ought to get this right.  Let me thereby enter a plea
to use the term "computer risk" and "computer error" with considerable
technical discretion.  I suggest the simple test above: Ask, can the identical
problem can arise in the absence of computers?

In some cases the answer is no (eg, instant, large-scale access to data from
arbitrary distances), and these are essential, computer-related risks.  

But if the same problem can arise, it is quite likely the technology is
fundamentally irrelevant and that the risk involves something else.  In that
circumstance ask what the problem is normally called and use that name.  The
story above, for example, is about risks to privacy, the dangers of using
inaccurate information from questionable sources, and requiring people to
report one another's activities.  Removing the computer from the picture does
not change those problems in any fundamental way.  And the problems are
serious enough that they ought to be debated on their own terms, without
muddying the waters with technology.

Charles Schwab &amp; Co spent more than $100,000 to conduct a nationwide poll on
program(med) trading, with two widely advertised free 800 phone numbers set up
to record the pro and con votes.  Apparently someone at Wells Fargo (which has
a high-profile program trading subsidiary) set up an autodialer to vote YES
continuously, which was detected by their programmed monitoring.  (` "First we
have program trading.  Now we have program dialing," quipped Senior Vice
President Hugo Quackenbush. ')  In 12 hours, there were 12,191 votes, 65.3%
for, 34.7% against.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 11 Nov 1989, pp. B1-B2.]

   [By the way, I observe that one call every twenty seconds for 12 hours would
   account for the entire difference between the pros and cons.  One call every
   six seconds would have accounted for ALL of the pro calls.  We might suspect
   that an autodialer could easily have skewed the results -- although perhaps
   others on both sides were also using the same strategy.]

The Bay Area Rapid Transit has for years been having troubles with its computer
systems -- both old and new.  The old one is supposed to handle 64 trains at
once, but is barely able to handle 39.  The new system -- almost ten years late
when it went on-line three weeks ago -- was supposed to be able to handle 108
trains, but becomes seriously overloaded at 10.  Consequently, all of the
long-planned extensions are on hold.  (The system supplier is Logica.  The old
system is still being used, at least as a backup when the new one is being
tested.)

"An outside consultant that designed three control systems for the Paris Metro
and was brought in by [BART General Manager Frank J.] Wilson has already
determined that even if the new system were able to perform as promised, it is
obsolete."  

[A summary of "BART's New Computer Called `Complete Failure'", By Harre 
W. Demoro, San Francisco Chronicle, 11 Nov 1989.]

An earlier article indicated that the BART system has been sorely pressed in
trying to accommodate the great increase in traffic due to the loss of the Bay
Bridge in the earthquake, and many train cars are out of service.

The captain of a ship which ran aground on an environmentally
sensitive live coral reef off the US coast attributed the accident to
a confused officer and a bad user interface.  Apparently, an officer
incorrectly changed course because the steering mechanism on the ship
operated in the opposite fashion from most such controls.

Whether or not the control was computerized, this demonstrates quite
dramatically the potential dangers of inconsistent user interfaces.  I suppose
the company which built the control could be held liable for the poor design.

There may be parallels with GUI issues yet to come.  What if a company has to
use an inconsistent interface because of patent restrictions?  Could the
company still liable for the errors of a confused user?

Excerpts from the UPI article follow:

	``I think he made an error. I think he was confused,'' Capt.
	Zdravko Beran told Coast Guard investigators on the first day
	of testimony before a board of inquiry. ``He told me that
	(navigational) light was dead ahead and then he wanted to turn
	a few degrees to the port (left).''

	Instead, the officer, Zvonko Baric, turned the ship to the
	right, or starboard, causing it to run aground on sensitive
	coral in the Fort Jefferson National Monument, Beran said.

	The steering mechanism must be turned in the opposite
	direction of the intended course -- the reverse of how most
	such devices operate, Beran said.

	Asked how future such accidents could be avoided, Beran said
	the federal officials could require ships to go around rather
	than through the national monument.

In RISKS DIGEST 9.40, Randy Davis says,

&gt; Numerous stories have been reported on this list under the title 
&gt; "computer error" and "computer risk," that seem to me to have nothing 
&gt; essential to do with computers, and a great deal to do with very 
&gt; different issues.
&gt; . . . I suggest the simple test above: Ask, can the identical
&gt; problem can arise in the absence of computers?

I claim that it is not that simple.  In a traditional library, it was possible
to invade your privacy by making a list of all the books you have every checked
out.  All an investigator had to do was open every book in the library and look
to see if you had signed the card inside.  The information was publicly
available, but actually it was benignly protected by an enormous collection
cost, so noone every worried about it.

These days, if the library has a computerized circulation system, and it is not
designed with proper regard for privacy, it may be possible to get this
information in a few seconds with a single request.  Most computerized
circulation system protect this information and many installations
systematically delete it to avoid any possibility of such investigations.  Yet,
when the first circulation systems were designed, some people said that the
circulation information has "always been public" as an argument against
protecting the information in the computerized system.

The Registrar of Motor Vehicles in Massachusetts has long used the "it has
always been public" argument on car registration information as an excuse for
selling tapes to mass mailers.  But as I recall, I didn't receive that class of
junk mail back in the days when you had to personally visit the Registry and
copy the information out of their ledgers.

The point is that the speed and efficiency with which data can be processed by
computer can convert a neglible risk into one worth discussing.  Had the RISKS
forum been around then, I think the library debate would have been quite an
appropriate topic.  Ditto the Mass. Registry.

Finally, the availability of the computer to discover connections may tempt
people to create data bases that they wouldn't otherwise consider feasible.
When I saw the report in RISKS on the proposed child-abuse data base I assumed
that this was an example of a data base that probably wouldn't have been
proposed had computers not been available to implement it--especially the part
about identifying people who use multiple doctors.

Thus I am prepared to tolerate a certain amount of fuzziness in identifying the
edge of the computer-RISKS arena by our beleaguered moderator.
                                                                  Jerry Saltzer

&gt;&gt;When five out of six hits are human errors, imagine the complaints!
&gt; 
&gt; It goes to show the importance of considering the total effect of a system
&gt; change, not just the project at hand. It was a serious design error [...]

   I am very surprised at how much complaining there has been about
this error rate.  I think finding one stolen car in every six stopped
is a phenomenally *high* success rate.  It doesn't seem a major
problem to me to inconvenience five people for a relatively short
period of time in order to apprehend one serious criminal.  I would
think almost any other form of police work would involve a much higher
level of inconvenience to the public for the same level of success.
   For comparison of order of magnitude, look at neutron-activation bomb
detectors, to be installed in airports.  They are said to have something like a
3% false positive rate (and that is in controlled tests, so the real rate will
most likely be higher).  I don't have a number at hand for the actual rate of
bombs in checked luggage, but let's say that it is 1 in 30 million (I'm sure it
is less).  That corresponds to 1 million false positives for every true
positive.  *That* is a high rate of error.  And our society has chosen to spend
nearly a billion dollars on that system.

I finally had a reason to dig thru the same box which had the following
reference in the history of Ada.  The quote comes from Pascal News #13,
December 1978, then published by the Pascal User Group.  This is a bound
journal (although basically Xerox(tm) copied sheets); it was unrefereed.  By
way on context, it should be recalled that the initial proposals for the new
DOD language (then refered as DOD-1, various "colors," and the progression:
Strawman, Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman, and then Steelman) had 17 proposals based
on Pascal (the last was based on PL/1, you can guess who proposed that 8).  So,
the Pascal community was thrust into the limelight.  (It was still a somewhat
obscure language at the time.)  The quote is authored by Andy Mickel, U MN,
then the editor:

  Latest News About DOD-1 (ADA or DOD0)		--Andy Mickel

  As we've told you in previous issues of Pascal News, the U.S. Department of
  Defense (DOD) has endeavored to procure a common programming language
  based on Pascal for all "embedded" computer applications -- computer systems
  attached to weaponry.  Reliable software should kill people reliably! .....
  [above description removed] ...colors: BLUE-Softech, GREEN-Honeywell Bull;
  RED-Intermetrics; and YELLOW-SRI International.

The article goes on for two more paragraphs, but Andy's comment about killing
was not taken lightly.  Pages 9-10.  So much for the history of programming
languages.

</i><PRE>

Brian Randell, in <A HREF="/Risks/9.39.html">RISKS-9.39</A>, gave a brief description of this programme,
which he thought was quite well done.  I have a few more reservations than
Brian, but this may be because most of the film of me ended up on the
cutting-room floor!

There were some interesting moments, though, not least in some of the
assertions still being made by Airbus and its constituent companies.
Throughout there was a curious belief in the power of the `systems approach'.
Perhaps the strongest statements came from Gilles Pichon (Chief Engineer, A320,
Aerospatiale), who said:

"Safety is ensured by the system approach: the computers, the sensors, the
whole environment, the power sources and the computer software.  All this has
to be analysed very closely for safety.  And the method of analysis, which is
called safety analysis, has been around for over 20 years.  It was used for
Concorde and it's still valid today."

Pretty unexceptionable, you may think, but this statement is quickly followed
in the film by a more detailed examination of the fault-tolerance of the
fly-by-wire system:

  Jacques Troyes (Flight Control Manager, Aerospatiale): "We work with three
  pieces of information completely independent of each other.  And we can only
  guarantee to protect the aircraft with certainty when we are sure of having
  at least two pieces of information."

I assume this is a reference to the A320 software fault tolerance, but if so it
is a bit confusing.  The voice-over questions whether developing all versions
from the same specification might introduce common faults.  Then cut to

  John Knight (University of Virginia): "It appears to be possible to build
  diverse programs where the programs will allow you to recover from certain
  kinds of difficulties that the software may get into.  The real issue is we
  have no way of predicting ahead of time how successful that kind of technology
  is going to be."

Voice-over then says Airbus have stated the system is designed to fail only
once 10**-9 hours [lovely slip that -- they mean 10**9!].  Then cut to me

  Bev Littlewood (City University): That means this system should fail every
  billion flight hours.  A billion flight hours is about 100,000 years.  There
  is no-one in this business believes you can design systems to that
  reliability."

  Pichon: "Having done all our safety analysis we are confident that we
  achieved the 10**-9.  And for those who have some doubts we can also say that
  even with no fly-by-wire the aircraft can fly safely because we have the
  mechanical back-up at the end."

Voice-over explains that mechanical back-up is really only meant to keep the
aircraft flying until computer system is got working again.

  Littlewood: "Airbus could have had a fully functioning mechanical back-up on
  that aircraft, so that in the event of total loss of the computer system it
  was still flyable.  Now what they've got is a vestigial mechanical back-up.
  Really all that you can control if you totally lose the computer system is
  the rudder and tail trim."

  Gordon Corps (Engineering Test Pilot, Airbus Industrie): "I had one Northwest
  Airlines pilot land the airplane totally satisfactorily using just the back-up
  system."

Later in the film, there is an interview with Michel Asseline, who was pilot in
charge of the A320 which crashed on the Mulhouse flight.

  Asseline: "When I pull the stick to up position, the flight controls, the
  elevator controls, go to down position . . . why?  That would be the good
  question."

Whereupon a man from the DGAC (the French certification agency) is asked
whether he had seen any evidence to support this claim.  He said he had not.
Then cut to

  Bernard Ziegler (Vice-President, Engineering, Airbus Industrie): "By no
  means, never, the computer want to land the aircraft, never.  I would even
  say, believe it or not, that we have put in our computer law to resist to
  land.  The pilot land the aircraft, and nobody else."

The voice-over then comments that, 15 months later, the official French report
into the crash has not been published, but it will almost certainly clear the
computer.

Later there are reports of other problems pilots have met, including the
following exchange

  Gino Scattolini (A320 pilot): "As we were coming in to land with the engines
  at idling speed, the two engines accelerated up to climbing speed, and as the
  automatic systems were not working we might have left the plane's flight path
  if the crew had not intervened.  But safety was never at risk."

  Corps: "There have been fine tuning changes done in some aspects of the
  software and I guess they will go on for some time, as we say just to cure some
  of the teething problems that we have seen.  But they haven't affected anything
  of significance associated with flight safety at all."

The film ends by looking to the future, and in particular the possibility of
unstable commercial aircraft.

  Ziegler: "It's clear that we say active control, which is a natural
  derivative of the fly-by-wire, we will be able to reduce the weight of the
  structure, to reduce the surface of the control.  That is also the next step
  and we are working also in this direction."

  Littlewood: "Now making an airliner unstable would bring enormous economic
  benefits because it would cut down drag and the aircraft would be much more
  fuel efficient.  But an unstable aircraft has to be controlled by computer
  all the time; there is no possibility of a mechanical control by the pilot.
  So that next step is one I think we ought to be worrying about."

  Brian Perry (UK Civil Aviation Authority): "There's nothing we know which
  would say we shouldn't consider such an approach.  We believe that if you
  take the system approach which looks at the hazards following system failure
  or system non-availability, and can satisfy yourself that the safety criteria
  are met, then the aircraft is potentially certificatable."

Certainly I agree with Brian that the film is worth seeing (I think it is to be
shown in the US -- probably on Public Broadcasting).  It would have been good to
have more debate and less lovely pictures of the A320 doing fancy things.  But
a couple of things did come out.

First, it seems that senior engineers (Pichon, above) are still trying to
convince us that they have achieved the mythical 10**-9.  Are they fools or
knaves?

Second, there seems to be confusion about exactly what can be expected of the
back-up system.  Do Airbus want us to believe that airline pilots will be able
to land on this, or that they will never need to do so?  (or both?)

Third, there have been software problems.  (I'm intrigued by the notion of
`fine tuning': is this similar to `it's not a bug it's a feature'?)

Fourth, this was the first formal statement I had heard that Airbus were
working on active control.  It seems to me that the certification agencies have
to take a more active role here than is represented by Perry's statement.

The Equinox programme mentioned by Brian Randell and Lindsay Marshall in Risks
9.39 and 9.40 has a glaring mistake in the script... I hope.

The announcer quite clearly explains at one point that the system was designed
to fail every "ten to the minus nine hours".  Moments later, an engineer says
they achieved the "10^-9 error rate".  (I'd recorded the programme, so I was
able to check what was said.)

A case of losing something in the translation?

Recent discussions in RISKS have suggested that safety standards in Europe are
superior to those we enjoy here, and indeed, some recent statistics suggest
that that may be true in some important senses.  However, we should beware in
adopting the stance that they have the answers and we have nothing to give.

In particular, I was in Hamburg, Germany for a six month assignment in 1987 and
was AMAZED to discover that the American safety requirement that all door open
OUT and that buildings have doors which are locked such that noone can be
locked in were unknown there.  If I forgot my keys and worked late, I could be
locked in at three separate levels: my own office, the office corridor, and the
building external doors.  MOST rooms had telephones, but...

Like everything else, we need to be careful about adopting anything wholesale,
without review.

Lightning may be natural, or may actually be stimulated artificially by
man-made conditions in situations in which lightning might otherwise not occur.
The latter occurred in the second and third of the following cases:

  ... three spectacular lightning accidents involving aircraft or spacecraft:
  (i) In 1963, a Boeing 707 flying at 5000 feet near Elkton, Maryland, was
  struck and destroyed by lightning, killing all occupants (3).  Lightning
  apparently burned through one of the metal wings, or in some other manner
  entered the fuel tank inside that wing, and caused the fuel vapor there to
  explode. (ii) In 1969, Apollo 12 artificially initiated (or "triggered") two
  lightning flashes, one to ground and one intracloud (IC) discharge, when it
  was launched through a weak cold front that was not producing natural
  lighting (4).  Although this rocket-initiated lightning caused major system
  upsets and minor permanent damage, the vehicle and its crew survived and were
  able to complete their mission successfully.  (iii) In 1987, an unmanned
  Atlas-Centaur vehicle (AC/67) was launched into weather conditions that were
  similar to those present at the launch of Apollo 12 and triggered a lightning
  discharge to ground (5).  This discharge upset the computer memory in the
  vehicle guidance system and produced an unplanned yaw rotation, and the
  associated stresses caused the vehicle to break apart.

This paragraph is excerpted from an article in the 27 October 1989 issue of
_Science_, Natural and Artificially Initiated Lightning, by Martin A. Uman
and E. Philip Krider, pp. 457-464.  References 3-5 are given in the article.

The Atlas-Centaur case was previously reported in <A HREF="/Risks/4.70.html">RISKS-4.70</A> (1 April 1987, no
joke) and <A HREF="/Risks/4.96.html">RISKS-4.96</A> (6 June 1987).  The Apollo 12 case has not -- to the best
of my knowledge been noted here previously.  More generally, the detailed
discussion of artificially triggered lightning in the Science article should be
particularly interesting to RISKS readers.

               MEXICO AND USA SIGN TREATY TO ATTACK TAX EVASIONS

   The mexican Secretary of Treasury, Pedro Aspe Armella, and Nicholas Brady,
northamerican Secretary of Treasury signed a treaty to detect and combat tax
evasions on both countries.  By means of this treaty both nations will have
access to information concerning the income of mexicans living in the States
and of northamericans living in Mexico. This deal also establishes the
possibility to exchange information on people who evades taxes.  This data will
be exchanged only if the laws and rights of the citizens are respected in each
country. With this information, the fiscal authorities expect to detect
possible tax evasions by incomes obtained in another country and that are
frequently not reported to the Government.

  [... another privacy "loophole" via a shared data base. The comment about
  protecting privacy by "observing all laws of both countries" is absurd. Once
  the data is in the hands of any third party, individual, corporate or
  national, controls imposed from without are nothing more than "gentlemen's
  agreements" observed out of courtesy and/or convenience.  Bill]
    [Bill did not indicate where this appeared.  I edited it lightly to fix a 
  few typos (e.g., Treasure), but left "northamerican Secretary".  PGN]

Summary: Election worker opinion

&gt;           [With a "Duke" as Governor of both Massachusetts and California, 
&gt;           I wonder if any Duke Univ. folks were governing this election?  PGN]

	Well, I work at Duke University, and I was also working as an
assistant to the precint registrar for my home precinct -- that might
count a "governing" this election ;-)

	It was an enlightening experience doing an election.  The machines
used around here are purely mechanical.  The only electricity used is for a
fluroescent light over the front panel.  After the election, a hand crank is
used to force the counter wheels against an NCR paper (or rather vice versa)
and the numbers are transcribed by hand to the official ballot reports.
	In my precinct, we had two calculators (electronic) to assist in the
tally, and I still caught an error by doing a simple parity check on the
numbers as they where called out.
	As for the "Computer Error" down at the Board of Elections...
What goes on there is simply a convenience for the press and candidates.
The BoE staff has a few PC's and spreadsheets set up to do simple calculations
and the person who got to put it together this year simply messed up one
of the cross-tabulations.  There is not, as far as I know, a specific
program that the BoE uses, just a PC set up in the County Commission meeting
room used for simple arithmetic.  Prior to last year they used simple hand
calculators and never had a problem.
	The "Official Election" comes about one week after the voting when
the registrars from each pricinct sit down "en banc" and canvass the actual
numbers from the machines in their precincts and double check each other
via whatever method is most convenient.  Some of the registrars actually
do the arithmetic in their heads and have the result written on their
scratch pads before the various calculator people can announce what they
get.  All in all, its still dependent on mechanisims and mental skill.

&gt;&gt;   .............................  In a traditional library, it was
&gt;&gt;   possible to invade your privacy by making a list of all the books you
&gt;&gt;   have every checked out.  All an investigator had to do was open every
&gt;&gt;   book in the library and look to see if you had signed the card
&gt;&gt;   inside.  The information was publicly available, but actually it was
&gt;&gt;   benignly protected by an enormous collection cost, so noone every
&gt;&gt;   worried about it.

In privacy discussions, one frequently hears the point about convenience
of collection, magnitude of what can be obtained for little effort, etc.,
but the concept of "benign protection by the status quo" is a very adroit
way of capturing the point and of relating it lay folks.

His point also brings to mind one made very forcefully by Richard Hamming
(currently on the faculty of the USN Postgraduate School at Monetery, CA)
many years ago.  In paraphrase, he said: "when something changes by an
order of magnitude, there are fundamental new effects."

Certainly from the benign library of the past to the computerized one of
now, the effort to assemble one's reading list has changed by been many
orders of magnitude.

Hamming's Law is really what's behind so many of the computer-induced
effects, and it's also the underlying issue in having such effects
understood among the laity.  It's certainly a big part of the problem with
getting legislators to pay attention; they think everything is fine just
because it has been fine in the past.

&gt;&gt; In RISKS DIGEST 9.40, Randy Davis says,
&gt;&gt; &gt; . . . I suggest the simple test above: Ask, can the identical
&gt;&gt; &gt; problem can arise in the absence of computers?
&gt;&gt; I claim that it is not that simple...

I think i must respectfully disagree.

Consider the two examples given ...  Yes, i will concede that the cost of
collecting library patron information precludes its use to send "appropriate"
junkmail.  The cost of collecting DMV information precluded its use for
junkmail as well.  But these are trivial invasions of privacy, and not the ones
i'm most worried about.

Consider the possibility of a new McCarthy Era.  During the old McCarthy Era,
readers of certain books in the library WERE found and used for purposes which
i would assume many would just as soon forget.  The fact that this information
was available in dilute form protected nobody.  Recall that both the imaginary
but believable society of 1984, and the real tyrrany of Nazi Germany, were
quite plausible/possible with only "human computers".

Consider the case of the skiptracer.  The cost of a DMV trip would be a
negligible portion of his cost of doing business; no doubt he would have
several cases he could service with a single trip.

So, in part, i support the original thesis that for serious breaches of privacy
[as opposed to trivial annoyances] lack of a computer is no protection against
data collection.  In part, i offer a possibility for a NEW protection.

It is practical for the head librarian of even the largest city to personally
walk the half-dozen disk packs containing circulation information to the
library's degausser, together with the appropriate tapes, and defend the
privacy of the more-than-two-month-old circulation information reasonably
absolutely.  It is possible for the populace to order the DMV to implement
access poicies.  In short, the compactness of the information implies that the
privacy afforded patrons of a particular service will not be the accidental
result of the way things happen to be, but the result of an explicit decision.

Here's a first-hand experience, for a change:

Some months ago my SO subscribed to the L.A.  Times newspaper.  She made
it very clear she wanted the Sunday edition only.  A week later papers
began arriving -- every day.  We called the Times and complained.  The
person who answered looked us up in their data base.  Sure enough, we're
listed there as Sunday edition only.  She said not to worry about it, we
would only be billed for the Sunday papers.

Time goes on.  Daily papers continue to arrive.  We complain again. (We
don't _want_ daily papers.  Not even for free).  Same story.  The computer
has us listed as Sunday only, so we shouldn't worry about it.

More time.  More daily papers.  Recycling them is becoming a major
nuisance.  On our third, most recent call the Times operator asked "What
is it you want?" We answered "Sunday delivery only." "Well, the computer
says that's what you're getting." End of conversation.

We're still getting daily papers. )-:

I get my news from phoenix.princeton.edu, and on that machine, <A HREF="/Risks/9.39.html">RISKS-9.39</A>
arrived AFTER 9.40 and 9.41.  Furthermore, many characters had been altered,
having their 2^2 bit set.  The most common changes were ' ' -&gt; '$' (happened 30
times) and 'h -&gt; l' (there were many instances of the word "tle").  I also
noticed y-&gt;}, s-&gt;w, i-&gt;m, p-&gt;t, b-&gt;f, r-&gt;v.  Note that in all of these cases,

An interesting sidelight is *why* Apollo 12 survived the lightning strikes.
The Apollo spacecraft's electronics got scrambled quite thoroughly, but the
independent computers running the Saturn V booster were unaffected.  They were
in a much less exposed position, on top of the booster proper, underneath the
Apollo spacecraft assembly.  (They may also perhaps have been better protected
against electrical upsets, although I don't know that for sure.)

Early in the Saturn program, there had been some discussion of the idea of
saving weight by having the spacecraft computers run the booster as well;
Wernher von Braun vetoed the idea and insisted on the booster having its own
control system.  This was probably more because of potential problems with
changing payloads -- the Saturn V was meant to be NASA's heavy booster well
into the 1980s, launching much more than just Apollo -- but I seem to recall
that better protection for the electronics was mentioned as well.

Truth stranger than fiction?  Several months ago, I stumbled on a novel,
_Passengers_, copyright 1983, by Thoms G. Foxworth &amp; Michael J.
Laurence.  It tells the story of a brand new airliner with active fly-by-wire
controls and inherent aerodynamic instability.  The book does have some
technical flaws.  However, it happens to cover not just the active fly-by-
wire issue, but also whistle-blowing and different international safety
standards and evaluations.

Again, not one's most technically accurate source, but an enjoyable read
nonetheless, especially in light of many of the discussions on RISKS.

An article in the San Francisco Bay Guardian of November 9, 1989 entitled
"We Almost Lost San Francisco", and an accompanying sidebar "Water, Water
Everywhere..." investigate some of the failures and near-failures of major
systems during the October 17th earthquake.  Most failures were made up for
by individuals' dedication and heroism.

According to the article, years of budget cuts and neglect had left the City
unprepared for such a disaster. Here is a summary of some of the points in
the article.

The telephone system held up pretty well, but the 911 system (not intended
for a disaster) was overloaded. There are only a few 911 trunk lines from
each exchange, and only 15 lines go into the 911 operators.

With 911 flooded, the primary way for citizens to contact the fire
department was the Street Telegraph System, which was first built in 1875,
and reconstructed after the 1906 earthquake. The Fire Department had
defended the system from former Mayor Feinstein's budget axe. The telegraph
system is triggered by pulling alarm boxes along city streets, sending a
coded signal to a teletype at the Central Fire Alarm Station. Because the
alarm boxes contain spring-driven works, and the telegraph lines are
battery-powered, the boxes worked fine after the quake.

Unfortunately, the success story of the street boxes ends there. The
telegraph messages are decoded by a 16-year-old DEC computer. It has a
history of crashing under heavy load, and went down almost immediately after
the quake. Dispatchers ended up using an antiquated 1940's-era card system
called "the tubs" to identify the locations of alarms and assign units. A
department chaplain used a pegboard to keep track of assignments.

Fire Commissioner Sharon Bretz told the Bay Guardian that no computer could
have handled the flood of calls into the Central Fire Alarm System.

The City's police, fire, and ambulance radio works through a repeater on
Twin Peaks, the highest point in town. When electrical power failed,
emergency generators kicked in. They are so old that mechanics can no longer
obtain spare parts for them. Both had trouble with their water pumps. The
first one overheated and failed; luckily, a dedicated engineer kept the
second unit (an identical machine with identical failure mode) running.

A large fire broke out in the Marina district. Water was eventually supplied
by the Phoenix, an aging fireboat. There is a special high-pressure water
system specifically designed to supply water for firefighters after an
earthquake, but no one ordered it turned on.  Even if the order had been
given, some of the pump stations are unmanned and automated, and have no
generators; the electrically-operated valves would not have worked. And some
of the dozen workers who know how to operate the system live out of town.

[I was lucky -- no damage to my home, and no nearby fires. I headed for the
neighborhood bar for some warm beer, and returned home when power came back
on (around midnight). -jvz]

Here's an article someone at work sent to me.  I find the perspective of the
author, um, interesting, and offer it to the group for their perusal,
amusement, and comment.

                   No more John Hancock
         Businesses start to sign off on paperless deals
          By Tom Steinert-Threlkeld Dallas Morning News

DALLAS. Until now, the operative phrase for sealing a contract has been, "Put
your 'John Hancock' on the line."  Soon, that may change. The operative phrase
could well become, "Send your personal identification code over the line."

Such is going to be the impact of the paperless contract. Unlike much of the
rest of the "paperless office," electronic purchase orders, invoices and
payments are taking off.

The process is called electronic data interchange. EDI involves a variety of
protocols and standards for paperless communications allowing companies to buy
and sell goods and services to each other simply by sitting at a screen on a
desk.  EDI is growing rapidly. Dallas attorney Benjamin Wright, author of a new
book called "EDI and American Law: A Practical Guide," estimates that as many
as 7,000 firms and agencies worldwide now use electronic means for conducting
basic business transactions.

Market Intelligence Research Co. estimates that only $11.3 million of business
was conducted through such means in 1985. That will have grown to $144.7
million of EDI business this year, the Mountain View research firm estimates.
By 1993, use will grow to $1.1 billion, the company says. Two years later? $1.8
billion. EDI is here to stay.

But the John Hancock problem remains. How do you prove that an electronic
document is for real? As computer malfeasance has proved, electronic
information can come from anywhere and go to anywhere.  No fingerprints get
left. No signatures are affixed. Heck, for that matter, make the wrong move and
the whole blasted thing gets erased in a blink. And there are no carbons.  It's
not quite as bad as all that. As Wright notes, electronic documents frequently
can be more secure than paper documents. Electronic systems provide a multitude
of options for automatically securing and authenticating documents or data:
passwords, security codes, encryption, and the like.

In addition, the information is less susceptible to damage. With electronic
transactions, basic information on a transaction need only be typed one time.
Let's say your company sends a quote to a customer. The customer gets the
quote. Electronically, the customer can reuse the data when it sends back an
acknowledgment of receiving the quote. From then on, through purchase order,
invoice, statement and payment, the data remains the same. No errors get added
at each step, from separate data entry operators.

Even if there is an error, it gets identified and fixed more rapidly, by
electronic means.

The systems can even automatically generate an electronic trail to follow
complex transactions and ongoing business. Acknowledgments, tracking numbers,
audit logs, network transmission reports there's a wealth of information that
can be logged by electrons, instead of by hand.

This is no small matter when you're trying to prove a transaction took place.
You can't haul electrons into court. You still will have to take paper, even if
it is a printout of the transaction that actually was stored magnetically on
tape.

And you won't be able to show that you signed off on the deal.  Paperless
transactions also mean signatureless transactions. The basic means of sealing
deals for centuries is giving way in a matter of years.

On CBC radio this morning, during the Daybreak program, there was an interview
with a tax expert by the name of Benoit Lasalle. Mr. Lasalle was warning
taxpayers that some people were getting letters from the income tax department
alleging that they had failed to declare dividend income. According to Mr.
Lasalle, these demands for payment, (allowing  a very short time to reply), were
often in error. For example, one taxpayer was being assessed for dividends paid
into his tax-sheltered Registered Retirement Savings Plan!.
The scary part is that the tax department is unable to produce a paper copy of
the T5 form, which is normally sent to the taxpayer by his financial
institution. Missed dividend declarations are determined on the basis of
information transferred from the financial institution to the tax department. If
a taxpayer has failed to keep records of previous taxation years (at least 3),
he could end up paying more tax than he should to avoid trouble.

I'm surprised that people find this surprising.  I moved from Toronto, Ontario
to Palo Alto, California in 1977, and a couple of years later received a letter
from the IRS asking me to account for income that appeared on my Canadian
income tax return that they couldn't identify on my US return.  (Fortunately, I
was able to show that I had properly reported it).  Ever since, I've assumed
that transnational exchange of income tax data was routine.

Randall Davis suggests that using the terms "computer errors" and "computer
risks" when speaking of social risks not arising uniquely from but only
amplified by the use of computers leads to discussing these matters in the
wrong forums -- computer technology instead of social morality.  He says that,
for example, if the misuse of computer databases and telecommunications to
implement policies that impinge drastically on individual privacy rights were
truly a "computer risks" problem, all that would be needed to solve it would be
the elimination of the computer.

It isn't quite that simple.  The motivation to establish and implement a policy
may be exist, but if there's no tool to implement it adequately, the motivation
will likely remain dormant, the policy unpursued.  Only when a tool becomes
available that makes implementation feasible will the policy be elaborated and
implemented.  It's possible to maintain large, irresponsibly constructed paper
databases on suspected child molesters, but not feasible; with computers, it's
not only feasible but easy -- the technology empowers the idea.

The existence of the motivation is a social moral concern.  That the pursuance
of policy based upon the motivation has been made feasible by the existence of
a powerful and compliant technology is both a social moral concern and a
technology concern.  The distinction is important, but it shouldn't prevent
discussion of the issue in both forums.

In the incipient stages of their White House investigation, Woodward and
Bernstein finagled access to a large quantity of Library of Congress records on
books checked out by White House offices. The distillation of their findings
was that E. Howard Hunt had done a massive amount of research on Senator Ted
Kennedy, presumably to aid in smearing him should he decide to run for the
presidency. The findings became part of a larger pattern of shady campaign
practices.

This invasion of privacy seems palatable since, in the light of history, it can
be deemed a "good cause." I could trivialize my next point by saying that a
good laptop PC would have saved Woodward and Bernstein a couple of long
evenings. But the fact is this, in the information age the widespread use of
PC's serves as a kind of "people's revolution." Previous to PC's, computerized
information processing was centralized and primarily accessible to a managerial
elite. With the advent of PC's information processing capability has been
decentralized to some extent. The possibilities for using computers to monitor
government and business should not be overlooked.

I get my news from phoenix.princeton.edu, and on that machine, <A HREF="/Risks/9.39.html">RISKS-9.39</A>
arrived after 9.40 and 9.41.  Furthermore, many characters had been altered,
having their 2^2 bit set.  The most common changes were ' ' -&gt; '$' (happened 30
times) and 'h -&gt; l' (there were many instances of the word "tle").  I also
noticed y-&gt;}, s-&gt;w, i-&gt;m, p-&gt;t, b-&gt;f, r-&gt;v.  Note that in all of these cases,
the letter substituted has ascii value exactly 4 greater than the original (one
extra bit set).

    [Similar behavior was reported by several other recipients, including
    henk@cs.eur.nl (Henk Langeveld) in Rotterdam, whose return path to me was
      "euraiv1!eurtrx!hp4nl!mcsun!uunet!seismo!ukma!tut.cis.ohio-state.edu!
      gem.mps.ohio-state.edu!usc!ucsd!ames!lll-lcc!unisoft!mtxinu!
      ucbvax!CSL.SRI.COM!risks".  But his copy had an interesting FROM: field
      -- "From: rmsks@CSL.SRI.COM (RISKS Forum)". 

    We have reported previously on compression screwups making systematic 
    substitutions.  This one looks like a transient hardware bit error in the
    4's bit, somewhere along the line.  Before u4ia sets in, I hope someone can
    track down its origin.  PGN]
