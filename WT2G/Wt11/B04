<h3>Pacific White-Sided Dolphin (<EM>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens</EM>): Central North Pacific Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The Pacific white-sided dolphin is found throughout the temperate North Pacific Ocean, north of the coasts of Japan and Baja California, Mexico, and is common both on the high seas and along the continental margins.  The following information was considered in classifying Pacific white-sided dolphin stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous; (2) Population response data:
unknown;  (3) Phenotypic data: two morphological forms recognized (Walker et al. 1986, Chivers et al. 1993); and (4) Genotypic data: preliminary genetic analyses underway (NMFS, unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).  Based on this limited information, stock structure throughout the North Pacific is poorly understood, yet the northern form occurs north of about 33°N from southern California to Alaska, whereas the southern form ranges from about 36°N southward along the coasts of California and Baja California.  These two forms can not, however, currently be differentiated for abundance and mortality estimation, and are thus managed together.  Because the California drift gillnet fisheries operate between 33°N and 45°N, two stocks are recognized:  1) California/Oregon/Washington stock, and 2) the central North Pacific stock.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The most recent population abundance estimate for Pacific white-sided dolphins was calculated by Buckland et al. (1993) from line transect analyses applied to the 1987-90 central  North Pacific marine mammal sightings survey data.  Their abundance estimate was 931,000 (CV=0.900; 95% CI 206,000-4,216,000) animals, after a regression adjustment for size-biased sampling of schools.  It should be noted, however, that Buckland et al. (1993) suggested that Pacific white-sided dolphins show strong vessel attraction, based on a high concentration of sightings close to the trackline during sampling.  A correction factor has not yet been estimated for such vessel attraction behavior for Pacific white-sided dolphins, yet it may be more extreme than the 0.2 determined for Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli); that is,, abundance estimates may be biased upwards by more than five-fold.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 931,000 and its associated CV of 0.900, NMIN for the North Pacific stock of Pacific white-sided dolphin is 486,719.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, there is no reliable information on trends in abundance for this stock of Pacific white-sided dolphin.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is not currently available for the central North Pacific stock of Pacific white-sided dolphin.  Thus, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock at this time (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks of unknown status (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for this stock of Pacific white-sided dolphin, PBR = (486,719 x 0.02 x 0.5), or 4,867 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>Between 1978 and 1991, thousands of Pacific white-sided dolphins were killed annually incidental to high seas fisheries; however, since 1991 these fisheries have not operated in the central north Pacific.  NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries that could have interacted with Pacific white-sided dolphins during 1990-93: The Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) and Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which incidental kill was observed was the Bering Sea groundfish fishery, with 1 mortality observed in all 4  years.  This mortality resulted in a mean annual (total) mortality &lt;1 (CV=0.60).  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental
catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0021 (CV=0.62).

<P>An additional source of information on the number of Pacific white-sided dolphins killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated 1 injury and 2 mortalities from gear interactions; no injuries or mortalities due to deterrence were reported. 
However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  The injury and mortalities occurred in the Copper River and Bering River salmon drift gillnet and the Southeast Alaska salmon drift gillnet.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (1.1; based on observer data (0.4) and logbook reports (0.7) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (487) and, therefore, is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (0.9) does not exceed the PBR (4,867), thus the North Pacific stock of the Pacific white-sided dolphin is not classified as a strategic stock.

<P>In 1988 changes were made in the program governing the take of
dolphins by the US tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific. This included the
elimination of "sundown" sets, the implementation of performance
standards for vessel operators and implementation of requirements
that each foriegn nation imorting tuna must have regulations
comporable to those of the US. Present regulations and management
activities have included embargo procedures on nations not
complying with US standards, dolphin-safe tuna catching
techniques and current proposed legislation to eliminate
purse-seining for tuna entirely within the next 5 years.  

<P>The best estimates of eastern spinner dolphin mortality indicate
that the purse-seine fishery for tuna killed at least 1,300,000
dolphins between 1959 (inception of the fishery) and 1990. The
mortality was greatest between 1960 and 1975. Since 1990 the
total mortality of this species (US and non-US fleet) is in the
low 1000's per year.

<H3>Distribution:</H3>

<P>The eastern spinner dolphin is endemic to the eastern tropical
Pacific (ETP). The core range of the species extends from near
the coast of Mexico and Central America to about 1000 km offshore
(8-15°N lattitude and 90-125°W longitude)

<IMG SRC="../images/coho.gif" HSPACE=10
VSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
<P>The coho salmon (<EM>Oncorhynchus kisutch</EM>) is an anadromous salmonid species that was
historically distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean from central California to
Point Hope, AK, through the Aleutian
Islands, and from the Anadyr River, Russia, south to Hokkaido, Japan.
Historically, this species probably inhabited most coastal streams in
Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Some
populations, now considered extinct, and believed to have migrated
hundreds of miles inland to spawn in tributaries of the upper Columbia
River in Washington, and the Snake River in Idaho.

<H3>Biology</H3>
<P>In contrast to the life history patterns of other anadromous
salmonids, coho salmon on the west coast of North America generally
exhibit a relatively simple 3-year life cycle. Adults typically begin
their freshwater spawning migration in the late summer and fall, spawn
by mid-winter, and then die. Run and spawn timing of adult coho salmon
vary between and within coastal and Columbia River Basin populations.
Depending on river temperatures, eggs incubate in ``redds'' (gravel
nests excavated by spawning females) for 1.5 to 4 months before
hatching as ``alevins'' (a larval life stage dependent on food stored
in a yolk sac). Following yolk sac absorption, alevins emerge from the
gravel as young juveniles, or ``fry,'' and begin actively feeding.
Juveniles rear in fresh water for up to 15 months, then migrate to the
ocean as ``smolts'' in the spring. Coho salmon typically spend two
growing seasons in the ocean before returning to their natal streams to
spawn as 3 year-olds. Some precocious males, called ``jacks,'' return
to spawn after only 6 months at sea.

<P>During this century, indigenous, naturally-reproducing populations
of coho salmon are believed to have been eliminated in nearly all
Columbia River tributaries and to be in decline in numerous coastal
streams in Washington, Oregon, and California. Coho in at least 33
stream/river systems have been identified by agencies and conservation
groups as being at moderate or high risk of extinction. In general,
there is a geographic trend in the status of west coast coho salmon
stocks, with the southernmost and easternmost stocks in the worst
condition.

<H3>Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</H3>

<P><STRONG>A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or
Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Logging, agricultural and mining activities, urbanization, stream
channelization, dams, wetland loss, and water withdrawals and
unscreened diversions for irrigation have contributed to the decline of
the Central California coast coho ESU. The following discussion
provides an overview of the types of activities and conditions that
adversely affect coho salmon in central California coast watersheds.

<P>Depletion and storage of natural flows have drastically altered
natural hydrological cycles in many central California rivers and
streams. Alteration of streamflows has increased juvenile salmonid
mortality for a variety of reasons: migration delay resulting from
insufficient flows or habitat blockages; loss of usable habitat due to
dewatering and blockage; stranding of fish resulting from rapid flow
fluctuations; entrainment of juveniles into unscreened or poorly
screened diversions; and increased juvenile mortality resulting from
increased water temperatures. In addition,
reduced flows degrade or diminish fish habitats via increased
deposition of fine sediments in spawning gravels, decreased recruitment
of new spawning gravels, and encroachment of riparian and non-endemic
vegetation into spawning and rearing areas.

<P>Sufficient quantities of good quality water are essential for coho
survival, growth, reproduction, and migration. Important elements of
water quality include water temperatures within the range that
corresponds with migration, rearing and emergence needs of fish and the
aquatic organisms upon which they depend. Desired conditions for coho salmon include an
abundance of cool (generally in the range of 53.3 F to 58.3 F
(11.8  deg.C to 14.6  deg.C), well oxygenated
water that is present year-round, free of excessive suspended sediments
and other pollutants that could limit primary production and benthic
invertebrate abundance and diversity.

<P>Numerous studies have demonstrated that land use activities
associated with logging, road construction, urban development, mining,
agriculture, and recreation have significantly altered coho salmon
habitat quantity and quality. Impacts of concern associated with these
activities include the following: alteration of streambank and channel
morphology, alteration of ambient stream water temperatures,
elimination of spawning and rearing habitat, fragmentation of available
habitats, elimination of downstream recruitment of spawning gravels and
large woody debris, removal of riparian vegetation resulting in
increased stream bank erosion, and degradation of water quality. Of particular concern is
the increased sediment input
into spawning and rearing areas that results from the loss of channel
complexity, pool habitat, suitable gravel substrate, and large woody
debris.

<P>Further, historical practices, such as the use of splash dams, and
widespread removal of beaver dams, log jams and snags from river
channels, have adversely modified fish habitat.

<P>Agricultural practices have also contributed to the degradation of
salmonid habitat on the West Coast through irrigation diversions,
overgrazing in riparian areas, and compaction of soils in upland areas
from livestock. The
vigor, composition and diversity of natural vegetation can be altered
by livestock grazing in and around riparian areas. This in turn can
affect the site's ability to control erosion, provide stability to
stream banks, and provide shade, cover, and nutrients to the stream.
Mechanical compaction can reduce the productivity of the soils
appreciably and cause bank slough and erosion. Mechanical bank damage often leads to
channel
widening, lateral stream migration, and excess sedimentation.

<P>Urbanization has degraded coho salmon habitat through stream
channelization, floodplain drainage, and riparian damage. When watersheds are urbanized,
problems may result simply
because structures are placed in the path of natural runoff processes,
or because the urbanization itself has induced changes in the
hydrologic regime. In almost every point that urbanization activity
touches the watershed, point source and nonpoint pollution occurs.
Water infiltration is reduced due to extensive ground covering. As a
result, runoff from the watershed is flashier, with increased flood
hazard. Flood control and land drainage schemes may
concentrate runoff, resulting in increased bank erosion which causes a
loss of riparian vegetation and undercut banks and eventually causes
widening and down-cutting of the stream channel. Sediments washed from
the urban areas contain trace metals such as copper, cadmium, zinc, and
lead. These, together with pesticides, herbicides,
fertilizers, gasoline, and other petroleum products, contaminate
drainage waters and harm aquatic life necessary for coho salmon
survival. The California State Water Resources Control Board 
reported that nonpoint source pollution is the cause of 50 to 80
percent of impairment to water bodies in California.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or
Education Purposes</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Marine harvest of coho salmon occurs primarily in nearshore waters
off British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Recreational
fishing for coho salmon is pursued in numerous streams throughout the
central California coast when adults return on their fall spawning
migration. There are few good historical accounts of the abundance of
coho salmon harvested along the California coast. Consequently, those early records did
not contain quantitative
data by species until the early 1950s.

<P>Today, coho salmon stocks are managed by NMFS in conjunction with
the PFMC, the states, and certain tribes. The central California coast
falls within the Federal salmon fishery management zone that stretches
from Horse Mountain, just north of Fort Bragg, CA, to the Mexico border. Coho ocean
harvest is managed by
setting escapement goals for Oregon Coastal Natural coho salmon. This
stock aggregate constitutes the largest portion of naturally produced
coho salmon caught in ocean salmon fisheries off California and Oregon. Using this index
may have resulted in pre-1994
exploitation rates higher than central California populations could
sustain. The confounding effects of habitat deterioration, drought, and
poor ocean conditions on coho salmon survival make it difficult to
assess the degree to which recreational and commercial harvest have
contributed to the overall decline of coho salmon in West Coast rivers.

<P>Collection for scientific research and educational programs has had
little or no impact on California coho salmon populations. In
California, most of the scientific collection permits are issued to
environmental consultants, Federal resource agencies, and universities
by the CDFG. Regulation of take is controlled by conditioning
individual permits. The CDFG requires reporting of any coho salmon
taken incidental to other monitoring activities; however, no
comprehensive total or estimate of coho salmon mortalities related to
scientific sampling are kept for any watershed in the State. The CDFG does not believe
that indirect
mortalities associated with scientific use are detrimental to coho
salmon in California.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>C. Disease or Predation</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Relative to effects of fishing, habitat degradation, and hatchery
practices, disease and predation are not believed to be major factors
contributing to the decline of West Coast coho salmon populations.
However, disease and predation may have substantial impacts in local
areas.

<P>Coho salmon are exposed to numerous bacterial, protozoan, viral,
and parasitic organisms in fresh water and marine environments.
Specific diseases such as bacterial kidney disease (BKD),
ceratomyxosis, columnaris, furunculosis, infectious hematopoietic
necrosis, redmouth and black spot disease, Erythrocytic Inclusion Body
Syndrome, whirling disease, and others are present and known to affect
salmon and steelhead. Very little
current or historical information exists to quantify changes in
infection levels and mortality rates attributable to these diseases for
coho salmon. However, studies have shown that native fish tend to be
less susceptible to these pathogens than hatchery-reared fish.

<P>Infectious disease is one of many factors that can influence adult
and juvenile survival. Disease may be
contracted through waterborne pathogens or by interbreeding with
infected hatchery fish. Salmonids typically are infected with several pathogens
during their life cycle; however, a high intensity of infection (number of organisms per
host) and stressful conditions must usually occur
before the host/parasite balance favors the parasite (pathogen) and a
disease state occurs in the fish.

<P>Many natural and hatchery coho populations throughout California's
coast have tested positive for the bacterium, Renibacterium
salmoninarum, the causative agent of BKD. The
overall incidence of BKD measured by direct fluorescent antibody
technique among Scott Creek coho salmon was 100 percent (13/13 fish)
and 95.5 percent (21/22 fish) among San Lorenzo River coho.
Waddell Creek coho salmon are also suspected of having near 100 percent
infection. The CDFG recently initiated a
treatment protocol to attempt to control BKD outbreaks in hatchery fish
released into the Russian River and Scott Creek. The
impacts of this disease are subtle. Juvenile salmonids may survive well
in their journey downstream but may be unable to make appropriate
changes in kidney function for a successful transition to sea water. Stress during
migration may also cause this disease to
come out of remission. Water quantity and quality
during late summer is a critical factor in controlling disease
epidemics. As water quantity and quality diminishes, stress may trigger
the onset of these diseases in fish that are carrying the disease.

<P>Freshwater predation by other salmonids is not believed to be a
major factor contributing to the decline of central California coho
salmon. Avian predators have been shown to impact some juvenile
salmonids in fresh water and near shore environments. Ruggerone 
estimated that ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) consumed 2
percent of the salmon and steelhead trout passing Wanapum Dam, in the
Columbia River, during the spring smolt outmigration in 1982. Wood estimated that the
common merganser (Mergus merganser), a known
freshwater predator of juvenile salmonids, were able to consume 24 to 65 percent of coho
salmon
production in coastal British Columbia streams. Known avian predators
in the nearshore marine environment include herons, cormorants, and
alcids. Cooper and Johnson and Botkin et al.
reported that marine mammal and avian predation may occur on
some local salmonid populations; however, they believed that it was a
minor factor in the decline of coastwide salmonid populations. With the
decrease in quality riverine and estuarine habitats, increased
predation by freshwater, avian, and marine predators will occur. With
the decrease in avoidance habitat (e.g., deep pools and estuaries, and
undercut banks) and adequate migration and rearing flows, predation may
play a small role in the reduction of some localized coho salmon
stocks.
<P>Harbor seal and California sea lion numbers have increased along
the Pacific Coast. At the mouth of the Russian River, Hanson 
reported that the foraging behavior of California sea lions and harbor
seals with respect to anadromous salmonids was minimal. Hanson 
also stated that predation on salmonids appeared to be coincidental
with the salmonid migrations rather than dependent upon them.

<P>Salmonids appear to be a minor component of the diet of marine
mammals.
Principal food sources are small pelagic schooling fish, juvenile
rockfish, lampreys,
benthic and epibenthic species and flatfish.

<P>Predation may significantly influence salmonid abundance in some
local populations when other prey are absent and physical conditions
lead to the concentration of adults and juveniles. Low flow conditions in streams can also
enhance predation
opportunities, particularly in central California streams, where adult
coho may congregate at the mouths of streams waiting for high flows for
access.

<P>Several studies have indicated that piscivorous predators may
control the abundance and survival of salmonids. Holtby et al. 
hypothesized that temperature-mediated arrival and predation by Pacific
hake may be an important source of mortality for coho salmon off the
west coast of Vancouver Island. Beamish et al. documented
predation of hatchery-reared chinook and coho salmon by spiny dogfish
(Squalus acanthias). Pearcy reviewed several studies of
salmonids off the Pacific Northwest coastline and concluded that
salmonid survival was influenced by the factional responses of the
predators to salmonids and alternative prey.

<P>The relative impacts of marine predation on anadromous salmonids
are not well understood, but most investigators believe that marine
predation is a minor factor in coho salmon declines. Predators play an
important role in the ecosystem, culling out unfit individuals, thereby
strengthening the species as a whole. The increased impact of certain
predators has been to a large degree the result of ecosystem
modification. Therefore, it would seem more likely that increased
predation is but a symptom of a much larger problem, namely, habitat
modification and a decrease in water quantity and quality.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>D. Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>A variety of state and Federal regulatory mechanisms exist to
protect coho habitat and address the decline of coho salmon in the
Central California coast ESU, but they have not been adequately
implemented.

<P>The State of California has listed coho as endangered in streams
south of San Francisco pursuant to the State ESA, initiated a recovery
planning effort, and implemented a biological opinion and incidental
take statement to improve the implementation of CFPRs in the range of
the listed streams. In CDFG's comment letter, CDFG
relayed the determination of its Ad-hoc Coho Salmon Advisory Committee
that coho south of Punta Gorda qualify for state listing and
acknowledged that, while state listing (subsequently implemented by the
Fish and Game Commission) did not encompass the entire ESU, it is
essential to manage the ESU as a population unit. While the CDFG may
intend to expand its recovery planning effort to the entire ESU, it
cannot provide the protective measures of the State ESA unless it
expands the current listing to encompass the remainder of the ESU.

<P>The Northwest Forest Plan and its Aquatic Conservation Strategy
provide a mechanism to ensure protection of functional salmonid habitat
on Federal lands. This is accomplished through a set of guidelines and
processes for watershed assessment to determine what forest practices
are acceptable within certain riparian buffer zones. Federal lands
comprise only about 5 percent of the Central California coast coho
salmon ESU, a proportion too small to secure recovery even with the
strictest of Federal forest management practices.

<P>The CFPRs contain provisions that are protective if fully
implemented. For example, provisions for sensitive species designation
allow the Board to adopt special management practices for sensitive
species and their habitat. The Board did not adopt CDFG's proposal to
designate coho salmon as a sensitive species. The current process for
approving Timber Harvest Plans receives inadequate environmental
review, and monitoring of impacts of timber harvest operations is
insufficient to determine whether a particular operation damaged
habitat and, if so, how it might be mitigated. There are also
exceptions to the rules that allow timber harvest to occur without any
requirement for environmental review or monitoring.

<P>The CWA provides for the protection of beneficial uses, including
the protection of fishery resources. However, implementation of this
statute has not been adequate to protect coho habitat. Seven streams or
rivers in central California have been designated as impaired
waterbodies pursuant to Section 303(d). The State Water Quality Control
Board is required to develop and implement water quality standards for
these waterbodies, and, if they do not, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is required to do so. EPA is currently involved in
litigation for its failure to designate water quality criteria for
these water bodies.

<P>While ocean fishing is regulated to reduce impacts on coho, state
sport fishing regulations continue to allow fishing for coho in inland
waters. The contribution of coho salmon to the in-river sport catch is
unknown, and losses due to injury and mortality from incidental capture
in other authorized fisheries, principally steelhead, are also unknown.
Current funding and personnel are not available to implement monitoring
programs to evaluate these impacts.

<P><STRONG>E. Other Natural or Human-made Factors Affecting Its Continued
Existence</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Natural Factors
<UL>
<P>Long-term trends in rainfall and marine productivity associated
with atmospheric conditions in the North Pacific Ocean may have a major
influence on coho salmon production.

<P><STRONG>a. Drought</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Much of the Pacific coast has experienced drought conditions during
the past 8 years, a situation which has undoubtedly contributed to the
decline of many salmonid populations. Drought conditions reduce the
amount of water available, resulting in reductions (or elimination) of
flows needed for adult coho salmon passage, egg incubation, and
juvenile rearing and migration. There are indications in tree ring
records that droughts more severe than the 6-year drought that
California recently experienced occurred in the past (Stine, 1994). The
key to survival in this type of variable and rapidly changing
environment is the evolution of behaviors and life history traits that
allow coho salmon to cope with a variety of environmental conditions.

<P>Populations that are fragmented or reduced in size and range are
more vulnerable to extinction by natural events. Whether recent
climatic conditions represent a long-term change that will continue to
affect salmonid stocks in the future or whether these changes are
short-term environmental fluctuations that can be expected to reverse
in the near future remains unclear. Many of the coho salmon population
declines began prior to these recent drought conditions.
</UL>
<P><STRONGb. Floods</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>With high inherent erosion risk, urban encroachment, and intensive
timber management, flood events can cause major soil loss. As previously mentioned,
sedimentation of stream beds has been implicated as a principal cause
of declining salmonid populations throughout their range. Floods can
result in mass wasting of erodible hillslopes and failure of roads on
unstable slopes causing catastrophic erosion. In addition, flooding can
cause scour and redeposition of spawning gravels in typically
inaccessible areas.

<P>During flood events, land disturbances resulting from logging, road
construction, mining, urbanization, livestock grazing, agriculture,
fire, and other uses may contribute sediment directly to streams or
exacerbate sedimentation from natural erosive processes . Judsen and Ritter, the
California Department of
Water Resources, and the California State Lands
Commission have stated that northwestern and central coastal
California have some of the most erodible terrain in the world. Several
studies have indicated that, in this region, catastrophic erosion and
subsequent stream sedimentation (such as during the 1955 and 1964
floods) resulted from areas which had been clearcut or which had roads
constructed on unstable soils.

<P>As streams and pools fill in with sediment, flood flow capacity is
reduced. Such changes cause decreased stream stability and increased
bank erosion, and subsequently exacerbate existing sedimentation
problems (Lisle, 1982), including sedimentation of spawning gravels and
filling of pools and estuaries. Channel widening and loss of pool-
riffle sequence due to sedimentation has damaged spawning and rearing
habitat of all salmonids. By 1980, the pool-riffle sequence and pool
quality in some California streams still had not fully recovered from
the 1964 regional flood. In fact, Lisle and Weaver and Hagans
found that many Pacific coast streams continue to show signs of
harboring debris flow. Such streams have remained shallow, wide, warm,
and unstable since these floods.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>c. Ocean Conditions</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Large fluctuations in Pacific salmon catch have occurred during the
past century. Annual world harvest of Pacific salmon has varied from
347 million lb (772 million kg) in the 1930s to about 184 million lb
(409 million kg) in 1977 and back to 368 million lb (818 million kg) by
1989. Mechanisms linking atmospheric and
oceanic physics and fish populations have been suggested for Pacific
salmon. Many studies have tried to correlate the production or
marine survival of salmon with environmental factors, and Holtby et
al. have reported associations between salmon survival and sea
surface temperature and salinity, especially during the first few
months that slamonids are at sea. Francis and Sibley, Rogers, and Cooney et al. also found
relationships between
salmon production and sea surface temperature. Some studies have tried
to link salmon production to oceanic and atmospheric climate change.
For example, Beamish and Bouillon and Ward found that
trends in Pacific salmon catches were similar to trends in winter
atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific.

<P>Francis and Sibley and Francis et al. have developed
a model linking decadal-scale atmospheric variability and salmon
production that incorporates hypotheses developed by Hollowed and
Wooster and Wockett, as well as evidence presented in
many other studies. The model developed by Francis et al. describes a time series of
biological and physical variables from the
Northeast Pacific that appear to share decadal-scale patterns.
Biological and physical variables that appear to have undergone shifts
during the late 1970s include the following: abundance of salmon
and other pelagic fish,
cephalopods, and zooplankton; oceanographic
properties such as current transport, sea surface
temperature and upwelling; and atmospheric
phenomena such as atmospheric circulation patterns, sea-surface
pressure patterns, and sea-surface wind-stress.

<P>Finally, Scarnecchia reported that near-shore conditions
during the spring and summer months along the California coast may
dramatically affect year-class strength of salmonids. Bottom et al. believed that coho
salmon along the Oregon and California coasts
may be especially sensitive to upwelling patterns because these regions
lack extensive bays, straits, and estuaries, such as those found along
the Washington, British Columbia, and Alaskan coasts, which could
buffer adverse oceanographic effects. The paucity of high quality near-
shore habitat, coupled with variable ocean conditions, makes freshwater
rearing habitat more crucial for the survival and persistence of many
coho salmon populations.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>El Nino</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>An environmental condition often cited as a cause for the decline
of west coast salmonids is the condition known as ``El Nino.'' El Nino
is a warming of the Pacific Ocean off South America and is caused by
atmospheric changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean (Southern
Oscillation-ENSO). During an El Nino event, a plume of warm sea water
flows from west to east toward South America, eventually reaching the
coast where it is reflected south and north along the continents.

<P>El Nino ocean conditions are characterized by anomalously warm sea
surface temperature and changes in thermal structure, coastal currents,
and upwelling. Principal ecosystem alterations include decreases in primary
and secondary productivity and changes in prey and predator species
distributions. Several El Nino events have been recorded during the
last several decades, including those of 1940-41, 1957-58, 1982-83,
1986-87, 1991-92, and 1993-94. The degree to which adverse ocean
conditions can influence coho salmon production was demonstrated during
the El Nino event of 1982-83, which resulted in a 24 to 27 percent
reduction in fecundity and a 58 percent reduction (based on pre-return
predictions) in survival of adult coho salmon stocks originating from
the Oregon Production Index area (Johnson, 1988).
</UL></UL>
<P><STRONG>b. Manmade Factors</STRONG>
<UL>
<P><STRONG>Artificial Propagation</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>Non-native coho salmon stocks have been introduced as broodstock in
hatcheries and widely transplanted in many coastal rivers and streams
in central California (Bryant, 1994; Weitkamp et al., 1995). Potential
problems associated with hatchery programs include genetic impacts on
indigenous, naturally-reproducing populations (see Waples, 1991),
disease transmission, predation of wild fish, difficulty in determining
wild stock status due to incomplete marking of hatchery fish, depletion
of wild stock to increase brood stock, and replacement rather than
supplementation of wild stocks through competition and continuted
annual introduction of hatchery fish.

<P>While non-native fish have been introduced in the Central
California coast ESU, most hatchery programs are currently being
conducted without inter-ESU import of broodstock. Hatchery fish
releases are conducted based on a determination that the hatchery
stocks are considered similar to the native run. Efforts are made to
return hatchery fish to their natal streams, and they are held for an
acclimation period to increase the probability of imprinting. However,
there are inadequate resources to tag enough (perhaps all) hatchery
coho to monitor return rates and rates of straying.

<center><b></b></center>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Northern fur seals occur from southern California north to the Bering Sea and west to the Okhotsk Sea and Honshu Island, Japan.  During the breeding season, approximately 74% of the worldwide population is found on the Pribilof Islands in the southern Bering Sea, with the remaining animals spread throughout the North Pacific Ocean (Lander and Kajimura 1982).  Of the seals in U.S. waters outside of the Pribilofs, approximately 1% of the population is found on Bogoslof Island in the southern Bering Sea and San Miguel Island off southern California (NMFS 1993).  Fur seals may temporarily haul out onto land at other sites in Alaska, British Columbia, and on islets along the coast of the continental U.S., but generally do so outside of the breeding season (Fiscus 1983).

<P>Adults usually occur on shore during a 6-month period, principally during the reproductive season (June-November), then migrate south and spend the next 6 months at sea.  Adult females and pups from the Pribilof Islands migrate through the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific Ocean, often to the Oregon and California offshore waters.  Pups may remain at sea for 22 months before returning to their rookery of birth.  Adult males generally migrate only as far
south as the Gulf of Alaska (Kajimura 1984).  The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, geographic separation during the breeding season, high natal site fidelity (DeLong 1982); (2) Population response data: substantial differences in population dynamics between Pribilofs and San Miguel Island (DeLong 1982, DeLong and Antonelis 1991, NMFS 1993); (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this information, two separate stocks of northern fur seals are recognized within U.S. waters:  an Eastern Pacific stock and a San Miguel Island stock.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The population estimate for the Eastern Pacific stock of fur seals is calculated as the estimated number of pups at rookeries multiplied by a series of different expansion factors determined from a life table analysis to estimate the number of yearlings, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, and animals at least 4 years old (Lander 1981).  The resulting population estimate is equal to the pup count multiplied by approximately 4.475.  The expansion factors are based on
a sex and age distribution estimated after the harvest of juvenile males was terminated; currently,  CVs are unavailable.  As the great majority of pups are born on the Pribilof Islands, pup estimates are concentrated on these islands, though additional counts are made on Bogoslof Island.  Based on the average mean pup count of 226,613 (CV=0.0593) from 1990 (234,919), 1992 (219,151), and 1994 (225,770) on the Pribilofs and a total population
estimate of 5,173 for Bogoslof Island in 1994 (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115), the most recent estimate for the number of fur seals in the Northern Pacific stock is approximately 1,019,192 (1,014,019+5,173)

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.): NMIN= N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 1,019,192 and the CV (0.0593) associated with the pup counts, NMIN for the Eastern Pacific stock of northern fur seals is 969,595.    Even though CVs are not currently available for the correction factor, the Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that this estimate is such that the true number of animals in the population is very likely  greater, and so would thus serve as an estimate of NMIN (DeMaster 1995: pp. 9).

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The Alaskan population of northern fur seals recovered to approximately 1.25 million in 1974 after the killing of females in the pelagic fur seal harvest was terminated in 1968.  The population then began to decrease with pup production declining at a rate of 6.5-7.8% per year into the 1980s (York 1987); the total stock estimate in 1983 was 877,000 (Briggs and Fowler 1984).  Annual pup production on St. Paul Island has remained relatively stable since 1981 (Fig. 3), indicating that stock size has not changed much in recent years (York and Fowler 1992).  The most recent stock estimates prior to 1994 were 984,000 in 1992, and 1.01 million in 1990 (NMFS 1993).  The northern fur seal was designated as depleted under the MMPA in 1988
because population levels had declined to less than 50% of levels observed in the late 1950s and there was no compelling evidence that carrying capacity (K) had changed substantially since  the late 1950s (NMFS 1993).  Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), this stock will remain listed as depleted until population levels reach at least the lower limit of optimum sustainable population (OSP) (60% of K).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>The northern fur seal population increased steadily during 1912-40 after the commercial harvest no longer included pregnant females.  During this period, the rate of population growth was approximately 8.6% (SE=1.47) per year (York, unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115), the maximum recorded for this species.  Given the extremely low density of the population in the early 1900s, this rate of increase is considered a reliable estimate of RMAX.

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized MMPA, the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for depleted stocks under the MMPA (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for the Eastern Pacific stock of northern fur seals, PBR = (969,595 x 0.043 x 0.5), or 20,846 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>The NMFS estimate of the total number of northern fur seals killed incidental to both the foreign and joint U.S.-foreign commercial groundfish trawl fisheries in the North Pacific from 1978 to 1988 was 246 (95% Confidence Interval: 68 - 567), which results in an estimated mean annual rate of 22 fur seals.  High seas driftnet fisheries are no longer operative, thus information from those fisheries were not included in the calculations of incidental mortality
rates.

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries during 1990-93 that could have interacted with northern fur seals:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries, and Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which observed incidental mortality occurred was the Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, with a mean annual (total) mortality of 2.4 (CV=0.54).  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0129 (CV=0.25).

<P>An additional source of information on the number of northern fur seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, included an annual mean of 18 injured and 2 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 18 injured and 2 mortalities due to illegal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  The great majority of the logbook incidental take occurred in the Bristol Bay salmon drift gillnet fishery.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (6.4; based on observer data (2.4) and logbook reports (4) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (2,085) and, therefore, is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Alaskan natives residing on the Pribilof Islands are allowed an annual subsistence harvest of northern fur seals, with a take range determined from annual household surveys.  During 1985 to 1993 the annual subsistence harvest level averaged 1,622 and 200 for St. Paul and St. George Islands, respectively.  The subsistence harvest in 1994 was 1,616 and 161 on St. Paul and St. George, respectively, for a total of 1,777.  Only juvenile males are taken in the subsistence harvest, which likely results in a much smaller impact on population growth than a harvest of equal proportions of males and females. Subsistence take in areas other than the Pribilof Islands is not unknown, but believed to be minimal (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

The estimated annual level of total human-caused mortality and serious injury (6+1,777 = 1,783) does not exceed the PBR (20,846) for this stock.  The Eastern Pacific stock of the northern fur seal is classified as a strategic stock because it is designated as depleted under the MMPA.

<h3>Dall's Porpoise (<EM>Phocoenoides dalli</EM>): Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Dall's porpoise are widely distributed across the entire North Pacific Ocean.  They are found over the continental shelf adjacent to the slope and over deep (2,500+ m) oceanic waters (Hall
1979).  They have been sighted throughout the North Pacific as far north as 65N (Buckland et
al. 1993), and as far south as 28N in the eastern North Pacific (Leatherwood and Fielding
1974).  The only apparent distribution gaps in Alaskan waters are upper Cook Inlet and the
shallow eastern flats of the Bering Sea.  Throughout most of the eastern North Pacific they are
present during all months of the year, although there may be seasonal onshore-offshore
movements along the West Coast of the U.S. (Loeb 1972, Leatherwood and Fielding 1974),
and winter movements of populations out of Prince William Sound (Hall 1979) and areas in
the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal
Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et
al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution
continuous, (2) Population response data: differential timing of reproduction between the
Bering Sea and western North Pacific; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data:
unknown.  The stock structure of eastern North Pacific Dall's porpoise is not adequately
understood at this time, but based on patterns of stock differentiation in the western North
Pacific, where they have been more intensively studied, it is expected that separate stocks will emerge when data become available (Perrin and Brownell 1994).   Based primarily on the
population response data, a delineation between Bering Sea and western North Pacific stocks
has been recognized (Jones et al. 1986).  However, similar data are not available for the
eastern North Pacific, thus one stock of Dall's porpoise is recommended for Alaskan waters. 
Porpoise along the coast of the continental U.S. from California to Washington comprise a
separate stock and are reported separately in the Status Assessment Reports for the Pacific
Region. 

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Data collected from vessel surveys, performed by both U.S. fishery observers and U.S.
scientists from 1987-91, were analyzed to provide population estimates of Dall's porpoise
throughout the North Pacific and the Bering Sea (Hobbs and Lerczak 1993).  The quality of
data used in analyses was determined by the procedures recommended by Boucher and Boaz
(1989).  Survey effort was not well distributed throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) in Alaska, and as a result, Bristol Bay and the north Bering Sea received little survey
effort.  Only 3 sightings were reported in this area by Hobbs and Lerczak (1993), resulting in
an estimate of 9,000 (CV=0.91).  In the U.S. EEZ north and south of the Aleutian Islands,
Hobbs and Lerczak (1993) reported an estimated abundance of 302,000 (CV=0.11), whereas
for the Gulf of Alaska EEZ, they reported 106,000 (CV=0.20) .  Combining these three
estimates results in an abundance estimate of 417,000 (9,000 + 302,000 + 106,000)
(CV=0.0970) for the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise.  Turnock and Quinn (1991) estimate that abundance estimates of Dall's porpoise are inflated by as much as 5 times because of vessel attraction behavior.  Therefore, a corrected population estimate is 83,400 (417,000 x 0.2) for this stock.  No reliable abundance estimates for British Columbia are currently available.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 83,400 and its associated CV of 0.0970, NMIN for the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise is 76,874.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, there is no reliable information on trends in abundance for the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>Until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  As this stock is considered to be within optimum sustainable population (OSP) (Buckland et al. 1993), the recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.00 (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for this stock of Dall's porpoise, PBR = (76,874 x 0.02 x 1.00), or 1,537 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries within the range of the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise during 1990-93: Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries, and Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The mean annual (total) mortality was 5 (CV=0.18) for the Bering Sea groundfish trawl fishery, and 1 (CV=0.54) for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl fishery.  No Dall's
porpoise mortality was observed by NMFS observers in the remaining 4 fisheries.  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught), observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed), and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was also estimated for those fisheries where incidental mortality occurred - Bering Sea groundfish trawl: effort=1.84 million tons, observer coverage=64%, and catch rate=0.0279 (CV=0.18); Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl: effort=212,000 tons, observer coverage=42%, and catch rate=0.0282 (CV=0.76).  The Prince William Sound driftnet fishery was monitored by observers during 1990 (Wynne et al. 1991) and 1991 (Wynne et al. 1992), with no incidental kill of Dall's porpoise reported.  The Alaska Peninsula salmon driftnet fishery was monitored in 1990, with a reported annual (total) incidental mortality rate of 28 Dall's porpoise (K. Wynne unpubl. data, Univ. AK, 900 Trident Way, Kodiak, AK 99615). 

<P>An additional source of information on the number of Dall's porpoise killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated an annual mean of 1 injury and 6 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 0 injuries and 0.7 mortalities due to illegal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  These estimates are based on all available logbook reports for Alaska fisheries, except for which observer data were presented above.  The fishery for which the majority of the incidental take occurred was the Southeast Alaska salmon drift gillnet fishery.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (41; based on observer data (34; 5 + 1 + 28) and logbook reports (7) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (154) and, therefore, is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate. 

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>No harvest of Dall's porpoise for subsistence purposes is known.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (41) does not exceed the PBR (1,537), thus the Alaska stock of Dall's porpoise is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Harbor Porpoise (<EM>Phocoena phocoena</EM>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, the harbor porpoise ranges from Point Barrow, along the Alaskan coast, and down the West Coast of North America to southern California (Gaskin 1984).   The harbor porpoise is basically an inshore species, frequenting coastal waters and the mouths of large rivers, harbors, and bays, sometimes ascending freshwater streams.  Relatively high densities of harbor porpoise have been recorded along the coasts of Washington, and Northern Oregon and California; yet, distinct seasonal changes in abundance in these areas have been noted, possibly due to a shift in distribution to deeper offshore waters during winter (Barlow 1987, Dohl et al. 1983).  Research to examine the genetic structure of harbor porpoise in the northeast Pacific was conducted in 1991-93 using mitochondrial DNA. Preliminary results showed that all 9 samples from Alaska waters fell within one of two major clades found among all northeast Pacific samples (Rosel et al. in press). However, the study was not designed to
investigate the genetic structure of harbor porpoise within Alaska, and therefore it is not possible to draw conclusions about stock structure in Alaska from this analysis. Additional Alaska samples are currently being analyzed.  For the eastern North Pacific, Gaskin (1984) proposed two putative stocks: Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, but this recommendation was based primarily on habitat differences between the two areas, and the Alaska Peninsula as a geographic barrier. Thus, until further research is conducted, a single stock is defined for Alaska waters, which is distinct from the stocks defined along the Pacific coast of the continental U.S.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The first systematic surveys of harbor porpoise in Alaska were conducted in 1991 (Dahlheim et al. 1992), 1992 (Dahlheim et al. 1993), and 1993 (Dahlheim et al. 1994).  Three vessel surveys in the spring, summer, and fall of each year were performed in the inside waters of Southeast Alaska, with abundance estimates relatively similar in each year.  Aerial surveys were conducted in different regions outside of Southeast Alaska for each of the 3 years.  The abundance estimate from the 1993 vessel survey and all aerial surveys was 10,526 (1,586 + 8,940) harbor porpoise (Table 1).

<P>Dahlheim et al. in prep).  The 1993 vessel survey was used because it was conducted within a few weeks of the Southeast Alaska aerial survey.  Correction factors for aerial surveys of harbor porpoise have been estimated at 3.1 (CV=0.171) (Calambokidis et al. 1993) from Puget Sound, Washington, and 3.2 (Barlow 1988) from the continental West Coast of the U.S.  Both estimates are considered conservative for the Alaskan surveys based on differences in survey conditions; the 3.1 estimate was employed.  Correction factors for vessel surveys along the continental U.S. was estimated at 1.28 (SE=0.117) by Barlow (1988), and 1.9 (CV=0.142) from vessel surveys in the Gulf of Maine (Palka, pers. comm., Northeast Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 314, Woods, Hole, MA 02543).  The estimate from the Pacific surveys is more applicable to the Alaskan surveys, and more conservative, thus it was employed.  The total corrected abundance estimate from aerial surveys of 27,714 (8,940 x 3.1) (CV=0.215) plus the corrected
abundance estimate from vessel surveys of 2,030 (1,586 x 1.28) (CV=0.404) equals a total corrected abundance estimate of 29,744.  This should be considered a minimum estimate because survey effort did not include the Aleutian Islands and the Bering Sea.  No reliable abundance estimates for British Columbia are currently available.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>For the Alaska stock of harbor porpoise, the minimum population estimates (NMIN)for the aerial and vessel surveys are calculated separately, using equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimates (N) of 27,714 and 2,030 and their associated CVs (0.215 and 0.404, respectively), NMIN for this stock is 24,635.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, there is no reliable information on trends in abundance for the Alaska stock of harbor porpoise.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) is not currently available for this stock of harbor porpoise.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate of 4% be employed (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for the Alaska stock of harbor porpoise, PBR = (24,635 x 0.02 x 0.5), or 246 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries within the range of the Alaska stock of harbor porpoise during 1990-93: Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries, and Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  No incidental mortality was observed in these fisheries, though 1 mortality and 1 injury was reported in logbook records during 1990 (see below).  NMFS fishery observers in the
Prince William Sound salmon drift gillnet fishery recorded 1 incidental take in 1990, and 3 incidental kills in 1991.  Incidental mortality occurred in fewer than 0.03% of observed sets for both years.  Extrapolated to the entire fleet, the estimated annual mortality was 7.5 (95% CI 0-22.1) in 1990 (Wynne et al. 1991), and 32.1 (95% CI 3-103) in 1991 (Wynne et al. 1992), for an average annual rate of 20 for both years.  NMFS observers have not participated in
this fishery since 1991; therefore, no additional data are available.

<P>An additional source of information on the number of harbor porpoise killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated an annual mean of 5 injuries and 12 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional
1 injury and 0.7 mortalities due to illegal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  These estimates are based on all available logbook reports, except the Prince William Sound gillnet fishery for which observer data were presented above.  The fisheries for which the majority of the incidental take occurred were the salmon gillnet fisheries in Southeast Alaska, Copper and Bering River district, Kodiak, and Alaska Peninsula.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (33; based on observer data (20) and logbook reports (13) where observer data were not available) is greater than 10% of the PBR (25) and, therefore, can not be considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>There are no reports of subsistence take of harbor porpoise in Alaska.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The lack of surveys in a significant portion of this stock's range results in a conservative PBR, and logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994) resulting in an underestimate of incidental kill.  Yet, based on the best scientific information available, the estimated level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (33) does not exceed the PBR (246), thus the Alaska stock or harbor porpoise is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Steller Sea Lion (<em>Eumetopias jubatus</em>):  Western U.S. Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.

<P><b>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</b>

<p>Steller sea lions range along the North Pacific Ocean rim from northern Japan to California (Loughlin et al. 1984),
with centers of abundance and distribution in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, respectively.  The species is
not known to migrate, but individuals disperse widely outside of the breeding season (late May-early July), thus
potentially intermixing with animals from other areas.  Loughlin (1994) considered the following information when
classifying stock structure based on the phylogeographic approach of Dizon et al. (1992):  (1) Distributional data:
geographic distribution continuous, yet a high degree of natal site fidelity and low (&lt;10%) exchange rate of breeding
animals between rookeries; (2) Population response data: substantial differences in population dynamics (Merrick and
York 1993); (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: substantial differences in mitochondrial DNA
(Bickham et al. in press).  Based on this information, two separate stocks of Steller sea lions are now recognized
within U.S. waters:  an Eastern stock, which includes animals east of Cape Suckling, Alaska (144W), and a Western
U.S. stock, which includes animals at and west of Cape Suckling.

<p><b>POPULATION SIZE</b><p>

	The most recent estimate of Steller sea lion abundance in Alaska is based on aerial surveys performed in June 1994
from Southeast Alaska to the western Aleutian Islands.  The data from these surveys represent actual counts of
nonpups at 95 'trend sites', where sea lions have been monitored since the 1970s, and a few additional sites.  Aerial
and ship-based surveys of Steller sea lions conducted at these same trend sites during June and July 1992 resulted in
coefficients of variation (CV) in counts from 0.025 to 0.12 for 7 distinct subareas of Alaska, with an overall CV of
0.0184 (Sease et al. 1993).  An indication of variance for the 1994 survey is represented by the difference of 5%
between the minimum count vs. the mean counts.  The methodology established from the 1989 rangewide survey
(Loughlin et al. 1992) produced a correction factor of 1.331 to be multiplied by the nonpup count to estimate total
nonpup abundance, and recommended dividing the nonpup count by 2.63 to estimate the number of pups.  Using
these correction factors and the 1994 counts for the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and the Bering Sea resulted in
an estimate of 33,600 nonpups and 9,600 pups, for a total abundance estimate of 43,200 Steller sea lions in the
Western U.S. stock (Table 1) (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way,
NE, Seattle, WA 98115).<p>

<p><b>Minimum Population Estimate</b><p>

	For the Western U.S. stock of Steller sea lions, the minimum population estimate (N<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>MIN</FONT></SUB>) is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep): N<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>MIN</FONT></SUB> = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT></SUPER>)]<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-2>1/2</FONT></SUPER>).  Using the population estimate (N) of 43,200 and an associated CV of 0.0184, N<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>MIN</FONT></SUB> for the Western U.S. stock is 42,536.  Even though CVs are not currently available for the correction factors, this estimate of N<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>MIN</FONT></SUB> is such that the true number of animals in the population is very likely to be greater than N<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>MIN</FONT></SUB> .  This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 10). <p>

<p><b>Current Population Trend</b>

<p>The first reported trend counts (an index to
examine population trends) of Steller sea
lions in Alaska were made in 1956-60
which indicated that there were at least
140,000 (no correction factors applied) sea
lions in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian
Islands (Merrick et al. 1987).  Subsequent
surveys indicated a major population
decrease, first detected in the eastern
Aleutian Islands in the mid-1970s (Braham
et al. 1980).  The decline appears to have
spread eastward to the Kodiak Island area
during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and
then westward to the central and western
Aleutian Islands during the early and mid-1980s (Merrick et al. 1987, Byrd 1989). 
The greatest declines occurred in the
eastern Aleutian Islands and western Gulf of
Alaska, but declines also occurred in the
central Gulf of Alaska and central Aleutian
Islands.  Counts from 1976 to 1979
indicated about 104,000 sea lions (no correction factors applied) (NMFS 1992).  Most recently, Steller sea lions in
the Western U.S. stock decreased 37.4% from 1989 to 1994 (NMFS unpubl. data).  Population estimates (correction
factors applied) for the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and the Bering Sea are given in Table 1, and are compared
to the Eastern stock in Figure 1.<p>

<p>

<b>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</b><p>

	There are no reliable estimates of maximum net productivity rates for this Steller sea lion.  Hence, until additional
data become available, it is recommended that the theoretical maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) for pinnipeds of
12% be employed for this (NMFS in prep).<p>

<p>

<b>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</b><p>

	Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is
defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate,
and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.3, a value half-way
between the default values for threatened (0.5) and endangered (0.1) stocks (DeMaster 1995: pp. 11), and is
supported by the population decline of 37% over the last 5 years and with the current reevaluation of this species
under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (NMFS in prep).  Thus, for the Western U.S. stock of Steller sea lions,
PBR = (42,536 x 0.06 x 0.3), or 766 animals.<p>

<p>

<b>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</b><p>

<p>

<b>Fisheries Information</b><p>

	NMFS observers monitored incidental take on six different fisheries within the range of the Western U.S. stock of
Steller sea lions during 1990-93: Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries, and
Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The mean annual (total) mortality was 15 (CV=0.12)
for the Bering Sea groundfish trawl fishery, 2 (CV=0.44) for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl fishery, and 2
(CV=0.93) for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish longline fishery.  No sea lion mortality was observed by NMFS
observers in the remaining three fisheries.  Fishing effort (based on total tons of fish caught), observer coverage
(defined as the percentage of effort observed), and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in
the catch divided by the observed effort (metric tons) multiplied by 10-4) were also estimated for those fisheries where
incidental mortality occurred: Bering Sea groundfish trawl: effort=1.84 million tons, observer coverage=64%, and
catch rate=0.0793 (CV=0.12);  Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl: <p>

<p>

effort=212,000 tons, observer coverage=42%, and catch rate=0.0845 (CV=0.44); and Gulf of Alaska groundfish
longline: effort=11,000 tons, observer coverage=13%, and catch rate=1.7415 (CV=0.93).  <p>

	Observers also monitored the Prince William Sound driftnet fishery in 1991 and 1992, recording 2 mortalities in
1991, extrapolated to 28.7 (95% CI 1-108) kills for the entire fishery (Wynne et al. 1992).  No mortalities were
observed during 1990 for this fishery (Wynne et al. 1991), resulting in a mean kill rate of 14.4 animals per year for
1990 and 1991.  In 1990, observers boarded 300 (57.3%) of the 524 vessels that fished in the Prince William Sound
driftnet fishery, monitoring a total of 3,090 sets, or 3.9% of the estimated number of sets made by the fleet after 1
July when observers were fully deployed.  The South Unimak driftnet fishery was monitored in 1990 (but not 1991),
and observers boarded 59 (38.3%) of 154 vessels, monitoring a total of 373 or 4.1% of the sets.  In 1991, 5.04% of
116,674 sets were observed in Prince William Sound districts.  Based on the observed mortalities in 1991, the
estimated mortality rate of Steller sea lions was 0.0002 deaths per set.  Combining the estimates from the Bering Sea
and Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl and longline fisheries present above (15+2+2=19) with the estimate from the
Prince William sound driftnet fishery (14.4) results in an estimated annual observed incidental kill rate of 33.4 sea
lions per year.<p>

	An additional source of information on the number of Steller sea lions killed or injured incidental to commercial
fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the MMPA interim exemption
program.  During the 3-year period between 1990 and1992, logbook reports included an annual mean of 8 injuries
and 2 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 4 injuries and 2 mortalities due to illegal
deterrence.  Incidental takes of additional sea lions were reported in the Gulf of Alaska fisheries, yet were listed as
"unknown species", indicating the animals could have been either a Steller sea lion or a California Sea lion.  Based
on all logbook reports for both species within the Gulf, California sea lions represented only 2.2% of all interactions. 
Thus, the reports of injured and killed "unknown" sea lions were considered to be Steller sea lions:  1 injured and 1
killed due to gear interaction, 1 injured and 3 killed due to illegal deterrence annually from 1990 to 1992.  The total
annual incidental take reported from logbook records during 1990-1992 is therefore estimated at 9 injured and 3 killed
from gear interactions, and 5 injured and 5 killed from illegal deterrence.  These totals are based on all available
logbook reports for Alaska fisheries, except the groundfish trawl fisheries in the Bering sea, Aleutian Islands, and
Gulf of Alaska, for which observer data were presented above.  The fisheries for which the majority of the incidental
take occurred in the Gulf of Alaska were the Copper River salmon drift gillnet and the Alaska Peninsula salmon set
gillnet.  In the Bering Sea, the fishery for which the majority of the incidental take occurred was in the Bristol Bay
salmon drift gillnet fishery.<p>

	The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is 41 sea lions per year, based on observer data (33)
and logbook data (8) where observer data were not available.  At present, annual mortality levels less than 77 animals
per year (i.e., 10% of PBR) can be considered insignificant.  However, because logbook records are most likely
negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), and the 1992 Recovery Plan (NMFS 1992) recommendation that immediate
actions be taken to reduce human-caused mortality to the "lowest level practicable" to safeguard against further
population declines, the current annual level of incidental mortality is not considered insignificant.<p>

<p>

<b>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</b><p>

	The 1992 and 1993 subsistence harvest of Steller sea lions in Alaska was estimated by the Alaska Department of Fish
and Game, under contract with the NMFS (Wolfe and Mishler 1993, Wolfe and Mishler 1994).  In both years, data
were collected through systematic interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals in approximately 2,100
households in about 60 coastal communities within the geographic range of the Steller sea lion in Alaska; interviews
were conducted in approximately 45 communities in the range of the Western U.S. stock.  The great majority (99%)
of the statewide subsistence take was from the Western U.S. stock in both 1992 and 1993: harvest, 541 (95% CI 452-711) and 486 (95% CI 391-630); struck and lost, 178 (32.9%) and 138 (28.4%).  In both years, the majority (79%) of
sea lions were taken by Aleut hunters in the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands.  The mean annual subsistence take for this
stock during 1992 and 1993 was 514 sea lions.  The age-specific kill of the harvest for both years was approximately
29% adults, 61% juveniles, 7% pups, and 3% of unknown age; sex-specific kill was approximately 62% males, 16%
females, and 22% of unknown sex.<p>

<p>

<b>Other Mortality</b><p>

	Shooting of sea lions by commercial fishers was thought to be a potentially significant source of mortality prior to the
listing of sea lions as threatened under the ESA in 1990, which made such shooting illegal (note: recent regulations
implemented under the authority of the MMPA prohibit commercial fishers from shooting at any marine mammals).<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>STATUS OF STOCK</b><p>

	The estimated annual level of total human-caused mortality and serious injury  (41+514=555) does not exceed the
PBR (766) for this stock.  The Steller sea lion is currently listed as threatened under the ESA, but is under
consideration for endangered status.  Thus, the Western U.S. stock of Steller sea lions is classified as a strategic
stock.  A summary of management actions recently implemented include no-entry buffer zones around rookeries,
prohibition of groundfish trawling within 10-20 nautical miles of certain rookeries, and spatial and temporal allocation
of Gulf of Alaska pollock total allowable catch.<p>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>
<P>Steller sea lions range along the North Pacific Ocean rim from northern Japan to California (Loughlin et al. 1984), with centers of abundance and distribution in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, respectively.  The species is not known to migrate, but individuals disperse widely outside of the breeding season (late May-early July), thus potentially intermixing with animals from other areas.  Loughlin (1994) considered the following information when classifying stock structure based on the phylogeographic approach of Dizon et al. (1992):  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, yet a high degree of natal site fidelity and low (&lt;10%) exchange rate of breeding animals between rookeries; (2) Population response data: substantial differences in population dynamics (Merrick and York 1993); (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: substantial differences in mitochondrial DNA
(Bickham et al. in press).  Based on this information, two separate stocks of Steller sea lions are now recognized within U.S. waters:  an Eastern stock, which includes animals east of Cape Suckling, Alaska (144W), and a Western U.S. stock, which includes animals at and west of Cape Suckling.  Steller sea lions in Canada are considered part of the Eastern stock, but based on the advice of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 11), the Canadian animals were not incorporated into the minimum abundance estimate.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The most recent estimate of Steller sea lion abundance in Southeast Alaska is based on aerial surveys performed in June 1994 (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).  The data from these surveys represent actual counts of nonpups at 'trend sites', where sea lions have been monitored since the 1970s, and a few additional sites.  Aerial and ship-based surveys of Steller sea lions conducted at these same trend sites during June and July 1992 resulted in coefficients of variation (CV) in counts from 0.025 to 0.12 for 7 distinct subareas of Alaska, with an overall CV of 0.0184 (Sease et al. 1993).  Counts in California were conducted in 1989 (Loughlin et al. 1992) and 1990-92 (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115), and in 1992 in Oregon (Brown and Riemer 1992); no comparable data are available for Washington State because no sea lion rookeries exist there.  The methodology established from
the 1989 rangewide survey (Loughlin et al. 1992) produced a correction factor of 1.331 to be multiplied by the nonpup count to estimate total nonpup abundance, and recommended dividing the nonpup count by 2.63 to estimate the number of pups.  Using these correction factors and the 1994 counts for Southeast Alaska, California, and Oregon resulted in an estimate of 18,600 nonpups and 5,300 pups, for a total abundance estimate of 23,900 Steller sea lions in
the Eastern stock (Table 1)

<P>Aerial surveys in British Columbia during 1994 produced counts of 8,091 nonpups, and 1,186 pups (P. Olesiuk, pers. comm., Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo, BC V9R 5K6).  If the same correction factors are applied to the nonpup count only, the estimated population of Steller sea lions in British Columbia is 13,846 (8,091 x 1.331 + 8,091/2.63) animals.  Because Steller sea lions are considered nonmigratory, the population estimate for Canada is not included in
the minimum population estimate for this stock (see NMFS in prep., DeMaster 1995: pp. 12)

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>For the Eastern  stock of Steller sea lions, the minimum population estimate (NMIN) is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.): NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 23,900 and an associated CV of 0.0184, NMIN for the Eastern stock is 23,533.  Even though CVs are not currently available for the correction factors, the Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that this estimate is such that the true number of animals in the population is very likely greater, and so would thus serve as an estimate of NMIN (DeMaster 1995: pp. 10-11).<p>

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Trend counts (an index to examine population trends) for Steller sea lions in Oregon were relatively stable in the 1980s at about 2,000-3,000 sea lions (no correction factors applied) (NMFS 1992).  Counts in Oregon have shown a gradual increase since 1976, as the adult and juvenile count for that year was 1,486 compared to 3,522 for 1994 (Brown and
Riemer 1992).  This increase is likely due to a recovery from reduced numbers caused by mortality prior to 1972, as immigration from other areas has not been documented (R. Brown, pers. comm., Oregon Dept. Fish &amp; Wildlife, 2040 SE Marine Science Dr., Newport, OR 97365).  Counts in California declined by over 50% from 5,000 to7,000 between 1927 and 1947 to 2,000 to 2,500 between 1980 and 1990; limited information suggests that counts in northern California have increased from the late 1970s to the early 1990s (R. Brown unpubl. data, Oregon Dept. Fish
&amp; Wildlife, 2040 SE Marine Science Dr., Newport, OR 97365).  At Ano Nuevo, California, a steady decline in ground counts started around 1970, resulting in a 85% reduction in the breeding population by 1987 (LeBoeuf et al. 1991).  In recent vertical aerial photographic counts, from 1990 to 1993, pups declined at a rate of 9.9%, while non-pups declined at a rate of 31.5% (Westlake et al. in review).  Most recently, population estimates (correction factors applied) for Steller sea lions in the Eastern stock increased 5.8% from 1989 (22,600) to 1994 (23,900) (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).  Population estimates for Oregon and California and Southeast Alaska are given in Table 1 and are compared to the Western U.S. stock in Figure 1.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>There are no reliable estimates of maximum net productivity rates for this Steller sea lion stock.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The default recovery factor (FR) for stocks listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is 0.5 (NMFS in prep.).  However, as total population estimates for the Eastern stock
have remained stable or increased over the last 20 years, the recovery factor is set at 0.75; midway between 0.5 (recovery factor for a threatened stock) and 1.0 (recovery factor for a stock within its optimal sustainable population (OSP) level).  This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 11).  Thus, for the Eastern stock of Steller sea lions, PBR = (23,533 x 0.06 x 0.75), or 1,059 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>One Steller sea lion mortality incidental to the California shark/swordfish driftnet fishery was observed in 1992, which resulted in an extrapolated estimated total kill of 8 animals (SE=7) per year (Julian 1993).  The only available measure of effort was the number of fishing days, thus kill per unit of effort was estimated at 1.681 x 10-3 animals killed per day.  There were 4,504 effort days for 1992, and an overall observer coverage rate of 13%, yet some areas had coverage rates less than 8%.  No other observed mortality incidental to commercial fisheries was reported.  Averaging the 1992 incidental take data over the most recent 4-year period between 1990-93 results in an estimated observed annual incidental kill rate of 2 sea lions per year.  No mortalities were reported by NMFS observers monitoring drift and set
gillnet fisheries in Washington and Oregon in the last 5 years; however, mortalities have been reported previously.  However, a sea lion tagged at Rogue Reef, Oregon, drowned in a salmon gillnet near Petersburg, Alaska (R. Brown, pers. comm., Oregon Dept. Fish &amp; Wildlife, 2040 SE Marine Science Dr., Newport, OR 97365).

<P>An additional source of information on the number of Steller sea lions killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, included an annual mean of 0 injuries and 1 mortality from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 1 injury and 1 mortality due to illegal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  The Southeast Alaska salmon drift gillnet was the only fishery for which logbook records indicated injury or mortality of sea lions.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (4.0; based on observer data (2) and logbook reports (2) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (106).   Therefore, the current annual level of incidental mortality is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The 1992 and 1993 subsistence harvest of Steller sea lions in Alaska was estimated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, under contract with the NMFS (Wolfe and Mishler 1993, Wolfe and Mishler 1994).  In both years, data were collected through systematic interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals in approximately 2,100 households in about 60 coastal communities within the geographic range of the Steller sea lion in Alaska; interviews were conducted in 18 communities in the range of the Eastern stock.  Only a very small percentage (1%) of the statewide subsistence take was from the Eastern stock, with 5 sea lions harvested in 1992, and 1 sea lion in 1993; 1 animal was struck and lost each year.  Thus, the mean annual subsistence take for this stock during 1992 and 1993 was 4.0 sea lions

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Shooting of sea lions by commercial fishers was thought to be a potentially significant source of mortality prior to the listing of sea lions as threatened under the ESA in 1990, which made such shooting illegal (note: recent regulations implemented under the authority of the MMPA prohibit commercial fishers from shooting at any marine mammals).

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual level of total human-caused mortality and serious injury (4+4=8) does not exceed the PBR (1,059) for this stock.  The Steller sea lion is currently listed as threatened under the ESA but is under consideration for endangered status.  Thus, the Eastern stock of Steller sea lions is classified as a strategic stock.  However, due to the recent classification of two stocks, the status of the Eastern stock will likely be re-evaluated.

<h3>Bowhead Whale (<EM>Balaena mysticetus</EM>):  Western Arctic Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Bowhead whales are distributed in seasonally ice-covered waters of the Arctic and near-Arctic, generally north of 54°N and south of 75°N in the western Arctic Basin (Moore and Reeves 1993).  Small stocks occur in the Sea of Okhotsk, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, and Spitsbergen, but onlya few tens to a few hundreds are found in each of these stocks (Zeh et al. 1994).  The largest remnant population is the Western Arctic stock which migrates from wintering areas (November to March) in the northern Bering Sea, through the Chukchi Sea in the spring (March through June), to the Beaufort Sea where they spend much of the summer (mid-May  through September) before returning to the Bering Sea in the autumn (September through November) (Braham et al. 1980; Moore and Reeves 1993).  The bowhead spring migration follows fractures in the sea ice around the coast of Alaska, generally in the shear zone between the shorefast ice and the mobile polar pack ice.  There is evidence of whales following each other, even when their route does not take advantage of large ice-free areas, such as polynya (Rugh and Cubbage 1980).  As the whales travel east past Point Barrow, their migration is somewhat funneled between shore and the polar pack ice, making for an optimal location from which to study this stock (Krogman 1980).  Most of the year, bowhead whales are closely associated with sea ice.  Only during the summer is this population in relatively ice-free waters in the southern Beaufort Sea, an area often exposed to industrial activity related to petroleum exploration (Richardson et al. 1985).

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>All stocks of bowhead whales were severely depleted during intense commercial whaling prior to
the 20th Century, starting in the early 16th Century near Labrador and spreading to the Bering Sea in the mid-19th Century (Woodby and Botkin 1993).  These authors summarized previous efforts to approximate how many bowheads there were prior to commercial whaling.  They reported a minimum worldwide population estimate of 50,000, with 10,400-23,000 in the Western Arctic
stock (dropping to less than 3,000 at the end of commercial whaling). 

<P>Since 1978, counts of bowhead whales have been conducted from sites on sea ice north of Point
Barrow, Alaska, during the whales' spring migration (Krogman et al. 1989).  These counts have
been corrected for whales missed due to distance offshore (through acoustical locators,  described in Clark et al. 1994), whales missed when no watch was in effect (based on sighting rates), and whales missed during a watch (estimated as a function of visibility, number of observers, and distance offshore) (Zeh et al. 1994).  However, in some years a small proportion of the population may not migrate past Barrow in spring, therefore the estimate could be negatively biased.  In 1993, unusually good counting conditions resulted in what is considered to be the most accurate population estimate to date for this stock: 8,000 (CV = 0.0730), with a 95% confidence interval from 6,900 to 9,200 (Zeh et al. 1994).  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the
PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 8,000 and its associated CV of 0.073, NMIN for the Western Arctic stock of bowhead whales is 7,524.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The Western Arctic stock of bowhead whales increased at a rate of 3.1% (95% CI = 1.4-4.7%)
from 1978 to 1993, when abundance increased from approximately 5,000 to 8,000 whales (Raftery et al. 1994) .  This rate of increase takes into account whales that passed beyond the viewing range of the ice-based observers.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>The current estimate for the rate of increase for this stock of bowhead whales (3.1%) should not be used as an estimate of (RMAX) because the population is currently being harvested and because the population has recovered to population levels where the growth is expected to be significantly less than RMAX.  Thus, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for the Western Arctic stock of bowhead whale (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological
removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the
maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR. 
The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5 rather than the default value of 0.1 for endangered species because population levels are increasing in the presence of a known take (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, PBR = (7,524 x 0.02 x 0.5), or 75 animals.  The IWC independently established a quota for the number of bowhead whales , such that the number of whales struck can not exceed 68 in 1995, 67 in 1996, 66 in 1997, and 65 in 1998, which takes precedence over the PBR estimate for the purpose of managing the Alaska native subsistence harvest.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>Rare cases of rope or net entanglement have been reported from whales taken in the subsistence hunt (Philo et al. 1993), but this species' association with sea ice limits the amount of fisheries activity in bowhead habitat.  Thus, there are no recent records of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries.  At present, annual mortality levels less than 7.5 animals per year (i.e. 10% of PBR) are considered insignificant.  Therefore, the estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (0.0; based on observer data and logbook reports) is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Eskimos have been taking bowhead whales for at least 2000 years  (Stoker and Krupnik 1993). 
Subsistence takes have been under a quota system under the authority of the International Whaling Commission since 1977.  Native hunters take approximately 0.1-0.5% of the population per annum, primarily from 9 Alaskan communities (Philo et al. 1993).  Since 1977, the number of
kills has ranged between 14-72 per year, depending in part on changes in management strategy
and in part to higher population estimates (Stoker and Krupnik 1993).  The total estimated kill, including struck and lost, in each of the last 5 years has been 25 (1989), 41 (1990), 46 (1991), 46 (1992), and 51 (1993), for an average of 42 whales per year (Suydam et al. 1994).  The Alaskan Eskimo subsistence harvest is managed under an international regime that differs from the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) amended legislation.  Therefore, development of
PBRs for potential incidental take of all stocks in U.S. waters (required for bowhead whales even though there is no incidental take) is independent of subsistence harvest agreements.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (42) does not exceed the PBR (75) nor the IWC quota for  1995 (68).  Bowhead whales of the Western Arctic stock are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and are thus classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Cuvier's Beaked Whale (<EM>Ziphius cavirostris</EM>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The distribution of Cuvier's beaked whale is known primarily from strandings, which indicate it is the most widespread of the beaked whales and is distributed in all oceans and most seas except in the high polar waters (Moore 1963).  In the northeastern Pacific from Alaska to Baja California, no obvious pattern of seasonality to strandings has been identified (Mitchell 1968).  Strandings of Cuvier's beaked whale are the most numerous of all beaked whales, indicating that they are probably not as rare as originally thought (Heyning 1989).  Observations reveal that the blow is low, diffuse, and directed forward (Backus and Schevill 1961, Norris and Prescott 1961), making sightings more difficult, and there is some evidence that they avoid vessels by diving (Heyning 1989).

<P>Mitchell (1968) examined skulls of stranded whales for geographical differences and thought that there was probably one panmictic population in the northeastern Pacific.  Otherwise, there are insufficient data to apply the phylogeographic approach to stock structure (Dizon et al. 1992) for Cuvier's beaked whale.  Therefore, Cuvier's beaked whale stocks are defined as the three non-contiguous areas within Pacific U.S. waters where they are found: (1) Alaska, (2) California/Oregon/Washington, (3) Hawaii. These three stocks were defined in this way because of (1) the large distance between the areas and the lack of any information about whether animals move between the three areas, (2) the different oceanographic habitats found in the three areas, and (3) the different fisheries that operate within portions of those three areas, with bycatch of Cuvier's beaked whales  only reported from the drift gillnet fishery in California. 

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of abundance for this stock are currently unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for these stocks is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, in the absence of a reliable estimate of minimum abundance, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There have been no observed reports of incidental mortality related to commercial fishery operations in the North Pacific in the last 5 years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program during the 3-year period between 1990 and 1992, no injuries or mortalities from gear interactions or illegal deterrence were reported.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries is considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>There is no known subsistence harvest of beaked whales.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury is very minimal for these stocks, and thus the Alaska stock of Cuvier's beaked whale is not classified as strategic.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>In U.S. waters in the Pacific, fin whales are distributed seasonally off the coast of North America and near and around the waters of Hawaii.  The following information was considered in
classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1)
Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous in winter, possibly isolated in summer; (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data:
unknown.  Based on this limited information, the International Whaling Commission considers
fin whales in the North Pacific to all belong to the same stock (Mizroch et al. 1984), although
Mizroch cited additional evidence that supports the establishment of subpopulations in the North Pacific .  Further, Fujino (1960) describes an eastern and a western group, which are isolated.  Tag recoveries reported by Rice (1974) indicate that animals that winter off the coast of southern California range from central California to the Gulf of Alaska in the summer.  Stock structure of fin whales is therefore equivocal.  Based on a conservative management approach, three stocks are proposed: 1) Alaska,  2) California/Washington/Oregon, and 3) Hawaii.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of current and historical abundance for fin whales in Alaska are currently not available.  Reported population ranges for the North Pacific prior to exploitation and in the early 1970s are 42,000 to 45,000 and 13,430 to 18,630, respectively (Ohsumi and Wada 1974).  These estimates were based on population modeling, incorporating catch and observation data, and include the California/Oregon/Washington  stock for which separate abundance estimates are currently available.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable estimate of minimum abundance for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are not available.   

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Reliable information on trends in abundance for this stock are currently not available.  There are no published reports indicating recovery of this stock has or is taking place (Braham 1992).  

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>It is recommended that the cetacean maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock at this time (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the
maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR. 
The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.1, the value for cetacean stocks which are listed as endangered (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance is
currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There have been no reports of incidental mortalities related to fishery operations in the North Pacific in the last 5 years.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is not currently possible to determine what level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries would be considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Subsistence hunters in Alaska and Russia have not been reported to take animals from this stock. 

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>This stock is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and is thus classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Gray Whale (<EM>Eschrichtius robustus</EM>):  Eastern North Pacific Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure of gray whales based on
the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: isolated geographic
distribution in the North Pacific Ocean; (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic
data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, two stocks
have been recognized in the North Pacific: the eastern North Pacific stock, which breeds along
the West Coast of North America, and the western Pacific or "Korean" stock, which apparently
breeds off the coast of eastern Asia (Rice 1981).  Most of the eastern North Pacific stock spends the summer feeding in the northern Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas (Rice and Wolman 1971).  However, gray whales have been reported feeding in the summer in waters off Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington.  The whales migrate near shore along the coast of North America from Alaska to the central California coast (Rugh et al. 1993) starting in October and November.  After passing Point Conception, California, Rice et al. (1984) reported the majority of the animals take a more direct offshore route across the southern California Bight to northern Baja California.  The eastern Pacific stock winters mainly along the west coast of Baja California.  The pregnant females assemble in certain shallow, nearly landlocked lagoons and bays where the calves are born from early January to mid-February (Rice et al. 1981).  The northbound migration generally begins in mid-February and continues through May (Rice et al. 1981).  

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>An abundance estimate, based on shore-based counts of southward migrating gray whales in
1987/1988, of 20,869 (CV=0.044) animals was reported by Buckland et al. (1993).  Preliminary
estimates of abundance for the southward migrations of gray whales in 1992/1993 and 1993/1994
were reported at the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee meetings in 1994
(RIWC 1995), where the 1992/1993 estimate (17,674 animals) was significantly less than that for
1993/1994 (23,109 animals).  However, the 1993/1994 estimate was not significantly different
from the 1987/1988 estimate of abundance for this stock of gray whales.  The 1993/1994 estimate
is currently considered the most reliable abundance estimate, thus the abundance estimate for this stock is 23,109 (CV=0.0740).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the
PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.): NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1 +[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the
population estimate of 23,109 and its associated CV of 0.074, NMIN for this stock is 21,715.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of increase, based on shore counts of southward migrating gray whales
between 1967 and 1988 is 3.29% with a standard error of 0.44% (Buckland et al. 1993). 
Incorporating the two most recent counts resulted in an annual rate of increase of 2.57% (SE =
0.4%: RIWC 1995).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>Wade (1994) reported that based on a Bayesian analysis of the census data between 1968 and
1994, the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales was between 0.51 and 0.97 of its carrying
capacity and that the rate of net production at the maximum net productivity level was 0.033 (95%CI: 0.023, 0.044).  However, this conclusion was regarded as questionable at the 1994 Scientific Committee meetings of the IWC because the analysis may have been unduly influenced by the 1992 census and because the variance of the abundance estimate was likely underestimated (i.e., negative biased).  Until consensus is reached, it is recommended (NMFS in prep.) that the cetacean maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock of gray whales.  Because this stock is thought to be midway between the lower limit of its optimum sustainable population (OSP) level and carrying capacity (K), the observed rate of increase is likely to be substantially less than RMAX.

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological
removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the
maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR. 
The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0, the upper limit of the range (0.5-1.0) of values for cetacean stocks with unknown population status but increasing with a known human take (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whale, PBR = (21,715 x 0.02 x 1.0) or 434 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>Since 1990, there have been no observed reports of incidental mortality related to commercial
fishery operations in the eastern North Pacific.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat
operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program during the 3-year period between
1990-92, one injury and one mortality was recorded in the Bristol Bay salmon set and drift gillnet fishery in 1990.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (0.3; based on observer data (0) and logbook reports (0.3) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (43) and, therefore, is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>At the 1991 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission, the U.S. "put on record
that it was not requesting and will not in future years request an allocation or use of 10 gray
whales" (RIWC 1992: pp. 32).  This represented a change from the previous quota period, where
an annual block quota of 179 animals had been authorized, of which 10 were subject to mutual
consideration with the U.S.  subsistence hunters in Russia took an average of 177 whales per year between 1966 and 1991 (RIWC 1995).  No takes were reported for 1992 and 1993.  In 1994, 44
gray whales were harvested by Russian aboriginals.  The current IWC quota for gray whales taken
by aboriginals is 140 animals per year.  In addition, Treaty Indian Tribes in Washington State
have expressed an interest in harvesting up to 5 animals per year for subsistence and ceremonial purposes.   	

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (0.3) does not exceed
the PBR (434), thus this stock of gray whale is not classified as a strategic stock.  It should be noted that this stock was recently (1994) removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife (i.e., it is no longer considered endangered or threatened under the U.S. Endangered
Species Act).

<h3>Humpback Whale (<EM>Megaptera novaeangliae</EM>): Western North Pacific Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The humpback whale is distributed worldwide in all ocean basins, though it is less common in
Arctic waters.  In winter, most humpback whales occur in temperate and tropical waters of both
hemispheres (10-23 latitude).  Humpback whales in the North Pacific are seasonal migrants that
feed on zooplankton and small schooling fishes in the cool, coastal waters of the western U.S.,
western Canada, and the Russian Far East (NMFS 1991).  The historic summering range of
humpback whales in the North Pacific encompassed coastal and inland waters around the Pacific
rim from Point Conception, California, north to the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, and west
along the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula and into the Sea of Okhotsk (Tomlin 1967,
Nemoto 1957, Johnson and Wolman 1984).  The population status of the humpback whale in
much of this range was considerably reduced as a result of intensive commercial exploitation
during this century.

<P>Aerial, vessel, and photo-identification surveys indicate four relatively separate populations that migrate between their respective summer/fall feeding areas to winter/spring calving and mating areas (Barlow 1994):  1) winter/spring populations in coastal Central America and Mexico which migrate to the coast of California to southern British Columbia in summer/fall (Steiger et al. 1991, Calambokidis et al. 1989, Calambokidis et al. 1993); 2) winter/spring populations of Mexico's offshore islands whose migratory destination is not well known but which do not migrate to the west coast of the continental U.S. (Calambokidis et al. 1993); 3) winter/spring populations of the Hawaiian Islands which migrate to Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound (Baker et al. 1990, Perry et al. 1990)- referred to as the Central North Pacific stock; and 4) winter/spring populations of Japan which probably migrate to waters west of the Kodiak Archipelago (the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands) in summer/fall (Berzin and Rovnin 1966, Nishiwaki 1966, Darling 1991)- referred to as the Western North Pacific stock.

<P>Significant levels of genetic differences were found between the California and Alaska feeding
groups based on analyses of mitochondrial DNA (Baker et al. 1990) and nuclear DNA (Baker et
al. 1993).  The genetic exchange rate between California and Alaska is estimated to be less than 1 female per generation (Baker 1992).  Two breeding areas (Hawaii and coastal Mexico) showed fewer genetic differences than did the two feeding areas (Baker 1992).  This is substantiated by the observed movement of individually-identified whales between Hawaii and Mexico (Baker et al. 1990).  There have been no individual matches between 607 humpbacks photographed in California and 567 humpbacks photographed in Alaska (Calambokidis et al. 1993).  Few of the whales photographed in British Columbia have matched with the California catalog (Calambokidis et al. 1993), indicating that British Columbia is the approximate geographic boundary between feeding populations.  Yet, some exchange between the mating and calving areas has been documented (Darling and McSweeney 1985, Baker et al. 1986, Darling and Cerchio 1993). 
Population structure in humpback whales appears to be based on matrilineal fidelity to feeding
areas.  Following the phylogeographic approach to classifying stock structure (Dizon et al. 1992), 4 stocks of humpback whales are recognized in the North Pacific, based on the information described above: two in the Eastern North Pacific, one in the Central North Pacific, and one in the Western North Pacific.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of abundance is currently not available for this stock of humpback whales.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable estimate of minimum abundance for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are not available.   

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The North Pacific humpback whale population may have numbered approximately 15,000 individuals prior to exploitation (Rice 1978).  Intensive commercial whaling removed more than 28,000 animals from the North Pacific during the 20th Century (Rice 1978).  Reliable information on trends in abundance for this stock are currently not available.  

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock of humpback whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.1, the value for cetacean stocks which are listed as endangered (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance is
currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers have not recorded mortality or serious injury to humpback whale incidental to
commercial fisheries in Alaska in the last 5 years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program during the 3-year period between
1990-92, no injuries or mortalities were recorded.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is zero, based on observer data (0) and logbook data (0) where observer data were not available.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries is considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The humpback whale is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), thus this
stock is classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Humpback Whale (<EM>Megaptera novaeangliae</EM>): Central North Pacific Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The humpback whale is distributed worldwide in all ocean basins, though it is less common in Arctic waters.  In winter, most humpback whales occur in temperate and tropical waters of both
hemispheres (10-23 latitude).  Humpback whales in the North Pacific are seasonal migrants that
feed on zooplankton and small schooling fishes in the cool, coastal waters of the western U.S.,
western Canada, and the Russian Far East (NMFS 1991).  The historic summering range of
humpback whales in the North Pacific encompassed coastal and inland waters around the Pacific
rim from Point Conception, California, north to the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, and west
along the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula and into the Sea of Okhotsk (Tomlin 1967,
Nemoto 1957, Johnson and Wolman 1984).  The population status of the humpback whale in much of this range was considerably reduced as a result of intensive commercial exploitation
during this century.

<P>Aerial, vessel, and photo-identification surveys indicate four relatively separate populations that migrate between their respective summer/fall feeding areas to winter/spring calving and mating areas (Barlow 1994):  1) winter/spring populations in coastal Central America and Mexico which migrate to the coast of California to southern British Columbia in summer/fall (Steiger et al. 1991, Calambokidis et al. 1989, Calambokidis et al. 1993); 2) winter/spring populations of Mexico's offshore islands whose migratory destination is not well known but which do not migrate to the west coast of the continental U.S. (Calambokidis et al. 1993); 3) winter/spring populations of the Hawaiian Islands which migrate to Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound (Baker et al. 1990, Perry et al. 1990)- referred to as the Central North Pacific stock; and 4) winter/spring populations of Japan which probably migrate to waters west of the Kodiak Archipelago (the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands) in summer/fall (Berzin and Rovnin 1966, Nishiwaki 1966, Darling 1991)- referred to as the Western North Pacific stock.

<P>Significant levels of genetic differences were found between the California and Alaska feeding
groups based on analyses of mitochondrial DNA (Baker et al. 1990) and nuclear DNA (Baker et
al. 1993).  The genetic exchange rate between California and Alaska is estimated to be less than 1 female per generation (Baker 1992).  Two breeding areas (Hawaii and coastal Mexico) showed fewer genetic differences than did the two feeding areas (Baker 1992).  This is substantiated by the observed movement of individually-identified whales between Hawaii and Mexico (Baker et al. 1990).  There have been no individual matches between 607 humpbacks photographed in California and 567 humpbacks photographed in Alaska (Calambokidis et al. 1993).  Few of the whales photographed in British Columbia have matched with the California catalog (Calambokidis et al. 1993), indicating that British Columbia is the approximate geographic boundary between feeding populations.  Yet, some exchange between the mating and calving areas has been documented (Darling and McSweeney 1985, Baker et al. 1986, Darling and Cerchio 1993). 
Population structure in humpback whales appears to be based on matrilineal fidelity to feeding
areas.  Following the phylogeographic approach to classifying stock structure (Dizon et al. 1992), 4 stocks of humpback whales are recognized in the North Pacific, based on the information described above: two in the Eastern North Pacific, one in the Central North Pacific, and one in the western North Pacific.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>This stock of humpback whales winters in Hawaiian waters (Baker et al. 1986).  Baker and
Herman (1987) used capture-recapture methodology to estimate the population at 1,407 (95% CI
1,113-1,701), which they considered an estimate for the entire stock (NMFS 1991).  However,
this estimate is calculated from data collected between 1980-83.  The current abundance estimate is considered unknown because the stock has been increasing for the past 12 years.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock was not calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)])   Rather,
because a reliable abundance estimate for this stock is not currently available, the population
estimate based on studies from the early 1980s, 1,407 whales, is considered a reasonable
alternative.  Applying equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.) to the estimate of
abundance and the associated CV from the early 1980s, given the likelihood that this stock is
increasing, seems unnecessarily conservative.  

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The North Pacific humpback whale population may have numbered approximately 15,000
individuals prior to exploitation (Rice 1978).  Intensive commercial whaling removed more than
28,000 animals from the North Pacific during the 20th Century and may have reduced this
population to as few as 1,000 before it was placed under international protection after the 1965 hunting season (Rice 1978).  Currently, a reliable estimate of trend in abundance for this stock is unavailable.  However, this stock is currently thought to be increasing (Johnson and Wolman 1984; DeMaster 1995: pp. 23).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock of humpback whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological
removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the
maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR. 
The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.1, the value for cetacean stocks listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for the North Central Pacific stock of humpback whales, PBR = (1,407 x 0.02 x 0.1), or 2.8 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers have not recorded mortality or serious injury to humpback whale incidental to
commercial fisheries in Alaska in the last 5 years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program during the 3-year period between
1990-92, no injuries or mortalities were recorded.  Several reports of mortalities were received from commercial fishers in 1993 and 1994.  

<P>Given that 10% of the PBR is approximately zero (i.e., 0.3) and the low number of observed or reported mortalities incidental to commercial fishing, the kill rate can not be classified as insignificant at this time.  

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The level of human-caused mortality and serious injury likely  does not exceed the PBR (2.8).  The humpback whale is listed as endangered under the ESA, thus this stock is classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Minke Whale (<EM>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</EM>): Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE:</STRONG>

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes 3 stocks of minke whales in the North Pacific: one in the Sea of Japan/East China Sea, one in the rest of the western Pacific west of 180oN, and one in the "remainder" of the Pacific (Donovan 1991).  The "remainder" stock designation reflects the lack of exploitation in the eastern Pacific and does not indicate that only one population exists in this area (Donovan 1991).  In the "remainder" area, minke whales are relatively common in the Bering and Chukchi Seas and in the inshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Mizroch 1992), but are not considered abundant in any other part of the eastern Pacific (Leatherwood et al. 1982, Brueggeman et al. 1990).  Because the "resident" minke whales from California to Washington appear behaviorally distinct from migratory whales further north, minke whales in Alaskan waters are considered a separate stock from minke whales in California, Oregon, and Washington.  
<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>No estimates have been made for the number of minke whales in the entire North Pacific nor are estimates available for the number of minke whales that occur in waters of Alaska.  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population</STRONG>

<P>A minimum population estimate is currently not available for this stock.  

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>There are no data on trends in minke whale abundance in waters off Alaska.  

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>There are no estimates of the growth rate of minke whale populations in the North Pacific (Best 1993).  In the absence of species-specific information on the annual rate of maximum net production, the default value of 0.04 should be used (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>The potential biological removal (PBR) for this stock is calculated as the product of minimum population size, 0.5 maximum net productivity, and a recovery  factor.  Given the status of this stock is unknown, the appropriate recovery factor is 0.5 (NMFS in prep.).  However, because an estimate of minimum abundance is not available, it is not possible to estimate a PBR for this stock at this time.  

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Historic Whaling</STRONG>

<P>The estimated take of western North Pacific minke whales by commercial whalers was approximately 31,000 from 1930 to 1987 (C. Allison, pers. comm., International Whaling
Commission, The Red House, Station Road, Histon, Cambridge, UK).   No minke whales were
ever taken by modern shore-based whale fishery in the eastern North Pacific which lasted from
1905-71 (Rice 1974).  Reported aboriginal takes of minke whales in Alaska were seven between
1930 and 1987 (C. Allison, pers. comm.).

<P><STRONG>Fishery Information</STRONG>

<P>Minke whales have been reported to have been caught in both coastal set gillnets and offshore drift gillnets.   

<P>Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program during the 3-year period between 1990-92,
no injuries or mortalities from gear interactions or illegal deterrence were reported.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is not currently possible to determine what level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries would be considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Subsistence hunters in Alaska and Russia have not been reported to take animals from this stock. 

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Minke whales are not on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  The greatest uncertainty regarding the status of the Alaskan stock has to do with the uncertainty pertaining to the stock structure of this species in the eastern North Pacific.  Because minke whales are
considered common in the waters off Alaska and because the number of human-related removals
is currently thought to be near-zero, this stock should not be considered a strategic stock, as
defined in the amended Marine Mammal Protection Act.  (Note: additional information on this
species is reported in the Stock Assessment Report for the stock of minke whales found in waters off California, Oregon, and Washington).

<h3>Northern Right Whale (<EM>Eubalaena glacialis</EM>):  North Pacific Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous; (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, two stocks of northern right whales are currently recognized: a North Atlantic stock and a North Pacific Stock (Scarff 1986, Schevill 1986).  In the eastern North Pacific south of 50N, only 29 reliable sightings have been recorded since 1900 (Scarff 1986, 1991; Carretta et al. 1994).  Whaling records indicate that right whales in the North Pacific range across the entire North Pacific north of 35N and occasionally occur as far south as 20N.  Sightings have been reported as far south as central Baja California in the eastern North Pacific and as far north as the sub-Arctic waters of the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in the summer (Berzin and Doroshenko 1982, NMFS 1991).  Migration patterns of the North Pacific stock are unknown.  

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The pre-exploitation size of this stock exceeded 11,000 animals (NMFS 1991).  Based on sighting
data, Wada (1973) estimated a total population of 100-200 in the North Pacific.  Rice (1974)
stated that only a few individuals remained in the eastern North Pacific stock, and that for all practical purposes was extinct because no sightings of a cow with calf have been confirmed since 1900 (D. Rice, pers. comm., Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE,
Seattle, WA  98115 ).  Therefore, a reliable estimate of abundance is currently not available.  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of minimum abundance for this stock is currently not available.  
	
<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of trend in abundance is currently not available. 

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>It is recommended (NMFS in prep.) that the cetacean maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) of
4% be employed for this stock.  However, this default rate is likely an underestimate based on the work reported by Best (1993).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological
removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the
maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR. 
The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.1, the value for cetacean stocks which are listed as endangered (NMFS in prep.).  If there are less than 500 whales the PBR would equal zero (500
x 0.02 x 0.1 = 1).  Therefore, the PBR is zero based on the assumption that it is extremely
unlikely that there are more than 500 whales in this stock.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>In June of 1983, a right whale was reported to be incidentally killed in a gillnet in Russian waters (NMFS 1991).  No other observed takes have occurred in the North Pacific.  Because the PBR is zero, any mortality incidental to commercial fisheries would not be considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Subsistence hunters in Alaska and Russia are not reported to take animals from this stock.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>This stock is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and is thus classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Stejneger's Beaked Whale (<EM>Mesoplodon stejnegeri</EM>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Stejneger's beaked whale is rarely seen at sea, and its distribution generally has been inferred from stranded specimens (Loughlin and Perez 1985, Mead 1989).  It is endemic to the cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, and deep waters of the southwest Bering Sea.  The range of Stejneger's beaked whale extends along the coast of North America from Cardiff, California, north through the Gulf of Alaska to the Aleutian Islands, into the Bering Sea to the Pribilof Islands and Commander Islands, and, off Asia, south to Akita Beach on Noto Peninsula, Honshu, in the Sea of Japan (Loughlin and Perez 1985).  The species is not known to enter the Arctic Ocean and is the only species of Mesoplodon known to occur in Alaskan waters.  The distribution of M. stejnegeri in the North Pacific corresponds closely, in occupying the same cold-temperate niche and position, to that of M. bidens in the North Atlantic.  It lies principally between 50and 60N and extends only to about 45°N on the east, but to about 40°N on the west (Moore 1963, 1966).

<P>There are insufficient data to apply the phylogeographic approach to stock structure (Dizon et al. 1992) for Stejneger's beaked whale.  The Alaska stock is recognized separately from other Mesoplodon spp. along the continental U.S. West Coast because of (1) the distribution of Stejneger's beaked whale and the different oceanographic habitats found in the two areas, (2) the large distance between the two non-contiguous areas of U.S. waters and the lack of any
information about whether animals move between the two areas, and (3) the different fisheries that operate within portions of those two areas, with bycatch of Mesoplodon spp. only reported from the drift gillnet fishery in California.
 
<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of abundance for this stock are currently unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for these stocks is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, in the absence of a reliable estimate of minimum abundance, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There have been no observed reports of incidental mortality related to commercial fishery operations in the North Pacific in the last 5 years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program during the 3-year period between 1990-92, no injuries or mortalities from gear interactions or illegal deterrence were reported.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries is considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>There is no known subsistence harvest of beaked whales.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury is very minimal for these stocks, and thus the Alaska stock of Stejneger's beaked whale is not classified as strategic.

<H1>Fur Seal Act of 1966</H1>

<P>The Fur Seal Act was enacted to administrate the Pribilof
Islands
off the coast of Alaska, the take of fur seals, and the
procedures for issuing, amending or
rescinding display permits for fur seals.  As these species are
marine mammals they are also
under the authority of the MMPA.  NMFS has consolidated the provisions of these two laws into
regulations promulgated under the MMPA (50 CFR part 216).

<H2>Scientific Research and Enhancement</H2>
<P>Over two decades has elapsed since NMFS began issuing
permits to take marine mammals in the wild.  This process has
evolved under three separate
statutes: The <A HREF="../mmpahome.html"> Marine Mammal
Protection Act</A>, the <A HREF="../esahome.html"> Endangered
Species Act</A>, and the <A HREF="../fsahome.html">Fur Seal
Act</A>. 
In addition, these statutes have been amended and new information regarding marine mammals as the activities which impact them continue to be gained.  In
response, NMFS has published regulations to consolidate and clarify basic conditions and restrictions applicable to all permits, and those applicable to research and enhancement
activities specifically.

<P>The 1994 Amendments provided for the General Authorization of  scientific research projects involving only <A
HREF="../mmpahome.html#Level B"> Level B harassment</A> of non-listed (endangered or threatened)  marine mammals.  Essentially, researchers submit a
Letter of Intent that contains detailed information so that NMFS can accurately determine whether or not the research is bona fide and the
impacts of the project are limited to Level B harassment as required under the General Authorization. Should it be determined that the project is
eligible, no public comment period is necessary.  Rather, the researcher receives a letter of  confirmation that they are covered under
the General Authorization.  In order to meet the timing
requirements of the 1994 Amendments
and still receive public review of this new program, an interim
final rule was published on
October 3, 1994.  Comments have been received and a Final Rule
for the General Authorization
will be published in the Federal Register.

<P>The 1994 Amendments eliminated the MMPA's jurisdiction over captive care

jurisdiction of the Animal Welfare Act administered by the Department of Agriculture, <A HREF="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/oa/aphishome.html">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</A> (USDA/APHIS). 
However, the MMPA requires that NMFS is notified 15 days prior to any transport, purchase, sale or export to update and maintain certain inventory information; and new rights provided to holders of captive marine mammals that will need to be reflected in regulatory language.  Although no captures for purposes of public display have occurred since 1989, NMFS still retains jurisdiction over any captures from the wild and any first-time imports of marine mammals into the U.S.  NMFS will publish these provisions and modifications as a Proposed Rule in the Federal Register.  For information regarding care and maintenance of marine mammals under the Animal Welfare Act, contact the <A HREF="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/oa/aphishome.html">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)</A>, USDA.

<H1>Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs)</H1>

<P>The Turtle Excluder Device or TED is a grid of bars with an
opening either at the top or the bottom.  The
grid is fitted into the neck of a shrimp trawl.  Small animals
like shrimp slip through the bars and are
caught in the bag end of the trawl.  Large animals such as
turtles and sharks, when caught at the mouth of
the trawl, strike the grid bars and are ejected through the
opening.

<P>NMFS has been able to show that TEDs are effective at
excluding up to
97% of sea turtles with minimal loss of shrimp.  This has enabled
NMFS to avoid implementing more restrictive
regulations on the shrimp industry.

<P>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) works daily to
balance the Nation's need for seafood
resources and the mandate to recover protected marine species
such as sea turtles.  The TED-use
requirements allow shrimpers to continue fishing in public trust
waters and simultaneously to protect sea
turtles.  This is an example of balancing commercial needs with
the biological need of protected resources.

<P>The development and implementation of the <A
HREF="tedregs.html">TED regulations (50 CFR 227.72(e))</A> gave
consideration to
industry concerns and included their participation in developing
the final regulations.  Industry
representatives also participate in review of new designs for
TEDs, some of which are submitted by the
shrimpers themselves.  NMFS ensured that the TED requirements
were phased in gradually, and has
provided numerous workshops and programs to work with the
industry regarding TEDs.

<P>With respect to foreign shrimp fisheries, NMFS and the State
Department have been working
closely with Mexico and other shrimp supplying nations in Latin
America to help them develop comparable
TED programs.  These programs are now in place in about a dozen
countries in the wider Caribbean area. 
In addition, NMFS and the State Department are negotiating an
International Sea Turtle Convention to
further promote TED programs in other countries.

<P>For more information about TEDs, consult NOAA Technical
Memorandum <A HREF="../undercon.html"> NMFS-SEFSC-366, The Turtle
Excluder Device: A Guide to Better Performance</A>.

VSPACE=10 ALIGN=left><P>For many people, salmon are the most
profound and enduring symbol of the Pacific Northwest.  To the
Northwest's Native American cultures, the salmon are the
very heart of their societies; they mark the turning of the
seasons and form a religious focus.  To the people who visit the
Northwest, the salmon represent unmatched
opportunities for fishing and for fish-watching as they make
their great migratory runs.  For citizens of the
Northwest in general, the salmon are the economic mainstay of
several communities, the opportunity for some
of the best fishing in the world right in their "own backyard,"
and one of the last living examples of the wild
character so cherished by the people of Oregon, Washington, and
Idaho.  Unfortunately, some Northwest salmon runs
are decreasing.

endangered</A>, the <A HREF="#Life History">life history of
Pacific salmon</A>, some of the <A HREF="#Why in Trouble">causes

<HR>

<A NAME="Why Endangered"></A><H3>Why Are Snake River Salmon
Listed as Threatened and Endangered? </H3>
<P>Snake River sockeye salmon were listed as an endangered
species on November 20, 1991.  Snake River
spring/summer and fall chinook salmon were listed as threatened
on April 22, 1992.  However, due to
record low returns in 1994, NMFS proposed to reclassify Snake
River chinook salmon as endangered.  Many
factors played a part in reducing these salmon populations to the
point of listing under the ESA.  Creation of dams and reservoirs
in their migration corridors, and the loss and deterioration of
their spawning and nursery habitats are the primary factors while
disease, predation, excessive harvest, water being withdrawn from
streams for other uses, and impacts from hatchery fish, are among
the other causes.  Impacts of climate chane are also considered a
significant factor for decline (i.e. El Nino and prolonged
drought conditions).

<P>Snake River sockeye salmon have declined in abundance more
than the other Northwest salmon.  During the 1950s
and 1960s, as many as 4,300 adult sockeye returned from the ocean
to Redfish Lake, Idaho, to spawn.  In 1992, one adult sockeye
returned to Redfish Lake, in 1993, eight returned, and in 1994,
only one sockeye returned.

<P>Naturally produced Snake River fall chinook salmon have also
declined to small numbers.  At the uppermost Snake River dam
with fish passage, an average of 12,700 salmon passed the dam
from 1964 through 1968.  Fish passing the
dam fell to a low of 78 in 1990, and then increased to 318 in
1991, 533 in 1992, 742 in 1993, and 404 in
1994.

<P>Exact numbers of naturally produced Snake River spring/summer
chinook salmon are harder to obtain
because many hatchery spring/summer chinook salmon have been
released in the system.  However, from
1950 through 1960, approximately 125,000 naturally produced adult
spring/summer chinook salmon annually returned to the system. 
Estimated returns of natural spring/summer chinook averaged 9,600
from 1980 through 1990.  In 1991 and 1992, 3,400 spring/summer
chinook returned to the Snake River Basin, in 1993, 7,900
returned, and in 1994 1,800 returned to spawn.   

<P><A HREF="#Top of page">Return to top of page</A>

<A NAME="Life History"></A><H3>Life History of the Snake River
Salmon</H3>
<P>Salmon have fascinating and complex life histories.  They
travel as much as 900 miles upriver and climb to
elevations of 6,500 feet to reach natal spawning grounds.  Snake
River chinook and sockeye salmon share the
same general life cycle.  Eggs are deposited and fertilized by
spawning adults in gravel "nests" (called
redds) in the summer and fall.  After the eggs hatch in the
redds, the juvenile salmon use the stream or
lake they were born in as a nursery area.  Sockeye salmon live in
nursery areas in Redfish Lake in Idaho for one to three years
before migrating seaward.  Spring/summer chinook live in nursery
areas in small
streams for one year but fall chinook live in nursery areas in
larger streams for only a few months. 
Sockeye and spring/summer chinook smolts leave their nursery
areas and start migrating to the ocean in the
spring.  Fall chinook salmon leave their nursery areas and start
migrating to the ocean early in the summer.

<P>In the Pacific Ocean, Snake River salmon range from northern
California to the Gulf of Alaska where they grow to maturity. 
Snake River salmon usually spend two to
four years in the ocean before they return to freshwater.  Snake
River sockeye salmon enter the Columbia
River in June and July and return to Idaho's Redfish Lake to
spawn.  Spring/summer chinook salmon
enter the Columbia River from March through July and return to
their natal streams to spawn.  The
spring/summer chinook that migrate early in the year tend to
spawn in the upstream reaches of the Snake River's tributary
streams, while those arriving later spawn in the river's lower
reaches.  Fall chinook salmon enter the Columbia
River from August through October and return to the mainstem
Snake River and lower reaches of major
tributary streams to spawn.

<P><A HREF="#Top of page">Return to top of page</A>

<A NAME="Why in Trouble"></A><H3>Causes of Snake River Salmon
Decline</H3>
<P>There are many causes of the salmon stocks' decline in
abundance:  dams, water use, overharvest, habitat
destruction, hatchery impacts, and other human-induced factors
all play roles in reducing the Snake River
salmon populations.  Ocean conditions have also been a
significant factor in the decline of salmon populations, though
these natural fluctuations are beyond our control.  As noted by
the Snake River Recovery Team, no single factor is responsible
for the full extent of the decline, and no single action will
restore the fish.  No "magic bullet" or single-purpose "fix"
exists to
restore the salmon populations to their former levels of
productivity and abundance.

<P>One of the problems is institutional.  There is insufficient
focus and accountability to ensure effective
management of the overall system for the sake of the salmon. 
Institutional, jurisdictional, international,
state and Federal boundaries make coordinated overall fisheries
management decisions difficult.  To
effectively implement and monitor the proposed Snake River Salmon
Recovery Plan, an institutional
structure needs to be developed that considers the
responsibilities of the Endangered Species Act, the Northwest
Power Act, and the many federal, state, tribal, county, and local
governmental and private
stakeholders.  

<P>In many of the Snake River salmon watersheds, the problems
begin before the salmon emerge from the
gravel.  Land use activities such as logging, grazing, mining,
and road building can smother redds (salmon
nests) with silt or sediment.  Livestock may step directly on a
redd and kill the salmon eggs.  Once young salmon emerge from the
redds, ecological interaction with hatchery fish such as
competition, predation, displacement, and disease transfer
contribute to population declines.  Logging may eliminate
streamside trees which would
otherwise fall into the water and create important habitat for
salmon.  Other land use activities, such as removing
stream-shading trees, may increase water temperatures to levels
that are lethal for juvenile salmon. 
Livestock grazing often removes vegetation near streams and
thereby reduces stream bank stability.  

<P>Once the salmon are ready to migrate to the ocean, they face
the problems associated with the hazardous
downstream journey.  This journey through the lower Snake and
Columbia rivers has become more
hazardous since eight hydroelectric dams were completed and their
reservoirs were created.  Seventy
percent of the 471 miles from the mouth of the Columbia River to
Lewiston/Clarkston on the Snake River
has been converted from free-flowing river into reservoirs.

<P>Juvenile salmon (called smolts when they are ready to migrate
seaward) must find their way through the
reservoirs and past the dams.  Smolt-to-adult survival rates of
Snake River salmon stocks have declined to
the point where they equal about one-fourth the rates observed in
the 1960s, and migration time for smolts
from the Snake River to the Columbia River estuary has doubled. 
The longer the smolt migration time, the
greater the risks of predation and disease.

<P>Smolts may pass the dams through different routes; those
passing over the spillway or using the bypass
systems have higher survival rates than those that pass through
the turbines.  Improvements in bypass
systems at several of the dams are helping to make passage safer
for the fish.

<P>Before the dams were built, flows in the spring were higher. 
Historically, even in years of low flow, there was
sufficient current to carry the smolts to the sea.  Then, as now,
most of the smolts migrated at night which
might be a way of avoiding predators.  

<P>Not only did the dams slow the rate of downstream travel for
smolts, they increased the amount of habitat
favorable to predator species, and provided physical conditions
that improved the predators' ability to detect
and capture juvenile salmon.  Hatchery fish and exotic species
which compete with, and prey on, chinook and sockeye have also
been introduced into the system.
. 
<P>The construction of hundreds of large and small reservoirs has
physically altered the original hydrology of
the Columbia River Basin.  The flows for the lower Snake and
Columbia rivers have been changed from
natural conditions to those considered more desirable for human
uses.   The large late-spring and early-summer runoffs and small
late-autumn and winter flows have been changed so that now there
is a much
smaller spring-summer runoff.  A complex management system has
been developed to manage the basin's
reservoirs and flows.  The system was primarily developed to
control floods, provide water for irrigation,
and serve the hydropower system by storing water for use when
power demand is high. 

<P>In addition to the sections of the rivers that have dams, the
140 mile section of free-flowing Columbia
River downstream from Bonneville Dam, and the Columbia River
plume that extends into the Pacific Ocean
have been altered in ways that may reduce the survival of smolts
migrating to sea.  Little research has been
conducted on the effects of reduced flows and turbidity on the
survival of smolts in the lower Columbia
River and the estuary.  However, it seems likely that reductions
in flows and turbidity in the spring have not only increased the
smolts' travel time, but also added to their risk of predation on
their way to the estuary. Reductions in flow
have also decreased the size of the river plume extending into
the ocean (an environmental factor which
offers the smolts some concealment from predators when they first
reach the ocean).
   
<P>Little is known about survival rates of salmon once they enter
the Pacific Ocean, but there is growing
evidence that survival rates are not uniform from year to year
and that variations in ocean productivity may
affect stocks over wide geographic areas and timeframes.  Annual
variability and the
possibility of long-term trends in the ocean environment make it
difficult to detect changes in
survival that result from efforts to improve inland conditions.  

<P>When salmon begin their upstream migration as adults, they
face harvest by commercial and
recreational fisherman and predation by marine mammals and other
animals.  Passage through the dams also presents a
problem.  Biologists are able to count salmon as they use the
dams' fish ladders on their way upstream. 
Large numbers of salmon "disappear" in between dams.  The reasons
these adult fish disappear include: 
mortality, unreported and illegal harvest, fish falling back over
the dams after being counted in the fish
ladder of a previous dam, straying or wandering, and spawning in
reservoirs and their tributaries.

<P>The causes of mortality may include:  predation and wounding
by marine mammals, injuries from fishing gear,
water pollution, high water temperatures, large spillway
discharges, and disease.  Additional mortality may result from
injuries received when the fish "fall back" downstream and go
through turbines, bypass systems, spillways, or navigation
locks.

<P>When the adult salmon return to the area where they emerged
from their parents' redd, they again face
habitat problems.  Spawning beds may be silted in with sediment
from logging, mining, or roadbuilding, or
the water may be too warm for them.  In addition, human
activities may unintentionally scare them away
from the spawning beds.

<H2>NMFS Annual Report to Congress on MMPA Activities for
1990-1991</H2>

<P><A HREF="#contents">Table of Contents</A>

<H3>I.  Introduction</H3>

<P>The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA or Act) is the
principal Federal legislation
that guides marine mammal species protection and conservation
policy.  The MMPA delegates
authority for oceanic marine mammals to the Secretary of
Commerce, the parent agency of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Species
of the order Cetacea
(whales and dolphins) and species, other than walrus, of the
order Carnivora, suborder
Pinnipedia (seals and sea lions), are the responsibility of
NOAA's National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS or the Service).  The Department of the Interior's
Fish and Wildlife Service is
responsible for the dugong, manatee, polar bear, sea otter, and
walrus.  Marine mammals that
are already managed under international agreements are exempt as
along as the agreements
further the purposes of the Act.

<P>With few exceptions, the Act, as originally enacted in 1972,
placed a moratorium on
taking or importing marine mammals or their products into the
United States.  The Act defines
the term "take" to mean "to harass, hunt, capture, or kill".  The
Department of Commerce could
authorize the take of marine mammals for scientific research, for
public display, and incidental
to commercial fishing.  The 1981 Amendments added two "small
take" categories to the
moratorium exception: one for commercial fishing and the other
for activities such as oil and
gas exploration.  The 1981 Amendments also provided for the
subsistence take of marine
mammals by certain natives of Alaska.

<P>In response to litigation and other events that made it
virtually impossible for NMFS to
issue take permits to commercial fisheries, the 1988 Amendments
to the MMPA were enacted. 
These Amendments established a five-year Interim Exemption to the
take moratorium for
commercial fisheries.  The primary objective of the Interim
Exemption was to provide a
mechanism for collecting data about interactions between marine
mammal and commercial
fisheries while allowing commercial fishing operations to
continue.  During the Interim
Exemption, the Amendments required NMFS to develop a new regime
to govern the incidental
take of marine mammals by commercial fisheries which would become
effective following the
expiration of the Interim Exemption.  The 1988 Amendments also
provided for permits to be
granted for take of marine mammals to enhance the survival or
recovery of a species or
population.

<P>NMFS implements MMPA activities through its Regional offices
and Fishery Science
Centers in cooperation with the States, conservation groups, the
public, other Federal agencies,
the Marine Mammal Commission, and constituents, including
scientific researchers, the fishing
industry, and the public display community.  The Service's
programs are coordinated by the
Office of Protected Resources.

<P>The 1990/1991 Annual Report addresses implementation of the
1988 amendments to the
MMPA and other major activities undertaken by NMFS under the
Act's authority.

<H2>NMFS Annual Report to Congress on MMPA Activities for 1995</H2>

<P><A HREF="#contents">Table of Contents</A>

<H3>I.  Introduction</H3>
<P>This Annual Report to Congress regarding the administration of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA or Act) has
been prepared pursuant to sections 103(f), 104(h)(3)(C), 110(d)  and 115(b)(3) of the MMPA.

<P>The MMPA is the principal Federal legislation that guides marine mammal species protection and conservation policy.
The MMPA vests responsibility for most marine mammals in the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Under the MMPA, NMFS is responsible for the management
and conservation of species of the order Cetacea (whales and dolphins) and species, other than walrus, of the order
Carnivora, suborder Pinnipedia (seals and sea lions). 

<P>Species management is administered through NMFS' Regional Offices and Fisheries Science Centers in cooperation with
States, conservation groups, the public, other Federal agencies, the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), and constituents,
including scientific researchers, the fishing industry, and the public display community.  NMFS' Office of Protected
Resources oversees the administration of these activities.

<P>On April 30, 1994, the Act was reauthorized by the MMPA Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103-238).  These amendments
introduce substantial changes to the provisions of the Act., incorporating recommendations from commercial fishers,
conservation groups, public display institutions, scientific researchers, NMFS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS),
MMC, animal protection groups and the Alaska Native community.

<P>This report focuses on research and management activities conducted by NMFS in 1995 relative to  these amendments and
their significance to the MMPA's goals re: resource management and marine mammal protection, in addition to providing an
annual update on the programs not revised by the 1994 Amendments.

<A NAME="1"></A><H3>Washington State Request to Remove Sea Lions
at Ballard Locks Has Been Approved</H3>
<P>On January 5, 1995, the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) approved, with
conditions, a Washington state request to lethally remove
California sea lions preying on the
steelhead run that passes through Seattle's Ballard Locks to
spawn.  This decision was made
in order to protect Washington state's severely depleted
winter-run stock of steelhead from
extinction.  The returning steelhead, whose numbers have fallen
drastically in the past
decade, are under consideration for listing under the Endangered
Species Act.

<P>In a letter to the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife,
NMFS outlined strict
conditions recommended, in part, by a federally convened task
force of scientists,
environmentalists, and fishery organizations under which the sea
lions can be captured and
held, and, as a last resort and only in certain cases, killed
under new provisions of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Amendments of 1994.

<P>Before sea lions can be lethally removed, the state, with
oversight from NMFS, must
ensure that all "feasible and practical" non-lethal removal
methods have been exhausted.  For
example, the state must try to prevent the sea lions from
approaching the Ballard Locks using
special sound generating devices that create an "acoustic
barrier".  In addition, the state must
try to capture and find temporary holding facilities for sea
lions identified as preying on
steelhead.  Also, before any removal decision, a sea lion would
have to be individually
identified as preying on steelhead and the overall sea lion
predation rate would have to
exceed ten percent of the steelhead run during a seven-day
period.

<P>In past years, NMFS and the state of Washington have tried a
range of non-lethal
means to control California sea lion predation, including
capturing and relocating the sea
lions, installing barriers and modifying water flow at the locks,
and trying to drive the sea
lions away from the locks by using rubber-tipped arrows and
firecrackers.  Because of the
ineffectiveness of these measures, and recent changes to the MMPA
allowing states to
request that NMFS convene task  forces  to make   recommendations
regarding "nuisance"
pinniped situations, Washington state officials last July asked
NMFS  for permission to
lethally remove sea lions from Ballard Locks.

<P>Washington state's population of California sea lions has
grown from occasional
sightings in the 1970's to 400-500 animals currently.  Throughout
its range, the California
sea lion population is growing at a rate of about 10 percent
annually and now numbers over
100,000 animals.

<P>Since the announcement of NMFS' decision, several events have
brought further
attention to the Ballard Locks/sea lion situation.  The
Muckleshoot tribe of Washington has
offered to accept those sea lions earmarked for removal.   The
Sea Shepherd Society has
offered to transport the sea lions to other sites to prevent the
lethal removals.  To date, one
sea lion has been captured and is in captivity at a local
aquarium.

<A NAME="2"></A><H3>Working Sessions to Discuss Draft Fishing
Regulations a Success</H3>

<P>In late November and early December of last year, the Office
of Protected Resources
held two public working sessions to discuss draft regulations to
implement provisions in the
MMPA to govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial
fishing operations
(sec. 118 of the MMPA).

<P>The broad range of public participation at the sessions
provided diverse, constructive
feedback on the draft regulations.  The sessions were held in
Silver Spring, MD and Seattle,
WA and were attended by representatives of fishing organizations,
environmental groups,
inter-state fishery commissions, coastal states, Congressional
staff, and the Marine Mammal
Commission.

<P>Discussions focused, among other things, on how fisheries
would be classified under
the new amendments.  The majority of attendees supported a shift
from criteria that classified
fisheries using a rate of take of marine mammals per twenty days
of fishing, to criteria that
is based on each fishery's annual serious injury and mortality
level for each stock relative to
its Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level.  However, there was
concern that fisheries
could be classified incorrectly if insufficient information were
available regarding a stock's
population size or level of take due to commercial fishing.

<P>The definition of the Zero Mortality Rate Goal (ZMRG) was also
debated, and most
agreed that if the total take from a stock was less than 10% of
its PBR, that stock could be
said to have reached "an insignificant level of serious injury
and mortality approaching a zero
rate".  However, because NMFS must assess each fishery's progress
in achieving the
ZMRG, many felt that it must be defined on a by-fishery basis. 
The Seattle group
recommended that this level be somewhere between 1% and 10% of a
stock's PBR,
depending on the number of fisheries interacting with each stock.

<P>Other feedback provided during the sessions will be
incorporated into the proposed
regulations implementing sec. 118, due to be published in March
or April.  For more
information, contact Vicki Cornish, (301) 713-2322.

<A NAME="3"></A><H3>Prohibition on Intentional Lethal Takes of
Marine Mammals In Effect</H3>
                                   
<P>The final rule implementing the statutory prohibition on
intentional killing of marine
mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations will be
effective on March 3, 1995. 
The rule makes obsolete current regulations that permit fishers
to intentionally kill marine
mammals to protect their catch or gear.  Persons found to be in
violation of this prohibition
are subject to a fine of up to $20,000.

<P>There will be an exception for actions taken by fishers that
are imminently necessary
to save the life of a person, provided that the killing is
reported to the National Marine
Fisheries Service within 48 hours after the end of the fishing
trip in which the take
occurred.

<P>Killing marine mammals will be prohibited, yet non-lethal
measures may still be used
to deter marine mammals from damaging fishing gear or catch.  The
MMPA requires NMFS
to develop guidelines for the safe deterrence of marine mammals. 
It also requires NMFS to
prohibit deterrence measures that have a significant adverse
effect on marine mammals.  The
guidelines and the list of prohibited measures are in
preparation, and it is hoped that a
proposed rule with guidelines and prohibited measures will be
published in the spring.

<P>For information on the intentional lethal take prohibition,
contact Dean Wilkinson,
(301) 713-2319.  For information on non-lethal deterrence
guidelines, contact Ken
Hollingshead, (301) 713-2055, or Dan Morris, NMFS Northeast
Region, (508)
281-9388.

<A NAME="4"></A><H3>Bering Sea Ecosystem Study is Underway</H3>

<P>NMFS is developing a plan to study the Bering Sea ecosystem. 
The purpose of the
study is to resolve uncertainties concerning the causes of
declines in marine mammals, sea
birds and other living resources in that ecosystem.  The study
will consider the research
recommendations developed by previous workshops, including
research on subsistence use of
living resources and ways to provide for their sustained use.  An
important component of the
study will be the involvement of Alaska Native groups in the
development of the plan and the
incorporation of traditional local knowledge.

<P>NMFS is currently working on the first draft of the plan.  The
plan will then be
revised based on comments by the Marine Mammal Commission, the
State of Alaska, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Native organizations, and
others.  A series of
workshops will be held in early 1995 to finalize the plan and
determine how the research will
be conducted.  For more information, contact Ned Cyr, (301)
713-2319.

<A NAME="5"></A><H3>Public Invited to Comment on Investigation of
Pinniped Impacts on Salmonids and Coastal Ecosystems</H3>

<P>NMFS will establish a working group comprised of Federal and
state biologists to
investigate the effects that California sea lions and Pacific
harbor seals are having on
salmonid stocks and coastal ecosystems of Washington, Oregon and
California.  Following
the working group's investigation, NMFS will begin discussions
with the Pacific States
Marine Fisheries Commission and will produce a report for
Congress addressing issues or
problems identified in the investigation.  NMFS will also make
recommendations to address
such issues.  The report will be available for public comment for
90 days.  

<P>The public is invited to attend the first working group
meeting to get an explanation
of the proposed investigation and report process, provide
statements and comments to the
working group, and answer inquiries for information.  The meeting
will be held at the
NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, WA, on
February 27, 1995 from
11:00 to 12:00 AM.  For further information, contact Dr. Linda
Jones, NMFS Northwest
Fisheries Science Center, (206) 860-3200.

<A NAME="6"></A><H3>Marine Mammals and Gillnets</H3>

<P>Although most marine mammal mortalities in the U.S. occur in
gillnets, NMFS
realizes that not all gillnet fisheries are the same.  Over the
last several years, NMFS has
reclassified many gillnet fisheries because they were shown to
have much lower mortality
rates than first suspected.  Based on data collected by
observers, NMFS is now able to make
better decisions on how to classify these fisheries under the
1994 amendments to the MMPA,
and can work with fishers to identify fishing methods and
modifications in gillnet gear that
may result in reduced mortalities of marine mammals.

<P><STRONG>Description of the Gear.</STRONG>  Gillnets are used
to catch a variety of fish species in the
U.S..  In Alaska and the Northwest, they are used primarily to
target salmon.  In both the
Atlantic and Pacific, they are used to target swordfish, tuna,
and shark in deep water, and
smaller finfish and groundfish in coastal waters.  Gillnets can
be set in a variety of ways. 
They can be fished at the ocean surface, in midwater, or on the
bottom.  They can drift
freely in open water, or can be set with one or both ends
anchored to either the shore, a
buoy, or a fishing vessel.

<P>Mesh sizes used by gillnetters vary greatly, depending upon
the size of the fish being
targeted.  The length of the net also varies.  In general,
fishery managers set regulations for
each gillnet fishery specifying the range of mesh sizes allowed,
the length of the net, and the
number of nets that can be fished.

<P><STRONG>Types of Interactions. </STRONG> There are generally
three types of direct "interactions"
between marine mammals and gillnets. The first, entanglement in
fishing gear, occurs when
marine mammals are in the same area as gillnets, and, for reasons
unknown, they do not
detect the presence of the nets and/or avoid them.  Marine
mammals then become entangled
in the gear, and are generally unable to disentangle themselves
before the nets are hauled in. 
In some cases, though, gillnetters are able to remove entangled
marine mammals and release
the animals alive.  This may depend on how frequently the nets
are tended, or how severely
the animals are entangled.  Entanglement may also occur when
fishing gear is discarded
illegally.
     
<P>The second type of interaction occurs when marine mammals are
preying on the same
fish species targeted by gillnetters, and are attracted to the
nets as an easy source of food. 
"Stealing" entangled fish from gear may result in damage to the
nets and reductions in catch. 
The third type of interaction, deterrence, is the intentional use
of firearms, "seal bombs", or
other devices to scare marine mammals away from fishing gear.  Of
course, not all fishers
use deterrence to keep marine mammals away from fishing gear, as
many consider damage
to nets and loss of catch a "cost of doing business".
     
<P><STRONG>Frequency of Interactions.</STRONG>  Updated
information on the type and frequency of marine
mammal mortalities with gillnets has come from observer programs,
fisher's logbooks, and
stranding data.  Of these, observers provide the most reliable
data on frequency of marine
mammal interactions.  Observer programs require that persons
receive intensive training in
the identification and sampling of marine mammals before being
placed on fishing vessels,
and that they demonstrate competency in objective data
collection.
     
<P>NMFS has placed observers in more than a dozen gillnet
fisheries in the U.S..  These
include the Alaska Prince William Sound salmon set and drift
gillnet fisheries, the Alaska
Peninsula salmon drift gillnet fishery, the Washington and Oregon
salmon drift gillnet
fisheries in Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, and Lower Columbia River,
the California set and
drift gillnet fisheries, the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery
and the Atlantic pelagic drift
gillnet fishery.
     
<P>Data collected by NMFS observers from 1990 to the present
indicate that the impacts
of gillnet fisheries on local marine mammal populations vary
greatly, depending on the depth
of the gear, the mesh size, the location of fishing activity, and
the season.
     
<P><STRONG>Classification of Fisheries.</STRONG>  The Marine
Mammal Exemption Program, established by
the 1988 amendments to the MMPA, required NMFS to classify
fisheries according to the
frequency of interactions between marine mammals and fisheries. 
Having little information
regarding gillnet fisheries, NMFS initially classified the
majority of these as either Category
I or II fisheries, suspecting that these fisheries had either a
frequent or occasional take of
marine mammals, respectively.
     
<P>Based on observer program data, and information submitted in
fishers' logbooks,
NMFS has been able to reallocate observer resources to focus on
fisheries or fishery "hot
spots" which have the highest levels of marine mammal
interactions.  NMFS has also
reclassified a number of gillnet fisheries which were initially
suspected of having a high level
of mortalities, yet were found, through the collection of
observer data, to have only rare
occurrences of mortalities.
     
<P>Some groups have suggested that NMFS propose a new system of
classifying
fisheries, under the 1994 amendments to the MMPA, based on the
number of serious injuries
and mortalities relative to each marine mammal stock's status or
abundance.  Information
collected during the Interim Exemption will help us to reclassify
fisheries under this new
system based on better estimates of fishing mortality in gillnet
gear.  It will also help us to
correctly classify gillnet fisheries when data are incomplete and
to recommend fishing
methods that will reduce the number of marine mammals killed each
year in gillnet
fisheries.

<A NAME="7"></A><H3>Process for Forming Take Reduction Teams is
Being Developed</H3>

<P>The 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act
require that NMFS
form take reduction teams shortly after the release of final
Stock Assessment Reports.  These
teams will develop plans for reducing the incidental take of
marine mammals in certain
commercial fisheries in order to to assist in the recovery or
prevent the depletion of strategic
stocks.
     
<P>Strategic stocks are those marine mammal stocks that have a
level of human-caused
mortality that is higher than the stock's calculated Potential
Biological Removal (PBR) level. 
Strategic stocks are also those stocks that are listed as
endangered or threatened under the
Endangered Species Act, designated as depleted under the MMPA, or
that are declining and
likely to be listed in the near future.
     
<P>A process to develop take reduction teams and to ensure that
teams are effective in
developing a plan that considers all available options, both
voluntary and mandatory, for
reducing incidental takes is currently being developed.  The use
of professionals to help
facilitate team meetings and guide the process of plan
development is being considered to
help ensure the success of these teams.
     
<P>Take reduction teams for New England harbor porpoise and
Mid-Atlantic coastal
bottlenose dolphins will be convened as soon as possible.  They
will serve as "pilot teams" to
help NMFS develop standardized guidelines to be followed by
future teams in other areas
and for other stocks and fisheries.
     
<P>In general, all efforts will be coordinated by NMFS Regional
Offices in consultation
with the Office of Protected Resources, with assistance from
professional facilitators.  For
information, contact Nancy Daves, (301) 713-2319.

<HR><A NAME="1"></A><H3>Preparing to Establish Take Reduction Teams</H3>
<P>Under the 1994 Amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), the NMFS must establish Take Reduction Teams for strategic stocks of marine mammals  which interact with Category I or II fisheries.  These are fisheries that interact frequently or occasionally with marine mammal stocks that are designated as endangered or threatened  under the Endangered Species Act, depleted under the MMPA, or whose levelof human-caused mortality exceeds the stock's calculated Potential Biological Removal.  Take Reduction Teams are to produce Take Reduction Plans designed to lower the levels of mortality caused by incidental interactions between the above commercial fisheries and marine mammal stocks.  The Teams are to be made up of individuals who represent  the span of interests and affected parties impacted by these decisions, including the commercial and recreational fishing industries,  management councils, interstate commissions, academic and scientific organizations, state officials, native Alaskans or other Native American interests if appropriate, environmental groups and NMFS representatives. 

<P>In February, NMFS initiated an effort to develop a formal process for establishing Take Reduction Teams capable of developing plans that consider all available options, both voluntary and mandatory, for reducing incidental takes.  The wide range of interests that will be involved in developing plans will make the process of  achieving consensus for bycatch reduction a challenging task.  To ensure that the Take Reduction Team process is unbiased, NMFS contracted with dispute resolution professionals to design general guidelines and proceedures for Team composition and operations, and to  make recommendations for establishing two "pilot" Take Reduction Teams to address bycatch of New England harbor porpoise and Mid-Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins. 

<P>In March, NMFS contracted with Resolve, Inc., a professional dispute resolution company, to develop recommendations for establishing the aforementioned "pilot" Take Reduction Teams.  Potentially interested parties were interviewed by Resolve and asked to provide their views on marine mammal bycatch issues and what their role might be on a  Team.  Many individuals interviewed expressed their interest in having a neutral facilitator convene Team meetings in order to ensure that the views of all Team members were given equal weight.  Subsequently, Resolve provided the NMFS with a "how-to" guide for the establishment and conducting of future Take Reduction Teams and final recommendations regarding the "pilot" Teams.  The  NMFS is confident that these products and the addition of a professional facilitator to the Take Reduction Team process will greatly improve the chances of achieving consensus when developing  plans to reduce marine mammal bycatch in commercial fisheries.

<P>Presently, a review of the preliminary Stock Assessment Reports indicates that six Take Reduction Teams may be necessary to develop the necessary Plans  required under the MMPA.  Teams may be established for 1)  the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy harbor porpoise, 2)  Atlantic offshore pelagic cetaceans, 3)  Atlantic large baleen whales, 4) mid-Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, 5)  Alaska marine mammals, and 6)  Pacific cetaceans.   Once a final determination is
made on the number and scope of necessary Take Reduction Teams, NMFS anticipates contracting with a professional dispute resolution service to establish Teams and facilitate Team meetings.  For general information, contact Mike Payne or Robyn Angliss (301/713-2322).

<HR><A NAME="2"><H3>Pinniped Predation Working Group</H3>

<P>As reported in the last Bulletin (<A HREF="feb95.htm">February 1995</A>), NMFS established  a scientific working group to examine the impacts of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals on Pacific salmonids, other fish and coastal environments of California,
Washington and Oregon.  Under the 1994 Amendments, NMFS is required to produce a report for Congress addressing identified issues and/or problems.  

<P>The Working Group, comprised of marine mammal and salmon biologists from the NMFS and state fisheries agencies, held its first meeting on February 27-28 at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington.  The primary focus of this meeting's agenda was to discuss the organization and scheduling of the investigation, and to identify sources of scientific information and documented data on marine mammal-anadromous fish interactions.  In addition, the public was invited to attend this first meeting to receive  an overview of the proposed investigation and the report process, receive answers to their questions, and to provide any comments or documentation of interactions for consideration by Working Group members.

<P>In preparation for developing the report, Working Group members are presently undertaking a literature search and reviewing scientific documentation and studies on  predation, behavior and status of California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals, and the status of salmonids on the west coast.  The report is slated for completion in October 1995 and will be made available for public comment and review. The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission will review this
report on behalf of the States of  Washington, Oregon and California, and the NMFS will enter discussions with the Commisison to address any issues or problems identified in the scientific report and develop recommendations to address such issues or problems.   The scientific report and any recommendations will subsequently be submitted to Congress.
 
<P>The Working Group is soliciting information from the public documenting interactions and impacts of California sea lions and harbor seals on salmonids and coastal ecosystems.  If you have relevant information contact Linda Jones, NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center, (206/860-3200), or send the information in a letter to Joe Scordino, Northwest Regional Office, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle WA 98115, or to James Lecky, Southwest Regional Office, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach CA 90802-4213.

<HR><A NAME="3"><H3>The Gulf of Maine Salmon Aquaculture-Pinniped Interaction Task Force</H3>

<P>As required under the 1994 Amendments, NMFS has established a Salmon Aquaculture-Pinniped Interaction Task Force.  This seven member Task Force, comprised of individuals representing academia, industry, conservation and animal protection interests, is charged with examining and reporting on the issues and problems of seals interacting in a dangerous and damaging manner with salmon aquaculture resources in the Gulf of Maine.  A final report  is to be completed by April 1996 and submitted to Congress.

<P>On March 23 & 24, the Task Force held its first meeting in Eastport, Maine.  This meeting was dedicated to fact finding. The Task Force visited three pen operations of various size and design, and spoke with site managers about seal attacks.  The Task Force reviewed and discussed materials regarding predation, deterrence, the economics of aquaculture in the global market and in Downeast Maine, predation management and mitigation policies worldwide, and seal behavior, population, and distribution.  The task force identified a number of areas in which more refined information is needed and began to outline a report.  The Task Force hopes to submit this report to the NMFS by October 1995. After sufficient public review and comment,  NMFS will identify and recommend preferred mitigation alternatives as part of its final
report to Congress.

<P>The Task Force is planning a second meeting in Eastport, Maine, from May 31-June 2,1995.  The first day will be dedicated to public comment.  It is hoped that stakeholders and numerous industry representatives will participate.  Discussions on the remaining days will focus on fleshing out the report.  Contact Dan Morris (508/281-9254) for further information.

<HR><A NAME="4"><H3>Bering Sea Ecosystem Study</H3>

<P>The 1994 Amendments require NMFS to undertake a scientific research program to monitor the health and stability of the Bering Sea Ecosystem, and to identify and address uncertainties concerning the causes of population declines of marine mammals, sea birds and other living resources in the ecosystem.  As a first step, the NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center  has developed a draft Bering Sea Ecosystem Study Plan which outlines a holistic research program for the Bering Sea.  The draft Study Plan has been distributed to Alaska Native Groups, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Department of Interior (Fish and Wildlife Service and National Biological Survey) and the State of Alaska for review.  The Plan will be discussed with these groups at a Bering Sea Ecosystem Study workshop to be held in Anchorage, Alaska, June 14-15,
1995.  Contact Ned Cyr (301/713-2322) for additional information.

<LI><STRONG>-Non-Lethal Deterrence Measures:</STRONG> The MMPA Amendments allow persons to deter marine mammals from damaging public or private property (including commercial fishing catch or gear), or endangering public safety, as long as the animal is not killed or injured.  A proposed rule to implement this provision was published in early May.  This proposal specifies guidelines for safely deterring marine mammals and prohibits certain deterrent measures that may have a significant adverse impact on marine mammals.  NMFS also released an Environmental Assessment for public comment at the same time as the proposed rule.   NMFS requests individuals identified as having expertise in marine mammal/human interactions to comment on the rule and suggest additional improvements.  NMFS is also interested in public participation in designing the final regulations and guidelines.  For more information, contact Ken Hollingshead (301/713-2055), Doug Beach or Dan Morris, NMFS Northeast Region, (508/281-9254).

<LI><STRONG>Stock Assessment Reports:</STRONG> Draft Stock Assessment Reports were published in the Federal Register in November of 1994.  The drafts have been finalized and are currently being edited for consistency by NMFS Headquarters staff.  The NMFS anticipates that an announcement of availability of the final Stock Assessment Reports will be published in the Federal Register near the end of May, 1995.  Contact Tom Eagle (301/713-2322) for additional information.

<LI><STRONG>Regulations governing Interactions Between Marine Mammals and Commercial Fisheries:</STRONG> The regulations that implement section 118 of the MMPA and govern interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries are currently being finalized, along with the associated Environmental Assessment.  A new List of Fisheries is being prepared concurrently and will be included in the new regulations.  A proposed rule for these new regulations is expected to be completed in late May or early June.  The regulations implementing section 118 of the MMPA will replace the regulations under the old section 114, the Interim Exemption for Commercial Fisheries.  Contact Robyn Angliss (301/713-2322) for additional information.

<HR><A NAME="7"><H3>Notification of Marine Mammal Transports and Captive Inventory Changes</H3>
<P>Under the 1994 Amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act  of 1972 (MMPA), holders of marine mammals are required to provide at least 15-days notice prior to the transport, purchase/sale, or export of marine mammals, and to notify NMFS of any captive births and deaths.  The Amendments also require that an inventory of captive marine mammals be established and maintained.  Although NMFS has maintained a computer-based inventory of captive marine mammals since the early 1980 s, this new statutory mandate combined with the elimination of a permit requirement for holding marine mammals for public display purposes increases significantly the importance of this inventory and its accuracy.  In February, all active holders of marine mammals listed on NMFS s existing Marine Mammal Inventory were mailed two formats designed to facilitate simple compliance with and efficient administration of these requirements.
<P>The Marine Mammal Transport Notification format is designed to assist holders of marine mammals in meeting the 15-day notification requirements of section 104 of the MMPA. It is also designed to be used for notifications of the export of marine mammals being held for purposes of public display. Foreign government certifications must  also be submitted in any situation involving the export of a marine mammal. An explanation of these and other export provisions are detailed in an "Exports" explanatory page provided with the Marine Mammal Transport Notification format. 
<P>The Marine Mammal Data Sheet format is designed to assist holders of marine mammals in reporting any changes to a holder's inventory of marine mammals, including births, deaths and transports (i.e. in conjunction with transport notifications), or for the submission of other marine mammal data that is animal-specific.
<P>These formats are simple and straightforward.  Notes have been included to make them self-explanatory.  Until these or similar formats are formally required through the regulatory process they are optional.  However, NMFS strongly encourages their immediate use and notes that, if a holder chooses not to use these formats, the same notification requirements and informational documentation must none-the-less be met and provided by each holder of marine mammals for the above purposes.  For more information or copies of these formats contact Ann Terbush, Permits Division, (301/713-2289).

<HR>
<A NAME="1"></A><H3>Proposed Marine Mammal Fishery Interactions
Regulations Published</H3>
<P>On June 16, 1995, NMFS published in the Federal Register
proposed regulations for a new
regime to govern interactions between marine mammals and
commercial fisheries.  The new
regime will replace the Interim Exemption for Commercial
Fisheries with a long-term program
to authorize fisheries that incidentally seriously injure and
kill marine mammals and, ultimately,
to reduce interactions to a level approaching a zero mortality
and serious injury rate.  A proposed
list of fisheries based on new classification criteria is
included in the proposed regulations.  The
following summarizes the major changes.

<P><STRONG>Fishery classification criteria.</STRONG>  The MMPA
requires that commercial fisheries be placed in one of
three categories based on whether the fishery has a frequent,
occasional or remote likelihood of
incidental serious injury and mortality of marine mammals.  Under
the Interim Exemption,
"frequent", "occasional" and "remote likelihood" were defined in
terms of the total marine
mammal take per vessel per 20 days.  The proposed regulations
define "frequent", "occasional"
and "remote likelihood" in terms of how many marine mammals of a
particular stock are
incidentally taken relative to that marine mammal stock's
potential biological removal (PBR)
level. 

<P>The proposed criteria are as follows:
          <UL>
<LI><EM>Category I fishery:</EM>  A commercial fishery that is,
by itself, responsible for the annual removal of
50% or more of any stock's PBR level.

<LI><EM>Category II fishery:</EM>  A commercial fishery that is,
collectively with other fisheries, responsible
for the annual removal of more than 10% of any marine mammal
stock's PBR level and is by
itself responsible for the annual removal of between 1% and 50%
exclusively, of the PBR level
for any stock.

<LI><EM>Category III fishery: </EM>  A commercial fishery that
is, collectively with other fisheries, responsible
for the annual removal of under 10% of any marine mammal stock's
PBR or more than 10% of
any  marine mammal stock's PBR but is, by itself, responsible for
less than or equal to 1% of that
stock's PBR.
</UL>
<P>These criteria incorporate a stock-specific approach rather
than a rate-based approach.  This
approach would increase the ability of NMFS to target management
actions to those fisheries
with the largest impact on particular marine mammal stocks.  It
would also eliminate several
on-going difficulties associated with using a per-vessel rate of
take.  For example, under the
present system a small fishery could have the same per-vessel
rate of take as a large fishery, yet
have less of an impact on a stock.  In addition,  if marine
mammal populations increase and
fishing effort remains constant, the per-vessel take rate may
also increase, causing a fishery to be
arbitrarily placed into a higher category .  The proposed
approach would allow NMFS to initiate
more proactive management efforts for fisheries that take species
with low and/or declining
populations. 

<P><A HREF="#2">Fisheries affected by the new criteria</A> are
highlighted on page 2 of this Bulletin.

<P><STRONG>Data used to classify fisheries</STRONG> Observer data
extrapolated to estimate the total kill of marine mammals in a
particular fishery were used when possible.  If observer data
were not available, several other data sources were
tapped, such as fishers' logbook data, fishers' reports,
confirmed anecdotes, stranding information, and analagous
situations.  Such data were not extrapolated, but were used as
minimum estimates of the annual number of stock-specific serious
injuries and mortalities in a fishery.  Other data used included
historical patterns of marine mammal takes and the expected
magnitude of takes resulting from changes in fishing effort or
fishing technology.

<P><STRONG>Reporting requirements</STRONG> Under the Interim
Exemption, fishers in Category I and II fisheries were required
to fill out daily
logbooks and to submit the logbooks every year.  Under the
proposed regulations, logbooks
would no longer be required.  Instead, all fishers are required
to report all marine mammal
injuries and deaths that occur incidental to a fishery to NMFS on
a postage-paid form within 48
hours of the end of a fishing trip.  The reporting form is
currently under development and should
be ready by January 1996.

<P><STRONG>Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious
injuries</STRONG> Under the Interim Exemption, NMFS could require
vessels participating in Category I fisheries
to carry an observer.  Under the new section 118, NMFS may place
observers on any Category I
or II vessel.  NMFS may also require vessels in Category III
fisheries to carry an observer if it
can be shown that the fishery is having an immediate and
significant adverse impact to a stock
listed under the ESA and if emergency regulations have been
published by NMFS to mitigate
this impact.  

<P><STRONG>Takes of ESA-listed species</STRONG> The 1994 MMPA
amendments require fishers to obtain a separate authorization to
take marine
mammals listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA if the
take can be determined to have
no more than a "negligible impact" on the stock.  The proposed
list of fisheries included with the
proposed rule contains a list of species that each fishery
interacts with.  NMFS specifically
requests comments on those fisheries that have takes of species
listed under the ESA and on the
magnitude of the takes.

<P>Comments on the proposed regulations and the authorization to
take listed species must be
submitted to NMFS by July 31, 1995.  Comments on the proposed
list of fisheries must be
submitted by September 14, 1995.  In addition, a number of
regional public hearings are
scheduled throughout the end of June and July.  For more
information, call Robyn Angliss at
301/713-2322.

<P>The Bering Sea Ecosystem Workshop previously scheduled for
June 14-15 in Anchorage was
postponed until September.  The postponement came at the request
of Alaska Native groups who
were unable to attend the June workshop due to scheduling
conflicts.  An announcement will be

<A NAME="4"></A><H3>Request for Proposals to Facilitate Take
Reduction Teams</H3>

<P>NMFS has decided that expertise in professional environmental
dispute resolution is necessary to
design and convene Take Reduction Teams and to develop Take
Reduction Plans (see MMPA
Bulletin, April/May 1995).  The request for proposals for this
activity was released on June 22,
and proposals will be accepted until July 14, 1995 

<P>Our twofold objective is to place a contract with an
organization with a background in
professional environmental dispute resolution that would: 1)
facilitate the development of a
series of Take Reduction Teams across the country, each of which
would focus on reducing
bycatch of a "strategic" stock(s) in regional commercial
fisheries, and 2) facilitate the convening
of each of these teams over a six month period, resulting in the
development of Take Reduction
Plans.

<P>Take Reduction Team are proposed for the following
fisheries/marine mammal stock complexes:
          <UL>
<LI>Gulf of Maine Harbor Porpoise
<LI>Atlantic Offshore Cetaceans and Beaked Whales
<LI>Pacific Offshore Cetaceans and Beaked Whales
<LI>Atlantic Baleen Whales
<LI>Atlantic Coastal Bottlenose Dolphins
<LI>Alaska Marine Mammals/Eastern and Western Steller Sea Lions
</UL

<P>Following the closing date for the request for proposals,
NMFS' Office of Protected Resources
will review the proposals.  It is anticipated that the contract
will be awarded approximately six
weeks following the review of all proposals received, and that
the selection of individuals to
participate on all the Take Reduction Teams will be completed by
approximately October 1,
1995. 

<P>NMFS would like to have draft Take Reduction Plans available
for public review by Spring,
1996.

<A NAME="5"></A><H3>New Program Logo Being Developed</H3>

<P>NMFS is in the process of developing a new logo for the
fisheries interaction program.  Decals
and exemption certificates issued to vessel owners under the
Interim Exemption displaying the
logo to the left will not be valid after January 1, 1996.   

<P>The new logo will be used on posters and other materials to
inform fishers and the public of the
new authorization requirements and on decals issued to registered
fishers.  Look for the new logo
in the next few months...

<A NAME="6"></A><H3>New Guidelines Proposed for the Zero
Mortality Raye Goal</H3>

<P>The MMPA Amendments of 1994 call for a reduction in the
incidental serious injury and
mortality of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations to
insignificant levels
approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate within seven
years, or by April, 2001.  The
proposed rule to implement Section 118 of the MMPA proposes a
series of biological objectives
to determine when the Zero Mortality Rate Goal (ZMRG) has been
met.

<P> Now that a definitive deadline has been imposed for attaining
the ZMRG, the fishing industry,
other interested constituents, and the government must develop
objective standards to determine
when the ZMRG has been reached, as well as gauge any progress
toward its attainment. 



<P>Developing specific objectives raises three fundamental
questions:  1) what does insignificant
mean?  2) how close to zero do we need to approach? and 3) what
rate should we use as the
measurement?

<P>First, in determining what is insignificant, it is helpful to
review what is meant by significant.  
For example, a statistician may think in terms of probabilities,
whereas an economist may focus
on the level of additional effort versus output as significant in
determining an optimum level of
efficiency. 

<P>On the other hand, many people may regard "a lot" of something
as being significant.  NMFS has
proposed that the ZMRG should address the biological significance
of levels of incidental
mortality and serious injury to marine mammal stocks.

<P>The next step is to identify the level of loss that could be
considered biologically insignificant to
a marine mammal stock.  The MMPA gives us an important starting
point with the Potential
Biological Removal level, or PBR. The PBR is the maximum number
of marine mammals that
could be removed from a stock (by other than natural causes) and
still allow that stock to reach
and maintain its Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP). 
Therefore, NMFS concluded that the
removal of a small portion of a stock's PBR could be considered
insignificant to the stock's
ability to reach and maintain OSP.

<P>In December, 1992, NMFS proposed to Congress that a level of
mortality or serious injury that
would delay recovery of a severely depleted stock of marine
mammals by no more than 10%
could be considered biologically insignificant.  Modeling
exercises confirmed that limiting
incidental removals to 10% of a stock's PBR would cause the
population to delay achieving OSP
by no more than 10%.  Therefore, NMFS proposed that if total
fishery-related mortality and
serious injury is less than 10% of PBR for a marine mammal stock,
it will be determined as
"insignificant" for that stock.  In addition, fisheries that
interact with declining, depleted,
threatened, or endangered stocks of marine mammals will be
examined more closely to ensure
that any incidental loss from these stocks is, indeed,
insignificant.   

<P>In cases where the total loss for a given stock exceeds 10% of
PBR, some fisheries may still
contribute only a small (or insignificant) amount of that loss. 
Therefore, NMFS proposes a
second tier of consideration for individual fisheries when total
incidental loss exceeds 10%.  A
fishery contributing removals of no more than 1% of a stock's
PBR, even when total loss due to
all fisheries exceeds 10%, would be determined to have an
insignificant effect on that stock.  It is
important to note that the proposal for ZMRG is the same as the
criteria for determining
Category III fisheries in the proposed list of fisheries.

<P>Second, incidental losses must "approach a zero rate".  Some
have argued that "zero means zero". 
Others have argued that incidental losses are accidental and
despite a fishery's best efforts, some
marine mammals may still get caught incidentally in their nets. 
NMFS proposes to control
incidental loss of marine mammals through regulation or
restrictions only to the point that these
losses are biologically insignificant to marine mammal stocks. 
However, NMFS would continue
efforts with the fishing industry to design, refine and use
technologies and methods that are more
"marine mammal friendly". 



<P>Lastly, what rate should we use?  Since the 1988 Amendments to
the MMPA were passed,
NMFS has looked primarily at the number of marine mammals caught
by an individual vessel
over a 20-day period.  An alternative is the number of marine
mammals killed by a given fishery
in a year. 

<P>Unfortunately, these rates are not directly related to
biological significance.  In the first case, a
fishery with a large number of vessels would remove more marine
mammals than a small fishery
if the per-vessel rates were the same.  In the second case, the
mortality of one right whale, an
endangered species, has more biological significance to a
population than the mortality of one
California sea lion.  

<P>The proposed definition for attaining the ZMRG has been
developed around the biological
significance of the magnitude of the incidental mortality and
serious injury of marine mammals
of a particular stock.  This approach is biologically
justifiable, and progress toward it would be
based upon the best available scientific information.  NMFS looks
forward to receiving your
comments on the ZMRG and other aspects of the proposed
regulations.   For more information,
call Tom Eagle at 301/713-2322.

<A NAME="7"></A><H3>Process to Take Marine Mammals by Harassment
Simplified</H3>

<P>On May 31, 1995, NMFS published a proposed rule to amend the
small take regulations (50 CFR
Part 228) to implement an expedited process by which U.S.
citizens could apply for an
authorization to incidentally (not intentionally) take small
numbers of marine mammals by
harassment without the need to issue specific regulations
governing the taking of marine
mammals for each and every activity.  Harassment in this context
does not include serious
injuries or lethal removals.  As authorized under the MMPA
Amendments of 1994, the rule
specifies statutory time limits for NMFS' review, publication,
and public notice and comment on
any applications for an authorization that would be granted.  The
rule also details the
requirements for submission of a plan of cooperation as well as
for scientific peer review of an
applicant's monitoring plans in cases involving activities that
may affect a species' or stock's
availability for subsistence.   

<P>If implemented, this rule would result in a more streamlined
and cost-effective method for
obtaining small take by incidental harassment authorizations,
without lessening the MMPA's
protection of species and stocks of marine mammals.  The comment
period for this proposed rule
was originally scheduled to close on July 17, 1995, but has been
extended until October 13,
1995.

<HR><A NAME="1"></A><H3>Negligible Impact Finding Made for Three ESA-Listed Marine Mammal Stocks</H3>
<P>On August 31, 1995, NMFS made negligible impact findings under the MMPA for three stocks of
marine mammals listed as threatened or endangered  under the Endangered Species Act (ESA): 
humpback whales in the central north Pacific, and Steller sea lions in both the eastern and
western Pacific. A single interim permit was issued to 24 Category I and II fisheries
authorizing the incidental take of animals from these stocks (60 FR 45399).  For seven other
stocks of marine mammals, NMFS was unable to determine that incidental takes by commercial
fishing would have a negligible impact.  As a result, a permit was not  issued to fisheries
that have the potential to incidentally take threatened or endangered marine mammals from these
stocks.

<P>Section 101(a)(5)(E) of the MMPA requires NMFS to authorize the incidental, but not
intentional, taking of ESA-listed marine mammals provided that three conditions are met. 
First, the incidental taking must be determined to have a negligible impact on the affected
species or stock.  Second, a recovery plan for that species or stock must exist or be under
development.  And, third, where required by section 118 of the MMPA, a monitoring program must
be established, vessels in the fishery must be registered, and a take reduction plan must exist
or be under development.

<P>In order to determine whether the first condition has been met, that incidental takes have
a negligible impact on the affected stock, NMFS has evaluated the best available information
for all ESA-listed marine mammals on a stock-by-stock basis.  Those stocks for which negligible
impact findings were made were then reviewed to determine if the second and third conditions
have also been met.  If all three conditions were met, the fisheries were included in a single
permit which authorizes the incidental, but not intentional, taking of marine mammals by
fisheries which are known to interact with that stock.  For some stocks, NMFS was unable to
make a negligible impact finding.  For others, there was no evidence of fishery interactions
(see chart below).

<P>Vessels participating in Category I and II fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals
from ESA-listed stocks without authorization permits may be subject to penalties under the MMPA
and/or the ESA.  Vessels found in violation may be subject to civil fines as well as seizure
and forfeiture of their cargo.  Individuals found in violation may be subject to civil fines. 
Individuals who intentionally violate the prohibitions of the MMPA are also subject to criminal
penalties and imprisonment of up to one year.

<P>Prior to the 1994 amendments to the MMPA, there was no mechanism for authorizing the
incidental take of ESA-listed species in fishery operations.  Because this is the first attempt
to authorize incidental takings, NMFS has issued the initial permit on an interim basis so that
the public could comment on the process and the fisheries permitted (or not permitted).   The
comment period for this action ends on October 16, 1995.  For more information, or a copy of
the report "Assessment of Fishery Impacts on Endangered and Threatened Marine Mammals Pursuant
to Section 101(a)(5)(E)", contact <A HREF="mailto:Vicki.Cornish@noaa.gov">Vicki Cornish</A> at 301-713-2322.

<LI><STRONG>Take Reduction Teams Update:</STRONG>  On September 14, 1995, NMFS awarded a contract to     RESOLVE, INC. to develop a series of Take Reduction Teams under the MMPA, and to facilitate the convening of these Take Reduction Teams over a six-month period.  After six months, each team is responsible for recommending a Take Reduction Plan to NMFS.  It is anticipated that the selection of individuals necessary to formulate the six Take Reduction Teams will be completed by November 1, 1995.  NMFS expects to have draft Take Reduction Plans available for public review by spring, 1996.  For more information, contact <A HREF="mailto:Michael.Payne@noaa.gov">Michael Payne</A> at 301-713-2322.                         <P>        
<LI><STRONG>State-Federal Coordination of Fishery Registration:</STRONG>  Participants in Category I or II commercial fisheries must register annually for an authorization certificate under section 118 of the MMPA, in addition to their state or Federal fishery license or permit.  Efforts to provide "one-stop shopping" for fishers have been ongoing and we hope to have a few states on board by January, 1996.  Details on changes to the registration process will be outlined in the final List of Fisheries for 1996, due to be published in November, 1995.  Nationally, the majority of states have welcomed the idea of the state/Federal integration process.  However, the issue of funding and/or reimbursement remains a concern.  Obstacles also exist  in the compatibility between existing registration systems and the relative sophistication of each state s database.

<HR><A NAME="3"><H3>California Sea Lion ("Herschel") Conflict with Wild Steelhead</H3>
<P>Efforts to protect the 1995 season s wild winter-run steelhead at the Ballard locks in Seattle from sea lion predation ended in June and are presently being evaluated by managers at NMFS.  Although the 1995 returns of wild steelhead are better than 1994,  with a final spawning escapement totaling 126 fish -- an 80% increase over the all time low return of 70 in 1994 -- the implications for any long-term run improvement are less certain.                        

<P>From December 5 to June 17, 1995, observers monitoring sea lion predation in the Lake Washington Ship Canal documented a total of 8 steelhead eaten by sea lions.  The total estimated take was 11 wild steelhead, approximately 8 percent of the total wild run, significantly lower than the 50% to 65% predation rates observed from 1986 to 1991.  This lower rate may be either the result of fewer available steelhead, which are down from over 1,000 per year prior to 1992, or the effectiveness of the acoustic devices used in deterring sea lions  from the prime "feeding" area at the entrance to the fish ladder.  

<P>The 1995 predation control program was conducted by the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife (WDFW) in conjunction with NMFS, in accordance with a Letter of Authorization issued to WDFW by NMFS under the MMPA.  As reported in the February, 1995, MMPA Bulletin, NMFS convened a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force and conditionally approved the Task Force s recommendation to have WDFW lethally remove individually-identified sea lions.  The principal condition specified by NMFS in its authorization was to place captured sea lions in captivity, allowing lethal removal only in cases where captive holding was unfeasible.

<P>A total of three sea lions were captured and held in the 1995 season; they were later released.  Sea lion #17, branded in 1989, was captured in Seattle on January 25th and held in captivity during the 1995 steelhead run until June 8th, when it was released into the wild in the Channel Islands.  A satellite tag applied to the animal tracked its movements to the Pacific Northwest.  At last report, on August 29, the animal had migrated north past Oregon and Washington to Barkley Sound on Vancouver Island, B.C..  It is anticipated that #17 will soon return to Puget Sound and make its way to the Ballard Locks.  During captivity, #17 increased in weight from 872 pounds when captured to 1,082 pounds at the time of release. This was the only animal placed in captivity, although several others were identified as candidates for captivity if captured.  One of those, #225, which had killed three steelhead on February 8 (the most steelhead observed killed on any single day), was captured on May 24 and, due to the lateness in the season, was not placed in captivity but rather transported to the Straits of Juan de Fuca and released.  The same circumstances occurred with sea lion #87, the most frequently observed, identifiable sea lion at the Locks in 1995.  Sea lion #87 was captured on June 17 and also released in the Straits.  Both sea lion #87 and #225 were observed at the Locks later in June, feasting on downstream migrating smolts. 

<P>Ongoing efforts of the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force will be discussed in future
editions of the MMPA Bulletin.  For more information, call Joe Scordino at 206-526-6143.

<HR><A NAME="4"><H3>Flipper's Myth Proves Harmful</H3>

<P>The "playful" antics performed by Flipper for 1960s  T.V. audiences has left dolphins and other marine mammals with a mythical, larger-than-life reputation.  Viewed as intelligent, nearly human creatures, dolphins are attributed with powers ranging from reducing stress in humans to telepathically communicating with emotionally-disturbed children.  The commercial operations making these claims neglect to acknowledge these creatures as powerful wild animals, whose need to survive deserves respect and caution from humans.  Unfortunately, public feeding and swimming-with activities with wild dolphins in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Hawaiian waters, and feeding sea lions on the west coast, has caused these animals to become at risk to injury from humans, and in turn, aggressive towards people.                 

<P>In the late 1980s, commercial boat tours in the Carolinas, Florida and Texas started feeding
wild dolphins.  Although the practice was banned following a 1993 court ruling, some recreational boaters and commercial operators continue to illegally feed dolphins in the wild.  There are numerous reports of both dolphins and humans being injured - and occasionally killed - from engaging in these activities.  Reports received by NMFS include people being bitten, swimmers being pulled under the water, and injuries severe enough to require stitches and hospitalization.  In Brazil, a man who was harassing a wild dolphin was killed when the dolphin rammed him in the chest. <P>

<P>NMFS is especially concerned about the increasing frequency of injuries, deaths and changing
behaviors among local-area dolphins which appear to be related to feeding and swimming-with
activities.  As these animals lose their natural fear of humans, they become increasingly
vulnerable to interactions and collisions with fishing and recreational vessels.  They also become more reliant on begging for handouts instead of foraging.  Reports of vandalism against dolphins have included people feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs, candy bars and baited fishhooks.  In Florida, some dolphins have become so brazen that they now take bait off of fishing lines.  Unfortunately, the hook and line often lodge into the mouth or throat, particularly in younger, less adept dolphins.  This became such a problem at one pier in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, that a favorite sport was to attempt to "land a dolphin".  

<P>The behavioral impact of these activities on the animals, especially on calves and juveniles, is of particular concern to scientists.  A report about the famous Monkey Mia resort in Western Australia, where approximately half a dozen female dolphins have been provisioned with handouts from the beach, found that of the 17 calves born to the provisioned adults since feeding began, only 5 have survived.  Starvation due to lack of foraging and hunting skills were cited among the causes of death.  In Hawaii, pelagic dolphins are known to frequent quiet coves and shallow areas in order to rest during the day and avoid predation.  Some entrepeneurs have discovered this phenomenon and are bringing tourists to these areas to swim with the dolphins.  Scientists are concerned that the dolphins  resting patterns are being disrupted, which may eventually lead to the dolphins being displaced from their natural resting areas.

<P>The problem of humans iteracting with marine mammals is not exclusive to dolphins.  NMFS has
documented a rise in human interactions with a variety of marine mammal species.  Sea lions
accustomed to handouts in areas along the California coast have been vandalized with seal bombs
and are now considered to be threatening nuisances at various public marinas.  Also on the West
coast, elephant seal rookeries along the popular coastal highway 101 are experiencing the negative effects of human encroachment.  State park rangers in San Simeon have witnessed people jumping onto the backs of these animals for a ride and parents placing their children along side of them for a photograph.  In the Northeast, seals have been hauling out and pupping  in such populated areas as Long Island, NY.  Seven people were bitten last year by seals on Long Island alone.  In addition to the injury caused by the bite itself, there is always the possibility that bite wounds from wild animals may become infected.  Although uncommon, marine mammals can transmit diseases to humans and domestic animals.

<P>In the last decade, marine mammals in general, and dolphins in particular, have grown in
popularity among the public.  The friendly reputation of dolphins has taken on mythical
proportions, leading to many lucrative operations in the tourist trade that often misinform the
public.  In addition, public attitudes are taking a dangerous turn: in some areas, the provisioned dolphins and sea lions are now considered to be "nuisance animals".  NMFS hopes to avert the disaster which occurred in the 1970s when public feeding of bears in Yellowstone National Park forced park officials to destroy an average of 27 bears per year.

<IMG SRC="../images/feed1.gif" ALT="Warning sign" ALIGN=right><P>NMFS is attempting to educate the public about the harm they are causing these animals and the need for common sense and respect when it comes to enjoying wildlife.  For the second year in a row, NMFS has initiated an educational campaign aimed at informing the public that feeding and swimming with wild marine mammals is not only illegal under the MMPA, but harmful to both the animals and people.  Part of NMFS  educational efforts is the development of enforcement signs informing the public that these activities are harmful to wildlife and can carry civil and criminal penalties.  The signs also provide a NMFS Enforcement Hotline number, 1-800-853-1964. 

<P>Although NMFS does not have the resources to place an enforcement agent on every waterway, it is hoped that members of the conservation, science, public display and fishing communities will join NMFS in helping to inform people to respect the wild nature of these animals by minimizing human impacts. 

<P>Responsible observation cruises provide the best environment for experiencing marine mammals
in the wild.  Under NO circumstances should people feed or swim with wild marine mammals.  It is illegal, harmful and can even be fatal.  For more information, contact the Permits Division at 301-713-2289.

<HR><A NAME="5"><H3>Final Marine Mammal-Fishery Interaction Regs Published</H3>

<P>The final regulations implementing section 118 of the MMPA were published in the Federal
Register on August 30, 1995.  These regulations replace the regulations issued under section 114 of the MMPA (the interim exemption program).  The new regulations authorize the incidental, but not intentional, taking of marine mammals in commercial fisheries. 

<P>NMFS received 28 oral comments and 56 written comments on the proposed regulations.  These
comments were considered by NMFS during the development of the final regulations.  Public comments on the proposed regulations resulted in two major modifications to the final rule.  First, "entanglement" is no longer included in the definition of injury, as marine mammals are often disentangled and released from gear without harm.  However, the definition of injury now includes marine mammals that are released with trailing gear.  Although NMFS will not require the reporting of an entangled animal that is not otherwise injured, the agency asks that these types of interactions be reported voluntarily, as it helps in understanding the circumstances of entanglement events.  Second, the definition of the zero mortality rate goal was deleted from the final rule. Many comments were received regarding NMFS  definition and approach to the zero mortality rate goal, so NMFS decided to postpone publishing a final definition until later this year.

<P>The comments from the public on the proposed regulations implementing section 118 were greatly appreciated.  Comments on the proposed list of fisheries are now being considered in developing the final list of fisheries for 1996.

<HR><A NAME="1"></A><H3>The 1996 List of Fisheries Has Been Published!</H3>

<P>The 1996 List of Fisheries was published in the Federal Register on December
28, 1995.  This list groups U.S. commercial fisheries into categories based on
the annual level of marine mammal serious injury and mortality incidental to
fishing operations. 

<P>New regulations governing interactions between marine mammals and commercial
fisheries were published on August 30, 1995.  Under these regulations, NMFS
must publish a list of all U.S. commercial fisheries at least annually. 
Fisheries are placed into Category I, II, or III based on the annual level of
marine mammal serious injury and mortality incidental to commercial fishing
operations relative to the potential biological removal level (PBR) of a
particular marine mammal species.  These new definitions of Category I, II, and
III fisheries provide a species-specific approach that allow NMFS to focus
management actions toward those fisheries that have frequent or occasional
incidental serious injuries and mortalities of marine mammals of particular
concern.

<P>Many fisheries have changed categories since the last List of Fisheries was
published in 1994.  Most changes have resulted in a fishery being moved from
Category II to Category III.  However, new information recently collected or
analyzed resulted in moving the following three fisheries from Category III to
Category II:  the southeast Alaska salmon purse seine fishery, the North
Carolina haul seine fishery, and the Atlantic midwater trawl fishery (includes
those species listed in the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Fishery Management
Plan).  In addition, the following three fisheries are new to the List of
Fisheries and have been placed in Category II:  the Oregon swordfish surface
longline fishery, the Alaska pair trawl fishery, and the North Carolina roe
mullet stop net fishery.  NMFS is currently in the process of contacting
participants in these fisheries to notify them of the requirements of Category
II fisheries. 

<P>Participants in fisheries that have been placed in Category I or II must
register with NMFS, pay a registration fee of $25, and carry an observer if
requested.  Those fishers participating in Category I or II fisheries in Oregon
and Washington do not need to pay the registration fee, as registration under
the MMPA has been coordinated with these states' fishery registration process
at no additional cost.  Participants in Category III fisheries do not have to
register with NMFS.  All fishers, regardless of the category of their fishery,
must report all injuries and mortalities of marine mammals that occur
incidental to their fishing operations within 48 hours. 

<P>NMFS received many comments on the 1996 proposed List of Fisheries, and, as
always, we appreciate your involvement.  We anticipate publishing a proposed
List of Fisheries for 1997 during the early summer of 1996, and hope that you
will continue to be involved in this part of the regulatory process.
<P><A HREF="#Top of page">Return to top of page</A>
<HR><A NAME="2"></A><H3>Effective Date of 1995 List Extended</H3>

<P>The 1995 List of Fisheries will be in effect until March 31, 1996, and on
April 1 the 1996 list will go into effect.  The original effective date of the
1996 list was to be January 1, 1996; however, the delay in publishing the final
list has prevented NMFS from providing sufficient notice to vessel owners
participating in Category I and II fisheries of their requirement to register. 
As a result, all vessel owners that obtained a marine mammal exemption
certificate in 1993, 1994, or 1995, will continue to be exempted from the take
prohibitions of the MMPA until March 31, 1996.

<P>NMFS is currently mailing out new registration forms to vessel owners and
operators.  Those who will participate in a Category I or II fishery on or
shortly after April 1, 1996 must return their registration form by March 1 to
insure that NMFS can process their application and issue an authorization
certificate by April 1.  Those who will participate in a Category I or II
fishery in 1996 after April 1 must submit their registration form at least 30
days before they expect to start fishing. For more information, contact Robyn
Angliss at 301-713-2322.

<HR><A NAME="4"></A><H3>Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Act:</H3>
<H4><EM>Spotlight on the Stranding Network</EM></H4>

<P>In 1992 the Congress enacted the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response
Act (MMHSRA), which became Title IV of the MMPA.  Title IV has three basic
components statutory recognition of the marine mammal stranding networks,
procedures for responding to unusual mortality events affecting marine mammals,
and a National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank.  As part of an effort to cover the
entire scope of the MMHSRA, this issue presents information on the first of
these components -- marine mammal strandings and the stranding network.  Other
components of the MMHSRA will be covered in subsequent issues.

<P>A Marine Mammal Stranding Network has been established in each coastal
state.  Most members of the Stranding Network are volunteers who respond to
both live and dead strandings of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises)
and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions).  Volunteers must satisfy minimum
requirements of experience with marine mammals in order to be issued letters of
authorization by the appropriate NMFS Regional Office for Network
participation.

<P>Although strandings are perceived as rare events, each year there are some
3,000 strandings reported in the United States,  Seals and sea lions account
for about 2,000 of the strandings.  Of the 1,000 cetacean strandings, more than
half involve bottlenose dolphins, but significant numbers of pygmy sperm
whales, harbor porpoises, and common dolphins also strand each year.  Stranding
Network members rehabilitate and release to the wild several hundred marine
mammals.  Although most of the animals released are seals and sea lions, the
number of cetaceans successfully treated has risen in the last few years.

<P>Even though live strandings receive a great deal of attention from the
public, the study of animals that strand dead can provide valuable information. 
To scientists, these stranded animals represent a research opportunity that
might not otherwise be available.  Network members are required to collect
certain basic biological data including species, sex, length, location, and any
evidence of human interaction.  In addition, they are encouraged to collect
other data and tissues that can be used for scientific analyses.  Even the most
basic information can provide information on the range of specific populations
and population dynamics.  For example, recent stranding data indicate that both
harbor seals and Arctic seals on the east coast may be expanding their range to
the south.

<P>Many Stranding Network members work beyond the basic data collection
requirements.  Additional research has provided information on:
<UL>
<LI>Disease in wild marine mammal populations,
<LI>Mortality rates, 
<LI>Life history parameters,
<LI>Population genetics
<LI>Types, levels, and effects of contaminants, and
<LI>Potentially serious human interactions.
</UL>

<P>From a management perspective, its important for NMFS to be aware of serious
diseases and human interactions that may be contributing to marine mammal
deaths.  By providing baseline data, stranding records can alert us to
increases in mortality rates even if they cannot provide total mortality
levels.  Examinations of carcasses also provide information on potentially
serious human interactions.  For example, strandings of seriously endangered
right whales in the eastern U.S. have shown that ship collisions are a
significant source of mortality.  Examinations of stranded harbor porpoises on
both the east and west coasts alerted NMFS serious interactions with coastal
gillnet fisheries.

<P><CENTER><STRONG>WHAT TO DO IF YOU ENCOUNTER A STRANDED MARINE MAMMAL</STRONG></CENTER>

<P><STRONG>Do not attempt to move or treat the animal yourself!</STRONG>  Among the problems
that have occurred are well-meaning individuals who pick up seal pups that they
think are abandoned, or attempt to return live cetaceans to the water.  In the
case of seals, they commonly haul out on land for extended periods to rest and
bear their young.  Pups may be left behind on the beach while the mother feeds. 
On both coasts, it is Network policy to observe such animals for a period of
time before taking action.  In the case of single strandings of live cetaceans,
researchers have found that cetaceans almost always strand because of serious
illness or injury.  Returning such an animal to the water postpones examination
and treatment and often results in the cetacean restranding in even worse
condition.  Live stranded animals also have the potential of transmitting
disease or seriously injuring untrained personnel.  As is the case with any
dead animal carcass, dead marine mammals may transmit pathogens.

<P><STRONG>Notify authorities</STRONG> of either live or dead stranded marine mammals so that
trained members of the Stranding Network can be contacted immediately.  Such
authorities include local police or marine patrols, state fish and wildlife
agencies, NMFS, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Time is critical!  In
the case of a live marine mammal, it is important for Network members to
examine an animal, administer first aid, and start a treatment regime as soon
as possible.  In the case of dead animals, carcasses decompose quickly and
useful information may be lost.

<P>The MMHSRA also instructed NMFS to develop guidelines for determining
whether rehabilitated animals are releasable to the wild.  These guidelines are
currently being developed and will be made available for public comment before
they are finalized.

<P><CENTER><STRONG>FIELD GUIDES AVAILABLE</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Recognizing the potential importance of information from stranded marine
mammals, the MMHSRA mandates efforts to improve the information flow to and
from the regional Stranding Networks and to improve Network capabilities by
developing protocols for response to stranding events and collection of tissues
from dead marine mammals. A field guide was produced by the Texas Sea Grant
program, in cooperation with NMFS, and distributed to Stranding Network members
in 1993.  In addition to a species identification guide, it contains basic
procedures for first aid and rehabilitation of live animals, necropsy
techniques, and protocols for collection of tissues from dead anials.  Field
Guides are available for $25 (includes shipping and handling) from: Texas A&M
University, Sea Grant Program, P.O. Box 1675, Galveston, TX, 77553-1675,
(409)762-9800.

<P>To supplement the field guide, a more detailed laboratory guide was prepared
on pinnipeds and distributed to Network members in 1994.  Copies of the
Pinniped Forensic, Necropsy and Tissue Collection Guide are available at no
charge from the Office of Protected Resources, Marine Mammal Division.  For

<P>Three Take Reduction Teams have been formed and are planning to meet in the
next several months.  The goal of the Take Reduction Teams will be to aid NMFS
in the development and implementation of Take Reduction Plans that will assist
in the recovery, or prevent the depletion of, strategic marine mammal stocks
that interact with Category I and II fisheries.  All meetings are open to the
public, and will be held from approximately 8:30AM - 4PM.

<P>The first meeting of  the Gulf of Maine Harbor Porpoise team was rescheduled
due to snow, and will be held February 14-15, 1996 at the Kings Grant Hotel,
Route 128 at Trask Lane, Danvers, Massachusetts.

<P>The first meeting of the Pacific Offshore Cetacean team will be held
February 13-14, 1996 at the Crown Sterling Suites Airport Hotel, 1440 East
Imperial Avenue, El Segundo, California.

<P>The first meeting of the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean team has not yet been
scheduled, but is planned for the end of February-early March, 1996.

<P>The membership of each team will be published in the Federal Register.  For

<HR><A NAME="1"></A><H3>What Should We Know Before We Free Willy?</H3>

<P>Public and media interest in releasing captive cetaceans (i.e., orca whales and dolphins) to
the wild has increased notably over the past two years as seen in recent fund-raising campaigns
for "Keiko," "Lolita," the Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary (SDS), and the "Welcome Home  Bogie  and
 Bacall  Project".  However, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is entrusted
by Congress to protect marine mammals in the wild.  As such, the reintroduction of captive
marine mammals into the wild must be done in a manner that protects wild stocks and populations
as well as ensuring the survivability of an individual to be released (i.e. preventing the
"take" of marine mammals).  Presently, no scientific protocols exist for  reintroducing captive
marine mammals back into the wild.   Therefore, NMFS has consistently stated in both press
releases and responses to letters of inquiry, that scientific protocols must be developed
through  issuance of scientific research permits for bona fide scientific reintroduction
projects which provide for public and scientific peer review.

<P>The lack of documentation and scientifically established protocols and their critical
importance for responsible reintroduction of any captive animal into the wild was acknowledged
by the U.S. Congress in 1994 regarding dolphins held by the U.S. Navy.  Although great media
pressure was placed on Congressional members to make these dolphins available for release into
the wild rather than placement in public display facilities, Congress did so by acknowledging
that any release of  these captive dolphins be done through scientifically accepted protocols,
stating in the Conference Report of H.R. 4650 (P.L. 103-335) that: 
<UL><EM>The conferees are informed that there are no scientifically established or accepted protocols for such releases. 
Moreover, documented success of previous attempts to reintroduce captive marine mammals to the
wild is sparse.  Accordingly, the conferees believe that any attempts at releasing Navy marine
mammals to the wild should be pursued cautiously and on an experimental basis until
scientifically sound protocols have been developed and reintroductions have proven successful. 
The conferees recognize that the Department of Defense does not have the authority to allow the
return of once-captive Navy marine mammals into the wild.  This authority rests with the
Department of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service.  Accordingly, the
conferees direct the Navy to cooperate with the Secretary of Commerce and the Marine Mammal
Commission in developing rigorous scientific protocols for experimental releases.  Given the
potential for "takes" under the [MMPA] or the Endangered Species Act, the conferees direct that
in no case shall any release be attempted unless authorized by a scientific research permit
issued by the Secretary of Commerce under the appropriate statutory authority." </EM></UL>

<P>Issues of concern surrunding the reintroduction of captive animals include disease transmission between released and wild individuals and stocks; unwanted genetic exchanges between introduced and endemic stocks/populations; the ability of the released animals to adequately forage and defend themselves from predators; and any behavioral patterns developed in captivity which could prove detrimental to the social structure of local populations as well as the social assimilation of the released animal.  

<P>The importance of these concerns as they apply to marine mammals has been underscored in recent years with a number of mass mortalities involving marine mammals along the coastlines of the U.S. and other areas around the world.  Most of the mass mortalities involving cetaceans and pinnipeds (seals) have been the result of disease, including diseases not previously seen in the affected populations.  With the limited knowledge currently available about marine mammal diseases, the need to prevent the introduction of disease into the wild is a very real and serious consideration.  In addition, human-caused introductions of non-indigenous species to local habitats has had serious ecological impacts throughout the world .  Because the captive cetaceans publicized for reintroduction are not endangered or threatened species (for which reintroduction to areas beyond their original genetic range is sometimes a consideration), there is concern over the long-term ecological impact of genetic mixing that would not have otherwise occurred without human interference.

<P>The sparse history of rehabilitated and released captive cetaceans has provided limited
documentation with questionable results.  NMFS has acted on only two applications for permits
to release dolphins.  One project (1989) involved the initial capture of dolphins for a period
of two years, followed by release to their original waters with on-going monitoring of their
success.  However, the other project (1987) was less quantifiable in its methodologies and
resulted in only 8 sightings two months after the dolphins' release.  No further sightings of
the dolphins from this release have been made.  In addition, this release project raised
environmental awareness over potential impacts to local dolphin populations (as the female
dolphin was pregnant) and other potential impacts on the ecology in the area.  Internationally,
a well known release project, "Into the Blue" (1992) lacks documentation of post-release
success.  More importantly, this project involved two Atlantic and one Pacific bottlenose
dolphin that were released in the Turks and Caicos Islands, far from their stocks of origin,
raising concern about genetic mixing.  Another well known effort was an attempt in Australia
(1992) to return captive aquarium dolphins, including some captive born, to the wild.  The
protocols for monitoring the dolphins  behavior, acclimation, foraging skills,
social-groupings, etc. were detailed and approached in a scientific manner.  Although there was
a clear effort to establish scientifically sound protocols that would be available for
repeatable projects in the future, this project resulted in a recapture of some of the dolphins
due to starvation and declining health.  Of the nine dolphins released by this project, three
had to be recaptured, one was presumed dead (a calf), and no confirmed sightings were made of
the remaining dolphins 43 days after their release.   

<P>With regard to "Keiko," "Lolita," and  "Bogie" and "Bacall", NMFS has received no acceptable
applications for scientific research permits to release these animals.  Specifically with
respect to the campaign to "Free Willy" to his native waters off the coast of Iceland, NMFS has
no knowledge that the Icelandic government would approve such a reintroduction.  Regardless of
an application's bona fide scientific merits, no permit could be issued without the foreign
government s consent to allow the animal to be exported and released into their jurisdictional
waters.

<P>In May 1996, two unauthorized releases of captive dolphins to the wild occurred.  On May 16,
the open water pen holding Bogie and Bacall of the "Welcome Home Project" was vandalized,
allowing the two dolphins to escape into the Indian River south of Melbourne, Florida.  On May
23, key personnel at the SDS illegally transported and released two of the ex-Navy dolphins,
"Luther" and "Buck," into Gulf waters off of the Florida Keys.  NMFS and stranding network
officials immediately began receiving reports of Luther begging from boats and  jet skis in the
area.  Within two weeks Luther and Buck were separately rescued.  Both were found in a state of
dehydration and had suffered lacerations.  Buck, who was rescued last, was visibly emaciated
and considerably underweight.  Efforts to find Bogie and Bacall continue.  

<P>On June 7, the remaining Navy dolphin at SDS, "Jake,"  was removed from the facility by NMFS
and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service after SDS's license was suspended due to
repeated violations of the Animal Welfare Act.

<HR><A NAME="2"><H3>General Authorizations Make Scietific Research Easier</H3>

<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA established a General Authorization program for bona fide
scientific research which does not exceed Level B harassment of marine mammal species not
listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The 1994 Amendments statutorily defined the
term "harassment" as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which: (i) has the potential to
injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has the
potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption
of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited, to migration, breathing, nursing, breeding,
feeding or sheltering (Level B harassment).  

<P>The Interim Final Rule for the General Authorization (GA) was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 1994.  The GA offers a 30-day streamlined process for authorizing Level B harassment, in contrast to the more lengthy public and scientific review regarding the permit
process.  The GA requires the principal investigator to submit a Letter of Intent detailing the
proposed activities.  Upon determination that the activities are bona fide and will not exceed
Level B harassment, NMFS will issue a Letter of Confirmation.  Although this process will
provide researchers a more efficient means of obtaining authority to conduct scientific
research projects with low levels of impact, the streamlined process should not be interpreted
as streamlining the information required in the Letter of Intent.  Because the GA process does
not allow for the give and take involved in scientific review, the Letter of Intent must be as
detailed as possible, particularly with regard to the purpose of the research, methodology, how
the research qualifies as bona fide, and the experience and qualifications of the personnel
identified to conduct activities under the GA.

<P>From November 1994 to December 31, 1995, NMFS received 27 Letters of Intent to conduct Level B harassment of marine mammal species or stocks for consideration under the GA.  Of these, 19
were issued a Letter of Confirmation and 8 were returned for insufficient information, failure
to qualify as bona fide research, or inclusion of Level A harassment activities or  marine
mammal species listed under the ESA for which the General Authorization does not apply.

<P>The GA program has now been in place for over a year.  Currently, activities which qualify
under the GA include photo-identification studies, behavioral observations, and vessel and
aerial population surveys.  During the past year, NMFS and researchers alike have had an
opportunity to review the process and assess areas for improvement.  The current controversial
nature of acoustic studies on marine mammals warrants special attention for consideration under
the GA.  Presently, only passive acoustic research (e.g. listening to marine mammals via
hydrophones) is regarded as Level B harassment.  However, flexibility for active acoustic
research such as play-back experiments and pinger studies, may merit consideration as Level B
harassment activities.  These research techniques are being explored for use in reducing
incidental interactions between marine mammals and commercial fishing operations.  Additional
concerns have been raised regarding requests to modify GAs, and how this might jeopardize the
intent and integrity of the GA process if allowed to evolve into a parallel permit process
which includes amendment provisions.  NMFS will evaluate these issues and the comments received
on the interim rule for future publication of  a Final Rule.

<P><A HREF="#Top of page">Return to top of page</A>
<HR><A NAME="3"><H3>Take Reduction Teams Are Making Progress</H3>

<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA established an integrated process for NMFS to manage marine
mammal interactions with commercial fishing operations.  In the last two years, NMFS has
developed stock assessment reports for every marine mammal that occurs in U.S. waters, and has
classified each U.S. fishery according to its level of marine mammal serious injury or
mortality.  NMFS must now develop Take Reduction Plans (TRP) for those fisheries with the
greatest impact on marine mammal stocks (Category I and II fisheries).  TRP's will assist in
the recovery or prevent the depletion of strategic marine mammal stocks by outlining strategies
for reducing the number of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial
fishing operations.

<P>TRP's are to be developed by NMFS with the help of Take Reduction Teams (TRT).  These teams are to be made up of individuals who represent the span of interests impacted by the strategies to reduce takes, including commercial and recreational fishing industries, fishery management
councils, interstate commissions, academic and scientific organizations, state officials,
environmental groups, Native Alaskans or other Native American interests if appropriate, and
NMFS representatives.

<P>The immediate goal of a Take Reduction Plan is to reduce, within 6 months of its
implementation, the incidental take of marine mammals to the levels below the Potential
Biological Removal Level, or PBR.  The long term goal of the plan is to reduce, within 5 years
of its implementation, the incidental take of marine mammals to insignificant levels
approaching zero mortality and serious injury rates.

<P>Once notice of the team's formation has been published in the Federal Register, the team has 6 months to develop a draft TRP.  The draft TRP must be approved by all members on the team
before being forwarded to NMFS.  NMFS has 60 days to publish the team's draft plan, including
any proposed changes to  the plan.  The public then has 90 days to review the plan and provide
comments to NMFS on the TRP and proposed regulations.  If the TRT cannot come to a consensus on
a draft plan, NMFS has 8 months from the date the team was formed to develop a proposed plan
and implementing regulations for public comment.  NMFS can use the team's deliberations as the
basis for its proposed TRP.  After the close of the comment period on the proposed plan and
implementing regulations, NMFS has 60 days to publish a final plan and final regulations.

<P>Regulations to implement a plan may include, but are not limited to, fishery-specific limits on incidental and serious injury and mortality, time-area restrictions on fishing, the use of
alternative fishing gear or techniques, the development of such gear or technology, the
convening of expert skippers panels, efforts to educate commercial fishermen on the importance
of reducing incidental takes, and a monitoring program to determine the effectiveness of take
reduction measures.  

<P>To date, three TRTs have been established, and one more is scheduled to be in place by the end of summer:

<UL>
<LI>The Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise TRT
<LI>The Pacific Offshore Cetacean TRT
<LI>The Atlantic Offshore Cetacean TRT
<LI>The Atlantic Large Whale TRT (summer 1996)
</UL>

<P>Each team is being facilitated by a contracted dispute resolution specialist.

<P>The Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise TRT was formed February 12, 1996, and is focused on reducing the incidental take of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine groundfish sink gillnet fishery.  The team has 23 members and met a total of four times.  The team reached a preliminary consensus on a draft plan at it's last meeting on May 23-24, 1996.  The plan built upon Amendment 7 to the Gulf of Maine Fishery Management Plan for groundfish by expanding closures and using acoustic deterrent devices to further reduce harbor porpoise bycatch.  The team expects to forward its plan to NMFS by August 12, 1996.

<P>The Pacific Offshore Cetacean TRT was also formed on February 12, 1996, and is focused on
reducing the incidental take of several strategic marine mammal stocks in the California/Oregon
swordfish and thresher shark drift gillnet fishery.  The team has 15 members and has met four
times to date.  Their fifth meeting, on June 25-27, 1996, in Santa Monica, California (see box
below), is open to the public.  A scoping meeting to encourage public participation in the
process and to obtain comments on alternatives that will be considered by NMFS prior to
publishing a final TRP, will be held from 7 to 10 PM on Tuesday, June 25th at the same
location.  The team expects to reach a consensus on a draft plan at their final meeting and
forward it to NMFS by August 12, 1996.

<P>The Atlantic Offshore Cetacean TRT was formed on May 24, 1996, and is focused on reducing the incidental take of several strategic marine mammal stocks in the Atlantic pelagic longline,
driftnet, and pair trawl fisheries for swordfish and tuna.  The team has 18 members, has had
one meeting to date, and will have their next meeting on July 30-31, 1996, at the Government
Center Holiday Inn (see box below).  Meetings are open to the public.  The team will meet a
total of four times before forwarding a draft plan to NMFS by November 24, 1996.

<P>The Atlantic Large Whale TRT is currently being established and will focus on reducing the
incidental take of endangered and threatened whales in the South Atlantic shark gillnet fishery
and various lobster and crab pot fisheries.  The team will probably meet four times before

<HR><A NAME="4"><H3>Captive Care Standards for Marine Mammals Under the Animal Welfare Act</H3>

<P>Between April 1-3, 1996, NMFS staff were included as non-voting observers to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service s (USDA-APHIS) Negotiated
Rulemaking for marine mammal captive care standards under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).  This
Federal advisory committee consists of several voting and nonvoting ("observer") members.  NMFS
took this opportunity to suggest that the advisory committee address certain practices
authorized under the AWA that have the potential of impacting marine mammals in the wild which
are under the jurisdiction of the MMPA.  Specifically, open-water pens and releases of captive
marine mammals to the wild for various purposes (i.e., swim-with programs, filming, and
scientific research) have the potential of facilitating disease transmission and unwanted
genetic exchange between captive animals and those in the wild.  

<P>NMFS recommended that facilities with openwater pens be required to have closed-water system
quarantine pools.  In addition, NMFS recommended that the USDA-APHIS proposed rule include an
explicit reference to the MMPA requirement that captive marine mammals may only be released to
the wild under a scientific research permit issued by NMFS.  Also, NMFS suggested that the AWA
regulations which allow the public to feed captive marine mammals  (i.e., feeding or petting
pools) be amended to require that the public be informed that feeding and interacting with
marine mammals in the wild is harmful to the animals; why it is harmful, and that it is
prohibited under Federal law.   The recommendations from this negotiated rulemaking are under
consideration by USDA/APHIS for possible publication of a proposed rulemaking on the AWA care
and maintenance standards.

<HR><A NAME="5"><H3>NMFS Enforcement Initiates Voluntary Compliance Program</H3>

<P>In the latter part of 1995, NMFS  Office of Enforcement adopted the Voluntary Compliance
Program (VCP) as a national initiative to proactively meet the enforcement challenges facing
the management of the nation s marine resources.  In 1995, the annual enforcement report
recorded 2,300 new investigations.  Based on annual statistics and trends, this number is
predicted to increase significantly by the end of 1996.  With smaller budgets available for
implementing NMFS expanding responsibilities, and newly emerging activities impacting marine
resources, NMFS  Office of Enforcement adopted the VCP as a supplement to the more traditional
techniques of enforcement.  

<P>Based on community-oriented, problem-focused policing models, the VCP rests on education and
awareness of enforcement issues through teamwork and partnerships at the grassroots level. 
Through cooperative approaches with stakeholders in a marine resource, NMFS hopes to enlist
their participation in custom tailoring solutions to marine resource management problems unique
to a community or activity, and employing voluntary rather than punitive measures to encourage
compliance.  

<P>Through the VCP, NMFS will be able to establish cooperative community-based relationships to
expand public education and outreach efforts addressing a variety of marine resource management
problems.  NMFS is particularly interested in exploring VCP options to educate the public about
the harmful impact of  human/marine mammal interactions in the wild and the exploitation of
these activities as "eco-tourism."  Presently, the VCP is comprised of the following programs:

<OL>
<LI>Partners-in-Problem-Solving (PiPS) teams the Office of Enforcement with marine resource
constituents in grassroots partnerships to identify, define and solve marine resource
enforcement problems with enduring tailor-made solutions.
<LI>The Fix-It Ticket (FIT) Program provides the first time offender a good faith opportunity to "fix" minor technical violations within a designated time frame without threat of penalty. The FIT Program is jointly administered by the Office of Enforcement and the Office of the
Assistant General Counsel for Enforcement and Litigation.
<LI> ProACTION uses education to promote understanding of the NOAA/NMFS enforcement mission.  It supports environmental education through the Office of Enforcement s Marine Mammal Loan Program and disseminates important enforcement messages through a variety of outreach mediums.
<LI>The NOAA Fisheries Enforcement Hotline provides live operator coverage, 24 hours a day, 7
days a week for anyone in the United States to report a Federal fisheries or marine mammal
violation.  The telephone service is free to the caller and enables instant contact with
enforcement personnel.  TO REPORT A VIOLATION CALL  1-800-853-1964.
<LI>Recognition and Rewards (R&R) offers tangible appreciation to marine resource constituents
for special contributions toward conserving the nation s living marine resources.
</OL>

<P>The NMFS  Office of Enforcement is currently comprised of 111 Special Agents who investigate
alleged criminal and civil violations, and 22 Fishery Patrol Officers on the front-line of
enforcing the Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  These agents and officers are
responsible for enforcing all Federal statutes and regulations under the jurisdiction of NOAA
regarding fisheries, protected species, marine sanctuaries and other ocean resources.  They are
charged with enforcing these laws and regulations throughout the United States, Tust and
Territories, including all fishing activities in Federal waters within the 200 mile Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ), and limited jurisdiction over anadramous species, all Continental Shelf
fishery resources, and highly migratory species extending beyond the EEZ.

<P>For more information about the VCP, contact Special Agent Carol Teraoka in the Office of
Enforcement at (301) 427-2300.  For more information on human/marine mammal interactions in the

<HR><A NAME="6"><H3>Permit Final Rule Published</H3>

<P>The final rule for procedural requirements for species exception permits was published in the Federal Register on May 10, 1996.  This final rule provides the requirements basic to all
special exemption permits to take, import, and export marine mammals under the MMPA and ESA. 
In addition, the rule includes additional requirements necessary to receive a permit to take
marine mammals for purposes of scientific research, and clarifies the administrative procedures
for determining the releasability or other disposition of stranded marine mammals that have
been rehabilitated.

<P>As discussed in the Preamble, this final rule responds to and incorporates many of the comments received on the 1993 proposed rule, and implements those provisions that are still relevant and/or under the jurisdiction of the NMFS since the passage of the 1994 Amendments.  

<P>Lastly, this rule also accounts for non-discretionary changes made to the MMPA by the
Amendments, such as eliminating concerns over duplicative research and providing for emergency
authorization to take marine mammals prior to public comment in situations of injury to a
species, stock, or individual marine mammal, or loss of a unique research opportunity.

<HR><A NAME="1"></A><H3>NMFS Proposes Additional Protection for Right Whales</H3>

<P>The northern right whale is the large whale species most in danger of becoming extinct in the near future.  It is estimated that there are approximately 300 northern right whales remaining in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.  Little is known about the biology or behavior of these whales beyond what may be gleaned by identifying individuals by their unique markings and by using satellite tags to determine where the whales go when they leave their feeding and calving grounds.  In the last twelve months, there have been 9 confirmed right whale mortalities.  Although the cause of all mortalities could not be determined, it is unquestionable that these mortalities have a severe impact on the population.  We do know that increasing vessel traffic and occasional interactions with fishing gear are among the factors delaying the recovery of this species from the historical impacts of commercial whaling.

<P>NMFS is proposing several actions designed to provide additional protection for right whales.  Federal actions will focus primarily on the major causes of known mortalities - ship strikes, harassment of whales, and entanglement in fishing gear.

<P>At the recommendation of Right Whale Recovery  Team, and in response to a petition received from GreenWorld, Inc., NMFS is proposing to prohibit most approaches within 500 yards of a northern right whale (August 7, 1996, Federal Register). 
 
<P>Vessel interactions, especially ship strikes, have been identified as one of the major threats facing these whales.  NMFS estimates that ship strikes are responsible for about one right whale mortality per year.  The recovery plan developed for the northern right whale also recognizes that human-induced disturbances are another factor impeding the recovery of the population.  Approaches to marine mammals by aircraft below certain altitudes have the potential to harass marine mammals.  Direct contact between humans and marine mammals is rare, but NMFS has received reports of "buzzing" incidents, where a person on a small high-speed  ("jet ski") or other watercraft deliberately approaches a marine mammal, swimming and scuba activities near marine mammals, touching or petting incidents, as well as photography and video activities.  If whales become accustomed to vessels and related activity they may become especially vulnerable to vessel collision or other adverse impacts.
<P>The proposed rule for protection of right whales would:
<UL>
<LI>prohibit approaching within 500 yards of a right whale-  prohibit head-on approaches to northern right whales  once a right whale has been sighted
<LI>prohibit the positioning of a vessel in the path of a right whale
<LI>require right whale avoidance measures necessary to avoid a take under the MMPA or ESA.
</UL>

<P>On July 16, 1996, NMFS published in the Federal Register a proposed list of fisheries (LOF) for 1997 (<A HREF="#2">see article below</A>).  Based on a review of 1990-1994 large whale entanglement reports received by the agency, NMFS has reports of at least 1 right whale, 11 humpback whales, and 6 minke whales seriously injured or killed as a result of interactions with lobster pot gear.  NMFS has determined that this level of incidental serious injury and mortality to these endangered whale populations warrants a proposed reclassification of all lobster trap/pot fisheries in the Gulf of Maine and mid-Atlantic into Category I.  Vessel owners or operators in Category 1 fisheries must register their vessels with NMFS, pay a registration fee, and, if requested, carry observers on board their vessels who will gather information on the impact of fishing operations on marine mammals.  Public comments on the proposed LOF must be received by NMFS by October 15, 1996.

<P>To address takes of northern right whales and other large whales in commercial fisheries of the Northwest Atlantic, NMFS announced the establishment of a Large Whale Take Reduction Team (TRT) on August 6, 1996 in the Federal Register.  The team will focus on the lobster pot/trap fishery, the southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery, the mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, and the Gulf of Maine sink-gillnet fishery.  Members of the Large Whale TRT include representatives from NMFS, state resource and environmental departments, environmental groups, fishery management councils, fishermen's associations, and marine mammal biologists.  The first meeting of the team will be held on September 16-17, 1996 at the Tara's Ferncroft Resort in Danvers, Massachusetts.  Meetings are open to the public and will be held from approximately 9AM to 5PM each day.

<HR><A NAME="2"><H3>Proposed List of Fisheries for 1997 Published</H3>

<P>NMFS published the proposed List of Fisheries (LOF) for 1997 on July 16, 1996.  The LOF, published pursuant to Section 118 of the MMPA, classifies all U.S. commercial fisheries into one of three categories based on the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that occur incidental to fishing operations.  A description of the classification scheme is located in the final rule implementing Section 118 (August 30, 1995, Federal Register). As a result of NMFS' review of available data on the levels of marine mammal incidental serious injury and mortality in commercial fisheries, several changes to the LOF are now being proposed:

<UL>
<LI>Reclassification of the Gulf of Maine/U.S. mid-Atlantic lobster pot/trap fisheries from Category III to Category I based on serious injuries and mortalities of right whales and humpback whales.
<LI>Reclassification of the California squid purse seine fishery from Category III to Category II based on historical interactions between this fishery and pilot whales.
<LI>Combination of the offshore monkfish bottom gillnet (Category III) with either the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery (Category I) or the U.S. mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery (Category II).  All fishers using bottom gillnet gear to target monkfish would register under Category I or II, depending on where they intend to fish.
<LI>Changes to the names and boundaries of the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery and the U.S. mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery to reflect a change in the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan and to eliminate a boundary overlap.
<LI>Separation of the Oregon swordfish/blue shark surface longline fishery into the "Oregon swordfish floating longline fishery" and the "Oregon blue shark floating longline fishery" to reflect the current fishery licensing practices in the State of Oregon.  Both fisheries would remain in Category II.
</UL>


<P>In addition, because there has been confusion regarding the definitions of trawl fisheries in the U.S. North Atlantic,  NMFS specifically requests public comments on appropriate definitions of the trawl fisheries. 

<P>NMFS proposes that, if registration information can be supplied through integration with existing state, interjurisdictional, or federally managed fisheries registration systems, individual fishers would automatically be registered under the MMPA and would not have to fill out separate registration materials.

<P>Comments on the proposed List of Fisheries must be submitted to NMFS by October 15, 1996.  For more information or a copy of the Federal Register  notice, contact <A HREF="mailto:Robyn.Angliss@noaa.gov">Robyn Angliss</A> at (301) 713-2322.

<HR><A NAME="4"><H3>Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force to Meet</H3>

<P>On August 26, 1996, NMFS published notice in the Federal Register of a public meeting of the Ballard Locks Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force.  The Task Force meeting will be held September 16-17, 1996 in the Snoqualmie Room at the Marriott Hotel, 3201 S. 176th Street, Seattle, Washington.  Meeting hours will be from 9 AM to 5 PM each day.  The Task Force was formed in 1994 pursuant to Section 120 of the MMPA to provide recommendations to NMFS on an application from the State of Washington for the lethal removal of California sea lions that were negatively impacting a wild run of winter steelhead that migrate through the Ballard Locks.  Section 120 of the MMPA provides the process under which states may apply for authority to intentionally lethally remove pinnipeds which are having a significant impact on the decline or recovery of salmonid fishery stocks.

<P>As previously reported in the MMPA Bulletin, the Task Force recommended approval of lethal removal of individually identifiable California sea lions at the Ballard Locks.  On January 4, 1995, NMFS issued a 3-year Letter of Authorization (LOA), with conditions, for lethal removal of individually identified California sea lions.  To date, no sea lions have been lethally removed at the Ballard Locks.  Three of the principal problem sea lions were captured in 1996 and removed from the Ballard Locks by placing them in permanent captivity at Sea World in Orlando, Florida.  

<P>As required by Section 120, the Task Force is being reconvened to evaluate the effectiveness of the lethal removal authorization and alternative measures which were implemented by Washington during the 1995/96 winter steelhead season.  The meeting is open to the public; however, the public will not be allowed to discuss or debate the issues with members of the Task Force at the meetings.  There will be an opportunity for the public to provide comments to the Task Force at 4 PM on the first day of the meeting.  For more information, contact Joe Scordino at (206) 526-6140.

<HR><A NAME="5"><H3>Former Navy Dolphins Rescued in Florida Keys</H3>

<P>As mentioned in the last issue of the MMPA Bulletin ("<A HREF="mayjun96.html#1"> What Should We Know Before We Free Willy?</A>"), NMFS embarked upon a rescue effort to recover the dolphins "Buck" and "Luther" who were illegally transported and released to the wild off Key West, Florida, in May 1996.  In a related action, NMFS, in cooperation with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), seized the dolphin "Jake" from the Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary (SDS) facility on Sugarloaf Key in June 1996.  Both efforts were conducted under the authority of the MMPA and at the direction of on-site NMFS personnel from the Office of Protected Resources and the Office of Enforcement. NMFS and APHIS had been in the process of planning and obtaining a warrant for the seizure of all three dolphins when the unauthorized release of Buck and Luther occurred.  The team organized by NMFS to assess the health of Buck and Luther was comprised of personnel from the Dolphin Research Center (DRC), the U.S. Navy's marine mammal research program, Florida Keys Wildlife Rescue,  the Marine Mammal Conservancy, and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.  Additional logistical assistance was provided by the U.S. Naval Air Station in Key West, the Florida Marine Patrol, and the U.S. Coast Guard. 

<P>Immediately after the release of Luther on May 23, he appeared in Key West marinas and public waterways alone, visibly underweight and with three deep lacerations on his right side below the dorsal fin.  The NMFS rescue team was assembled on May 25, and observed Luther approaching moving vessels, interacting with the public, performing trained behaviors, begging for food, and being fed fish-bait and unidentified objects.  Luther's behavior demonstrated that he was still highly conditioned and dependent upon human care indicating that he was not prepared for life in the wild.  The NMFS rescue team was particularly concerned about Luther's poor body condition and injuries which required prompt medical attention. 
 
<P>On May 30, the NMFS rescue team was able to safely secure Luther in a lagoon at the U.S. Naval Air Base on Boca Chica Key and provide him with necessary veterinary care.  The professional marine mammal trainers who were part of the rescue team were able to work easily with Luther without causing him stress by using standard operant conditioning training techniques.  Luther's responsiveness to an acoustic recall and hand signals enabled the team to engage him in a trained boat-follow and lead him to safety without ever having to deploy a net for capture.

<P>On June 4, Buck was found in Vaca Cut near Marathon Key in considerably worse body condition than Luther.  Buck was emaciated and had numerous injuries: three deep gashes on his head between the blow hole and dorsal fin, a deep puncture wound on his right side below the dorsal fin, and four long horizontal lacerations on the left side of his peduncle.  Buck's emaciated condition was evident by the concave shape of his head, the protrusion of his scapulae, and the protrusion of his tail vertebrae.  Members of the public who alerted the rescue team of Buck's whereabouts reported that he, similar to Luther, had been approaching people begging for food and was being fed.  

<P>The NMFS rescue team observed that Buck was also still highly conditioned to humans.  The marine mammal trainers were able to engage Buck in a boat-follow and lead him to the DRC facility in Marathon.  Buck swam into the DRC holding pool on his own without being forced by the rescue team.  Once Buck was secured at DRC, he was provided with medical care.

<P>On June 7, NMFS seized Jake, the only remaining former Navy dolphin at the SDS facility.  Seizure occurred after APHIS suspended SDS's exhibitor's license for multiple violations of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), including the failure to utilize a qualified veterinarian, provide necessary physical examinations and blood testing, and properly maintain the dolphins within the facility.  The seizure was conducted pursuant to the MMPA, which authorizes NMFS to seize animals that are held by a public display facility which does not have a valid AWA exhibitor's license.  Although Jake was not in the same critical condition as Buck and Luther, the veterinarians who examined him determined that he was underweight and needed to be provided a nutritional diet.

<P>Given his poor medical condition, Buck did not travel with the other dolphins to San Diego.  He continues to recover at DRC and his health is being monitored closely.
<P>NMFS sincerely appreciates the hard work of everyone who assisted with the rescue and seizure operations.  Many individuals and organizations dedicated their time, expertise, and equipment to ensure that Buck, Luther, and Jake were returned to safety and given proper medical attention.

<HR><A NAME="6"><H3>Continued Efforts to Reduce Takes of Marine Mammals in Fisheries</H3>

<P>Since our last update in the last edition of the MMPA Bulletin, two Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) have submitted draft Take Reduction Plans (TRPs) to NMFS and one more team has been established.  A fourth team is in the midst of developing a TRP.
 
<P>The Harbor Porpoise TRT submitted a draft TRP in August 1996.  The 24 members of the TRT reached consensus on the draft TRP after five meetings.  The TRP outlines several measures to reduce takes of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.  The plan builds on time-area fishing closures already instituted by the New England Fishery Management Council and also proposes the use of acoustic devices ("pingers") in areas and at times when the bycatch of harbor porpoise is highest.

<P>The Pacific Offshore Cetacean TRT also submitted a draft TRP in August 1996.  It represents the consensus view of the 14 members of the TRT.  The TRP addresses the takes of several strategic stocks in the California/Oregon swordfish drift gillnet fishery.  The TRT recommended that nets be fished at a minimum depth of 6 fathoms, and that skipper workshops be held to educate fishers about marine mammals and solicit input on ways to reduce takes.  The TRT also recommended that NMFS conduct an experiment to test the effectiveness of acoustic devices ("pingers") in reducing marine mammal takes.

<P>NMFS must review and make any changes that may be necessary within 60 days of receipt of the TRP.  NMFS must also prepare proposed regulations to implement the provisions of the proposed plan in the same period.  The proposed plan and regulations will then be available for public comment for a minimum of 90 days.

<P>The Atlantic Offshore Cetacean TRT was established to address the take of several strategic stocks in the Atlantic pelagic driftnet, longline and pair trawl fisheries.  The TRT has met twice and has two more meetings scheduled (see box).

<P>The Atlantic Large Whale TRT  will focus on reducing the incidental take of several species of whales in the South Atlantic shark gillnet fishery, the lobster fishery, the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery, and the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.  The TRT's first meeting is this month (see <A HREF="#Upcoming TRT Meetings">"Upcoming TRT Meetings"</A>).

<P>The Mid-Atlantic Coastal Gillnet TRT is being formed to address takes of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoise in coastal gillnet fisheries off the mid-Atlantic. Potential team members are being contacted and a date for the first meeting will be announced in the next edition of the MMPA Bulletin.

The Office of Protected Resources, located in Silver Spring, Maryland, coordinates marine species protection, conservation and restoration for the National Marine Fisheries Service. Authority for these programs comes from two pivotal environmental laws of the 1970's; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. 
</P><P>
Within the office, specialists in marine resources and ecology, fishery biology, and veterinary medicine coordinate and manage programs in the following areas:  Biodiversity Assessment and Conservation, Endangered Species Protection, Marine Mammal Protection, Research and Public Display Permits, and a Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program.  The office assists in managing these programs with regional management offices and science centers located in coastal areas of the United States from New England to the Atlantic coastal states, the Gulf of Mexico, California, the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P><P>
Office actions are governed by the <A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov/protected_species.html">
Recover Protected Species Initiative
</A> of NOAA's Strategic Plan, which proposes to:           
</P><UL>
<LI>
Promote the recovery of currently depleted species and take proactive steps to avoid depletion of species of concern

<center><h2>PREFACE</h2></center>
<p>On April 30,1994, Public Law 103-238 was enacted allowing significant changes to provisions within the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries are now addressed under three new Sections.  This new regime replaced the interim exemption that has regulated fisheries-related incidental takes since 1988.  Section 117, Stock Assessments, required the establishment of three regional scientific review groups to advise
and report on the status of marine mammal stocks within Alaskan waters, along the Pacific Coast (including Hawaii), and the Atlantic Coast (including the Gulf of Mexico).  This report provides information on the marine mammal stocks of Alaska under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service.

<p>Each stock assessment includes a description of the stock's geographic range, a minimum population estimate, current population trends, current and maximum net productivity rates, optimum sustainable population levels and allowable removal levels, and estimates of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury through interactions with commercial fisheries and subsistence hunters.  Under the new regime, these data will be used to evaluate the progress of each fishery towards achieving its goal of zero mortality and serious injury.

<p>This is a working document.  Each stock assessment report is designed to stand alone and will be updated as new information becomes available.  The authors wish to solicit any new data or comments that would serve to improve future stock assessment reports.

<CENTER><H3>DETERMINATION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THREATENED SPECIES</H3></CENTER>

<P>Sec. 4. (a) GENERAL.-
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of any of the following factors:
<UL>
<P>(A) the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;
<P>(B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;
<P>(C) disease or predation;
<P>(D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms;
<P>(E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.
</UL>
<P>(2) With respect to any species over which program responsibilities have been vested in the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970-
<UL>
<P>(A) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should-
<UL>      
<P>(i) be listed as an endangered species or a threatened species, or
<P>(ii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species, he shall so inform the Secretary of the Interior, who shall list such species in accordance with this section;
</UL>
<P>(B) in any case in which the Secretary of Commerce determines that such species should-
<UL>
<P>(i) be removed from any list published pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, or
<P>(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species, he shall recommend such action to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Interior, if he concurs in the recommendation, shall implement such action; and
</UL>
<P>(C) the Secretary of the Interior may not list or remove from any list any such species, and may not change the status of any such species which are listed, without a prior favorable determination made pursuant to this section by the Secretary of Commerce.
</UL>
<P>(3) The Secretary, by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) and to the maximum extent prudent and determinable-
<UL>
<P>(A) shall, concurrently with making a determination under paragraph (1) that a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat; and
<P>(B) may, from time-to-time thereafter as appropriate, revise such designation.
</UL></UL>
<P>(b) BASIS FOR DETERMINATIONS.-
<UL>
<P>(1)(A) The Secretary shall make determinations required by subsection (a)(1) solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to him after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.
<UL>
<P>(B) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to species which have been-
<UL>
<P>(i) designated as requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, or pursuant to any international agreement; or
<P>(ii) identified as in danger of extinction, or likely to become so within the foreseeable future, by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish or wildlife or plants.
</UL></UL>
<P>(2) The Secretary shall designate critical habitat, and make revisions thereto, under subsection (a)(3) on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat.  The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.
<P>(3)(A) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, United States Code, to add a species to, or to remove a species from, either of the lists published under subsection (c), the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.  If such a petition is found to present such information, the Secretary shall promptly commence a review of the status of the species concerned.  The Secretary shall promptly publish each finding made under this subparagraph in the Federal Register.
<UL>
<P>(B) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under subparagraph (A) to present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, the Secretary shall make one of the following findings:
<UL>
<P>(i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.
<P>(ii) The petitioned action is warranted in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a general notice and the complete text of a proposed regulation to implement such action in accordance with paragraph (5).
<P>(iii) The petitioned action is warranted but that-
<UL>
<P>(I) the immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a final regulation implementing the petitioned action in accordance with paragraphs (5) and (6) is precluded by pending proposals to determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species, and
<P>(II) expeditious progress is being made to add qualified species to either of the lists published under subsection (c) and to remove from such lists species for which the protec- tions of the Act are no longer necessary, in which case the Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register, together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and data on which the finding is based.
</UL></UL>
<P>(C)(i) A petition with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be treated as a petition that is resubmitted to the Secretary under subparagraph (A) on the date of such finding and that presents substantial scientific or commercial information that the petitioned action may be warranted.
<UL>
<P>(ii) Any negative finding described in subparagraph (A) and any finding described in subparagraph (B) (i) or (iii) shall be subject to judicial review.
<P>(iii) The Secretary shall implement a system to monitor effectively the status of all species with respect to which a finding is made under subparagraph (B)(iii) and shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7 to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such species.
</UL>
<P>(D)(i) To the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving the petition of an interested person under section 553(e) of title 5, United States Code, to revise a critical habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that the revision may be warranted.  The Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register.
<UL>
<P>(ii) Within 12 months after receiving a petition that is found under clause (i) to present substantial information indicating that the requested revision may be warranted, the Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the Federal Register.
</UL></UL>
<P>(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection, the provisions of section 553 of title 5, United States Code (relating to rulemaking procedures), shall apply to any regulation promulgated to carry out the purposes of this Act.
<P>(5) With respect to any regulation proposed by the Secretary to implement a determination, designation, or revision referred to in subsection (a) (1) or (3), the Secretary shall-
<UL>
<P>(A) not less than 90 days before the effective date of the regulation-
<UL>
<P>(i) publish a general notice and the complete text of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, and
<P>(ii) give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the complete text of the regulation) to the State agency in each State in which the species is believed to occur, and to each county or equivalent jurisdiction in which the species is believed to occur, and invite the comment of such agency, and each such jurisdiction, thereon; 
</UL>
<P>(B) insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of State, give notice of the proposed regulation to each foreign nation in which the species is believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high seas, and invite the comment of such nation thereon;
<P>(C) give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional scientific organizations as he deems appropriate;
<P>(D) publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of general circulation in each area of the United States in which the species is believed to occur; and
<P>(E) promptly hold one public hearing on the proposed regulation if any person files a request for such a hearing within 45 days after the date of publication of general notice.
</UL>
<P>(6)(A) Within the one-year period beginning on the date on which general notice is published in accordance with paragraph (5)(A)(i) regarding a proposed regulation, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register-
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) if a determination as to whether a species is an endangered species or a threatened species, or a revision of critical habitat, is involved, either-
<UL>
<P>(I) a final regulation to implement such determination,
<P>(II) a final regulation to implement such revision or a finding that such revision should not be made,
<P>(III) notice that such one-year period is being extended under subparagraph (B)(i), or
<P>(IV) notice that the proposed regulation is being withdrawn under subparagraph
(B)(ii), together with the finding on which such withdrawal is based; or
</UL>
<P>(ii) subject to subparagraph (C), if a designation of critical habitat is involved, either-
<UL>
<P>(I) a final regulation to implement such designation, or
<P>(II) notice that such one-year period is being extended under such subparagraph. 
</UL></UL>
<P>(B)(i) If the Secretary finds with respect to a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) that there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination or revision concerned the Secretary may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) for not more than six months for purposes of soliciting additional data.
<UL>
<P>(ii) If a proposed regulation referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) is not promulgated as a final regulation within such one-year period (or longer period if extension under clause (i) applies) because the Secretary finds that there is not sufficient evidence to justify the action proposed by the regulation the Secretary shall immediately withdraw the regulation.  The finding on which a withdrawal is based shall be subject to judicial review.  The Secretary may not propose a regulation that has previously been withdrawn under this clause unless he determines that sufficient new information is available to warrant such proposal.
<P>(iii) If the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) is extended under clause (i) with respect to a proposed regulation, then before the close of such extended period the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register either a final regulation to implement the determination or revision concerned, a finding that the revision should not be made, or a notice of withdrawal of the regulation under clause (ii), together with the finding on which the withdrawal is based.
</UL>
<P>(C) A final regulation designating critical habitat of an endangered species or a threatened species shall be published concurrently with the final regulation implementing the determination that such species is endangered or threatened, unless the Secretary deems that-<UL>
<P>(i) it is essential to the conservation of such species that the regulation implementing such determination be promptly published; or
<P>(ii) critical habitat of such species is not then determinable, in which case the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to designate such habitat, may extend the one-year period specified in subparagraph (A) by not more than one additional year, but not later than the close of such additional year the Secretary must publish a final regulation, based on such data as may be available at that time, designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such habitat. 
</UL></UL>
<P>(7) Neither paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection nor section 553 of title 5, United States Code, shall apply to any regulation issued by the Secretary in regard to any emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of any species of fish and wildlife or plants, but only if-
<UL>
<P>(A) at the time of publication of the regulation in the Federal Register the Secretary publishes therein detailed reasons why such regulation is necessary; and
<P>(B) in the case such regulation applies to resident species of fish or wildlife, or plants, the Secretary gives actual notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in which such species is believed to occur.
</UL>
<P>Such regulation shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect immediately upon the publication of the regulation in the Federal Register.  Any regulation promulgated under the authority of this paragraph shall cease to have force and effect at the close of the 240-day period following the date of publication unless, during such 240-day period, the rulemaking procedures which would apply to such regulation without regard to this paragraph are complied with.  If at any time after issuing an emergency regulation the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best appropriate data available to him, that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such regulation, he shall withdraw it.

<P>(8) The publication in the Federal Register of any proposed or final regulation which is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act shall include a summary by the Secretary of the data on which such regulation is based and shall show the relationship of such data to such regulation; and if such regulation designates or revises critical habitat, such summary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, also include a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether public or private) which, in the opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken may adversely modify such habitat, or may be affected by such designation.
</UL>
<P>(c) LISTS.-
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register a list of all species determined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be endangered species and a list of all species determined by him or the Secretary of Commerce to be threatened species.  Each list shall refer to the species contained therein by scientific and common name or names, if any, specify with respect to such species over what portion of its range it is endangered or threatened, and specify any critical habitat within such range.  The Secretary shall from time to time revise each list published under the authority of this subsection to reflect recent determinations, designations, and revisions made in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).
<P>(2) The Secretary shall-
<UL>
<P>(A) conduct, at least once every five years, a review of all species included in a list which is published pursuant to paragraph (1) and which is in effect at the time of such review; and
<P>(B) determine on the basis of such review whether any such species should-
<UL>
<P>(i) be removed from such list;
<P>(ii) be changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened species; or
<P>(iii) be changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species.   
</UL></UL>
<P>Each determination under subparagraph (B) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) and (b).
<UL>
<P>(d) PROTECTIVE REGULATIONS.-Whenever any species is listed as a threatened species pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species.  The Secretary may by regulation prohibit with respect to any threatened species any act prohibited under section 9(a)(1), in the case of fish or wildlife, or section 9(a)(2), in the case of plants, with respect to endangered species; except that with respect to the taking of resident species of fish or wildlife, such regulations shall apply in any State which has entered into a cooperative agreement pursuant to section 6(c) of this Act only to the extent that such regulations have also been adopted by such State.

<P>(e) SIMILARITY OF APPEARANCE CASES.-The Secretary may, by regulation of commerce or taking, and to the extent he deems advisable, treat any species as an endangered species or threatened species even though it is not listed pursuant to section 4 of this Act if he finds that-
<UL>
<P>(1) such species so closely resembles in appearance, at the point in question, a species which has been listed pursuant to such section that enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listed and unlisted species;
<P>(2) the effect of this substantial difficulty is an additional threat to an endangered or threatened species; and
<P>(3) such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the policy of this Act. 
</UL>
<P>(f)(1) RECOVERY PLANS.-The Secretary shall develop and implement plans (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as "recovery plans") for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species listed pursuant to this section, unless he finds that such a plan will not promote the conservation of the species.  The Secretary, in development and implementing recovery plans, shall, to the maximum extent practicable-
<UL><UL>
<P>(A) give priority to those endangered species or threatened species, without regard to taxonomic classification, that are most likely to benefit from such plans, particularly those species that are, or may be, in conflict with construction or other development projects or other forms of economic activity;
<P>(B) incorporate in each plan-
<UL>
<P>(i) a description of such site-specific management actions as may be necessary to achieve the plan's goal for the conservation and survival of the species;
<P>(ii) objective, measurable criteria which, when met, would result in a determination, in accordance with the provisions of this section, that the species be removed from the list; and
<P>(iii) estimates of the time required and the cost to carry out those measures needed to achieve the plan's goal and to achieve intermediate steps toward that goal. 
</UL></UL>
<P>(2) The Secretary, in developing and implementing recovery plans, may procure the services of appropriate public and private agencies and institutions, and other qualified persons.  Recovery teams appointed pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
<P>(3) The Secretary shall report every two years to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives on the status of efforts to develop and implement recovery plans for all species listed pursuant to this section and on the status of all species for which such plans have been developed.
<P>(4) The Secretary shall, prior to final approval of a new or revised recovery plan, provide public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment on such plan.  The Secretary shall consider all information presented during the public comment period prior to approval of the plan.
<P>(5) Each Federal agency shall, prior to implementation of a new or revised recovery plan, consider all information presented during the public comment period under paragraph (4).
</UL>
<P>(g) MONITORING.-
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall implement a system in cooperation with the States to monitor effectively for not less than five years the status of all species which have recovered to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary and which, in accordance with the provisions of this section, have been removed from either of the lists published under subsection (c).
<P>(2) The Secretary shall make prompt use of the authority under paragraph 7 of subsection (b) of this section to prevent a significant risk to the well being of any such recovered species.
<BR>
</UL>
<P>(h) AGENCY GUIDELINES.-The Secretary shall establish, and publish in the Federal Register, agency guidelines to insure that the purposes of this section are achieved efficiently and effectively.  Such guidelines shall include, but are not limited to-
<UL>
<P>(1) procedures for recording the receipt and the disposition of petitions submitted under subsection (b)(3) of this section;
<P>(2) criteria for making the findings required under such subsection with respect to petitions;
<P>(3) a ranking system to assist in the identification of species that should receive priority review under subsection (a)(1) of the section; and
<P>(4) a system for developing and implementing, on a priority basis, recovery plans under subsection (f) of this section.  
</UL>
<P>The Secretary shall provide to the public notice of, and opportunity to submit written comments on, any guideline (including any amendment thereto) proposed to be established under this subsection.

<P>(i) If, in the case of any regulation proposed by the Secretary under the authority of this section, a State agency to which notice thereof was given in accordance with subsection
(b)(5)(A)(ii) files comments disagreeing with all or part of the proposed regulation, and the Secretary issues a final regulation which is in conflict with such comments, or if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation pursuant to an action petitioned by a State agency under subsection (b)(3), the Secretary shall submit to the State agency a written justification for his failure to adopt regulations consistent with the agency's comments or petition.

<P>(b) HARDSHIP EXEMPTIONS.-
<UL>
<P>(1) If any person enters into a contract with respect to a species of fish or wildlife or plant before the date of the publication in the Federal Register of notice of consideration of that species as an endangered species and the subsequent listing of that species as an endangered species pursuant to section 4 of this Act will cause undue hardship to such person under the contract, the Secretary, in order to minimize such hardship, may exempt such person from the application of section 9(a) of this Act to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate if such person applies to him for such exemption and includes with such application such information as the Secretary may require to prove such hardship; except that (A) no such exemption shall be for a duration of more than one year from the date of publication in the Federal Register of notice of consideration of the species concerned, or shall apply to a quantity of fish or wildlife or plants in excess of that specified by the Secretary; (B) the one-year period for those species of fish or wildlife listed by the Secretary as endangered prior to the effective date of this Act shall expire in accordance with the terms of section 3 of the Act of December 5, 1969 (83 Stat. 275); and (C) no such exemption may be granted for the importation or exportation of a specimen listed in Appendix I of the Convention which is to be used in a commercial activity.

<P>(B) substantial economic loss to persons who, for the year prior to the notice of consideration of such species as an endangered species, derived a substantial portion of their income from the lawful taking of any listed species, which taking would be made unlawful under this Act; or
<P>(C) curtailment of subsistence taking made unlawful under this Act by persons 
<UL>
<P>(i) not reasonably able to secure other sources of subsistence; and 
<P>(ii) dependent to a substantial extent upon hunting and fishing for subsistence; and 
<P>(iii) who must engage in such curtailed taking for subsistence purposes.
</UL></UL>

<P>SEC. 11. (a) CIVIL PENALTIES.-
<UL>
<P>(1) Any person who knowingly violates, and any person engaged in business as an importer or exporter of fish, wildlife, or plants who violates, any provision of this Act, or any provision of any permit or certificate issued hereunder, or of any regulation issued in order to implement subsection (a)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F), (a)(2)(A), (B), (C), or (D), (c), (d) (other than regulation relating to recordkeeping or filing of reports), (f), or (g) of section 9 of this Act, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $25,000 for each violation.  Any person who knowingly violates, and any person engaged in business as an importer or exporter of fish, wildlife, or plants who violates, any pro- vision of any other regulation issued under this Act may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $12,000 for each such violation.  Any person who otherwise violates any provision of this Act, or any regulation, permit, or certificate issued hereunder, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $500 for each such violation.  No penalty may be assessed under this subsection unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such violation.  Each violation shall be a separate offense.  Any such civil penalty may be remitted or mitigated by the Secretary.  Upon any failure to pay a penalty assessed under this subsection, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business to collect the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action.  The court shall hear such action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain his action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.
<P>(2) Hearings held during proceedings for the assessment of civil penalties by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 554 of title 5, United States Code.  The Secretary may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and administer oaths.  Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States.  In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a sub- poena served upon any person pursuant to this paragraph, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found or resides or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.
<P>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no civil penalty shall be imposed if it can be shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed an act based on a good faith belief that he was acting to protect himself or herself, a member of his or her family, or any other individual from bodily harm, from any endangered or threatened species.
</UL>
<P>(b) CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS.-

</UL>
<P>(c) DISTRICT COURT JURISDICTION.-The several district courts of the United States; including the courts enumerated in section 460 of title 28, United States Code, shall have jurisdiction over any actions arising under this Act.

Home Page</A>
<H1>50 CFR 227.72(e) - TED Regulations</H1>
<P>(e) Exception for incidental taking- (1) General. The
prohibitions against taking in   227.71(a) do not apply to the
incidental take of any member of any species of sea turtle listed
in   227.4 (i.e., a take not directed toward such member) during
fishing or scientific research activities, to the extent that
those involved are in compliance with the requirements of
paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), and (6) of this section, or in
compliance with the terms and conditions of an incidental take
permit issued pursuant to paragraph (e)(7) of this section. 

<P>(i) Any specimen so taken must be handled with due care to 
prevent injury to live specimens, observed for activity, and 
returned to the water according to the following procedures: 

<P>(A) Sea turtles that are dead or actively moving must be
released  over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be
released  only when trawls are not in use, when the engine gears
are in  neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to
be  recaptured or injured by vessels. 

<P>(B) Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are 
comatose or inactive but not dead by: 

<P>(1) Placing the turtle on its back (carapace) and pumping  its
breastplate (plastron) with hand or foot; or 

<P>(2) Placing the turtle on its breastplate (plastron) and
elevating  its hindquarter several inches for a period of 1 up to
24 hours.  The amount of the elevation depends on the size of the
turtle;  greater elevations are needed for larger turtles. Sea
turtles  being resuscitated must be shaded and kept wet or moist.
Those  that revive and become active must be released over the
stern  of the boat only when trawls are not in use, when the
engine  gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they
are unlikely  to be recaptured or injured by vessels. Similarly,
sea turtles  that fail to move within several hours (up to 24, if
possible)  must be returned to the water in the same manner. 

<P>(ii) Any specimen so taken must not be consumed, sold, landed, 
offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck. 

<P>(2) Gear requirements.-(i) TED requirement. Except as provided 
in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, any shrimp trawler  that
is in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area must have an approved  TED
(as defined in   217.12 of this subchapter) installed in  each
net that is rigged for fishing. A net is rigged for fishing  if
it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise 
connected to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, cable, 
pole or extension, either on board or attached in any manner  to
the shrimp trawler. 

<P>(ii) Exemptions from the TED requirement. (A) A shrimp trawler 
is exempt from the TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of 
this section if it complies with the alternative tow-time
restrictions  in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and if it: 

<P>(1) Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl
retrieval  system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the
net aboard); 

<P>(2) Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board 
in a container with a circulating seawater system, if it does 
not possess more than 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on 
board, and if it has on board a valid original state bait-shrimp 
license (if in a state that requires such a license); 

<P>(3) Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net 
rigged for fishing; 

<P>(4) Is in an area during a period for which tow-time
restrictions  apply under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this
section,  if it complies with all applicable provisions imposed
under  those paragraphs; 

<P>(5) Prior to December 1, 1994, is in inshore waters, if it 
has no more than one net rigged for fishing (other than a test 
(or try) net), if that net has both a headrope length of less 
than 35 feet (10.7 m) and a footrope length of less than 44  feet
(13.4 m). 

<P>(B) The following fishing gear or activities are exempted 
from the TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section: 

<P>(1) A single test net (try net) with a headrope length of  20
feet (6.1 m) or less, if it is either pulled immediately  in
front of another net or is not connected to another net in  any
way, if no more than one test net is used at a time, and  if it
is not towed as a primary net; 

<P>(2) A beam or roller trawl fished without doors, boards, or 
similar devices, that has a mouth formed by a rigid frame and 
rigid vertical bars, if none of the spaces between the bars,  or
between the bars and the frame, exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm);  and 

<P>(3) A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red 
shrimp, if at least 90 percent (by weight) of all shrimp either 
found on board, or offloaded from that shrimp trawler, is royal 
red shrimp. 

<P>(iii) Gear requirement-summer flounder trawlers. (A) TED
requirement.  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of
this section,  any summer flounder trawler in the summer flounder
fishery-sea  turtle protection area must have an approved TED (as
defined  in   217.12 of this subchapter) installed in each net
that is  rigged for fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is
in  the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise connected 
to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, cable, pole  or
extension, either on board or attached in any manner to the 
summer flounder trawler.  

<P>(B) Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard  a
NMFS-approved observer if requested upon written notification 
from the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, or the Director, 
Northeast Region, NMFS, sent to the address specified for the 
vessel in either the NMFS or state fishing permit application, 
or to the address specified for registration or documentation 
purposes, or upon written notification otherwise served on the 
owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and operators must comply 
with the terms and conditions specified in such written
notification.  All NMFS-approved observers will report any
violations of this  section, or other applicable regulations and
laws; such information  may be used for enforcement purposes.  

<P>(C) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant 
Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer 
flounder trawlers as he or she deems necessary or appropriate  to
protect sea turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the 
procedures of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. Such measures 
may include, but are not limited to, a requirement to use TEDs 
in areas other than summer flounder fishery-sea turtle protection 
area, a requirement to use limited tow-times, and closure of  the
fishery.  

<P>(iv) Gear requirement-leatherback conservation zone-(A)
Leatherback  surveys. From January 1 through June 30 of each
year, weekly  aerial surveys will be conducted (contingent upon
weather conditions)  by NMFS or state agents in the leatherback
conservation zone  (defined in   217.12 of this chapter). If
sighting rates of  greater than 10 leatherback turtles per 50
nautical miles (92.6  km) of trackline are observed, the aerial
surveys of that area  will be replicated within 24 hours, or as
soon as practicable  thereafter.  

<P>(B) TED requirements and registration. If surveys pursuant  to
(e)(2)(iv)(A) of this section indicate a sighting rate within 
the leatherback conservation zone of greater than 10 leatherback 
sea turtles per 50 nautical miles (92.6 km) of trackline, NMFS 
will close, for a 2-week period, an area of the leatherback 
conservation zone encompassing all, or a portion of, inshore 
waters and offshore waters 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) seaward 
of the COLREGS demarcation line, bounded by 1ø lat. coinciding 
with the trackline, within the leatherback conservation zone. 
Within such closed area, fishing by any shrimp trawler required 
to have a NMFS-approved TED installed in each net rigged for 
fishing is prohibited, unless the TED installed is one described 
at paragraph (e)(4)(i)(G)(2)(ii) or paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E)  of
this section, and the owner or operator of the shrimp trawler 
has notified the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional 
Director) of his or her intention to fish in that area, in
accordance  with the procedure provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(iv)
(A) through  (F) of this section. If requested in writing from
the Regional  Director, owners and operators of shrimp trawlers
in the leatherback  conservation zone must carry NMFS-approved
observers aboard  such vessel(s). A shrimp trawler in the
leatherback conservation  zone must comply with the terms and
conditions specified in  such written request, as well as provide
information on trawling  hours, gear modifications, and turtle
captures.  

<P>(C) Notification. NMFS will immediately announce specific 
area closures on the NOAA weather radio channel, in newspapers, 
and other media. Specific area closures will be effective upon 
filing for public inspection at the Office of the Federal
Register.  Owners and operators of shrimp trawl vessels in the
leatherback  conservation zone are responsible for monitoring the
NOAA weather  radio channel for closure announcements. Shrimp
trawlers may  also call the Southeast Regional Office at (813)
570-5312 to  receive updated area closure information.  

<P>(3) Tow-time restrictions. (i) Duration of tows. If tow-time 
restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2)(ii),
(e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must
limit tow times to no more than 55 minutes from April 1 through
October 31; and to no more than 75 minutes from November 1
through
March 31. A shrimp trawler in the North Carolina restricted area
must limit tow times to no more than 30 minutes from May 16
through 
August 15. The tow time is measured from the time that the trawl 
door enters the water until it is removed from the water. For a
trawl that is not attached to a door, the tow time is
measured  from the time the codend enters the water until it is
removed from the water.  

<P>(ii) Alternative-special environmental conditions. (A) The 
Assistant Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time
restrictions,  as an alternative to the TED requirement of
paragraph (e)(2)(i)  of this section, if he/she determines that
the presence of algae,  seaweed, debris or other special
environmental conditions in  a particular area makes trawling
with TED-equipped nets impracticable. 

<P>(B) North Carolina restricted area. From June 27, 1994 through 
November 30, 1994, a shrimp trawler in the North Carolina
restricted  area, as an alternative to complying with the TED
requirement  of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, may comply
with the  tow-time restrictions set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)
of this  section. The owner or operator of a shrimp trawler who
wishes  to operate his or her shrimp trawler in the North
Carolina restricted  area must register pursuant to paragraph
(e)(3)(v) of this section,  with registration received by the
Director, Southeast Region,  NMFS, at least 24 hours before the
first use of such tow times.  Registration may be made by
telephoning (813) 893-3141 or writing  to 9721 Executive Center
Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702. The  owner or operator of a
shrimp trawler in the North Carolina  restricted area must carry
onboard a NMFS-approved observer  upon written notification by
the Director, Southeast Region,  NMFS. Notification shall be made
to the address specified for  the vessel in either the NMFS or
state fishing permit application,  the registration or
documentation papers, or otherwise served  upon the owner or
operator of the vessel. The owner or operator  must comply with
the terms and conditions specified in such  written notification.
All observers will report any violations  of this section, or
other applicable regulations and laws; such  information may be
used for enforcement purposes.  

<P>(iii) Substitute-ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant
Administrator  may require compliance with tow-time restrictions,
as a substitute  for the TED requirement of paragraph (e)(2)(i)
of this section,  if he/she determines that TEDs are ineffective
in protecting  sea turtles. 

<P>(iv) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant
Administrator  will publish notification concerning any tow-time
restriction  imposed under paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) or (iii) of
this section  in the Federal Register and will announce it in
summary form  on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. A
notification of tow- time restrictions will include findings in
support of these  restrictions as an alternative to, or as
substitute for, the  TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of
this section. The  notification will specify the effective dates,
the geographic  area where tow-time restrictions apply, and any
applicable conditions  or restrictions that the Assistant
Administrator determines  are necessary or appropriate to protect
sea turtles and ensure  compliance, including, but not limited
to, a requirement to  carry observers, or for all shrimp trawlers
in the area to synchronize  their tow times so that all trawl
gear remains out of the water  during certain times. A
notification withdrawing tow-time restrictions  will include
findings in support of that action. 

<P>(v) Registration. If the Assistant Administrator imposes
restrictions  under paragraph (e)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this
section, he/she  may require the owner and operator of a shrimp
trawler to register  before entering an area where, and during
the time when, the  restrictions apply. If registration is
required, the trawler's  owner and operator must submit the
following information to  the NMFS Regional Office: 

<P>(A) The name and official number (or registration number)  of
the shrimp trawler; 

<P>(B) The names, mailing and street addresses, and telephone 
numbers of the trawler owner and operator; 

<P>(C) The permit number or other identification of relevant 
state or Federal fishing permit(s); 

<P>(D) Where and when the trawler intends to fish; 

<P>(E) Where and when the trawler will depart on any fishing 
trip, with sufficient specificity to allow for an observer to 
embark on the trip; and 

<P>(F) Any changes in the information submitted under paragraphs 
(e)(3)(v) (A) through (E) of this section. Failure to do so 
immediately will void the registration, which will render
unlawful  any subsequent entry of the shrimp trawler into the
area where  and during the time when the restrictions apply. 

<P>(vi) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult 
with the appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where 
the affected shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification 
concerning tow-time restrictions. An emergency notification  can
be effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed 
for additional periods of up to 30 days each if the Assistant 
Administrator finds that the conditions that necessitated the 
imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist. The
Assistant  Administrator may invite comments on such an action,
and may  withdraw or modify the action by following procedures
similar  to those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator
will  implement any permanent tow-time restriction through
rulemaking. 

<P>(4) Approved TEDs. Any netting, webbing, or mesh that may  be
measured to determine compliance with this paragraph (e)(4)  is
subject to measurement, regardless of whether it is wet or  dry.
Any such measurement will be of the stretched mesh size. 

<P>(i) Hard TEDs. Hard TEDs are TEDs with rigid deflector grids 
and are categorized as ``hooped hard TEDs,'' such as the NMFS 
and Cameron TEDs (Figures 1 & 2), or ``single-grid hard TEDs,'' 
such as the Matagorda and Georgia TEDs (Figures 3 & 4). Hard 
TEDs complying with the following generic design criteria are 
approved TEDs: 

<P>(A) Construction materials. A hard TED must be constructed  of
one or a combination of the following materials, with minimum 
dimensions as follows: 

<P>(1) Solid steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of 1/4 
inch (0.64 cm);  

<P>(2) Fiberglass or aluminum rod with a minimum outside diameter 
of 1/2 inch (1.27 cm); or 

<P>(3) Steel or aluminum tubing with a minimum outside diameter 
of 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) and a minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch 
(0.32 cm) (also known as schedule 40 tubing). 

<P>(B) Method of attachment. A hard TED must be sewn into the 
trawl around the entire circumference of the TED with heavy 
twine. 

<P>(C) Angle of deflector bars. The angle of the deflector bars 
must be between 30° and 55° from the normal, horizontal flow 
through the interior of the trawl. 

<P>(D) Space between bars. The space between deflector bars,  and
between the deflector bars and the frame, must not exceed  4
inches (10.2 cm). 

<P>(E) Direction of bars. The deflector bars must run from top 
to bottom of the TED, as the TED is positioned in the net, except 
that up to four of the bottom bars and two of the top bars, 
including the frame, may run from side to side of the TED. 

<P>(F) Position of escape opening. The entire width of the escape 
opening from the trawl must be centered on and immediately
forward  of the frame at either the top or bottom of the net when
the  net is in its deployed position. The escape opening must be 
at the top of the net when the slope of the deflector bars from 
forward to aft is upward, and must be at the bottom when such 
slope is downward. For a single-grid TED, the escape opening 
must be cut horizontally along the same plane as the TED, and 
may not be cut in a fore-and-aft direction. 

<P>(G) Size of escape opening. (1) On a hooped hard TED, the
escape opening must not be smaller than 25 inches by 25 inches
(63.5 cm by 63.5 cm) in the Gulf Area, or 30 inches by 30 inches
(76.2 cm by 76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area. A door frame may not
be used over the  escape opening; however, a webbing flap may be
used as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.

<P>(2)(i) On a single-grid hard TED, the cut in the trawl webbing
for the escape opening cannot be narrower than the outside width
of the grid minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of the grid,
when measured as a straight line width. (Figure 13 of this part
illustrates the dimensions of this cut.) The resulting escape
opening in the net webbing must measure at least 32 inches (81.3
cm) in horizontal taut length and, simultaneously, 10 inches
(25.4 cm) in vertical taut height in the Gulf Area; or 35 inches
(88.9 cm) in horizontal taut length and, simultaneously, 12
inches (30.5 cm) in vertical taut height in the Atlantic Area.
The vertical measurement must be taken at the midpoint of the
horizontal measurement. 

<P> (ii) Escape opening for leatherback turtles.  A single-grid
hard TED escape opening shall be enlarged to 
allow leatherback turtles to escape by cutting an exit hole  in
the extension forward of the TED frame 26 inches (66 cm)  deep,
on each side, by 83 inches (211 cm) across (Figures 12a  and 12b
of this part). Excess webbing is removed by cutting  across 1/2
mesh forward of the TED frame. The exit hole cover  is made by
cutting a 133-inch (338-cm) by 58-inch (148 cm) piece  of webbing
no smaller than 1 1/2 inch (4 cm) stretch mesh and  no larger
than 1 5/8 inch (4.2 cm) stretch mesh. The 133-inch  (338 cm)
edge of the cover is attached to the forward edge of  the opening
(83-inch (211-cm) edge) with a sewing sequence of  3:2. The cover
should overlap 5 inches (13 cm) of the exit hole  on each side.
The side of the cover is attached, maintaining  the 5-inch
(13-cm) overlap, to the side of the opening by sewing  28 inches
(71 cm) of the cover to 26 inches (66 cm) of the opening  forward
of the TED frame and by sewing 15 inches (38 cm) of  the cover to
15 inches (38 cm) of the extension behind the TED  frame. The
cover may extend no more than 24 inches (61 cm) behind  the
posterior edge of the TED frame. The circumference of the  exit
opening must be 142 inches (361 cm) when stretched. If  an
accelerator funnel is used with a single-grid hard TED, modified 
as above, it must also have a minimum circumference of 142 inches 
(361 cm).  

<P>(H) Size of hoop or grid- (1) Hooped hard TED. (i) An oval 
front hoop on a hard TED must have an inside horizontal
measurement  of at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) and an inside
vertical measurement  of at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) in the Gulf
Area, or an inside  horizontal measurement of at least 35 inches
(88.9 cm) and an  inside vertical measurement of at least 30
inches (76.2 cm)  in the Atlantic Area. 

<P>(I) Flotation. Floats must be attached to the top one-half  of
all hard TEDs with bottom escape openings. The floats may  be
attached either outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. 
Floats attached inside the net must be behind the rear surface. 
Floats must be attached with heavy twine or rope. Floats must  be
constructed of aluminum, hard plastic, expanded polyvinyl 
chloride, or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate unless otherwise 
specified. The requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied 
by compliance with either the dimension requirements of paragraph 
(e)(4)(i)(I)(1) of this section, or the buoyancy requirements  of
paragraph (e)(4)(i)(I)(2) of this section, or the buoyancy-
dimension requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(I)(3) of this 
section. If roller gear is used pursuant to paragraph
(e)(4)(iv)(E),  the roller gear must be included in the
circumference measurement  of the TED or the total weight of the
TED. 

<P>(1) Float dimension requirements. (i) For hard TEDs with  a
circumference of 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, a minimum  of
either one round, aluminum or hard plastic float, no smaller 
than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in diameter, or two expanded polyvinyl 
chloride or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate floats, each no 
smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in diameter by 8.75 inches 
(22.2 cm) in length, must be attached. 

<P>(ii) For hard TEDs with a circumference of less than 120 
inches (304.8 cm), a minimum of either one round, aluminum or 
hard plastic float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in 
diameter, or one expanded polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene 
vinyl acetate float, no smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in 
diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be attached. 

<P>(2) Float buoyancy requirements. Floats of any size and in 
any combination must be attached such that the combined buoyancy 
of the floats, as marked on the floats, equals or exceeds the 
weight of the hard TED, as marked on the TED. The buoyancy of 
the floats and the weight of the TED must be clearly marked  on
the floats and the TED as follows: 

<P>(i) Float buoyancy markings. Marking must be made in clearly 
legible raised or recessed lettering by the original
manufacturer. The marking must identify the buoyancy of the float
in water, expressed in grams or kilograms, and must include the
metric unit of measure. The marking may additionally include the
buoyancy in English units. The marking must identify the nominal
buoyancy for the  manufactured float. 

<P>(ii) A circular front hoop on a hard TED must have an inside 
diameter of at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) in the Gulf Area or  35
inches (88.9 cm) in the Atlantic Area. 

<P>(3) Buoyancy-dimension requirements. Floats of any size and 
in any combination, provided that they are marked pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(4)(i)(I)(2)(i) of this section, must be attached 
such that the combined buoyancy of the floats equals or exceeds 
the following values:  

<P>(i) For floats constructed of aluminum or hard plastic,
regardless  of the size of the TED grid, the combined buoyancy
must equal  or exceed 14 lb (6.4 kg); 

<P>(ii) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride  or
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference  of the
TED is 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, the combined buoyancy  must
equal or exceed 20 lb (9.1 kg); or 

<P>(iii) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride 
or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference  of
the TED is less than 120 inches (304.8 cm), the combined 
buoyancy must equal or exceed 10 lb (4.5 kg). 

<P>(2) Single-grid hard TED. A single-grid hard TED must have  an
inside horizontal and vertical measurement of at least 28  inches
(71.1 cm) in the Gulf Area or 30 inches (76.2 cm) in  the
Atlantic Area. The required inside measurements must be  at the
mid-point of the deflector grid. 

<P> (ii) Special Hard TEDs. Special hard TEDs are hard TEDs which 
 do not meet all of the design and construction criteria of the  
generic standards. The following special hard TEDs are approved  
TEDs: 

<P>(A) Flounder TED (Figure 10 of this part). The Flounder TED 
must be constructed of at least 1 1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside 
diameter aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness of at 
least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). It must have a rectangular frame with 
outside dimensions which can be no less than 51 inches (129.5 
cm) in length and 32 inches (81.3 cm) in width. It must have  at
least five vertical deflector bars, with bar spacings of  no more
than 4 inches (10.2 cm). The vertical bars must be connected  to
the top of the frame and to a single horizontal bar near  the
bottom. The horizontal bar must be connected at both ends  to the
sides of the frame and parallel to the bottom bar of  the frame.
There must be a space no larger than 10 inches (25.4  cm) between
the horizontal bar and the bottom bar of the frame.  An
additional vertical bar runs from the middle of the bottom  bar
to the middle of the horizontal bar dividing the opening  at the
bottom into two rectangles with an opening height of  no more
than 10 inches (25.4 cm) and an opening width of no  more than 14
1/2 inches (36.8 cm). If, because of the width  of the TED, the
opening width of the bottom rectangles exceeds  the maximum
allowed, additional vertical bars must be added.  This TED must
comply with paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(B), (e)(4)(i)(C),  (e)(4)(i)(F),
and (e)(4)(i)(G) of this section with respect  to the method of
attachment, the angle of the deflector bars,  the position of the
escape opening, and the size of the escape  opening, except that
the deflector bars must be positioned in  the net to deflect
turtles to the escape opening in the top  of the trawl. This TED
may not be configured with a bottom escape  opening. Installation
of an accelerator funnel is not permitted  with this TED. Use of
this TED is restricted to the Atlantic  summer flounder bottom
trawl fishery. 

<P>(B) Jones TED (Figure 11 of this part). The Jones TED must  be
constructed of at least 1 1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter 
aluminum or steel pipe, and the pipe must have a wall thickness 
of at least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). It must be generally oval in 
shape with a flattened bottom. The deflector bars must be
attached  to the frame at a 45° angle from the horizontal
positioning  downward and each bar must be attached at only one
end to the  frame. The deflector bars must be attached and lie in
the same  plane as the frame. The space between the ends of the
bottom  deflector bars and the bottom frame bar must be no more
than  3 inches (7.6 cm). The spacing between the bottom three
deflector  bars on each side must be no greater than 2 1/2 inches
(6.4  cm). The spacing between all other deflector bars must not
exceed  3 1/2 inches (8.9 cm) and spacing between ends of
opposing deflector  bars also must not exceed 3 1/2 inches (8.9
cm). This TED must  comply with paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(B),
(e)(4)(i)(C), (e)(4)(i)(F),  (e)(4)(i)(G), (e)(4)(i)(H)(2), and
(e)(4)(i)(I) of this section  with respect to the method of
attachment, the angle of the deflector  bars, the position of the
escape opening, the size of the escape  opening, the size of the
grid, and flotation.  

<P>(iii) Soft TEDS. Soft TEDs are TEDs with deflector panels made 
from polypropylene or polyethylene netting. The following soft 
TEDs are approved TEDs: 

<P>(A) Morrison TED (Figures 5 & 6)- (1) Description. The
Morrison  TED uses synthetic mesh webbing for its deflector
panel(s).  The webbing must consist of number 42 (3-mm thick) or
larger  polypropylene or polyethylene webbing that is heat-set
knotted  or braided. The stretched mesh size may not exceed 8
inches  (20.3 cm). The webbing may be installed either as one
main excluder  panel or as a main and two side (jib) excluder
panels (Figure  6), so long as it forms a complete barrier to
large objects  inside the trawl net forward of the codend. The
base (leading  edge) of the excluder panel(s) must be sewn to the
bottom body  of the trawl net at least 16 feet 8 inches (5.1 m)
forward of  the point at which the codend is attached to the
trawl net.  The apex of the excluder panel(s) must be sewn to the
center  of the top body of the trawl net not more than 20 inches
(50.8  cm) forward of the point at which the codend is attached
to  the trawl net. The meshes of the leading edge of the excluder 
panel shall be sewn evenly onto the bottom belly of the trawl 
following the same row of meshes from seam to seam, including 
the wings (i.e., the sides of the trawl that separate the top 
from the bottom). The leading edge of the panel cannot be
installed  on a bias. If a net extension is inserted forward of
the codend,  the base and apex attachments of the excluder
panel(s) must  be measured from the forward attachment points of
such extension.  The horizontal taut length of the stretched main
excluder panel  may not be less than 15 feet (4.6 m). Each point
on the circumference  of the webbing must be sewn to the trawl
net. The meshes of  the webbing must be under tension when the
codend is pulled  aft, thus forming diamond patterns pointing
toward the top of  the trawl net. As an escape opening, a slit at
least 4 feet  8 inches (1.4 m) in taut length must be cut in a
fore-and-aft  direction at the top of the trawl net immediately
forward of  the apex of the panel webbing. The slit may not be
covered or  closed in any manner. 

<P>(2) [Reserved] 

<P>(B) Parrish TED (Figure 7). The Parrish TED consists of an 
extension and deflector panel made of synthetic mesh and a steel 
frame. The extension must be a piece of 1 3/4-inch (4.4-cm) 
stretched mesh, no. 15 thread, treated nylon, measuring 150 
meshes by 100 meshes and installed in the trawl. When installed, 
the extension must be cylindrically shaped with a circumference 
of 150 meshes and a depth of 100 meshes. The deflector panel 
must slope down the inside of the extension and must be a
rectangular  piece of 8-inch (20.3-cm), stretched mesh, 3-mm
diameter, braided  polyethylene. The deflector panel must measure
eight meshes  across its leading and trailing edges and be 15 1/2
meshes deep.  The eight meshes at the leading edge of the
deflector panel  must be sewn into the small (1 3/4-inch)
(4.4-cm) mesh of the  extension three meshes down from the top
edge of the extension.  The eight meshes at the trailing edge
must be attached to the  top edge of the frame. Each side edge of
the deflector panel  must be attached at 5 5/8-inch (14.3-cm)
intervals to a 3/8- inch (1.0-cm) diameter, three-strand
polydacron rope,
which  must be attached to the small mesh of the extension at 5
5/8- inch (14.3-cm) intervals. The deflector panel must form a
complete  barrier to large objects inside the extension forward
of the  frame. The frame must be a rectangular, 3/8-inch (1.0-cm)
diameter,  welded galvanized steel rod unit
with a 40-inch by 4-inch (101.6- cm by 10.2-cm) opening and small
pad eyes at the top corners.  The trailing-edge meshes of the
deflector panel must be attached  to the top of the frame, and 50
lateral meshes of the extension  netting (1 3/4-inch (4.4.-cm)
mesh) must be centered and sewn  to the bottom and sides of the
frame. The escape opening must  consist of a lateral slit,
measuring 40 meshes, cut from the  leading edge at the bottom of
the frame. A bungee cord having  a 50-inch (127.0-cm)
non-stretched length and a 1/4-inch (0.64- cm) diameter must be
laced through the meshes
at the cut. Opposing  ends of the bungee cord must be secured to
the opposing pad  eyes at the top of the frame. One end of a flap
measuring 50  meshes across by 30 meshes deep must be attached to
the meshes  at the cut. 

<P>(C) Andrews TED (Figures 8a and 8b of this part). The Andrews 
TED is a funnel constructed of 5-inch (12.7-cm) stretched mesh 
polyethylene or polypropylene webbing that is sewn inside a 
shrimp trawl. The bottom panel of the trawl may be used as the 
bottom panel of the funnel, so long as the bottom edges of the 
sides of the funnel are sewn at every mesh to the bottom panel 
of the trawl. The leading edge of the funnel must be sewn with 
heavy twine at all points to the outer trawl beginning on the 
row of meshes located 20 meshes behind the center of the footrope 
and continuing around the circumference of the trawl, following 
the same row of meshes. The webbing may not be laced with rope. 
The funnel must taper to an escape opening in the bottom of  the
trawl. The trailing edge on the funnel must be sewn at all 
points around the circumference of the escape opening. The escape 
opening must be at least 96 inches (243.8 cm) in circumference. 
A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape opening if no 
device holds the webbing flap closed or otherwise restricts  the
opening, and if such flap is constructed of webbing that  has a
stretched mesh size no larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm),  lies on
the outside of the trawl, is attached along its entire  forward
edge forward of the escape opening, is 50 meshes wide  and 15
meshes deep, does not overlap the exit opening more than  5
meshes on each side (it may be attached along the 15-mesh  edge),
and maintains an opening of at least 48 inches (121.9  cm) in a
taut position. 

<P>(D) Taylor TED (Figures 9a and 9b of this part). The Taylor 
TED is constructed of 6-inch (15.2-cm) polyethylene or
polypropylene  webbing that is heat-set knotted or braided. The
Taylor TED  deflector panel must be not less than 228 inches (580
cm) on  the leading edge and not less than 120 inches (305 cm)
long.  The leading edge, sides, and apex of the deflector panel 
must be sewn to the trawl body so as to form a complete barrier 
to large objects inside the trawl net forward of the codend  or
extension. The apex may be removed not more than 24 inches  (61
cm) forward of the rear point. If the apex is removed, a 
rectangular section 24 inches (61 cm) long must be sewn evenly 
to the rear of the deflector panel to maintain the 120-inch 
(305-cm) length. The leading edge of the Taylor TED deflector 
panel must be sewn to the bottom body of the trawl net. The  rear
point of the deflector panel, or rear edge, if the apex  is
removed, must be sewn evenly, centered across the top body.  An
escape opening must be located on the top of the trawl body 
centered over the deflector panel. The opening must measure  not
less than 72 inches (183.6 cm), must be in a single row  of
meshes, and must be located no farther forward than the point 
where its entire length is above the deflector panel--the forward 
edge of the opening must extend from the attachment of the
deflector  panel on one side of the body, across the top of the
body, to  the attachment of the deflector panel on the other
side. All  trawl webbing above the deflector panel between the
72-inch  (183.6-cm) cut and the posterior edge of the deflector
panel  must be removed. A rectangular flap of nylon webbing not
larger  than 2-inch (5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be sewn to the
forward  edge of the escape opening. The width of the flap may
not exceed  the length of the forward edge of the triangular
opening. The  flap may extend not more than 12 inches (30.5 cm)
beyond the  rear point of the escape opening. The sides of the
flap may  be attached to the body, but may not be attached
farther aft  than the rear point of the escape opening. One row
of chain  not larger than 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly
to the  back edge of the flap. The stretched length of the chain
may  not exceed 84 inches (214.2 cm). 

<P>(E) Allowable modifications to soft TEDs. The following
modifications  may be made to the Morrison and Taylor TEDs to
increase the  size of the escape opening to permit the exclusion
of leatherback  turtles. An enlarged escape opening must be
created on the top  of the trawl body centered over the deflector
panel. The opening  must measure not less than 96 inches (244
cm), must be in a  single row of meshes, and must be located no
farther forward  than the point where its entire length is above
the deflector  panel--the forward edge of the opening must extend
from the  attachment of the deflector panel on one side of the
body, across  the top of the body, to the attachment of the
deflector panel  on the other side. All trawl webbing above the
deflector panel  between the 96-inch (244-cm) cut and the
posterior edge of the  deflector panel must be removed. A
rectangular flap of nylon  webbing not larger than 2-inch
(5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be  sewn to the forward edge of the
escape opening. The width of  the flap may not exceed the length
of the forward edge of the  triangular opening. The flap may
extend not more than 12 inches  (30.4 cm) beyond the rear point
of the escape opening. The sides  of the flap may be attached to
the body, but may not be attached  farther aft than the rear
point of the escape opening. One row  of chain not larger than
3/16 inch (4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly  to the back edge of the
flap. The stretched length of the chain  may not exceed 96 inches
(244 cm). For the Morrison TED, the  apex of the excluder panel
may be removed no more than 48 inches  (122 cm) forward of the
rear edge. A rectangular section 48  inches (122 cm) long must
then be sewn evenly to the rear of  the excluder panel to
maintain the length prescribed in the  description of the
Morrison TED. For the Morrison TED, the addition  of a webbing
flap and the modification of the excluder panel  may only be done
conjointly with the enlargement of the escape  opening as
described in this paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E). 

<P>(iv) Allowable modifications to TEDs. No modifications may  be
made to an approved soft TED, except for the modifications 
described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E). Unless otherwise
prohibited  in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, only the
following  modifications may be made to an approved hard TED and
an approved  special hard TED:  

<P>(A) Floats. In addition to floats required pursuant to
paragraph  (e)(4)(i)(I) of this section, floats may be attached
to the  top one-half of the TED, either outside or inside the
net, but  not to a flap. Floats attached inside the net must be
behind  the rear surface at the top of the TED.  

<P>(B) Accelerator funnel. An accelerator funnel may be installed 
in the trawl, if it is made of net webbing material with a
stretched  mesh size not greater than 1 5/8 inches (4.1 cm), if
it has  an inside horizontal opening of at least 39 inches (99.1
cm)  when measured in a taut position, if it is inserted in the
net  immediately forward of the TED, and if its rear edge does
not  extend past the bars of the TED. The trailing edge of the
accelerator  funnel may be attached to the TED on the side
opposite the escape  opening if not more than 1/3 of the
circumference of the funnel  is attached, and if the inside
horizontal opening of at least  39 inches (99.1 cm) is
maintained. In a downward shooting TED,  only the top 1/3 of the
circumference of the funnel may be attached  to the TED. In an
upward shooting TED, only the bottom 1/3 of  the circumference of
the funnel may be attached to the TED. 

<P>(C) Webbing flap. A webbing flap may be used to cover the 
escape opening if no device holds it closed or otherwise
restricts  the opening, and if it is constructed of webbing with
a stretched  mesh size no larger than 1 5/8 inches (4.1 cm), lies
on the  outside of the trawl, is attached along its entire
forward edge  forward of the escape opening, is not attached on
the sides  beyond the row of meshes that lies 6 inches (15.2 cm)
behind  the posterior edge of the grid, and does not extend more
than  24 inches (61.0 cm) beyond the posterior edge of the grid. 

<P>(D) Chafing webbing. A single piece of nylon webbing, with  a
twine size no smaller than size 36 (2.46 mm in diameter),  may be
attached outside of the escape opening webbing flap to  prevent
chafing on bottom opening TEDs. This webbing may be  attached
along its leading edge only. This webbing may not extend  beyond
the trailing edge or sides of the existing escape opening 
webbing flap, and it must not interfere or otherwise restrict 
the turtle escape opening. 

<P>(E) Roller gear. Roller gear may be attached to the bottom  of
a TED to prevent chafing on the bottom of the TED and the  trawl
net. When a webbing flap is used in conjunction with roller 
gear, the webbing flap must be of a length such that no part  of
the webbing flap can touch or come in contact with any part  of
the roller gear assembly or the means of attachment of the 
roller gear assembly to the TED, when the trawl net is in its 
normal, horizontal position. Roller gear must be constructed 
according to one of the following design criteria: 

<P>(1) A single roller consisting of hard plastic shall be
mounted on an axle rod, so that the roller can roll freely about
the axle. The maximum diameter of the roller shall be 6 inches
(15.24 cm), and the maximum width of the axle rod shall be 12
inches (30.4 cm). The axle rod must be attached to the TED by two
support rods. The maximum clearance between the roller and the
TED shall not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the center of the roller.
The support rods and axle rod must be made from solid steel or
solid aluminum rod no larger than 1/2 inch (1.28 cm) in diameter.
The attachment of the support rods to the TED shall be such that
there are no protrusions (lips, sharp edges, burrs, etc.) on the
front face of the grid. The axle rod and support rods must lie
entirely behind the plane of the face of the TED grid.  

<P>(2) A single roller consisting of hard plastic tubing shall 
be tightly tied to the back face of the TED grid with rope or 
heavy twine passed through the center of the roller tubing.  The
roller shall lie flush against the TED. The maximum outside 
diameter of the roller shall be 3 1/2 inches (8.0 cm), the
minimum  outside diameter of the roller shall be 2 inches (5.1
cm), and  the maximum length of the roller shall be 12 inches
(30.4 cm).  The roller must lie entirely behind the plane of the
face of  the grid.  

<P>(5) Revision of generic design criteria, allowable
modification  of hard TEDs, additional soft TEDs and special hard
TEDs. (i)  The Assistant Administrator may revise the generic
design criteria  for hard TEDs set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(i)
of this section,  may approve special hard TEDs in addition to
those listed in  paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, may
approve soft TEDs  in addition to those listed in paragraph
(e)(4)(iii) of this  section, or may approve allowable
modifications to hard TEDs  in addition to those authorized in
paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this  section, by a regulatory amendment,
if, according to a NMFS- approved scientific protocol, the TEDs
demonstrate a sea turtle  exclusion rate of 97 percent or greater
(or an equivalent exclusion  rate). Two such protocols have been
published by NMFS (52 FR  24262, June 29, 1987; and 55 FR 41092,
October 9, 1990). Testing  under the protocol must be conducted
under the supervision of  the Assistant Administrator, and shall
be subject to all such  conditions and restrictions as the
Assistant Administrator deems  appropriate. Any person wishing to
participate in such testing  should contact the Director,
Southeast Fisheries Science Center,  NMFS, 75 Virginia Beach
Drive, Miami, FL 33149. 

<P>(ii) Upon application, the Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits, subject to such conditions and restrictions as the 
Assistant Administrator deems appropriate, authorizing public  or
private experimentation aimed at improving shrimp retention 
efficiency of existing approved TEDs and at developing additional 
TEDs, or conducting fishery research, that would otherwise be 
subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Applications should 
be addressed to the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, 9450 Koger 
Blvd., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. 

<P>(6) Limitations on incidental takings during fishing
activities.- <P>(i) Limitations. The exemption for incidental
takings of sea  turtles in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does
not authorize  incidental takings during fishing activities if
the takings: 

<P>(A) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of 
an incidental take statement or biological opinion; 

<P>(B) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of 
an incidental take permit; or 

<P>(C) May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of  a
species listed under the Act. 

<P>(ii) Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental 
takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant 
thereto, the Assistant Administrator may restrict fishing
activities  in order to conserve a species listed under the Act,
including,  but not limited to, restrictions on the fishing
activities of  vessels subject to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this
section. The  Assistant Administrator will take such action if
he/she determines  that restrictions are necessary to avoid
unauthorized takings  that may be likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of  a listed species. The Assistant
Administrator may withdraw or  modify a determination concerning
unauthorized takings or any  restriction on fishing activities if
the Assistant Administrator  determines that such action is
warranted. 

<P>(iii) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant
Administrator  will publish a notification of a determination
concerning unauthorized  takings or a notification concerning the
restriction of fishing  activities in the Federal Register. The
Assistant Administrator  will provide as much advance notice as
possible, consistent  with the requirements of the Act, and will
announce the notification  in summary form on channel 16 of the
marine VHF radio. Notification  of a determination concerning
unauthorized takings will include  findings in support of that
determination; specify the fishery,  including the target species
and gear used by the fishery, the  area, and the times, for which
incidental takings are not authorized;  and include such other
conditions and restrictions as the Assistant  Administrator
determines are necessary or appropriate to protect  sea turtles
and ensure compliance. Notification of restriction  of fishing
activities will include findings in support of the  restriction,
will specify the time and area where the restriction  is
applicable, and will specify any applicable conditions or 
restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines are 
necessary or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure
compliance.  Such conditions and restrictions may include, but
are not limited  to, limitations on the types of fishing gear
that may be used,  tow-time restrictions, alteration or extension
of the periods  of time during which particular tow-time
requirements apply,  requirements to use TEDs, and requirements
to provide observers.  Notification of withdrawal or modification
will include findings  in support of that action. 

<P>(iv) Registration. If the Assistant Administrator imposes 
restrictions under paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, he/she 
may require the owner and operator of a vessel to register before 
entering an area where, and during the time when, the
restrictions  apply. If registration is required, the vessel's
owner and operator  must submit the following information to the
NMFS Regional Office: 

<P>(A) The name and official number (or registration number)  of
the vessel; 

<P>(B) The names, mailing and street addresses, and telephone 
numbers of the vessel owner and operator;  

<P>(C) The permit number or other identification of relevant 
state or Federal fishing permit(s); 

<P>(D) Where and when the vessel intends to fish; and  

<P>(E) Where and when the vessel will depart on any fishing trip, 
with sufficient specificity to allow for an observer to embark 
on the trip. 

<P>(F) Any changes in the information submitted under paragraphs 
(e)(6)(iv) (A) through (E) of this section. Failure to do so 
immediately will void the registration, which will render
unlawful  any subsequent entry of the fishing vessel into the
area where  and during the time when the restrictions apply. 

<P>(v) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with 
the appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where  the
fishing activities are located in issuing notification of  a
determination concerning unauthorized takings or notification 
concerning the restriction of fishing activities. An emergency 
notification will be effective for a period of up to 30 days  and
may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days each.  The
Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such action,  and
may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures 
similar to those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator 
will implement any permanent determination or restriction through 
rulemaking. 

<P>(7) Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator  may
issue permits authorizing activities that would otherwise  be
prohibited in   227.71(a) of this chapter in accordance with 
section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and  in
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of parts  220 and
222 of this chapter. Such permits may be issued for  the
incidental taking of both endangered and threatened species  of
sea turtles. This section supersedes restrictions on the  scope
of parts 220 and 222, including, but not limited to, the 
restrictions specified in    220.3, 222.1, 222.2(a) and
222.22(a).

<H2>II.  Marine Mammal Interactions with Fisheries and other
Commercial Activities</H2>

<P>A central focus of marine mammal protection program activities
is the management of
marine mammal interactions with commercial fisheries.  The
importance of this issue can be
measured in terms of both public concern and the allocation of
NMFS resources.  The
Marine Mammal Protection Act has attempted to address these
interactions by establishing a
zero mortality rate goal and creating a permit program to limit
the taking of marine
mammals by commercial fisheries and other parties.

<P>This chapter discusses NMFS activities to manage and reduce
the incidental take of
marine mammals by fisheries and other commercial activities. 
Issues covered include a
general description of the Interim Exemption Program,
implementation of the observer
program, and development of the proposed regime to govern marine
mammal interactions
with commercial fisheries.  Of particular concern to NMFS is the
incidental take of dolphins
in the eastern tropical Pacific yellowfin tuna purse seine 
fishery.  The chapter, therefore,
examines recent efforts to reduce dolphin mortality, discusses
tuna importation issues, and
summarizes interaction data.


<H3>Interim Exemption</H3>

<P>A major component of the 1988 Amendments to the MMPA was the
establishment of
a five-year exemption program to allow the incidental taking of
marine mammals by
commercial fisherman until October 1, 1993.  The primary
objective of the interim
exemption program is to provide a mechanism for obtaining data on
interactions while
allowing commercial fishing to continue.  NMFS will use the
information collected in the
exemption system along with other data on marine mammal
populations to develop a long-
term program to govern the taking of marine mammals by commercial
fisheries.

<H3>List of Fisheries</H3>

<P>As a preliminary step in establishing the exemption program,
the 1988 Amendments
require the Secretary of Commerce to compile a list of fisheries
that interacted with marine
mammals and the number of vessels or persons operating in each
fishery.  Fisheries were
then to be divided into three categories:
     <UL>
<LI>Category I fisheries, in which there is frequent incidental
taking of marine mammals;
<LI>Category II fisheries, in which there is an occasional
incidental taking marine mammals; and
<LI>Category III fisheries, in which there is a remote likelihood
or no known incidental taking of marine mammals.
</UL>

<P>The fishery category determines the requirements that vessel
owners/operators must
meet under the interim exemption program.  The Amendments require
the Secretary to
review the list annually.  Changes may be made to the list after
providing opportunity for
public comment.  In December, 1990, NMFS published the first list
of Fisheries
operating in U.S. waters and on February 7, 1991, NMFS  published
the first annual review
of fisheries (56 FR 5138).  The 1991 list identifies 11 Category
I fisheries, 32 Category II
fisheries, and 129 Category III fisheries, and increase of 5
Category II fisheries from the
original 1989 list.  Fisheries that are not classified are
included in category III by default. 
Exhibit A-1 in Appendix A presents the 1991 list of Category I
and Category II fisheries.

<H3>Registration and Reporting</H3>

<P>Under the Interim Exemption,  vessel owners must register with
NMFS, obtain an
Exemption Certificate, and fulfill specified reporting
requirements to legally fish in any
Category I or Category II fishery.  Owners of vessels engaged
only in Category III fisheries
are not required to register, but must report marine mammals
killed incidentally.

<P>Vessel owners registered initially by submitting a
registration form and a $30 fee to
NMFS.  In return, the owner received a decal, an annual sticker,
a fishing log, and
exemption compliance instructions.  The Exemption Certificate
must be renewed each year
by submitting an updated registration form, required fee, and
required reports covering all
Category I and II fisheries in which the vessel was registered.

<P>All registration data are entered into the Marine Mammal
Exemption Program data
base (MMEP), which allows NMFS to analyze the number and size of
fishing vessels on a
nationwide basis.  In 1990, NMFS registered 15,756 vessels.  The
number of registered
vessels declined to 12,156 in 1991.  Exhibits 1  through 3 
graphically summarize the
distribution
of registered vessels in 1991 by Region, fishery category, and
gear type.
   
<P>Exemption Certificate holders must maintain accurate daily
logs of fishing effort and
incidental takes of marine mammals.  For each fishing day, the
log should include information
on: the fishery, fishing effort, and gear type; the marine mammal
species or a description of the marine mammals involved if the
species is not known; number, date, and location of marine mammal
incidental takes; type of interaction and
any injury to the marine mammal; a description efforts to deter
animals by any non-lethal or
lethal means; and any loss of fish or gear caused by marine
mammals.  A report, consisting of
a copy of daily logs covering Category I and II fisheries, must
be submitted annually to NMFS by December 31. 
Fishermen, however, are encouraged to submit log sheets at the
conclusion of each fishing season or on a regular
basis throughout the year.

<P>NMFS received 11,588 log books in 1990 from vessel owners.  In
1991, the number of
log books received declined to 9,034.  Appendix B contains tables
that summarize the data
submitted in the log books.


<H3>Observer Program</H3>

<P>Section 114(e) of the MMPA requires the Secretary to place
observers on Category I vessels
to monitor between 20 and 35 percent of the fishing operations in
each fishery.  The purpose of the
observer program is to: (1) obtain statistically reliable
information on the species and number of marine mammals
incidentally taken in a fishery; (2) verify the accuracy of
self-reporting by fisherman; (3) identify possible means for
reducing such
takes; and (4) collect other biological information on marine
mammals and the marine
ecosystem.

<P><If NMFS is unable to meet the required observer coverage
level in any particular year,
observers must be allocated among Category I fisheries according
to the following priorities:
     <UL>
<LI>Those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from
stocks designated as depleted;
<LI>Those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals form
stocks that are declining;
<LI>Those fisheries, other than those described above, in which
the greatest incidental take of marine mammals occur; and
<LI>Any other Category I fishery.
</UL>


<P>If observers cannot be placed on Category I vessels at the
required level, NMFS should
establish observation and verification programs to supplement or
replace the mandated on-board
observer program.  Alternative observer programs may include
direct observation of fishing
activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.  If
sufficient resources are available,
alternative programs or voluntary observer programs may also be
established in Category II and
Category III fisheries for which reliable information is not
otherwise available.

<P>NMFS designed its observer program to obtain statistically
reliable information on the
species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in as
many Category I fisheries as
possible.  The specific design of the observer program was based
on the size and nature of each
Category I fishery,  the desired precision for mortality
estimates, and the resources available. 
Exhibit 4 summarizes observer coverage in 10 category I fisheries
during 1990 and 1991.  This
exhibit is supplemented by descriptions of Regional programs
presented below.  Detailed
analysis of 1990 and 1991  observer data are presented in
separate reports.

<P>The NMFS Southwest Regional Office (SWR) implemented an
observer program for the
California set and drift gillnet fisheries with assistance from
the California Department of Fish
and Game (CDFG).  The Region reported that setnet fishermen
shifted from single day runs to
multi-day trips to avoid observer placement.  Setnet boats are
small vessels with little work room
and no observer sleeping space.  In response, NMFS chartered two
vessels in 1990 as alternate
platforms to observe the operations of setnet fishing vessels. 
NMFS established a joint venture
in 1991 with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to use their
research vessel as a high seas
platform to observe setnet fishing operations.

<P>NMFS issued an emergency regulation that required, as of
November 27, 1990, all
bottomfish vessels operating in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands
protected species zone to notify
NMFS prior to departure, enabling SWR to place an observer on the
vessel.  A final rule was
published on May 30, 1991 implementing this emergency regulation
on a permanent basis. 
Currently, there are two observers to monitor the 28 permitted
vessels in the fishery.  SWR is
seeking one additional observer to investigate the distribution
of Hawaiian monk seals and other
protected species in the zone.

<P>The NMFS Alaska Regional Office (AKR) observer program has
yielded important
mortality data, resulting in changes in the categorization of
some Alaskan fisheries.  In 1990,
observers reported no mortalities in the Prince William Sound
salmon set gillnet fisheries and
only one mortality in the South Unimak salmon drift gillnet
fishery.  Based on these findings,
NMFS reclassified these fisheries from Category I to Category II. 
Classification of the Prince
William Sound salmon drift gill net fishery will be reviewed in
the future because only seven
marine mammal mortalities were observed in 1991.  The Bering Sea
and  Gulf of Alaska
groundfish trawl fisheries were placed in Category III as a
result of  data that showed that the
level of incidental take was very low.

<P>The NMFS Northwest Regional Office (NWR) observer program
monitors two Category
I fisheries.  NMFS, in cooperation with the Pacific States Marine
Fisheries Commission, the
Washington Department of Wildlife, and the Oregon Department of
Fish and Wildlife,
documented marine mammal interactions in the Washington, Oregon
Lower Columbia River
Region, Willapa Bay and Grays Harbors salmon drift gillnet
fishery.  Observers in these
fisheries documented (1)  the mortality of harbor seals and
California sea lions and (2) damage
to salmon stocks and fishing gear.  Observation of the Makah set
gillnet fishery documented
entanglement of harbor porpoise and harbor seals.

<H3>California Sea Lion/Steelhead Conflict</H3>

<P>The sea lion/steelhead salmon conflict in the Lake Washington
ship channel, known as
the "Herschel Problem," continues to be a well-publicized marine
mammal issue.  A simple
statistic illustrates the severity of this conflict;  during the
1988/89 winter run, 65 percent of
returning steelhead were consumed by sea lions.

<P>Under a cooperative program involving NMFS, the Washington
Department of Wildlife,
the Army Corp of Engineers, and the Muckleshoot and Suquamish
Indian Tribes, researchers
have attempted numerous non-lethal control methods.  These
efforts continued during the 1990
and 1991 steelhead runs.

<P>Marine Mammal Protection Act Home Page   During the 1990, a
capture-relocation program was undertaken.  Researchers, using a
meshed cage secured to a mooring float, captured six adult male
sea lions and transported them
to the breeding colony located on San Miguel Island,
approximately 1200 miles from Seattle. 
Monitored with radio transmitters, four of the six animals
returned to Washington State waters,
the first within 30 days of release.

<P>Efforts during the 1991 run focused on potential enhancements
for steelhead passage
through the fishway.  Based on the recommendations of an
interagency task group, NMFS
initiated two pilot studies.  The objective of the first study
was to assess the effects of fishway
lighting on fish passage at night, when sea lion predation is at
a minimum.  The second study
attempted to collect information on the salinity gradient between
fishway attraction water and
the water below the dam.  Neither study produced conclusive
results, and the study designs are
being modified for future use.

<H3>Proposed Regime to Manage the Marine Mammal Interactions with
Commercial Fisheries</H3>

<P>The MMPA, recognizing that a total prohibition on taking of
marine mammals could
seriously affect certain fisheries, authorized the Secretaries of
Commerce and the Interior to
allow the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations when such
taking would not disadvantage the affected marine mammal species
or stocks.  The 1981
Amendments permitted the Secretaries to use streamlined
procedures for granting small take
exemptions for non-depleted marine mammals if, after notice and
opportunity for public
comment, the Secretary finds that such taking would have a
negligible impact on the affected
species or stock.  In response to litigation and recognition that
the existing permit system was
unworkable, the 1988 MMPA amendments required NMFS to develop a
regime to manage
marine mammal interactions with commercial fisheries.  This
section
discusses the legal challenges to the original permit system, the
1988 amendment requirements,
and NMFS' proposed regime.

<H3>Kokechik and the 1988 MMPA Amendments</H3>

<P>In 1987, Alaska Native fishing groups and environmental
organizations challenged a
general permit that authorized the Federation of Japan Salmon
Fisheries Cooperative Association
to take Dall's porpoise incidental to its fishing operations. 
The suit (Kokechik Fishermen's
Association v. the Secretary of Commerce, 839 F.2d 795) claimed
that the general permit should
not be issued because other marine mammals for which permits
could not be issued (e.g.,
northern fur seal) would inevitably be taken.  A District Court,
ruling in favor of the plaintiffs,
invalidated the permit, a decision that was upheld on appeal. 
NMFS, therefore, could not issue
an incidental take permit for any species of marine mammal in
circumstances where unpermitted
taking of other species of marine mammals would occur.

<P>To address the situation created by Kokechik,  Congress
amended the MMPA in 1988
to exempt most commercial fisheries from the Act's general permit
and small take provisions
for five years.  Section 114 of the amendments required NMFS to
develop a new regime to
govern marine mammal/commercial fishery interactions (other than
takings that occur in the ETP
yellowfin tuna fishery) after the interim exemption expires.  
Section 114 states that the regime should include:

<UL>
<LI>"(A) the scientific guidelines to be used in determining
permissible levels of incidental taking;
<LI>(B) a description of the arrangements for consultation and
cooperation with other Federal agencies, the appropriate Regional
Fishery Management Councils and Sates, the commercial fishing
industry, and conservation organizations; and
<LI>(C) a summary of such regulations and legislation as would be
necessary to implement the suggested regime."
</UL>

<P>According to the amendments, the Secretary should develop this
regime in consultation with the
Marine Mammal Commission, Regional Fishery Councils, and other
interested governmental and
non-governmental organizations.

<H3>NMFS' Initial Proposal</H3>

<P>NMFS published its proposed regime on May 24, 1991.  The
proposal, which was based
on the Marine Mammal Commission's recommended guidelines, would:

<UL>
<LI>Authorize incidental taking of depleted as well as
non-depleted species;
<LI>Reduce incidental mortality and serious injury of marine
mammals to insignificant levels with
minimum hardship to fisheries involved;
<LI>Establish allowable biological removal (ABR) quotas for each
marine mammal population
affected by commercial fishery interactions, taking into account
the status of the affected
populations;
<LI>Require actions to be taken (e.g., stopping fishing
operations) to prevent ABR quotas from
being exceeded;
<LI>Provide a framework for allocating ABR quotas among user
groups and fisheries, and create
Regional Quota Boards to establish quotas for each fishery; and
<LI>Require monitoring of incidental takes and ABR quotas, and
charge fishermen an
administrative fee (and, perhaps, fishery-specific user fees) to
recover monitoring costs.
</UL>

<H3>Public Comment and the Revised Draft Interim Proposal</H3>

<P>NMFS received comments from 84 entities during the public
comment period.  In their
comments, conservation groups expressed concern that there were
(1) no provisions for judicial
review, (2) no optimal sustainable population (OSP) or depletion
determinations, (3) no final
adjustment of ABR, and (4) no movement towards the Zero Mortality
Rate Goal.  Industry
groups stated that the proposed regime was (1) not focused on
problems areas, (2) too
conservative on recovery factors and minimum abundance estimates,
and (3) did not include
subsistence takes in ABR allocations.  Industry and conservation
interests both rejected the
Regional  Quota Board proposal.

<P>After reviewing the comments and consulting with the Regional
Fishery Management
Councils, the environmental community, and the fishing industry,
NMFS revised its proposal
and distributed the Revised Draft Interim Proposal for limited
review on November 20, 1991. 
The revised proposal included the following significant changes:
<UL>
<LI>ABR was replaced with potential biological removal (PBR) to
clarify that this level
   represented a maximum possible take level, and not necessarily
the removal level that would
   be authorized;

<LI>PBR allocations would be made based on recommendations made
by Regional Fishery
   Management Councils and State fishery agencies with
opportunity for public comment.  This
   process would replace the Regional Quota Board concept;

<LI>Additional criteria for determining when the fishing industry
must finance special observer
   programs;

<LI>OSP calculations would be based on current carrying capacity;

<LI>The two-year implementation period was retained but removal
limitations could be phased-in
   for some fisheries; and

<LI>Safety factors for estimating maximum removals from various
population levels were
   reduced, unless a higher factor is specified in a recovery or
conservation plan.
</UL>
<P>Under the Revised Draft Interim Proposal, each marine mammal
population would be
categorized as Class A, B, or C based on its abundance and the
total number of projected
removals compared to the PBR.  Class A populations are those that
are listed as endangered or
threatened under the ESA, designated as depleted under the MMPA,
or whose total annual
estimated removal is greater than or equal to the calculated PBR. 
Class B populations are
defined as populations  that are in no immediate danger, but are
"likely" to become Class A
within five years.   Class C populations are not "likely" to
become Class A within five years. 
The revised proposal classified fisheries that interact with
marine mammals according to the
class of mammals with which they interact.

<P>The deadline for submitting comments on the revised proposal
was December 20, 1991. 
NMFS was reviewing and analyzing these comments at the end of
1991.

<H3>Tuna-Dolphin Issues </H3>

<P>The best known interaction between marine mammals and
commercial fisheries is the
incidental take of dolphins by  yellowfin tuna purse seiners in
the ETP.  For reasons not fully
understood by  marine biologists, schools of yellowfin tuna
associate with dolphin stocks.  In
the late 1950's fisherman began exploiting this association by
deploying large purse seine nets
around the more readily observed dolphin schools to catch the
tuna swimming below.  Despite
the fishermen's efforts to release the dolphins, many became
trapped in the nets and drowned.

<P>Efforts to reduce dolphin mortality in the ETP has been a
central focus of the MMPA
since it was enacted in 1972.  Recent activities have focused on
domestic  fishing operations, 
increased monitoring of foreign fishing fleets, actions to
encourage foreign fishing fleets to
reduce dolphin mortality,  and international meetings and
workshops.  This section of the Annual
Report discusses these activities and presents the most recent
data on dolphin take by the U.S.
purse seine tuna fleet.

<H3>Fishing Operations</H3>

<P>During 1990-1991, a number of significant events occurred
concerning changes to purse
seine yellowfin tuna fishing.  These events involve the use of
explosives, the development of
alternative fishing methods, and the development of operator
performance standards.

<P>Since the early 1980's, the U.S tuna fleet had used a variety
of explosive devices to herd
dolphins during fishing operations.  The 1988 amendments to the
MMPA prohibited the use of
all explosive devices in the yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery. 
The amendments exempted Class
C explosive devices, pending a determination that use of these
explosives would physically
impair or increase the mortality of marine mammals.  Based on the
finding of research
sponsored by SWR, NMFS published an interim final rule on March
29, 1990 prohibiting the
use of all explosives during sets on marine mammals.

<P>NMFS's alternative fishing method research has begun to focus
on techniques that do not
involve encirclement of dolphins.  Areas under investigation
include:

<UL>
<LI>Increasing the efficiency of searches to locate tuna not
associated with dolphins;
<LI>Pre-set separation of tuna and dolphins; and
<LI>The aggregation of tuna using fish aggregating devices
(FADs).
</UL>

<P>Implementation of the third project (FADs) has been hampered
by the lack of participation of
purse seine fishing  vessels.  For various reasons, fishing
vessels have not participated in the
program to the degree expected.  Several research cruises to
evaluate FADs and to assess other
measures (e.g., tuna-dolphin separation and tuna location
devices), however,  are planned for
1992.

<H3>Tuna-Dolphin Interactions</H3>

<P>In 1990, NMFS placed observers on 58 trips aboard U.S. fishing
vessels 49 aboard
international fishing vessels, a shared effort with the IATTC. 
NMFS placed observers on 29
trips aboard U.S. vessels and 18 trips aboard  international
vessels in 1991.  Incidental mortality
of dolphins in the U.S. ETP yellowfin tuna purse seine  fishery
has continued to decline.  In
fact, mortality in 1991 was the lowest since the fishery
began.Exhibit 5 compares the take quota
against 1990 and 1991 mortality data for U.S. vessels.

<P>These reductions are the result of changes in fishing methods,
including a combination
of strict operator performance standards, a ban on sundown sets,
prohibition of Class C pest
control devices, and a noticeable concern by fishery operators to
reduce mortality.  A second
factor contributing to mortality decline is the decision by the
major U.S. tuna canners to no
longer accept tuna caught by setting on dolphins.

<P>Kill-per-set changed little from 1990 to 1991 based on
calendar year data.  When shifting
to fishing year data, kill-per-set declined by more than 25
percent between 1990 and 1991.  The
shift from calendar year to fishing year measurement was required
to complete the data
verification and analysis process for making foreign country
comparability evaluations.

<P>The Marine Mammal Protection Act was amended by Congress on April 30, 1994 <EM>(Public Law 103-238)</EM>.  The amendments replaced the Interim Exemption for Commercial Fisheries (section 114 - see chapter II of the MMPA Annual Report for 1994) with a long-term regime for governing interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries (sections 117 and 118).  This new program has been named the Marine Mammal Assessment Program (MMAP) by NMFS.  Final regulations
implementing this program were published in 1995, after considerable public involvement.

<P>The considerable effort required to prepare comprehensive regulations implementing Section 118 was spearheaded by the MMPA Task Force, which consists of key NMFS and NOAA individuals and their associates in Regional Offices, Science Centers, and Headquarters line offices, as well as representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) (Box 1).  The formation of this cross-cutting national team allowed for timely submission of information and review of draft regulations, and greatly enhanced the ability of NMFS to meet the rigorous Congressional deadlines set forth in the 1994 amendments to the MMPA.

<P>The following chapter outlines the major tenets of the new regime under Section 118:  the prohibition on intentional lethal take, the new regulations governing interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries, the categorization of commercial fisheries in the 1996 List of Fisheries, the marine mammal mortality information used to classify the fisheries, and the public outreach program.  The stock assessment reports required by section 117 and prepared in 1995 by NMFS staff provide a critical element of the new regime and will be addressed in detail in <A HREF="chap04.html">Chapter IV</A>. 

<A NAME="Prohibition on Intentional Lethal Take"></A><H4>Prohibition on Intentional Lethal Take</H4>

<P>Prior to 1994, fishers were exempt from any marine mammal take prohibitions if the takes occurred incidental to commercial fishing operations.  This included actions taken by fishers to protect their gear and/or fish catch from marine mammals.  The 1994 amendments to the MMPA contained a new provision to halt the intentional lethal taking of marine mammals (Section 118(a)(5)), although section 101(c) was maintained to authorize intentional lethal taking if
imminently necessary in self-defense or to save the life of a person in immediate danger.

<P>NMFS promulgated regulations to implement the prohibition on intentional lethal taking on a faster schedule than regulations implementing the other provisions of Section 118.  The proposed rule was published on December 8, 1994 (59 FR 63324) and the final rule was published on February 1, 1995 (60 FR 6037).  Comments on the proposed rule focused on the expansion of pinniped stocks on the east and west coast and their impact on salmon runs and aquaculture operations, and the lack of sufficient alternative means for protecting gear and catch.  NMFS responded that the statute explicitly prohibits intentional taking of all marine mammals, regardless of the status of the stock.  Alternative, non-injurious means for deterring marine mammals are being addressed in a separate set of guidelines, which NMFS published as proposed later in the year (May 5, 1995, 60 FR 22345).  Comments on the proposed guidelines and the final guidelines were still under review by NMFS at the end of 1995.

<P>Final regulations prohibit the intentional lethal take of marine mammals in the course of
commercial fishing operations.  An exception is provided for an intentional lethal take
imminently necessary in self-defense or to save the life of another person in immediate
danger.  The regulations require that if a marine mammal is killed in self-defense or to save
the life of another person, a report must be made to the appropriate Regional Office within
48 hours after the conclusion of the fishing trip.  The prohibition became effective on March
3, 1995.

<A NAME="Legislative History"></A><H4>Legislative and Regulatory History of the Section 118 Regulations</H4>

<P>Prior to the 1988 amendments of the MMPA, commercial fishers could receive an exception from
the MMPA's general prohibition on the taking of marine mammals by applying for permits and
certificates of inclusion.  The 1988 amendments added section 114 to the MMPA, which provided
an interim exemption for taking marine mammals to those commercial fishers who registered
their vessels under the Marine Mammal Exemption Program (MMEP) and reported certain
information in fisher's logbooks.  The Marine Mammal Exemption Program, through observers and
fisher self-reporting in logbooks, allowed NMFS to collect information on fishery-specific
levels of marine mammal incidental take that could be used to start a comprehensive
management regime.

<P>The replacement of section 114 with Section 118 in the 1994 MMPA amendments established a new management regime for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fisheries.  Major tenets of this section were:  to authorize commercial fishers to incidentally take marine
mammals in the course of fishing operations if the fishers comply with registration, reporting, and other  requirements of Section 118, to reaffirm that the reduction of mortality or serious injury of marine mammals incidental to commercial fisheries to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate is an underlying goal of the MMPA, and to prohibit all intentional lethal taking of marine mammals.  Like section 114, Section 118 requires NMFS to classify commercial fisheries into three categories based on the level of serious injury and mortality that occur incidental to each commercial fishery. 

<P>Before the proposed regulations implementing Section 118 were published in the Federal Register, NMFS held two informal working sessions in 1994, in Silver Spring, MD, and in Seattle, WA,  to discuss the draft proposed regulations.  Attendees at the working sessions included Congressional staff, representatives of conservation groups, members of several different fishing industries, representatives of state governments, a representative of the Alaska subsistence community, and NMFS staff.  Discussions and recommendations from these sessions, in addition to written comments received on the draft proposed regulations and on the proposed changes to the list of fisheries, were very helpful in developing the proposed implementing regulations.  

<IMG SRC="../../images/mmaplogs.gif" ALT="Marine Mammal Authorization Program decal" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=right><P>The MMPA Task Force published the proposed rule implementing Section 118 in the Federal Register in June of 1995 (60 FR 31666-31696).  The proposed List of Fisheries (LOF) for 1996, based on the proposed fishery classification criteria set forth in the proposed rule, was published simultaneously.  An Environmental Assessment was prepared to provide the data used to classify fisheries in the proposed LOF and to assess the impacts of the proposed regulations on commercial fishers.  NMFS held 10 public hearings to receive comments on the proposed rule and LOF.  NMFS received 28 oral comments during the public hearings  and received over 70 written comments on either the proposed rule, the proposed LOF, or both.

<P>The final regulations implementing Section 118 of the MMPA were published in the Federal Register in August of 1995 and were in place when the regulations under section 114 expired on September 1, 1995.  The final List of Fisheries for 1996 was published in December of 1996.  Due to the large number of comments on the definition of the Zero Mortality Rate Goal, a final definition was not published in the final implementing regulations.  A final definition is being developed and will be published in 1996.

<A NAME="Injury Definition"></A><H4>Definitions of Injury and Serious Injury</H4>

<P><EM>Injury.</EM>  Under the old section 114, which was replaced by Section 118 and its implementing regulations, fisheries were classified based on the number of takes that occurred incidental to commercial fishing activities.  "Take" was defined broadly and included mortalities, injuries, and, in some cases, harassment.  Because Section 118 focuses on impacts to marine mammal populations, harassment is no longer considered in assessing impacts of commercial fisheries. 

<P>Under Section 118, commercial fishers in Category I and II must report all injuries and mortalities that occur incidental to commercial fishing.  NMFS defined "injury" very explicitly in the final regulations (CFR   229.2): 

<UL>
<EM><FONT SIZE=-1>"Injury means a wound or other physical harm.  Signs of injury to a marine mammal include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position, noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture or rupture of eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs of equilibrium imbalance.  Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any animal that is released with fishing gear entangling, trailing, or perforating any part of the body will be considered injured regardless of the absence of any wound or other evidence of an injury."</FONT></EM>
</UL>


<P><EM>Serious injury.</EM>  Under Section 118, NMFS must classify commercial fisheries based on the level of serious injury and mortality that occurs incidental to commercial fishing operations.  The dichotomy between what the fishers must report ("injury and mortality") and what NMFS must base fishery classification on ("serious injury and mortality") is likely due to recognition by Congress that not all possible injuries to marine mammals will be serious, cause the animal to die, and impact the population.

<P>In contrast to the definition of "injury", which was defined specifically, "serious injury" was defined broadly in the final regulations:  

<UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1><EM>"Serious injury means any injury that will likely result in mortality."  </EM></FONT>
</UL>

<P>Defining serious injury in this way allows NMFS to develop guidelines for which "injuries" may constitute a serious injury.  Guidelines could either apply generally to all marine mammals injured in commercial fisheries, or could be species-specific, age-specific, gear-specific, or some combination of the above.  

<A NAME="Definitions of Category I,II, III Fisheries"></A><H4>Definitions of Category I, II, and III Commercial Fisheries</H4>

<P>NMFS must classify U.S. commercial fisheries into one of three categories under both the old section 114 and the new Section 118 of the MMPA.  The MMPA indicates that category I, II and III fisheries are those that have frequent, occasional, or a remote likelihood of  incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals, respectively.  Under the Interim Exemption Program (1988 - 1995), NMFS defined "frequent", "occasional", and "remote likelihood" in terms of the rate of marine mammal taken per vessel per 20 days.  This definition was somewhat arbitrary and relied heavily on the collection of fishery effort information, as reported by commercial fishers.  Because Section 118 shifted the focus onto impacts of commercial fisheries on marine mammal populations, NMFS redefined "frequent", "occasional", and "remote likelihood" (Category I, II, and III fisheries, respectively) in the final regulations implementing Section 118 to reflect this new focus.

<P>The new definitions of Category I, II and III fisheries capitalize on another section of the MMPA as amended in 1994:  Section 117.  In this section,  Congress mandated that NMFS prepare a Stock Assessment Report (SAR) for each marine mammal stock that occurs in U.S. waters.  Each SAR must describe the distribution of the stock, the population size and trends, the extent of human impact on the stock,  the fisheries that interact with the stock, and the Potential Biological Removal level (PBR) calculated for each stock.  The PBR is defined as the maximum number of animals that can be removed from a population while allowing the population to attain its Optimum Sustainable Population level.  The PBR is calculated as the product of the minimum population size of the marine mammal stock, one half of the maximum rate of increase for that stock, and a recovery factor that ranges from 0.1 to 1.0, depending on the status of the stock.  

<P>The definitions of Category I, II, and III fisheries in the final regulations implementing Section 118 focus on the impacts of commercial fisheries to marine mammal populations by comparing both the cumulative and individual fishery-related annual number of serious injuries and mortalities to the PBR for each species of marine mammal impacted by that fishery.  This approach acknowledges that from a population perspective, one mortality of a western North Atlantic harbor seal (population is increasing) is not equivalent to one mortality of a Northern right whale (population is increasing, but species is endangered and consists of fewer than 400 animals).  Further, this approach recognizes that fisheries that impact different stocks of marine mammals should be subject to a different level of management for the conservation of protected species.

<P>The definitions of Category I, II, and III fisheries are listed in <A HREF="#Box 2">Box 2.</A>  Essentially, the fishery classification criteria consist of a two-tiered, stock-specific approach that first addresses the total impact of all fisheries on each marine mammal stock and then addresses the impact of individual fisheries on each stock.  Tier 1 considers the cumulative fishery mortality and serious injury for a particular stock, while Tier 2 considers fishery-specific mortality for a particular stock.  NMFS goes through the following decision process when assessing each fishery for which data are available:

<P><STRONG>Tier 1:</STRONG>  If the total annual mortality and serious injury across all fisheries that interact with a stock is less than or equal to 10 percent of the PBR of such a stock, then all fisheries interacting with this stock would be placed in Category III.  Otherwise, these fisheries are subject to the next tier to determine their classification.

<STRONG>Tier 2:</STRONG>

<P><EM>Category I: </EM>   Annual mortality and serious injury of a stock in a given fishery is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the PBR level.

<P><EM>Category II: </EM> Annual mortality and serious injury in a given fishery is greater than 1 percent and less than 50 percent of the PBR level.

<P><EM>Category III: </EM> Annual mortality and serious injury in a given fishery is less than or equal to 1 percent of the PBR level.

<P>Exceptions to this classification scheme can be made if the data on which the classification is based are scientifically questionable.  For example, if the coefficient of variation is unreasonably large for either the mortality estimates from an observer program, or for the population estimate on which the PBR is based, NMFS may determine the level of serious injury and mortality by evaluating other factors, such as the fishing gear type used or whether the fishing season occurs during a time of high marine mammal abundance.

<A NAME="Classification Information"></A><H4>Information Used to Classify Commercial Fisheries</H4>

<P>NMFS may base its classification of commercial fisheries on a variety of different types of information.  The best source of information on the level of fishery-specific marine mammal incidental serious injuries and mortalities is a fishery observer program.  Thus, if data from an observer program are available, NMFS will use this information to classify the fishery.  However, because only a few commercial fisheries have been monitored by observer programs, other information may also be used to classify the fisheries.

<P>If data from fishery observer programs are not available, NMFS may also use fishers' reports, stranding data, logbook data, alternative observer programs that use platforms such as aircraft and non-fishing vessels, and other sources of information to classify fisheries.  
   
<A NAME="List of Fisheries"></A><H4>Publication of the List of Fisheries</H4>

<P>Under Section 118, NMFS must publish a list of fisheries (LOF) in the Federal Register at least once a year that places all U.S. commercial fisheries into Category I, II, or III based on the level of marine mammal incidental mortality and serious injury that occurs incidental to each fishery.  Proposed changes to the LOF for the following year are published in the
spring or early summer.  Public comments received during the 90-day comment period will be considered when developing the final LOF, which is published during the late fall or early winter.  

<P>For each fishery, the LOF must include the number of vessels or participants in that fishery and which marine mammals interact with that fishery.  Because the focus in the law is on "injuries and mortalities" to marine mammals, any marine mammal that has been injured or killed in a particular commercial fishery is included.  

<A NAME="Fishery Definitions"></A><H4>Definitions of U.S. Commercial Fisheries in the List of Fisheries</H4>

<P>The LOF published pursuant to Section 118 includes all U.S. commercial fisheries.  Fisheries are defined by the broad or specific geographic area in which they operate, the gear type used, the method used, and the target species.  NMFS will, whenever possible, define fisheries the way they are defined in Federal, regional, or state fishery management plans or programs.  Using this process to define fisheries in the LOF will: 

<UL>
<LI>reduce confusion caused by having multiple names for the same fishery; 
<LI>provide a "common name" for a fishery that can be used by NMFS, fishers, and state and regional fishery managers;
<LI>allow NMFS to more easily collect information on fishery statistics, such as the number of participants, target species landed, length of fishing season, etc.;
<LI>help NMFS meet its statutory obligations by coordinating registration under the MMPA with existing fishery management programs.  
</UL>

<P>NMFS will continue to seek public comment on the optimum way to define commercial fisheries, and will modify the LOF as necessary to reflect changes in the fisheries of the United States.

<A NAME="Registration Requirements"></A><H4>Registration Requirements for Commercial Fishers</H4>
<P>U.S. commercial fishers who participate in Category I or II fisheries in the LOF must register under the MMPA.  Fishers must obtain a registration packet from NMFS and submit the application and the $25 fee to the NMFS Regional Office in which their fishery operates.  NMFS will send the fisher an Authorization Certificate, program decal, and reporting forms within 60 days of receiving the registration form and application fee.

<P>NMFS has successfully integrated registration under the MMPA with state fishery registration in Washington and Oregon and is actively pursuing integration with state fishery registration in Alaska and California.  The benefits of integration have included an elimination of fees and a reduction in paperwork for some commercial fishers, and a reduction in paperwork that must be completed by NMFS.  NMFS will continue to integrate MMAP registration with existing state or federal fishery management programs where possible.

<P><STRONG>Alaska Region's Progress on State-Federal Integration of Vessel Registration</STRONG>

<P>NMFS' Alaska Region (AKR) has met 3 times with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Commercial Fishery Entry Commission (CFEC) since the beginning of 1995 to determine the most feasible course of integrating the registration of vessels participating in Category I and II fisheries under the MMAP with the commercial vessel licensing and fishery permitting systems operated by the state.  The Alaska Region currently has 12 Category II fisheries that operate in state waters, which include approximately 5,000 vessel owners and set net permit holders.  The scenario envisioned to meet the mandate in the MMPA to attempt to integrate existing registration systems and relieve the fishermen of additional paperwork required by the MMAP registration strives also to keep to a minimum any potential impact on the CFEC vessel licensing and fishery permitting systems.  

<P>The CFEC was not able to accommodate the full registration integration for the 1996 fishing season due to their own program re-structuring last year, but did assist NMFS in providing a mailing list of commercial vessel license owners and fishery permit holders for the Category II fisheries.  This list allowed NMFS to contact 5,000 fishery permit holders and 25,000 commercial vessel owners and notify them of the MMAP registration requirements.

<P>It has been determined that if the integration is to go forward, the CFEC would not be in a position to pass on to the fishermen the MMAP registration fee currently assessed by NMFS by raising state licensing and permitting fees to eventually pass money back to NMFS.  State commercial vessel licensing and fishery permitting fees are set by legislative statute.  In order to facilitate the integration, NMFS has agreed to drop the fee to the fishermen and pass
funds directly to the state to cover the costs associated with the registration.  The AKR is requesting the CFEC include in their computerized vessel licensing fishery permitting system a mechanism to allow automatic registration in the MMAP.  The vessel license or fishery permit would contain language that stated that the holder was registered in the MMAP for a specific fishery.  The CFEC would then turn the list of registrants over to NMFS, who would send follow-up information on the program as well as program decals to the registrants.  In this way, fishermen in Category I and II fisheries would not be required to submit separate MMAP  registration forms to NMFS or pay the $25 registration fee.

<P>The CFEC is currently deciding if they will agree to integrate the MMAP registration into their system.  In order for the integration to be operating for the 1997 fishing season, the bulk of the computer reprogramming must be completed by August 1, 1996, to meet CFEC internal schedules.

<P><STRONG>Northwest Region's Progress on State-Federal Integration of Vessel Registration</STRONG>

<P>In the Northwest Region (Washington and Oregon), State commercial fisheries licensing agencies have agreed to assist NMFS with the issuance of Marine Mammal Authorizations for Category I and II fisheries conducted under State issued licenses or permits.  In each case, this is possible because information collected during the State licensing process is adequate to fulfill the requirements of the MMPA and individual vessels can be identified as participants in the subject fishery.  Under the agreements, NMFS will provide logistic support to the States for issuing Authorization materials (such as printed program information, certificates and reporting forms).  The State licensing agencies will distribute the materials at the time of fishing license or permit renewal.  The registration information on fishery participants will then be transferred to NMFS for inclusion in the national Marine Mammal Authorization Program database.  For 1996, the cost savings associated with the agreements resulted in the elimination of Marine Mammal Authorization registration fees for participants in Category I and II fisheries licensed in Washington and Oregon.

<A NAME="Reporting Requirements"></A><H4>Reporting Requirements for Commercial Fishers</H4>

<P>Vessel owners or operators in Category I, II, or III fisheries must report all incidental mortality and injury of marine mammals during the course of commercial fishing operations.  Reports will no longer be made in logbooks, as was required under the old MMEP regulations.  Instead, reports of marine mammal mortality or injury should be made on postage-paid
forms provided by NMFS, and these forms should be sent to NMFS Headquarters. 

<P>These reporting forms have been designed to be scannable by computers.  Because a computer will electronically "read" the reporting form, data entry will be faster and summaries of reports will be more readily available.

<A NAME="Monitoring Programs"></A><H4>Monitoring Programs</H4>

<P>As with the interim exemption program under section 114, Section 118 specifies that NMFS establish a program to monitor incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations.  The purpose of fishery observer programs is to obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in commercial fisheries, to determine the reliability of fishers' reports, and to identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.

<P>Seven fisheries were observed in 1995 for interactions with marine mammals: the New England multi-species sink gillnet fishery, the Atlantic swordfish drift gillnet fishery, the Atlantic tuna pair trawl fishery, the mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery, the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea groundfish trawl fishery, the Washington coastal (Makah tribe) set gillnet fishery, and the California/Oregon thresher shark/swordfish drift gillnet fishery.  In addition, a feasibility survey of several Alaska gillnet and purse seine fisheries was completed in 1995 to determine how observer coverage will be proposed to be allocated in 1996 for these fisheries.  The 1994 MMPA Annual Report contains an appendix that  lists the fisheries observed in 1989-1994 and their associated levels of observer coverage, observed incidental serious injury
and mortality by species, and estimated annual removal levels.  Compilation and analysis of the 1995 data are still in progress.

<A NAME="Treaty Tribe Exclusion"></A><H4>Exclusion of the Treaty Tribe Fisheries</H4>

<P>NMFS issued regulations implementing Section 118 to authorize the taking of marine mammals incidental to  commercial fishing operations.  However, because the rights to fish and hunt are provided separately for Northwest Indian tribes through treaties with the United States, and because the MMPA states that it is not meant to alter any part of a treaty, the NMFS has determined that the MMPA's mandatory registration system does not apply to treaty Indian fishers operating in their usual and accustomed fishing areas.  Several Northwest Indian tribes have developed, or are in the process of developing, regulations for the management of tribal activities with respect to marine mammals.  The tribes have agreed to cooperate with NMFS in gathering and submitting data on interactions between their fisheries and marine mammals so
that the health of affected marine mammal stocks can be monitored.  

<A NAME="EA for Proposed Rule"></A><H4>Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Rule Implementing Section 118 of the MMPA</H4>

<P>To fulfill NMFS' obligations under NEPA, NMFS prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) to examine the consequences of the proposed regulations implementing Section 118 on the environment and on the public.  Because the goal of the MMPA is the protection and conservation of marine mammals and their habitats, NMFS determined that any regulations intended to implement the MMPA would impact protected resources in a positive manner.  Thus, this part of the EA was minimized, and NMFS focused instead on the impact that the proposed regulations would have on the affected part of the human environment: the commercial fisheries. 

<P>NMFS described many of the U.S. commercial fisheries in the EA.  New information was synthesized on the geographic range of the fisheries, the seasons during which the fisheries operate, what type of gear is used, how the gear is fished, the number of participants in each fishery, what species of fish are targeted in each fishery, what type of management program exists for each fishery, etc.  This new information was primarily gathered by requesting licensing data from individual states, by telephone interview of state fishery managers, and by reviews of interstate or Regional Fishery Management Plans and recent amendments to Federal Fishery Management Plans.

<P>The focus of the search for new information was on those fisheries for which NMFS had data concerning  protected species interactions.  In most cases, this meant that updated descriptions were provided for those fisheries placed in Category I or II under the Interim Exemption Program.  However, new information was also collected for many fisheries that have
historically been in Category III.

<P>For each fishery described in the EA, NMFS presented information on the level of takes of marine mammals.  Annual mortality levels of marine mammals in each fishery were averaged over the number of years for which data were available (typically 1989-1993).  Observer data were used in the calculations if available.  If observer data were not available for a particular fishery, logbook data, stranding data, fisher's reports, or Category III reports were included, in that order.  Because the EA focused on the period after the implementation of the Interim Exemption Program and because information from 1994 was typically not available from the NMFS Science Centers and Regional Offices at the time the EA was drafted, only logbook and stranding data collected from 1989 through 1993 were used.  Because the final Stock Assessment Reports were published after the EA was finalized, there are some differences between the two documents, and both should be consulted if information is being sought on marine mammal
mortalities in commercial fisheries. 

<P>Overall, the commercial fishery with the highest species specific rate of average annual incidental mortality is the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery.  Reduction of takes in this fishery has been the goal of the Harbor Porpoise Working Group for several years. Two other fisheries that had high occurrences of incidental mortalities were the large mesh drift gillnet fisheries targeting pelagic species such as tuna, swordfish, and sharks on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.  These drift gillnet fisheries have large numbers of incidental mortalities of delphinid species (especially common dolphins), and incidental mortalities of whales (humpback and right whales in the Atlantic drift gillnet fishery; sperm whales and beaked whales in the Pacific drift gillnet fishery).  Reduction of marine mammal incidental serious injury and mortality in these fisheries will be a major goal of the Take Reduction Teams, which will be formed and convened in 1996.

<P>NMFS also provided information in the EA on the level of incidental mortality of seabirds and sea turtles in commercial fisheries.  Based on observer data, sea turtle captures and mortalities were highest in the Atlantic large pelagics longline fishery.  The data indicate, however, that while the number of captures is large (46 observed in 1992; 92 observed in 1993; extrapolated to 1773 captures in 1992 and 1561 captures in 1993), the number of observed, confirmed mortalities is low (one mortality of a leatherback turtles observed in 1992; 2 mortalities of loggerhead turtles observed in 1993).  Based on observer data, sea bird mortality occurs in all observed gillnet fisheries.  High levels (> 1000 per year) of total estimated sea bird kill have occurred in the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery, the
Prince William Sound salmon drift gillnet fishery, and the Bering Sea/Gulf of Alaska groundfish longline fishery.  In addition, if it is assumed that the observed takes of sea birds in the California angel shark/set gillnet fishery are actually observed kills, the total estimated annual kill of sea birds in this fishery would also be over 1,000 per year.  

<A NAME="ZMRG"></A><H4>Zero Mortality Rate Goal</H4>

<P>The 1994 amendments to the MMPA requires that commercial fisheries reduce incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate within 7 years (by April 30, 2001).  NMFS proposed a definition of the Zero Mortality Rate Goal (ZMRG) in the proposed regulations implementing
Section 118.  Because many comments were received on the proposed definition, and NMFS wanted to study some of the issues raised further, a final definition of the ZMRG was not published in the final regulations. 

<P>In the proposed regulations for Section 118, NMFS proposed that the definition of the ZMRG be essentially the same as the definition of a Category III fishery.  Thus, under the proposed definition, those fisheries in Category III would have met the ZMRG and would not be required to further reduce incidental mortalities and serious injuries.  This proposed approach has the following advantages:  1)  ZMRG would be based on measurable, quantifiable criteria (annual
level of incidental mortality and serious injury relative to the PBR), 2)  the criteria would be conservative as they would be synonymous with Category III, where there is a "remote likelihood" of incidental takes, and 3)  the stock-specific focus of the Act would be maintained.  

<P>Public comments on this proposed definition will be addressed in the Federal Register notice that announces the final definition of the ZMRG.

<P>The proposed definition of the ZMRG tracked NMFS' belief that this goal would be met for a marine mammal stock when the incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial fishing operations reach levels significantly below the stock's PBR.  Once serious injury and mortality levels reach this low annual rate, the impact of commercial fisheries would have a biologically insignificant effect on the status of the affected stock.  NMFS will continue to encourage commercial fishers to reduce incidental mortalities and serious injuries below this level.  

<A NAME="1996 LOF"></A><H4>The 1996 List of Fisheries</H4>
  
<P>A proposed List of Fisheries for 1996 was published in the Federal Register concurrent with the publication of the proposed regulations implementing Section 118 of the MMPA.  This proposed LOF was based on the proposed fishery classification criteria described above. 

<P>During July of 1995, NMFS held 10 public hearings at various locations to receive comments on the proposed regulations and the proposed LOF for 1996.  Of the 86 individuals who attend the hearings, 28 submitted oral comments on either the proposed regulations, the LOF, or both.  In addition, NMFS received 23 written letters commenting specifically on the proposed LOF.  

<P>The final LOF for 1996 was published on December 28, 1995, and was in place when the previous LOF expired on January 1, 1996.  However, in order to allow ample time for the registration of commercial fishers in the Marine Mammal Authorization Program, the previous LOF was extended until 3/1/96.    There were several changes to the fisheries in Category I and II in the LOF in 1996 from the LOF published in 1994/1995.  The Alaska Southeast salmon purse seine and the North Carolina haul seine, both previously in Category III were moved to Category II in the 1996 LOF.  Three new fisheries were placed in Category II:  the Oregon swordfish/blue shark surface longline fishery, the Alaska  pair trawl, and the North Carolina roe mullet stop net fishery.  Some fisheries were also moved from Category II to Category III in the 1996 LOF:  the AK southern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Western Gulf of Alaska sablefish longline/set line, and the California/Oregon/Washington salmon troll fishery.

<A NAME="Take Reduction Plans"></A><H4>Take Reduction Plans</H4>

<P>Pursuant to Section 118 of the 1994 MMPA amendments, NMFS is required to convene Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) for each strategic stock that interacts with a category I or II fishery.  Each team's primary objective is to develop a plan for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to each strategic stock. 

<P>Stocks that are determined to have incidental takes that exceed the PBR are to be designated "strategic."  (Section 117 of the MMPA requires that NMFS complete stock assessment reports for all marine mammal stocks within waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  These stock assessments have to include a calculation of PBR.)  In addition, stocks that are declining and are likely to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), or those that are currently listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are listed as depleted under the MMPA are designated "strategic stocks."  

<P>The  coordination process to form TRTs was initiated in 1995.  Each team is to be made up of individuals who represent the variety of interested or affected parties from the commercial and recreational fishing industry, appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, interstate fisheries commissions, academic and scientific organizations, state officials, native Alaskans or other Native Americans if appropriate, and environmental groups.  NMFS contracted a facilitator group with expertise in environmental dispute resolution in September 1995 to  compile the team participants.  

<P>The contractor is also responsible for convening six (6) Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) and facilitating their development of Take Reduction Plans (TRPs) during 1996, for the following stocks of marine mammals, listed in order of priority: Gulf of Maine stock (population) of harbor porpoise; Atlantic offshore cetaceans; Pacific offshore cetaceans; and the Atlantic baleen whales (humpback and northern right whales).  The development of TRTs for three other stocks; the Atlantic coastal stock of bottlenose dolphins; and the eastern and western stocks of Steller sea lions, is also being considered.
 
<P>During November and December, 1995, the facilitator was contacting individuals to participate on each of the TRTs.  The first TRT meetings will convene in late-January or February, 1996.

<A NAME="Section 101a5E"></A><H4>Section 101a5E:  Interim Permits for the Taking of Threatened and Endangered Marine Mammals</H4>

<P>Section 101(a)(5)(E) of the MMPA allows for the take of marine mammals listed as endangered or threatened under ESA incidental to commercial fishing operations, if it can be determined that: (1) incidental mortality and serious injury will have a negligible impact on the affected species or stock, (2) a recovery plan for that species or stock has been
developed or is being developed, and (3) where required under Section 118, a
monitoring program has been established, vessels are registered, and a take reduction
plan has been developed or is being developed.  

<P>In the proposed rule to implement Section 118 of the MMPA (60 FR 31666, June 16,
1995) and the associated proposed list of fisheries (LOF), comments were requested
that addressed (1) those fisheries that interact with species or stocks listed under
the ESA and (2) information on the magnitude of the takes of such 
species or stocks found in the environmental assessment (EA) that accompanied the
rule. These comments and NMFS's responses to the comments are included in the final
rule to implement Section 118 published in the Federal Register on August 30, 1995,
(60 FR 45086).  

<P>In order to determine whether commercial fishing activities are having a negligible
impact on endangered and threatened stocks of marine mammals, NMFS evaluated the total number of all incidental serious injuries and mortalities due to commercial fishing for each such
stock, based on  information included in final stock assessment reports and in the EA
prepared for the implementation of Section 118 of the MMPA.  
Negligible impact, as defined in 50 CFR 228.3, is "an impact resulting from the
specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably
likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of
recruitment or survival."  Because of the qualitative nature of this definition and
limitations on available information, NMFS determined that the application of
strict quantitative criteria for making negligible impact findings was not
appropriate.  However, as a starting point, NMFS considered a total annual
serious injury and mortality of not more than 10 percent of a stock's PBR level
to be insignificant, based on recommendations of a NMFS workshop held in June,
1994, to propose guidelines for preparing stock assessment reports.

<P>Such a criterion was not, however, the only factor in evaluating whether a
particular level of take was considered negligible.  The information in the
stock assessment reports and the EA had varying degrees of uncertainty, and
factors other than PBR level (e.g., population trend) were also considered.  
Because the negligible impact determinations required some judgement based upon
the available information, each finding indicated NMFS' best assessment of
whether or not the estimated mortality and serious injury of endangered and
threatened marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations adversely
affects the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or
survival.

<P>In order to determine which fisheries would receive permits under section
101(a)(5)(E), NMFS classified ESA-listed marine mammal stocks into three
categories (60 FR 45399, August 31, 1995).  These classifications and
associated stocks are listed in Box 4.  NMFS issued a general interim permit to
fisheries in the first category (Appendix A), and will issue individual  
permits to participants in these fisheries in 1996 and beyond in conjunction
with Section 118 authorization certificates, subject to the same terms and conditions.

<P>The "<A HREF="../bulletin.html"> MMPA Bulletin</A>," a new publication of the Office of Protected Resources, is designed to increase public awareness of and participation in the regulatory process.  The first edition, published in September 1994, included a description of the 1994 Amendments to the MMPA, and subsequent editions have focused on NMFS' efforts to implement the amendments.  The "MMPA Bulletin" has been sent to approximately 1,600 interested parties, including fishers, members of the environmental community, marine mammal scientists, state and Federal agencies dealing with protected species issues, Native American groups, public display facilities, and Congressional staff.

<A NAME="Overview"></A><H4>Overview</H4>

<P>The new section 117 (as amended in 1994) of  the MMPA requires NMFS and USFWS to
prepare, in consultation with regional Scientific Review Groups,  draft assessment reports for
each stock of marine mammal that occurs in waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  The agencies are
to make these reports available for public review and comment and prepare final stock
assessment reports based upon public comments and continued consultation with the Scientific
Review Groups. 

<P>The MMPA requires that each stock assessment report contain several items, including (1) a
description of the stock, including its geographic range;  (2)  a minimum population estimate,
a maximum net productivity rate, and a description of current population trend, including a
description of the information upon which these are based; (3) an estimate of the annual
human-caused mortality and serious injury of the stock and, for a strategic stock, other factors that may be causing a decline or impeding recovery of the stock, including effects on marine mammal habitat and prey;  (4) a description of the commercial fisheries that interact with the stock, including the estimated level of incidental mortality and serious injury of the stock by each fishery on an annual basis;  (5) a statement categorizing the stock as strategic or not, and why; and (6) an estimate of the potential biological removal level (PBR) for the stock, describing the information used to calculate it.

<P>The primary goal of the MMPA is to ensure that each stock of marine mammal does not
become depleted, i.e., reduced below its optimum sustainable population level.  A stock
which has a level of human-caused mortality that is likely to cause the stock to be reduced or
kept below its optimum sustainable population would be classified as "strategic".  A marine
mammal stock is designated as strategic if (A) its level of direct human-caused mortality
exceeds the potential biological removal level; or (B) it is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA, or is designated as depleted under the MMPA; or (C) it is declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the ESA within the foreseeable future.  The consequences of being designated strategic are covered in Section 118 of the MMPA, which requires the formation of a TRT for each strategic stock which interacts with a category I or II fishery.  These teams are required to develop a take reduction plan for each strategic stock, with an immediate goal of reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to levels less than the PBR. 

<P>Section 117 also requires the formation of  three independent regional Scientific Review
Groups (SRGs) representing Alaska, the Pacific Coast (including Hawaii), and the Atlantic
Coast (including the Gulf of Mexico).  The Secretary of Commerce establishes the groups
after consulting with the Secretary of the Interior, the Marine Mammal Commission,
Governors of affected adjacent coastal States, regional fishery and wildlife management
authorities, Alaska Native organizations, Indian tribes, and fishing industry and environmental
groups.  Members of the groups must have expertise in marine mammal biology and ecology,
populations dynamics and modeling, commercial fishing technology and practices, or marine
mammal stocks taken under MMPA section 101(b). These groups advise the Secretary on
stock assessments, uncertainties and research needed on stocks, impacts to stocks, and
methods to reduce incidental mortality in fishing operations.

<P>In 1994, immediately after the amendments were signed into law on 30 April, NMFS held a
workshop on 27-29 June at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, CA, to draft
guidelines for preparing the stock assessment reports (called the PBR guidelines).  NMFS
completed the draft stock assessment reports, 
including preliminary consultation with the three regional SRGs, and made them available for
public review and comment on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40527).  The three SRGs held their
first meetings jointly on 12-13 October, in Seattle, WA, along with NMFS personnel.  The
primary focus of that first meeting was to provide NMFS with comments and
recommendations regarding the draft PBR guidelines.  The public comment period on the
draft stock assessments ended on 1 December, and these comments were compiled,
summarized, and distributed to field offices and the SRGs for review in late December.

<P><STRONG>The 1995 Stock Assessment Process</STRONG>

<P>From December, 1994, to February, 1995,  NMFS consulted extensively with the SRGs to
discuss the review groups  and public s comments on the PBR guidelines and the individual
stock reports.  The draft guidelines and stock assessment reports were modified in response to
comments from the SRGs, the public (including non-governmental organizations such as the
Humane Society of the U.S., the Center for Marine Conservation, and several Alaska native
organizations), and the Marine Mammal Commission. After discussions by NMFS scientists
nationally, particularly authors of the stock assessment reports and members of the MMPA
implementation task force, the PBR guidelines were finalized near the end of February.

<P>The revised stock assessment reports were submitted to NMFS headquarters in March, 1995. 
These draft final reports were reviewed by NMFS headquarters staff from April to June, with
a particular focus on ensuring that the PBR guidelines were consistently applied in all the
reports.  Additionally, the reports were sent to the regional SRGs for a final review. 
Comments resulting from these reviews were incorporated into the final stock assessment
reports, and their availability was published in the Federal Register on 25 August, 1995 (60
FR 44308).
 
<P>From July to September, four documents written by NMFS were published in the NOAA
Technical Memorandum series to make available the 1995 marine mammal stock assessments
and related information.  Three of those documents contained the final stock assessment
reports prepared by NMFS in each of the three regions covered by Scientific Review Groups: 
Alaska (including the North Pacific) (Small and DeMaster 1995), the Atlantic coast (including
the Gulf of Mexico) (Blaylock et al. 1995), and the Pacific coast (including Hawaii) (Barlow
et al. 1995a).  The fourth document contained the final PBR guidelines, a summary of the
1995 stock assessments, and the reports of the June 1994 PBR workshop and the October
1994 Joint Scientific Review Group (Barlow et al. 1995b).

<A NAME="Summary of 1995 MMSA Reports"></A><H4>Summary of the 1995 Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports</H4>

<P><STRONG>Stock Definition</STRONG>

<P>For many species of marine mammals, stocks have never been clearly defined in U.S. waters. 
Therefore, the first task of preparing the stock assessments was to define all stocks. Stocks of cetaceans were typically based on their known distribution within one of  5 major areas of
U.S. EEZ: the Atlantic coast of the continental U.S.,  the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific coast of
the continental U.S.,  Alaska, and Hawaii. These were reasonable stock areas for many
species because of the different oceanographic habitats found between these areas, the large
distances between these areas (especially in the Pacific), and because of the different fisheries that interact with marine mammals within these areas. Where additional biological
information indicated a different stock structure was appropriate, smaller or larger stocks were defined. Such stocks included Pacific humpback whales, beluga whales, Pacific killer whales, Pacific harbor porpoise, and both Pacific and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.  Pinniped stocks were typically defined by the area of their haul-outs and rookeries. Where biological
information indicated it was appropriate, multiple stocks were defined for species, including
the Steller sea lion, the northern fur seal, and the Pacific harbor seal.

<P>A total of 145 stocks were defined for taxa that are under the authority of  NMFS (see
Appendix B), which are cetaceans and most pinnipeds (8 additional stocks of manatees, polar
bears, sea otters, and walrus are under the authority of the USFWS).  There are 60 marine
mammal stocks in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, 54 along the Pacific coast of the
continental U.S. and Hawaii, and 31 in Alaska or the North Pacific. Further work on the
definition of stock structure of many species was recognized as being needed, including
Pacific and Atlantic harbor porpoise, Pacific killer whales, beluga whales, Atlantic bottlenose
dolphins, and Pacific harbor seals. It is therefore anticipated that the number of stocks will
change as additional information is collected and stock structure is revised.

<P><STRONG>Stocks Designated Strategic Because of Incidental Fisheries Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Along the Atlantic coast of the continental U.S. there are 16 stocks that are strategic because their estimate of incidental fisheries mortality exceeds their calculated PBR, out of a total of 34 stocks.  Three of those 16 stocks are also strategic because they are endangered or
depleted.  The Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise had fisheries mortality estimated to be 4.65
times its PBR, primarily in the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery, which was also
mainly responsible for the strategic designation of Atlantic white-sided dolphins. Mortality in
the Atlantic drift gillnet fishery for swordfish, tuna, and shark was primarily responsible for
the strategic designation of 13 other stocks of cetaceans.  Significant mortality of some of
these stocks also occurred in the Atlantic pair-trawl fishery and the Atlantic longline fishery
which also target swordfish, tuna, and shark, and it is possible that there was also significant mortality in the Atlantic mid-water trawl fisheries for mackerel and for squid. Some of these stocks may be strategic only because of species identification difficulties and under-estimation of abundance; NMFS has planned additional research to address these issues. The U.S. Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery was thought to be the source of incidental mortality estimated from strandings that exceeds the PBR of Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins, as well as being responsible for additional mortality of harbor porpoise.  

<P>None of the 26 stocks in the Gulf of Mexico had estimates of incidental fisheries mortality
greater than their PBR. However, the Gulf of Mexico stock of  bottlenose dolphin  (in bays,
sounds, and estuaries) is strategic because it was concluded that in most of the bays and
sounds the take of a single animal would exceed that area s individual PBR, and there is
documentation of stranded animals with evidence of fisheries entanglement in those areas.
Additionally, Gulf of Mexico short-finned pilot whales are strategic because of their low
population size and the documentation of fishery-related mortality in the longline fishery.

<P>Along the Pacific coast of the continental U.S.,  7 stocks out of a total of 34 are strategic because of incidental fisheries mortality that exceeds their calculated PBRs. Their incidental mortality is nearly exclusively from the California/Oregon/Washington drift gillnet fishery for swordfish and shark. Two of these stocks are also strategic because they are listed as endangered under the ESA.  

<P>None of the 20 Hawaii stocks or 31 Alaska stocks have incidental fisheries mortality that
exceeds their calculated PBRs. 

A list of all stocks that are strategic because of incidental fisheries mortality is provided in Box 5.

</TABLE>

<P><STRONG>Stocks Designated Strategic Because of Other Human-Caused Mortality</STRONG>

<P>The stocks of dwarf and pygmy sperm whales in the western North Atlantic were both
designated strategic on the advice of the Atlantic Scientific Review Group because of
stranding data indicating apparent mortality due to the ingestion of plastic bags, and because
identification difficulties between the two species prevented the calculation of a separate PBR
for either species. Additionally, they may interact with the drift gillnet fishery.  Similarly, the stocks of dwarf and pygmy sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico were both also designated
strategic because of apparent mortality due to the ingestion of plastic bags, and because identification difficulties between the two species prevented the calculation of a separate PBR for either species.

<P><STRONG>Stocks Designated Strategic Because They are Endangered, Threatened, or Depleted</STRONG>

<P>Stocks that are listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA or are designated as
depleted under the MMPA are automatically designated as strategic.  Blue, Fin, Sei,
Humpback, Right, Bowhead, and Sperm whales were all listed as endangered in the 1970's,
mostly because they were considered severely depleted due to commercial whaling harvests.
There are 21 stocks from these seven species in U.S. waters, and they are all therefore
strategic (see Box 5). None of these stocks are (a) known to be commercially  listed as
depleted under the MMPA; (b) subject to subsistence harvests by Alaska Natives but where
mortality and serious injury incidental to commercial fishing is absent or is a relatively minor contribution to total human-related mortality and injury; and (c) where indicated in the stock assessment reports, believed to have a total estimated human-related mortality that may not be sustainable over the long-term.

<P>Estimates for PBR and status determinations for such stocks will be determined from the
analysis of scientific and other relevant information discussed during the Co-management
process, and these will maintain the intent of best available scientific information and reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with the information obtained for these stocks.  Three stock assessment reports were affected by these criteria, which were harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska and beluga whales in Cook Inlet and in Norton Sound.

<A NAME="Regional SRG's"></A><H4>Regional Scientific Review Groups</H4>

<P>The primary responsibility in 1995 of the three regional SRGs was to review the draft stock
assessment reports, and this was the main focus of their meetings.  As discussed above, they
worked closely with NMFS personnel to revise and finalize the 1995 stock assessments.  The
SRGs held several meetings just before and during 1995 (see box 6).  Also participating in
the meetings were NMFS personnel from the field offices in each region and from the
headquarters office.

</TABLE>

<P>The SRGs have also provided specific advice to NMFS on what are high priority research
activities to improve the stock assessments.  In 1996 and beyond, it is anticipated that the
SRGs will continue to provide advice, assistance, and guidance to NMFS during the review
and revision process that the stock assessment reports will undergo.  It is also anticipated that they will review Take Reduction Plans for stocks within their regions, and contribute to
identifying critical habitat for strategic stocks. 

<A NAME="TRT's"></A><H4>Take Reduction Teams</H4>

<P>Take Reduction Teams (TRTs) are required under  Section 118 of the MMPA for each
strategic stock which interacts with a category I or II fishery.  Therefore, in 1995, the process of forming such teams was initiated.  These teams are required to develop a take reduction plan for each strategic stock, with an immediate goal of reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to levels less than the PBR.

<P>Six TRTs were proposed for the following fisheries/marine mammal complexes: Gulf of
Maine harbor porpoise, Atlantic offshore cetaceans, Pacific offshore cetaceans, Atlantic baleen
whales, Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins, and Alaska marine mammals.  Initial meetings of
the Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise, Pacific offshore cetacean, and Atlantic offshore cetacean
teams were planned for February-March 1996.  Refer to Chapter II for further information
regarding the formation of these teams.
 
<A NAME="SAP"></A><H4>Stock Assessment Planning</H4>

<P><STRONG>Review and Revision</STRONG>

<P>Section 117 requires the Secretary to review stock assessments at least (A) annually for
strategic stocks; (B) annually for stocks with significant new information; and (C) once every
3 years for all other stocks.  The stock assessment reports are required to be revised if the
review indicates that the status of the stock has changed or can be more accurately
determined. Furthermore, calculations of PBR include a minimum population estimate, which
is required to be based on the best available scientific information on abundance,
incorporating the precision and variability associated with such information; and, provides
reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or greater than the estimate.  As a stock's abundance estimate become old and thus out-dated, it will fail to meet this requirement of reasonable assurance if no information is available about the population trend of the stock. 
Recognizing this, the PBR guidelines recommend making downward adjustments to the
recovery factor when abundance estimates are more than five year's old.  Therefore, NMFS
has made plans to repeat abundance surveys periodically to meet this requirement of
providing reasonable assurance about the stock's size (see next section).

<P>NMFS has planned a workshop in April, 1996 to consider further the guidelines for preparing
the marine mammal stock assessments.  During this workshop it is anticipated that the details
of the stock assessment review and revision process required under section 117 will be
established.

<P><STRONG>Long-Term Planning of Marine Mammal Research</STRONG>

<P>NMFS has developed a preliminary long-term plan for marine mammal activities supported
with MMPA and ESA funds.  One important part of this planning process is the annual
review and revision of a recommended three-year spending plan.  This part of the long-term
plan was first implemented in 1995 with the development of a recommended spending plan
for fiscal years 1996-98.  Research needs for improving stock assessments were a primary
consideration in the development of the three-year plan.

<P>To aid in planning the frequency with which marine mammal surveys will be conducted,
NMFS developed a suggested rotation schedule for abundance surveys.  Each marine mammal
stock was placed in a priority category using the following criteria:  a high priority was
assigned if human-caused mortality was greater than PBR for a particular stock; medium
priority was assigned to surveys for stocks with mortality > 10% of PBR; and low priority
was given to surveys with mortality < 10% of PBR.   A target survey interval was established
for the three different priority categories:  high (every 3 years), medium (every 4 years), and
low  (every 5 years).  In addition to this general prioritization, high priority was also given to abundance surveys for some stocks with mortality < PBR, including surveys of endangered
stocks, surveys of threatened or depleted stocks where there is known or suspected incidental
mortality, surveys of unlisted but declining stocks, and surveys of de-listed stocks required as part of 5-year research and monitoring plans (e.g., gray whales).

<P>The draft survey schedule generated in this manner was the starting point for further
discussions.  Reasons for modifying the draft survey schedule included recovery plans
requiring more frequent monitoring than decided upon for high priority stocks in general, ship
or airplane availability in certain years, efficient use of the manpower of an individual science center in each year, and the desire to coordinate adjacent surveys carried out by different science centers.

<P>The survey rotation schedule was then used to develop the three-year plan.  Similar
prioritization and consideration was also given to other research needed for stock assessments
and for the implementation of Take Reduction Plans, including stock structure studies, fishery
observer programs, and by-catch reduction studies.  The survey rotation schedule and three-
year plan will be updated annually.  In this way, NMFS can anticipate and provide new
information necessary to revising the marine mammal stock assessments.

<A NAME="Domestic Fleet"></A><H4>Domestic Fleet</H4>

<P>Five U.S. flag purse seine fishing vessels, each with a carrying capacity of greater than 400 short tons, operated in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) in 1995. Since June 1994, the
MMPA allows only tuna that are dolphin safe to be sold, bought, offered for sale, shipped or
transported in the United States. Even though the U.S. market was restricted under the
MMPA to only dolphin safe tuna, the General Permit issued to the American Tunaboat
Association allowed U.S. boats an incidental mortality of (kill) 105 dolphins in 1995.

<P>U.S. law requires all U.S. purse seine vessels intending to fish in association with dolphin in the ETP to request a Dolphin Mortality Limit (DML) from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC). A boat is not required to have a DML if it fishes "dolphin safe" and
does not target schools of fish found beneath dolphins. None of the U.S. vessels requested
DML's from the IATTC at the beginning of the year but the five boats did request and
receive DML's for the second semester. However, the U.S. fleet did not make any sets on
dolphins in 1995 and the total mortality for 1995 was zero dolphins.

<P>Under the MMPA, the annual quota cannot exceed the number of dolphin mortalities which
occurred under the permit during the preceding year. The MMPA requires that in each
subsequent year dolphin mortalities must be reduced by statistically significant amounts,
approaching zero by December 31, 1999. This means that there is no allowable mortality
quota available to the U.S. fleet in 1996, regardless of DML's issued by the IATTC.

<A NAME="International Fleet"></A><H4>International Fleet: Yellowfin Tuna Embargoes</H4>

<P>By the end of 1995, the following five harvesting nations with purse seine vessels greater
than 400 short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity harvesting yellowfin tuna in the ETP
remained under primary embargo under the MMPA:  Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Vanuatu
and Venezuela.  The MMPA requires that yellowfin tuna or products from yellowfin tuna
caught in the ETP by purse seine vessels cannot be imported into the United States from any
harvesting nation unless the Secretary has issued an affirmative finding.  An affirmative
finding is issued if the nation demonstrates that it has a marine mammal regulatory program
and a marine mammal mortality rate comparable to that of the United States.  Alternatively, a
harvesting nation may request an affirmative finding if it has prohibited dolphin sets by its
fleet.  Spain and Ecuador currently have affirmative findings as harvesting nations whose
vessels do not set on dolphins.

<P>Under the MMPA, an intermediary nation is one that exports yellowfin tuna to the United
States and also imports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a ban on
direct importation into the United States.  Three nations, Costa Rica, Italy and Japan, are
currently subject to "intermediary nation" embargo.  All yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna
products are prohibited from importation into the United States from a nation under
"intermediary nation" embargo.

<A NAME="La Jolla Agreement"></A><H4>The La Jolla Agreement</H4>

<P>The United States, as a member of the IATTC, participates in the Intergovernmental meetings
(IGM) and the International Review Panel (IRP) meetings.  The IRP was established by
international agreement in 1992 in La Jolla, California, to review the performance of each of
the vessels of the international fleet that participates in the yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery (La Jolla Agreement).  The goal of this multilateral agreement is to reduce marine mammal mortalities in the fishery while sustaining the yield of tuna.  Reductions in dolphin mortality in the international fishery have been achieved through the International Dolphin Conservation Program (IDCP) by the La Jolla Agreement.  The overall annual Dolphin Mortality Limit (DML) set for the international fleet by the La Jolla Agreement through 1999, is allocated annually to vessels that meet certain criteria, including observer coverage, possession of the equipment required for releasing captured dolphins unharmed, agreement to adhere to IATTC standards regarding fishing practices, training of crew members in dolphin safety techniques, and monetary support of the IDCP observer program.  Every vessel in the fishery is assigned an individual vessel quota based on the total number of vessels in the fishery for the year divided into the total DML for the year.  The information collected by the required 100 percent observer coverage is essential for scientific research and for ensuring compliance with the agreement.  

<P>The IRP meets about three times annually and is charged with reviewing and reporting on the
compliance of the international fleet with the La Jolla Agreement and verifying the
performance of individual vessels.  The IRP is made up of representatives of governments,
the fishing industry, and non-governmental environmental organization. 

<P>On October 4, 1995, the governments of Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France,
Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, the United States of America, Vanuatu, and Venezuela
met in Panama City to reaffirm the following commitments and objectives of the La Jolla
Agreement:  (1) progressively reducing dolphin mortality in the ETP to levels approaching
zero through the setting of annual limits and (2) with a goal of eliminating dolphin mortality
in the fishery, seeking ecologically sound means of capturing large yellowfin tunas not in
association with dolphins.  These nations announced their intention to formalize the La Jolla
Agreement as a binding legal instrument which shall be open to all nations with coastlines
bordering the ETP or with vessels fishing for tuna in this region.  This shall be accomplished
by adoption of a binding resolution or other legally binding instrument.  The adoption of the
IATTC resolution or other legally binding instrument, that utilizes to the maximum extent
possible the existing structure of the IATTC is contingent upon the enactment of changes in
U.S. Law, specifically the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

<P>The Panama Declaration would, among other things, establish: (1) through the year 2000 a
per-stock, per-year cap of between 0.2% of the Minimum Estimated Abundance (Nmin) (as
calculated by NMFS or equivalent standard) and 0.1% of Nmin; (2) beginning in the year
2001 a per-stock, per-year cap of 0.1% of Nmin; (3) a 5,000 total numerical cap on dolphin
mortalities in the fishery; and (4) a per-vessel maximum annual DML consistent with the per-
year mortality caps.

<P>The countries agreeing to the Panama Declaration envisioned several changes to U.S. Law
which would result in the lifting of current primary and secondary embargoes, and a change
in the definition of "dolphin safe" to describe any tuna caught in the ETP purse seine fishery
in a set in which no dolphin mortality occurred as documented by observers.

<P>Legislation pending before Congress at the end of 1995 would implement all or some of the
provisions of the Panama Declaration.  Both the Senate and the House have hearings set for
early 1996 to discuss the proposed legislation.  

<A NAME="Dolphin-Safe Research"></A><H4>Dolphin-Safe Research Program</H4>

<P>During FY95, NMFS's Dolphin-Safe Research Program awarded contracts for and oversaw
completion of  3 top-priority projects recommended during the previous year s Research
Planning Workshop.   These projects included 1) acoustic signal propagation in the eastern
tropical Pacific (ETP) marine environment, 2) acoustic target strength of schools of large
yellow tuna, and 3) radar location of tuna in the ETP environment.   Contract results indicate
that acoustic detection of large yellowfin tuna unassociated with dolphins in the ETP should
be feasible with existing sonar systems, and that feasible ranges for radar detection of bird
flocks can probably be doubled using larger antennas, but that radar detection of fish-
associated surface disturbances is probably not feasible for locating submerged tuna schools.  
Optical detection methods received less attention during FY95 than in earlier years, as longer-
range detection methodologies were of greater current interest.  

<P>Subsequent studies planned for FY96 include potential effects of proposed acoustic and
optical detection devices on tuna and marine mammal physiology (i.e., hearing interference
from acoustic detection systems and eye damage from optical (laser) detection systems),
acoustic system design, and survey design for estimating distribution and abundance of
unassociated large yellowfin tuna in the ETP.

<A NAME="Small Take Authorizations"></A><H4>Small Take Authorizations</H4>

<P>Since 1982, the MMPA has provided a mechanism for authorizing,
upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified
activity (other than commercial fishing) for periods not to
exceed five years per authorization.  Before issuing regulations
that allow the takes, NMFS must determine that the takes will not
have more than a negligible impact on the species requested to be
taken and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the
availability of the species for subsistence hunting.  The
regulations require the applicant to monitor the taking of marine
mammals during the activity and to report the results to NMFS.

<P>During 1995, four specific activities had authorizations to
incidentally take marine mammals under this provision of the
MMPA.  The authorized activities included (1) the taking of
ringed seals incidental to seismic activities on the ice in the
Beaufort Sea; (2) the taking of six species of marine mammals
incidental to energy exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi
Seas; (3) the taking of seals and sea lions incidental to the
launching of Titan IV rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California; and (4) the taking of a number of species of marine
mammals during Navy ship shock trials off southern California. 
However, only the taking of ringed seals on the ice in the
Beaufort Sea and the launching of Titan IV rockets from
Vandenberg were active during the year.  No new regulated small
takes applications were received in 1995.
 
<A NAME="Herschel"></A><H4>California Sea Lion ( Herschel ) Conflict with Wild Steelhead</H4>

<P>Efforts to protect the 1995 season s wild winter-run steelhead
at the Ballard locks in Seattle from sea lion predation ended in
June and are presently being evaluated by managers at NMFS. 
Although the 1995 returns of wild steelhead are better than 1994,
with final spawning escapement totaling 126 fish -- an 80%
increase over the all time low return of 70 in 1994 -- the
implications for any long-term run improvement are less certain.

<P>From December 5 to June 17, 1995, observers monitoring sea
lion predation in the Lake Washington Ship Canal documented a
total of 8 steelhead eaten by sea lions.  The total estimated
take was 11 wild steelhead, approximately 8 percent of the total
wild run, significantly lower than the 50% to 65% predation rates
observed from 1986 to 1991.  This lower rate may be either the
result of fewer available steelhead, which are down from over
1,000 per year prior to 1992, or the effectiveness of the
acoustic devices used in deterring sea lions from the prime 
feeding  area at the entrance to the fish ladder.

<P>The 1995 predation control program was conducted by the
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) in conjunction
with NMFS, in accordance with a Letter of Authorization issued to
WDFW by NMFS under the MMPA.  NMFS convened a Pinniped-Fishery
Interaction Task Force and conditionally approved the Task Force
s recommendation to have WDFW lethally remove individually-identified sea lions.  The principal condition specified by NMFS
in its authorization was to place captured sea lions in
captivity, allowing lethal removal only in cases where captive
holding was unfeasible.

<P>A total of three sea lions were captured and held in the 1995
season; they were later released.  Sea lion #17, branded in 1989,
was captured in Seattle on January 25th and held in captivity
during the 1995 steelhead run until June 8th, when it was
released into the wild in the Channel Islands.  A satellite tag
applied to the animal tracked its movements to the Pacific
Northwest.  At last report, on August 29, the animal had migrated
north past Oregon and Washington to Barkley Sound on Vancouver
Island, B.C.  It is anticipated that #17 will soon return to
Puget and make its way to the Ballard Locks.  During captivity,
#17 increased in weight from 872 pounds when captured to 1,082
pounds at the time of release.  This was the only animal placed
in captivity, although several others were identified as
candidates for captivity if captured.  One of those, #255, which
had killed three steelhead on February 8 (the most steelhead
observed killed on any single day), was captured on May 24 and,
due to the lateness in the season, was not placed in captivity
but rather transported to the Straits of Juan de Fuca and
released.  The same circumstances occurred with sea lion #87, the
most frequently observed, identifiable sea lion at the Locks in
1995.  Sea lion #87 was captured on June 17 and also released in
the Straits.  Both sea lion #87 and #225 were observed at the
Locks later in June, feasting on downstream migrating smolts.  

<A NAME="Section 120"></A><H4>Section 120: Pinniped Removal Authority</H4>

<P>The 1994 MMPA Amendments added a new section to the MMPA
which, in addition to requiring NMFS to conduct two studies and
report on interactions between Pacific Coast harbor seal and
California sea lions and salmonid fish stocks, sets forth a
process for authorization of intentional lethal taking of
individually identifiable pinnipeds that are having a significant
negative impact on salmonids that are either listed, approaching
listing under the ESA or migrating through the Ballard locks in
Seattle, Washington.

<P>In July 1994, NMFS received an application from the State of
Washington requesting initiation of the Section 120 process to
consider authorizing the intentional lethal taking of California
sea lions that are depredating a wild run of winter steelhead
during their migration through the Ballard Locks.  In September
1994 the Ballard Locks Pinniped - Fishery Interaction Task Force
was convened to review the available data and public comments,
and to develop their recommendations on whether the application
for lethal removal authority should be approved or denied.  The
Task Force submitted its report and recommendations for
conditioned approval of the State's application in November 1994
and minority views were incorporated into the report in December.

<P>On January 4, 1995, NMFS issued a Letter of Authorization
(LOA) to Washington State for the lethal removal of individually
identified California sea lions from the Ballard Locks under
certain conditions.  Under the NMFS LOA, lethal removal of
"predatory" sea lions was authorized provided non-lethal
deterrence measures, such as an acoustic barrier, were
implemented first.  "Predatory" sea lions were defined as
individually identified animals that had been observed preying on
steelhead in the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  In addition, lethal
removal was only authorized if it was determined that adequate
holding facilities were unavailable or if temporary captive
holding , for the duration of the steelhead run, proved
infeasible or impractical.  Further, lethal removal was not to
occur until the sea lion predation rate exceeded 10 percent of
the available fish in a seven day period.  In addition, lethal
removal would be suspended if the predation rate fell below 10
percent of the available fish for 14 consecutive days of fish
passage.

<P>On January 24, 1995, the 10 percent predation rate "trigger"
was exceeded and the lethal removal authorization went into
effect.  On January 25, "predatory" sea lion number 17 was
captured and placed in a temporary holding facility for the
duration of the steelhead run.  On April 2nd, the lethal removal
authorization ceased as 14 days of fish passage had occurred
without any observed predation.  Two additional "predatory" sea
lions (numbers 87 and 225) were captured and relocated to the
Strait of Juan de Fuca in May and June, following the cessation
of the lethal removal authority.  Sea lion number 17 was released
to the wild on June 8, 1995.  Based on observations at the Locks,
the estimated steelhead mortality attributable to sea lion
predation was eleven fish or approximately eight percent of the
total reconstructed run size.  An estimated 126 adult steelhead
escaped to spawn in 1995.  No California sea lions were lethally
removed under the 1995 LOA.  It is noteworthy that sea lion
number 17 returned to the Locks area in 1995 after spending the
summer on the breeding islands off of southern California, and
that sea lions 87 and 225 also returned following release.

<P>In September 1995, the Ballard Locks Pinniped - Fishery
Interaction Task Force was reconvened to evaluate the
effectiveness of the lethal removal authorization and alternative
measures which were implemented as mitigation in the sea
lion/steelhead conflict.  In light of continuing and projected
low numbers of returning adult steelhead, the Task Force voted 11
to 8 to recommend modifications to the conditions for lethal
removal.  The Task Force, citing information from the Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife that returning numbers are now so
low that individual fish may be critical to the recovery process,
indicated that no avoidable loss of steelhead from predation
should be allowed.  

<P>On November 8, 1995 the Task Force submitted its
recommendations, along with minority views, to NMFS.  The Task
Force recommended that, for the 1995/96 steelhead run, a) sea
lions which had been previously observed killing steelhead should
be removed either to permanent captivity or lethally if observed
in area of central Puget Sound; b) newly identified sea lions
observed taking salmon or steelhead after October 1, 1995 should
be removed to captivity for the duration of the steelhead run (if
funding for captive holding is available) or be lethally removed;
and c) sea lions observed foraging near the Locks, but not yet
observed to have taken a fish, should be removed to temporary
captivity or relocated but not lethally removed.  These
recommendations were judged to be necessary because the Task
Force believes that any predation event would have a significant
negative impact on the steelhead recovery process.  At the end of
1995, NMFS was still considering the Task Force recommendations. 

<A NAME="Small Take Amendment"></A><H4>Small Take Amendment-Incidental Harassment</H4>

<P>Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was amended by the 1994 MMPA
amendments (Public Law 103-238) to establish an expedited process
by which citizens of the United States can apply for an
authorization to incidentally take small numbers of marine
mammals by harassment.  It established specific time limits for
processing the application, for public notice and comment on the
application and for issuance or denial of the authorization.

<P>On May 31, 1995, NMFS published a proposed rule to amend the
small take regulations (60 FR 28379) to implement the process for
issuing harassment authorizations without the need to issue
specific regulations governing the taking of marine mammals for
each and every activity.  This rule would set forth the process
for applying for and obtaining an authorization; the time limits
set by the statute for NMFS review, publication, and public
notice and comment on any applications for authorization that
would be granted; and the requirements for submission of a plan
of cooperation and for scientific peer review of an applicant's
monitoring plans (if that activity may affect the availability of
a species or stock of marine mammal for taking for subsistence
purposes).  The proposed changes to the existing regulations were
made to clarify the requirements for obtaining a small take
authorization.  

<P>If implemented, this rule would result in a more streamlined
and cost effective method for obtaining small take by incidental
harassment authorizations, without lessening the MMPA's
protection of species and stocks of marine mammals.  However,
because of a request by the U.S. Navy to extend the comment
period on the proposed rule for 120 days, the comment period for
this rule did not close until October 20, 1995. 

<P>Under the new small take provisions, during 1995, NMFS
accepted applications from, and issued authorizations to, the
following activities: (1) McNeil Island dock demolition by
Washington State Department of Corrections; (2) Lockheed
Corporation for launches of the Lockheed family of rockets from
Vandenberg Air Force Base, California; (3) the U.S. Air Force for
launches of McDonnel Douglas rockets from Vandenberg; and (4) the
Exxon Corporation for conducting a 3-D seismic survey in the
Santa Barbara Channel, California.

<P><STRONG>McNeil Island, Washington, Dock Demolition </STRONG>

<P>On January 20, 1995, NMFS issued a one-year Incidental
Harassment Authorization to the State of Washington Department of
Corrections to take small numbers of harbor seals by harassment
incidental to the non-explosive demolition of the Still Harbor
Dock Facility on McNeil Island in southern Puget Sound.  NMFS and
the State believed that the noise from the construction site
would cause those harbor seals that come ashore at a nearby 
haul-out beach to leave the shore for the water.  However, as the
project was timed to avoid the peak pupping season, NMFS
anticipated that the impact on harbor seals by this activity
would be negligible under the Authorization which included
monitoring requirements and mitigation measures.   

<P>For comparison purposes, monitoring of the haul-out site was
conducted during pre- demolition, demolition and post-demolition
periods.  A total of 363 incidental harassment takes were
attributed to associated activities of the four month demolition
project.  Demolition related disturbances caused by contractor
activities resulted in decreased numbers of harbor seals using
the haul-out site when compared to pre-demolition counts. 
Following completion of the demolition activities, harbor seal
numbers returned to pre-demolition levels.  Due to budgetary
constraints, the State has not begun construction of the new pier
facility and, therefore, has not applied for a second
authorization.

<P><STRONG>Lockheed Corporation for Launches of Lockheed rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California</STRONG> 

<P>On  July 18, 1995, NMFS issued a small take (harassment)
authorization to Lockheed Environmental Systems and Technologies
Company, Las Vegas, Nevada, to take small numbers of harbor seals
by harassment incidental to launches of its family of 3 space
vehicles at Space Launch Complex 6, Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California.  Based upon documentation submitted with the request,
NMFS concurred with Lockheed that the launches will result in
only negligible impacts to harbor seals located on the Vandenberg
base and no impacts are likely at the pinniped haul-outs on San
Miguel Island.  To ensure that these determinations are correct,
Lockheed will conduct shore-side pinniped surveys along South
Vandenberg and will employ time-lapse photographic monitoring
during the launch when observers are denied access to the beach. 
Acoustic monitoring will also be employed along South Vandenberg
and on San Miguel Island.


<P><STRONG>U.S. Air Force for Launches of  McDonnell  Douglas Rockets from Vandenberg </STRONG>

<P>On  September 19, 1995, NMFS issued an incidental harassment
authorization to the U.S. Air Force for harassment takes during
launches of  NASA/ McDonnell/Douglas'  Delta II rockets from
Vandenberg AFB, California.  This authorization, which is valid
for 1 year, allows the unintentional harassment by launch noises
on harbor seals, northern elephant seals and California sea
lions.  No sonic boom effects are anticipated to harass pinnipeds
on the Channel Islands since the noise over the islands would be
less than ambient and therefore undetectable.  The Air Force will
undertake monitoring and reporting similar to that imposed on
Lockheed. 


<P><STRONG>Exxon  Corporation for Conducting a 3-D Seismic Survey in the Santa Barbara Channel,  California</STRONG> 

<P>An  Incidental Harassment Authorization was issued on October
11, 1995, to the Exxon Company to harass small numbers of
cetaceans incidental to conducting a three-dimensional (3-D)
seismic survey in the Santa Ynez Unit (SYU), located in the
western portion of the Santa Barbara Channel, California, in
Federal waters.  The authorization expired on December 31, 1995. 
Three-D seismic surveys have been in common use in U.S. waters
for several years.  Based on the best available information, NMFS
has concluded that the authorization to harass small numbers of
cetaceans: is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of
any listed species (as defined under the Endangered Species Act);
will not result in more than the incidental harassment (as
defined by the MMPA) of small numbers of mysticete cetaceans,
sperm whales, and possibly pygmy sperm whales; would have only a
negligible impact on these cetacean stocks; will not have an
unmitigable adverse impact on  the  availability of these stocks
for subsistence uses; and would result in the least practicable
impact on the stocks.  The short-term impact from conducting
these surveys may result in a temporary modification in behavior
of certain listed and non-listed whale species.

<P>The MMPA authorizes NMFS to initiate management actions, such as the development of conservation plans, for species or stocks whose survival is in jeopardy.  The ESA offers similar management authority to NMFS for endangered and threatened marine species.  This chapter summarizes species management activities undertaken by NMFS pursuant to the MMPA and ESA in 1995.

<A NAME="Steller Sea Lion"></A><H4>Steller Sea Lion, <EM>Eumetopias jubatus</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Section 7 Consultations</STRONG>

<P>With regard to proposed Federal actions that may affect Steller sea lions, the ESA Section 7
consultation process continues to be an important part of the NMFS Recovery Program.  

<P>Several important consultations occurred in Alaska in 1995: 

<OL>
<LI>NMFS consulted with the Federal Aviation Administration on a proposed NEXRAD (next generation radar facility) on Middleton Island (consultation resulted in a project design expected to result in no adverse effects to sea lions and their use of the haulout on the island, and may provide additional information on sea lion use of this site). 
<LI>NMFS reinitiated and completed formal  consultation on the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries. The new consultations summarized and evaluated the most recent available data on Steller sea lions and the fisheries.  No new mitigation measures were determined to be necessary.
<LI>NMFS has been consulting with the Federal Highway Administration regarding a proposed road from Juneau that could have serious impacts on a Steller sea lion haulout listed as critical habitat.  A draft Environmental Impact Statement and formal consultation on the project are expected in 1996; 
<LI>NMFS has consulted with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding a statewide NPDES General Permit for seafood processing waste discharge.  Through the consultation process, EPA has established no-processing buffer zones around Steller sea lion rookeries and haulouts; 
<LI>NMFS has consulted with the Mineral Management Service regarding several OCS lease sales and exploration activities; 
<LI>NMFS has begun consultation regarding a proposed Kodiak rocket launch site, which may have effects on a nearby Steller sea lion haulout; and 
<LI>NMFS has been consulting with the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the  Department of Interior Solicitor's Office regarding the applicability of Section 7 to land transfers from the Federal government to the state of Alaska or Alaska Native Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska Statehood Act. In the past, these Federal agencies had not consulted with NMFS during land transfers, and thus, some critical habitat sites for Steller sea lions passed out of Federal jurisdiction without any consultation with NMFS.

<P><STRONG>Proposed Reclassification Under the Endangered Species Act</STRONG>

<P>In an emergency rule issued on April 5, 1990, NMFS determined that the Steller sea lion was
a threatened species under the ESA (55 FR 12645; see also, 55 FR 13488, April 10, 1990). 
The final listing became effective on December 4, 1990 (55 FR 49294, November 26, 1990;
see also, 55 FR 50005, December 4, 1990).  The species was listed throughout its range
because of a precipitous decline in abundance.  This decline was concentrated primarily in
areas near the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands.  

<P>Since 1990, NMFS and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) have conducted
monitoring surveys that indicate that the decline of Steller sea lions has continued throughout
most of Alaska.  Because of this continued decline, on November 1, 1993, NMFS initiated a
formal population status review under the ESA to determine whether a change in its listing
status as a threatened species is warranted (58 FR 58318, November 1, 1993).

<P>NMFS received sixteen comments in response to the status review notice.  Based on these
comments, recommendations from the Steller sea lion recovery team, and additional data
collected by NMFS (including a summer 1994 population survey), NMFS issued a proposed
rule and request for comments on October 4, 1995 (60 FR 51968).  NMFS proposed in this
rule that the western stock of the species (west of 144ø W longitude) be listed as endangered,
while the eastern stock (east of 144ø W longitude) remain classified as threatened.

<P><STRONG>Recommendations of the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team</STRONG>

<P>The Recovery Team was appointed by NMFS in 1990 to draft a recovery plan for the species
and to serve as an advisory body to NMFS on Steller sea lion research and management
issues.  On November 29-30, 1994, NMFS convened the Recovery Team specifically to
consider the appropriate ESA listing status for the species and to evaluate the adequacy of
ongoing research and management programs.  In the course of that meeting, and in
subsequent letters to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), the Recovery
Team recommended that NMFS list the Steller sea lion as two separate population segments,
split to the east and west of 144ø W long. (a line near Cape Suckling, AK).  The Recovery
Team recommended that the western population segment be listed as endangered and that the
eastern population segment be listed as threatened.  


<P><STRONG>Proposed Population Determinations </STRONG>

<P>Only a "species" may be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, although this term
is defined to include any subspecies of fish or wildlife and any distinct population segment of
any species of fish or wildlife that interbreeds when mature. On December 21, 1994, NMFS
and the USFWS issued a proposed policy to clarify their interpretation of the phrase "distinct
population segment" for the purposes of listing, delisting, and reclassifying species under the
ESA (59 FR 65884, December 21, 1994).  Although this policy is only a proposal at this
time, it represents the best available guidance for interpreting the term "distinct population
segment."   

<P>NMFS proposed to use the criteria announced in the December 21, 1994 policy proposal to
assess the presence of distinct populations of Steller sea lions.  The proposed policy outlined
three elements that should be considered in any decision regarding the status of a possible
distinct population segment:  

<UL>
<LI>discreteness of the population segment in relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs;
<LI>significance of the population segment to the species to which it belongs; and 
<LI>conservation status of the population segment in relation to the ESA's standards for listing. 
</UL>

<P>Under the proposed policy a population segment of a vertebrate species may be considered
discrete if it is either markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon as a
consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors (quantitative
measures of genetic or morphological discontinuity may provide evidence); or delimited by
international governmental boundaries that are significant in light of section 4(a)(1)(D) of the ESA.  The former criterion is particularly relevant for Steller sea lions.

<P>Genetic studies provide the strongest evidence that distinct populations of Steller sea lions exist.  Genetic samples from 224 Steller sea lion pups were collected from rookeries in
Russia, the Aleutian Islands, the western and central Gulf of Alaska, southeastern Alaska, and
Oregon.  Mitochondrial DNA analyses of these samples identified a total of 52 haplotypes
(sets of alleles of closely linked genes that tend to be inherited together, uniquely identifying a chromosome) that could be further grouped together into eight lineages.  Bickham et al. found a distinct break in haplotype distribution between the four western localities and the two eastern localities.  Cluster analysis indicated that the eight lineages could be subdivided into two genetically differentiated populations, with the division at about Prince William Sound.  

<P>Similar analyses were conducted from samples obtained from 11 Steller sea lions on Ano
Nuevo Island, CA, and seven haplotypes were identified.  Six of these were identical to those
identified from southeastern Alaska and Oregon, and one was unique to Ano Nuevo Island. 

<P>Tagging and branding studies provide evidence that the breeding behavior of Steller sea lions probably reduces opportunities for genetic mixing among rookeries although Steller sea lions have been documented to travel large distances during the non-breeding season.  The majority of females marked as pups, then later resighted as adults, have returned to their rookery of birth to breed.  The few resighted females observed breeding at rookeries other than their natal site were all at rookeries near their birth rookery.  This apparent natal site fidelity not only reduces genetic mixing among rookeries, but it also makes it less likely that declining rookeries will be bolstered by recruitment from other rookeries.

<P>Population trend data provide further evidence of separation  among these two population
segments.  The Steller sea lion population east of Cape Suckling (with the exception of the
portion in southern California) has remained stable since the 1970s, whereas the population to
the west has declined dramatically.  Futhermore, the only break in the distribution of Steller
sea lions along the Alaskan coast occurs in the Yakutat area, near the proposed longitudinal
border that would delineate the western and eastern populations.  A phylogeographic approach
to discern population discreteness in Steller sea lions indicates that, based on an evaluation of distribution, population response, phenotypic, and genotypic data, Steller sea lions should be managed as two discrete populations, a western and an eastern population, with the separation line at about 144° W. long. 

<P><STRONG>Status of the Western Steller Sea Lion Population Segment</STRONG>

<P><EM>Population Monitoring Data</EM>

<P>The western Steller sea lion population segment had suffered substantial declines prior to the 1990 ESA listing.  Loughlin et al. (1992) estimate a 70-percent decrease in the number of
adult and juvenile sea lions in this area between the 1960's and 1989.  Since the 1990 listing,
Steller sea lion trend counts for the western population segment have shown a continued
decline.  The number of adult and juvenile animals counted at trend sites during aerial
surveys has dropped from 30,525 in 1990 to 24,104 in 1994 (a 21-percent decrease).

<P><EM>Regionally Differing Decline Rates</EM>

<P>Counts of eastern and central Gulf of Alaska (a 38-percent and a 36-percent decline,
respectively) and the central and western Aleutian Islands (a 28-percent and a 13-percent
decline, respectively) have shown the largest declines in adult/juvenile numbers since 1990. 
Counts of the eastern Aleutian Islands area and western Gulf of Alaska area have been
relatively stable since 1990, while the Bering Sea region has shown an increase in
adult/juvenile counts since 1990.  However, the eastern Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea
regions declined substantially prior to 1990, and populations there remain only a fraction of
what they were 20 years ago.

<P>Pup production has decreased since the 1990 listing.  Overall, a decline of about 28-percent
has been observed between pup counts made in 1989-90 as compared to 1993-94 (excluding
the western Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea where comparative counts are not available).  Regional differences in the rate of change in pup production are apparent.  Pup production in the central Gulf of Alaska declined by 49-percent between 1989-90 and 1993-94.  The central and eastern Aleutian Islands also had large decreases in pup production (a 19-percent and a 16-percent decline, respectively), while pup production in the eastern and western Gulf of Alaska was relatively stable over the time period.

<P><EM>Population Viability Analysis</EM>

<P>Steller sea lion abundance trends within the decline area were modeled to provide an estimate of the likelihood of extinction given the available population data.  Using both the 1985-94 and 1989-94 population trends, two models were developed based on a stochastic model of
exponential growth that required only count data and count variance to predict future trends. 
One model (an aggregate Kenai-Kiska Island (trend sites) model) was based on the trajectory
of the sum of the rookery populations within the area.  The second model was based on a
simulation of the population trajectories of individual rookeries in the Kenai-Kiska area.   
 
<P>Both models predicted that the Kenai-Kiska population would be reduced to low levels (<500
females) within 100 years from the present, if either the 1985-94 or 1989-94 trend continues
into the future.  The Kenai-Kiska regional model predicted a probability of extinction within
100 years of 100 percent from the 1985-94 trend data, and a probability of extinction within
100 years of 65 percent if the 1989-94 trend data are used.  

<P>Under all modelling scenarios during the next 20 years, assuming that observed rates of
decline will continue independent of changes in density and that the current rate of decline is
independent of environmental stochasticity, populations on individual rookeries are predicted
to be reduced to low levels (mean size <100 adult females).  These results indicate that, if
either trend persists, the next 20 years will be crucial to the survival of the western Alaska
population. 

<P><EM>Conclusions Concerning the Western Population</EM>

<P>An analysis of the conservation status of the western population segment of the Steller sea
lion in relationship to the standards for threatened and endangered status indicates that the
western stock fits the criteria for listing as endangered under the ESA. 

<P><STRONG>Status of the Eastern Steller Sea Lion Population Segment </STRONG>

<P><EM>Population Monitoring Data</EM>

<P>The 1990 ESA listing of Steller sea lions resulted primarily from the declines observed in the western population area; in the eastern population, a decline has been noted only in the
California part of the range.  Since the 1990 listing, trend counts of the eastern population
segment show about a 17-percent increase overall in adult/juvenile numbers.  Similar to the
western population, regional differences in trends within the eastern population are evident.  

<P>California experienced a large decline in Steller sea lion numbers prior to 1980; NMFS
(1995) estimated a greater than 50-percent decline between about 1950 and 1980.  Some of
the available data indicate that a northward shift in the Steller sea lion range may be
occurring, which may exacerbate the decline at southern rookeries.  Steller sea lion counts in
California have been relatively stable since 1980 (1980 count was 982) although counts
declined 19-percent from 1990-94 (from 1,123 animals to 915) (NMFS, 1995).  The reasons
for the historical decline in Steller sea lion total abundance and the current decline at southern locations in California is not known.  Causal factors under investigation include changes in prey base, possible effects of anthropogenic contaminants and disease, disturbance, and competition with other pinniped populations that are increasing in abundance in California,
e.g., California sea lions, elephant seals, northern fur seals.

<P>Steller sea lion adult/juvenile counts at Oregon trend sites show a relatively large increase from 1990-94 (from 2,005 to 2,696) but this may be, at least partially, due to improved counting techniques (NMFS, 1995).  Steller sea lion adult/juvenile counts in Southeast Alaska increased 15-percent from 1990 to 1994 (from 7,629 to 9,005), and pup counts increased by about 10-percent (from a mean of 2,568 in 1989-90 to a mean of 3,701 in 1993-94). 

<P>The British Columbia portion of the eastern population has also apparently been increasing
slowly since the 1970s.  Reports from aerial surveys conducted by the Canadian Department
of Fisheries and Oceans indicate that adult/juvenile counts at rookeries and haulouts in British Columbia increased about 10 percent between 1992 and 1994 (from 7,376 to 8,091) (Olesiuk, pers. comm.).

<P><EM>Criteria for Threatened Status and Conclusions Concerning the Eastern Population</EM>

<P>The overall trend of the eastern population segment of Steller sea lions since 1980 is stable to increasing although significant declines in the number of Steller sea lions occurring within California prior to 1980 have been documented.  Population modeling to assess the viability of the eastern population segment has not been specifically conducted by NMFS.  Since this population's trend has been stable to increasing, modelling, such as that conducted for the western population, would be expected to predict persistence of this population segment for
the foreseeable future.
   
<P>Prior to the decline, the proportion of the U.S. population of Steller sea lions that resided within the eastern population area was less than 10 percent (NMFS, 1995).  Because of the western population's decline, the eastern population's numerical significance has increased.  NMFS (1995) estimates that the total U.S. population of Steller sea lions has declined by 73 percent between the 1960s and 1994 (NMFS, 1995).  Thus, although for listing purposes the western and eastern population segments may be considered discrete, the substantial population decline that has occurred in the eastern Gulf of Alaska through the Aleutian Islands represents a threat to the continued existence of the entire species, including the eastern population. The vulnerability of the eastern population remains
a serious concern as long as the cause of the decline of the western population remains
undetermined.  These populations, while separate, are not isolated, and factors causing the
decline in Alaska could move eastward and pose a threat to the continued existence of the
eastern population.  In addition, the declining numbers of Steller sea lions in California, in the southern extremity of their range, is also of concern.  

<P>An analysis of the conservation status of the eastern population segment of the Steller sea
lion in relationship to the standards for threatened status indicates that this population remains vulnerable (i.e., the above mentioned third criterion of the proposed population policy was satisfied), but in a manner and to an extent that differs from the vulnerability of the western population segment.  Likewise, the available data and information concerning the status of this stock indicates that the eastern population should continue to be considered threatened.  

<P>NMFS proposed a separate listing for the eastern population of the Steller sea lion as a
threatened species under the ESA.  The eastern population segment would consist of Steller
sea lions from breeding colonies located east of 144° W. long.

<P><EM>Quotas on Incidental Takings  </EM>

<P>On April 30, 1994, the reauthorized and amended MMPA established a new regime to govern
the take of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations to replace the interim
exemption program that was established by the 1988 amendments to the MMPA.  Under the
1988 Interim Marine Mammal Exemption Program, up to 1,350 Steller sea lions were
authorized to be taken annually incidental to commercial fisheries and emergency regulatory
actions were required if more than 1,350 animals were incidentally killed in any year.  The
new MMPA management regime replaces the previous quota system and focuses on reducing
the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals from strategic stocks, i.e.,
those that are listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, those that are listed as
depleted under the MMPA, and those for which human-caused mortality exceeds the
estimated potential biological removal (PBR) for the stock.  

<P>Under this new regime, section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA allows NMFS to authorize the take
of threatened and endangered marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations
only if, among other things, that take will have a "negligible impact" on the stock.  In a
separate action, NMFS has adopted the following definition of "negligible impact", found at
50 CFR 228.3, for the purposes of making this determination: when mortality and serious
injury rates incidental to fishing operations are only a small portion (e.g., 10 percent or less) of the PBR, then the fisheries' take would be a negligible mortality factor for the affected stock or population.

<P>With regard to the western population of Steller sea lions, NMFS has estimated that 41
animals per year (Small and DeMaster, 1995) are taken incidental to commercial fisheries
operations.  This estimate of commercial fishery annual incidental take from the western
population is below 10 percent of the calculated PBR for this population (77 animals).  Based
on this it would be appropriate to conclude that taking incidental to commercial fisheries is
having a negligible impact on the western population of Steller sea lions.

<P>With regard to the eastern population of Steller sea lions, NMFS has estimated that
approximately 4 animals per year are taken incidental to commercial fisheries operations. 
This estimate of commercial fishery annual incidental take from the eastern population is
substantially below 10 percent of the calculated PBR for this population of 1,059 animals.  

<P>It is, thus, appropriate to conclude that taking incidental to commercial fisheries is having a negligible impact on the eastern population of Steller sea lions.   Based on this negligible impact determination, and in light of the PBR determination and the overall continued declining trend in Steller sea lions, NMFS issued an Incidental Take Statement (on August 25, 1995) that authorizes, under Section 7(b)(4) of the ESA, the incidental mortality and serious injury in commercial fisheries of up to 77 Steller sea lions from the western
population annually (west of 144° W. long.) and up to 106 Steller sea lions from the eastern
population annually (east of 144° W. long.).

<P><EM>Removals from the Eastern Population Segment</EM>

<P>Accurate data on incidental takes of Steller sea lions in other fisheries in Southeast Alaska, Oregon, and California are not available, but estimates from available sources are low. 
Alaska Native takes of Steller sea lions within the eastern population (Southeast Alaska) have
been estimated at less than 10 animals annually (Wolfe and Mischler, 1993; 1994).  

<P>The calculated PBR for the eastern population of Steller sea lion is 706 animals, well above
the current level of human-caused mortality.

<P><EM>Proposed Determinations</EM>

<P>The best available information indicates that Steller sea lions should be managed as two
discrete population segments and NMFS proposes separate listings of the eastern and the
western population segments of the Steller sea lion for the purposes of the ESA.

<P>Available data on population trends indicate that the western population of Steller sea lions is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant part of its range.  This population had exhibited a precipitous, large population decline at the time that the Steller sea lion was listed as a threatened species in 1990, and has continued to decline since the listing.  Although the precise cause(s) of the decline have not been determined, it is likely that the current condition is caused by a combination of the factors specified under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA.  An endangered classification appears appropriate for the western population of Steller sea lions.  

<P>The eastern population segment was originally listed as a threatened species in 1990 when the entire species was listed.  The eastern population has exhibited a stable to increasing
population trend for the last 15 years; however, NMFS believes that the large decline within
the overall U.S. population threatens the continued existence of the entire species.  This is
particularly true since the underlying causes of the decline remain unknown, and thus,
unpredictable.  

<P>Therefore, despite the apparent stability of the eastern population segment, NMFS proposes to maintain a threatened listing for this portion of the geographic range.  This proposed
determination allows a differentiation between the two populations that acknowledges the
different individual population trends, but does not lose sight of the overall trend for the
species.  NMFS, in conjunction with the Recovery Team, will develop appropriate delisting
criteria for the eastern population segment. 

<A NAME="Harbor Seals"></A><H4>Harbor Seals, <EM>Phoca vitulina</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Workshop on Population Assessment of Harbor Seals in Alaska</STRONG>

<P>A workshop was held November 14-16, 1995, in Fairbanks, Alaska to review population
assessment research on harbor seals in Alaska and to assess their current population status. 
Overviews and input were sought from a panel of scientists to address the following basic question: What level of population change do we wish to detect over which geographic areas
in how much time and with what level of certainty?

<P>The following recommendations from the workshop were based on discussions on the
following topics: stock structure and current status of seals in Alaska, survey design and
correction factors, trend sites: molting vs. pupping, and Alaskan Native issues.

<P><STRONG>Summary And List of Recommendations</STRONG>

<P>The general principles of survey design were presented and discussed, followed by examples
from current research, in particular, from Prince William Sound (PWS).  Overall, the current
approach of conducting annual surveys with approximately 7 replicates was considered
appropriate.  However, more detailed analyses of existing count data outside of PWS 
are needed to determine if this survey design should be modified.  The application of the Poisson regression model has provided insight on how to account for a substantial portion of the variance associated with trend counts; this statistical technique should be utilized whenever possible in future analyses.  The establishment of new trend site surveys was recommended, with the Northeast Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea the two areas of highest priority.  A central database will be established at the NMML and data collection protocol will be standardized following NMFS and ADF&G formats.  Additional correction factor estimates
are needed, especially from glacial ice and rocky substrates in the Gulf of Alaska.  Discussion
with the Alaskan Native Community on issues related to harbor seal population assessment
should continue through the Alaskan Native Harbor Seal Commission.

<P>Specific recommendations were as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Examine current survey routes to ensure trend sites within each route are stratified by haulout substrate and the number of seals at the haulout sites, and such that approximately the same percentage of seals are counted among the different survey routes.  Explore the use of statistical models that do not assume independence among sites, such that an estimate of covariance among sites may be calculated and incorporated into the overall estimate of variance.
<LI>For the purpose of population assessment, discontinue pupping counts unless future analyses of existing pupping count data demonstrate they exhibit precision and statistical power comparable to molting counts.
<LI>To determine the quality of trend count data relative to the assessment of population trend, analyze all existing trend count data to account for variability due to environmental factors (e.g., date, tide, time) followed by a power analysis.  Comparison of trends between different substrates, especially rocky vs. glacial ice, within the same survey route is needed. The completion of such analyses are required to determine if the current survey design should be modified, and will provide a better understanding of how well population trend has been assessed in the different geographic areas.
<LI>Until the analyses described in #3 are completed, trend counts surveys should be conducted annually, attempting to achieve 7 replicates, for at least 5 years to obtain acceptable levels of statistical power to assess population trends.  Thereafter, biannual surveys should be considered to continue monitoring population trend.
<LI>Establish guidelines on how to quantify disturbance during aerial counts and incorporate such documentation into survey protocol; Kate Wynne will provide the draft outline based on her attempts to quantify disturbance during Kodiak trend count surveys.  Such data should then be entered into analytical models as an environmental factor to determine if counts at some sites are significantly more variable due to disturbance.
<LI>Range-wide surveys should continue, as they provide information on population status outside of those areas monitored by trend count surveys.
<LI>When the analyses in #3 are completed, determine if the current survey design within specific geographic areas are providing a satisfactory level of statistical power to detect a minimally acceptable level of population change.  Thereafter, modify survey design as appropriate, and then establish new trend routes when funding is available.  Areas of highest priority for new trend routes are the Northeast Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea.
<LI>Establish a central database for harbor seal population assessment research at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML).  Dave Withrow (NMML) will draft the data collection protocol(s) from existing NMFS and ADFG formats.
<LI>Pursue new techniques to capture seals on glacial ice to develop a correction factor for such substrates.  Estimate a correction factor for rocky substrates in the Gulf of Alaska.
<LI>Compile a continuous,  clean  data set and historic chronology for Tugidak Island.  Laurie Jemison is available to compile this database from field reports, interviews with local residents and researchers responsible for historic data and projects.
<LI>Continue to discuss issues related to harbor seal population assessment with the Alaskan native community through the Alaskan Native Harbor Seal Commission, and pursue cooperative arrangements to integrate traditional environmental knowledge.
</OL>

<P><STRONG>Conservation Plan</STRONG>

<P>The Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission has the draft harbor seal conservation plan for
review and comment.  This plan cannot progress without full Alaska Native participation and
support.   Fortunately, preliminary comments suggest that the document is of sufficient
flexibility for Alaska Native concerns. 

<P>Research recommendations from the population assessment workshop are to be included in
the Harbor Seal Conservation Plan, as well.  The current draft of the Conservation Plan was
distributed at the above-mentioned workshop and acknowledged as a mechanism for
coordinating State and Federal research and management activities. 

<A NAME="Bottlenose Dolphin"></A><H4>Bottlenose Dolphin, <EM>Tursiops truncatus</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Assessment Surveys</STRONG>

<P><EM>Southeast U.S. Coast Aerial Surveys</EM>

<P>The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) conducted aerial surveys in January-March
to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of bottlenose dolphins in coastal waters
between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and approximately Ft. Pierce, Florida.  Line transects
were flown orthogonally to the coastline to approximately 9 km past the average position of
the Gulf Stream inner wall.  Inclement weather throughout the survey area prevented
completion of the original survey plan; each of the nine survey blocks was flown only once
instead of the three replicate surveys originally planned.  A total of 134 bottlenose dolphin
herds were sighted and other species sighted included Atlantic spotted dolphins, striped
dolphins, right whales, and humpback whales. The humpback and right whale sightings all
occurred close to the shoreline.  Analysis of the bottlenose dolphin perpendicular sighting
data will be completed in 1996.

<P><EM>Caribbean Shipboard Survey</EM>

<P>The SEFSC conducted a cetacean survey in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent North Atlantic
aboard the NOAA Ship Oregon II during January-February, 1995 to estimate abundance and
examine the distribution of cetaceans in the northern Caribbean Sea and adjacent Atlantic
Ocean.  Associated environmental data and skin and blubber biopsy samples were also collected. Surveys were conducted during daylight hours and 4,275 transect km were surveyed during the 44 day cruise.
  
<P>The maximum number of cetacean groups sighted in one day was six and 70 groups were
sighted during the entire cruise.  Cetaceans were encountered throughout the area surveyed
and nine species were identified.  Humpback whales, sperm whales, pilot whales, Atlantic
spotted dolphins, and pantropical spotted dolphins were the most commonly sighted species. 
Group sizes for humpback whales and sperm whales averaged 1.8 and 3.6 whales,
respectively.  Pilot whale group size (probably short-finned pilot whales) ranged from 8-43
animals.  The largest group sighted was a group of 140 striped dolphins.  Pilot whales and
humpback whales were observed associated on two occasions.  A biopsy sample was obtained
from one individual in each of two groups of Atlantic spotted dolphins near Puerto Rico. 
Analysis of the abundance and distribution data will be completed in 1996 and the biopsy
samples have been archived.

<P><EM>Mid-Atlantic Bight Aerial Surveys</EM>

<P>The SEFSC conducted line transect aerial surveys over the coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic
bight from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, during July 11
through August 14, 1995.  Latitudinally-oriented transects were flown over the area from
shore to the 25 m isobath to examine the distribution and estimate abundance of Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins.  The survey was designed to provide sufficient precision for monitoring
population trends and 205 transects covering approximately 7,600 km were flown during the
34-day survey period.

<P>One hundred forty bottlenose dolphin herds, totaling 2,490 dolphins, were sighted; also
sighted were three herds of Atlantic spotted dolphins, totaling 93 dolphins.  Preliminary
analyses of the perpendicular sighting distance data produced an estimated average of 11,374
bottlenose dolphins in the survey area during the survey period (asymptotic 95% confidence
interval = 7,523 < N < 17,198; coefficient of variation = 21.3%).  The analysis assumed that
all dolphin herds directly on the transect were observed [g(0) = 1]; thus, this may represent a
negatively-biased estimate of average bottlenose dolphin abundance.  The proportion of the
estimated average abundance represented by the Atlantic coastal migratory bottlenose dolphin
stock (listed as depleted under the MMPA) is unknown because neither the distribution of this
stock nor that of the offshore stock is known, but their distributions are believed to overlap. 
It is also impossible to visually distinguish between the two stocks during aerial surveys
because the stocks overlap in body size.

<P><STRONG>Bottlenose Dolphin Health Assessment: Field Report on Sampling near Beaufort, North Carolina, during July, 1995</STRONG>

<P>The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) is conducting research to estimate and
eventually monitor health assessment indices of local bottlenose dolphin stocks throughout the
Southeast Region in order to assess the impact of human activities on specific bottlenose
dolphin stocks.  These health assessment indices will be used to refine estimates of human-
induced mortality and other human-induced impacts, and combined with reproductive rate,
age structure, and stock structure information will allow more accurate estimation of potential
biological removal levels for a given population.  

<P>The health assessment studies require sampling of live bottlenose dolphins.  The SEFSC has
conducted live capture, sampling, and release exercises in specific areas of the coastal
Southeast Region where anomalous mortalities of bottlenose dolphins have occurred. 
Reference samples collected at an unaffected site (Sarasota, FL) have been used, with those
collected by the SEFSC,  to develop and test a quantitative health assessment model (Wells,
1994; Sweeney et al., in review a and b).  This model is still being refined, and when used
with other information may provide a means of estimating the effects of some indirect,
human-induced impacts, such as environmental contaminants, on dolphin stocks (e.g., Reif et
al., in review), and for identifying stocks at relatively higher risk of mortality.

<P>The SEFSC sampling has included bottlenose dolphins in an affected site, Matagorda Bay,
Texas.  Dolphins in this estuarine area  were sampled during July, 1992, because of unusually
high numbers of strandings there in 1990 and 1992.  Bottlenose dolphins of the U.S. Atlantic
coastal stock were classified depleted under the MMPA as a result of a mass dieoff during
1987-88.  The bottlenose dolphins which occur in the estuarine system near Beaufort, NC, are
believed to belong to this depleted stock.  

<P>Captures were conducted on 11 days during the period July 10-21, 1995.  Dolphins were
captured in various parts of the estuarine system, with most captures occurring in the Newport
River and Bogue Sound.  A total of 31 dolphins, 17 males and 14 females, was captured,
sampled, and released.  Two of these animals were recaptured; one was released quickly and
the other was held until sampling not completed during the first capture was completed. 
Fourteen additional animals were encircled; two escaped, and the others were released without
sampling.

<P>Lengths were measured for all 31 animals sampled; lengths ranged from 197cm to 278cm. 
Complete morphometrics were obtained for 28 animals.  Weights were measured for all
except one younger animal (FB704) that was not removed from the water.  Weights ranged
from 84.6kg to 252.2kg.  Blood samples were obtained from all 31 animals and hematology
and blood chemistry analyses were conducted by two laboratories which were familiar with
dolphin blood.  A tooth was extracted from 28 animals.  Skin and blubber biopsies were
collected from all 31 animals.  Milk samples were obtained from three lactating females. 
Fecal samples were collected from 28 animals, and urine samples from 27 animals.  Bacterial
swab samples were taken from the blowhole of 29 animals.  Blubber depth measurements (by
ultrasound) were made on 30 animals.  A diagnostic ultrasound exam was conducted on 26
animals.  Colonic temperature measurements were made on 29 animals.  All 31 animals were
acoustically recorded.  Thirty of the animals were freeze branded for permanent identification. 
Nine animals were fitted with roto-tag mounted VHF radio tags and four additional animals
were outfitted with Trac-Pacs.  The radio tracking and Trac-Pac studies are reported in Read
et al. (1996, in press) and Townsend et al. (1996, in press), respectively.  A roto-tag was
mounted on the trailing edge of each of the 31 dolphins, four of the animals were outfitted
with an additional roto-tag.  
   
<P>A photo-identification study of bottlenose dolphins has been conducted in the Beaufort, NC,
area since 1985 and several hundred animals have been identified (Thayer and Rittmaster,
1995).  The dolphins we captured were compared to the catalogue of identified animals, and
10 were dolphins previously observed in the study area but none prior to 1989.  Seven of
these had been seen on only one occasion, and three were seen two or more times.  All of
these dolphins were previously sighted only during summer months, with the exception of one
(712), which was sighted only during winter months from 1991-1995.  All of the known
dolphins in this area have been considered  summer  or  winter  dolphins, with no
intermixing documented (Thayer and Rittmaster, 1995).  Dolphin 712 is the first dolphin
known to frequent the estuarine area during both winter and summer months. 
  
<P>A technical memorandum providing a more detailed summary information on the 1995
sampling activities conducted on these dolphins will be published in 1996.

<A NAME="Northern Fur Seal"></A><H4>Northern Fur Seal, <EM>Callorhinus ursinus</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Northern Fur Seal Stock Assessments</STRONG>

<P>In 1994 the MMPA was amended to provide a new approach for managing interactions
between marine mammals and fisheries. In part, it required that the NMFS prepare stock
assessments for all marine mammal stocks in U.S. waters.  NMFS completed final stock
assessments in August 1995. It concluded that northern fur seals in U.S. waters consisted of
two distinct stocks - an eastern Pacific stock composed of animals breeding on the Pribilof
Islands and Bogoslof Island and a San Miguel Island stock in southem California.  The
estimated annual maximum recovery rate for both stocks of fur seals was 8.6 percent.

<P><EM>Eastern Pacific Stock</EM>

<P>Based on fur seal census data collected in 1994, the final stock assessment for the eastem
Pacific fur seal stock estimated its size to be 1,019,192 animals, including an estimated 5,173
animals on Bogoslof Island. 

<P><EM>San Miguel Island Stock</EM>

<P>The final stock assessment for the San Miguel Island stock of fur seals estimated its
population size in 1994 to be 10,536 animals.

<P><STRONG>Northern Fur Seal Research Activities in 1995</STRONG>

<P><EM>San Miguel Island</EM>

<P>Studies of the life history parameters of northern fur seals were conducted at San Miguel
Island throughout June, July and August, 1995.  The primary objective of these long-term
studies, conducted in cooperation with the Channel Islands National Sanctuary Program and
the National Park Service is 1) to estimate survival, recruitment, and natality of these species as a comprehensive assessment of the ecology of pinnipeds in the Channel Islands and 2) to assess the status and recovery of fur seals throughout the north Pacific ocean in accordance
with the Fur Seal Conservation Plan.  

<P><EM>Censuses of Adult Males on Pribilof Islands</EM>

<P>Adult male northern fur seals were counted on St Paul and St. George Islands during July
1995.  The "idle" bull counts on St. Paul for 1986 -1988 as compared to 1990-1995 showed
an increase from 1,865-3,201 to 7,632-10,940.  In 1995, however, there was a decrease when
compared to both 1994 and 1993 from 9,301-10,014 (1993-1994) to 8,459 (1995).  Through
the early 1990s "harem" male counts also increased but may have stabilized between 5, 154
(1995) and 6,405 (1993).   Such changes were expected effects of the terminated commercial
harvest in 1984.  On St. Paul, at least, this appears to have reached an endpoint.

<P><EM>Pup Counts</EM>

<P>Population counts are conducted every other year, and 1995 was a no-census year.  however,
pup counts were conducted on one rookery (South) on St. George in 1995.  The purpose of
this census was to assess biases associated with the shearing sample pup census method. 
Biases associated with the size of the pups sheared, time between shearing and resampling,
and inter-observer variation were investigated.

<P><EM>Mortality Studies of Pups on St. Paul Island</EM>

<P>Pup mortality studies were conducted on St. Paul Island from July 9-August 9, 1995.  Dead
pups were collected from several rookeries and necropsies performed.

<P><EM>Counts of Fur Seals on Bogoslof Island</EM>

<P>The average of two counts on Bogoslof Island on September 25, 1996, was 1,272 pups.  Dead
pups were not counted.  The estimated number of live pups was lower in 1995 compared to
August 18, 1994, when 1,482 were counted.  This may be due to the late date of the 1995
census.  By the end of September, pups are highly mobile and readily enter the water for
hours at a time, making them difficult to count.

<P><EM>Counts of Fur Seals on San Miguel Island</EM>

<P>In July 1995, a fur seal pup census was conducted in Adams cove on San Miguel Island.  a
mean of 1,577 pups was counted, the highest number of pups counted since the colony was
estabished in 1968.   In August 1, 1995, a pup census was conducted on Castle Rock at San
Miguel Island.  A mean of 795 pups was counted.

<P><EM>Condition Indices of Northern Fur Seal Pups on St. Paul Island and St. George Island</EM>

<P>Length and weight measurements were collected to evaluate the physical condition of 1,032
male and 848 female pups from St. Paul Island on August 25-29; and 359 male and 293
female pups from St. George Island on August 24-28, 1995.  An additional 316 pups were
measured on St. George during pup census activities on August 14, 1995.  These data will be
used as part of a long-term study of the trends in condition of pups during the first few
months of life and relationship of trends to natural or anthropogenic changes in their
environment. 

<P><EM>Evaluation of Entanglement Rates</EM>

<P>Surveys to assess the rate of entanglement of adult and juvenile male fur seals in marine
debris were conducted in cooperation with the Aleut communities on both St. Paul and St.
George Islands.  On St. Paul, surveys were conducted from July 6 to August 5, 1995, both in
conjunction with the subsistence harvest and independent of the harvest using roundups.  On
St. George surveys were conducted from June 29 to August 5, independent of the subsistence
harvest.  A total of 9,969 seals were rounded up independent of harvest of St. Paul. 
Including those counted during harvests, 26,883 seals were counted on St. Paul, of which 39
were entangled.  On St. George, a total of 15,080 seals were rounded up independent of
harvests, of which 26 were entangled. 

<P>During the course of all research activities, debris was removed from 93 entangled seals on
St. Paul Island, and 26 were disentangled on St. George Island.  Twenty-five of the
disentangled males were tagged.  Twenty females were disentangled during the course of the
season, primarily during population censusing.

<P><EM>Investigate Movement of Pups and Patterns of Survival at San Miguel Island</EM>

<P>Northern fur seal pups were double tagged to continue long-term studies on survival and
reproductive succcess of the San Miguel Island population.  In Adams Cove, 300 pups were
tagged on October 5.   The Northern fur seal tagging program on San Miguel Island began in
1975.  Since that time efforts are made every breeding season to resight tagged animals to
assess long-term survival and reproductive success.  Since animals do not return to San
Miguel until they are two or three years old, there is a lag time between tagging and first
resighting of indivivuals.

<P><EM>Foraging Ecology</EM>

<P>Approximately 851 scats (631 on St. Paul, 220 on St. George) were collected from female
pupping areas and male haulout areas on St. Paul and St. George Islands during the course of
other research.  Foraging cycles were monitored using a Time Wet Recorder (TWR) to record foraging cycles of female fur seals.  On July 27, 3 seals were captured and TWRs were attached to their pelage.  The  3 seals were then recaptured on August 25 -29, 1995.

<A NAME="Nothern Right Whale"></A><H4>Northern Right Whale, <EM>Eubalaena glacialis</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Southeastern Implementation Team</STRONG>

<P>On August 26, 1993, NMFS convened a meeting in Brunswick, Georgia, to discuss a
monitoring program that needed to be in place to protect northern Atlantic right whales on
their winter calving ground, prior to their arrival.  During this meeting, the Southeastern U.S. Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team was formed.  Members of this team
recommended that the following monitoring efforts be considered to protect whales from
December through March in the Southeastern U.S.:

<OL>
<LI>Daily aerial surveys during the right whale calving season.
<LI>Monitoring right whale movements, and habitat-use by mothers and calves during the right whale calving season.
<LI>Restriction of vessel speeds when right whales are known to be in an area.  The actual speed reduction necessary is defined as the minimum safe speed to insure the safety of the vessel.
<LI>Dedicated right whale observers that would accompany pilots on vessels as they enter and leave ports.
<LI>An education program for all Federal, state and local parties that might adversely affect the species. 
</OL>

<P>The Southeastern Implementation Team met on April 21, 1995, to discuss the previous
calving season and make recommendations prior to the 1995-1996 season.  Topics of
discussion at this meeting were the low number adult females and calves (n = 7 calves)
reported during the 1994-1995 season; a description of NAVTEX and how this technology is
being used as part of the Early Warning System (EWS); the sighting distribution from the
surveys conducted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (it was apparent
from this data given the limited effort that whales are spending considerable time outside and
south of the critical habitat zone in Florida waters); the 1994/1995 EWS Survey results
followed by a discussion on how well the EWS is working; a Partnering Agreement between
members of the Implementation Team; and an update on the ANPR proposal.

<P>The Implementation Team discussed a set of recommended safe operating procedures for
large vessels transiting the right whale calving grounds. The recommended measures offer
non-binding advice on posting observers aboard transiting ships, communicating information
to incoming and outgoing ships on right whale sightings, suggested actions for ships to take
under alternative right whale sighting scenarios, and the reporting of right whale sightings by
transiting ships. The recommended procedures are intended for use by port personnel
participating under a voluntary partnership agreement among team members.
   
<P>The Implementation Team also met on October 31, 1995, prior to the 1995-1996 calving
season.  The agenda included a discussion of recommended safe operating procedures for
large vessels transiting the right whale calving area critical habitat, detectability of right
whales from aircraft and recommendations for a monitoring program, and vessel traffic
pattern information.

<P>During the October meeting, the Implemention Team also discussed a draft letter to the
NMFS recommending that they proceed with rulemaking to restrict the use of gillnets in
Federal waters that poses a significant entanglement hazard to right whales during the calving
season.  The states of Georgia and Florida already prohibit gillnets in State waters eliminating potential entanglement threats from gillnets in those areas.  The final recommendation by the Implementation Team was that team members pursue the proposal on their own and provide advice on the matter directly to the NMFS.

<P><STRONG>Early Warning System Surveys, 1994/1995</STRONG>

<P>A final report by the New England Aquarium was completed on August 24, 1995, that
described the results of the second year of the EWS aerial survey program.  There were 92
surveys of the EWS area during this season.  Thirty-seven right whale sightings were made,
on 27 different days.  These 37 sightings were composed of 6 cow/calf pairs, and about 9
unidentified other whales, for a total of 21 different animals.

<P>It was generally agreed that the EWS has dramatically increased awareness of the presence of
whales throughout the region.  No mortalities or injuries have been observed as occuring
within the EWS area during the past two seasons.

<P>The surveys also provide information on the distribution and movements of whales in the
area.  It is apparent that the whales begin moving into the EWS area during the latter half of
December, remain in high numbers throughout January and are sighted less frequently in
February (until the end of February when there is an increase in sightings again).  It was
suggested at the meeting that the survey area be extended southward and that perhaps
Savannah (northern end of the EWS) could be dropped since the whales are not in the area
for any period of time (suggested as a transit area rather than a high-density calving area).

<P>During the 1994-1995 calving season, NMFS provided funding to the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to survey areas
further offshore and to assess the sighting efficiency flights of the Early Warning System
survey program.  In addition, to improve information on small- scale movements of right
whales on their calving grounds, NMFS contracted with the New England Aquarium, the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources to satellite-tag and track at least four animals on the winter calving grounds.

<P><STRONG>Detectability of Right Whales in Southeastern U.S.A Preliminary Study</STRONG>

<P>Research on detectablility of right whales is aimed at evaluating and improving the EWS to
reduce ship strikes.  During 1995 behavioral data were recorded on audio- and videotape
using airships as research platforms.  These sighting data (percent surface time, along with
mean dive and surface time) were then used to calculate preliminary sighting probabilities at
various distances from the trackline based on the view-field from a small aircraft used in the
aerial monitoring program, for three categories of right whale sightings.  The view-field from
each side of the aircraft was the sector of a circle, with search time greatest at about 1 nmi
from the trackline.  When aircraft view-field characteristics were merged with whale behavior
data, overall detection probabilities were highest for groups (94%), intermediate for
mother/calf pairs (61%), and lowest for single juveniles (57%).  These calculated values are
considered theoretical maxima.  

<P>Results to date suggest that the probability (calculated maxima) of the aerial monitoring
program sighting right whales on any given survey averages 50-60% for mother/calf pairs and
single juveniles.  The implication of this preliminary study is that because single juveniles are least likely to be sighted from both the monitoring aircraft as well as by transiting ships
seeking to avoid them, the likelihood of vessel interaction is greatest for this population
segment.   Secondly, because juveniles have likely been undersampled, demographic
descriptions may have been skewed.

<P><STRONG>Southeast Implementation Team Newsletter</STRONG>

<P>The Southeast Implementation Team developed a quarterly newsletter with the intent of
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of recovery efforts for the northern right whale. 
The newsletter is edited by members of the team and participation in the newsletter is open to
anyone actively involved in right whale conservation efforts including, to this point in time,
ship operators, harbor pilots, port authorities, fishermen, educators, scientists, managers,
policy makers, non-governmental organizations and other concerned citizens.  Relevant
information from areas other than the southeastern calving grounds (i.e., Bay of Fundy field
season summaries) are also included in the newsletter.  The first newsletter was published in
August 1994 and subsequent newsletters have been published through December 1995. 
Information or questions regarding the newsletter should be forwarded to Hans Neuhauser,
Georgia Land Trust Service Center, 640 Cobb Street, Athens, Georgia.

<P><STRONG>New England Implementation Team</STRONG>

<P>On January 3, 1994, NMFS received a letter from the Committee on Merchant Marine and
Fisheries, House of Representatives, requesting that a right whale recovery plan
implementation team be developed in the northeast, comparable to that developed in the
southeast.  The letter cited the success of the southeast implementation team and requested
that a priortity of the northeastern team be the development of a monitoring program that
monitors the cumulative effects of several dredge-disposal and sewer-discharge activities in
Massachusetts Bay and Cape Cod Bay.  

<P>NMFS coordinated a meeting of all interested individuals, and representatives from state and
Federal agencies, to discuss agencies responsibilities and the formation of a  New England
Implementation Team.  The first meeting of this group was convened in Boston,
Massachusetts on August 19, 1994.  

<P>The group determined that an implementation team should not only focus on the northern
right whale, but also address issues relative to other protected species including the humpback
whale.  Subgroups were established with the following foci:  research needs, reduction of
mortality due to shipstrikes and fishing activities, and habitat needs and monitoring.  

<P>The second meeting of this Implementation Team occurred on May 10, 1995, at Saugus,
Massachusetts.  Topics of discussion at that meeting included a summary of the October 1994
peer reviewed report on right whale research and recovery objectives of NMFS (the meeting
was convened in Woods Hole, and a summary provided in the last MMPA Annual Report); a
discussion of contracted research with the New England Aquarium; an outreach/educational
program being developed by the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Program; a
summary of contaminant analysis being conducted on whale tissue samples from necropsies
of stranded animals; several reports from state, Federal and private organizations represented
on the Implementation Team.

<P>The Vessel Interaction/Gear Conflict Subgroup met on April 26, 1995, and following
comments from this meeting, provided a discussion of their meeting to the remainder of the
Implementation Team.  Topics of discussion from this subgroup were education and outreach
(mariner/whale safety); a discussion of the shipping/vessel effects to whales in the region; and fisheries interactions in the northeast region and possible recommendations to the New
England Fishery Management Council regarding the inclusion of right whale protection
measures in fishery management plans.  

<P>The Implementation Team met again on June 8, 1995, at the Stellwagen Bank National
Marine Sanctuary Office, Plymouth, Massachusetts, to review objectives of the
Implementation Team; to discuss a Memorandum of Understanding between NMFS and the
U.S. Coast Guard; whale watching issues; the possibility of an early warning network in areas
of high density vessel traffic and whale concentrations; and a discussion of the Habitat
Subgroup.

<P><STRONG>Summary of Interagency Collaboration with the Coast Guard</STRONG>

<P>One issue identified by both researchers and the Northeast Implementation Team is that of
unreported events and "lost data," particularly from human-impacted whales (ship strikes and
net entanglements) and "floaters" in offshore areas.

<P>The Coast Guard and NMFS have cooperated informally for many years.  In late 1994, this
arrangement began to be formalized through the drafting of a Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA).  As this MOA moves toward final signatures, a pilot effort since December 1993 has
provided a number of reports, including 12 "floaters"  (8 fin whales, 3 humpbacks, and 1
right whale).  Photo and video documentation have provided valuable data.

<P>The Coast Guard has also on several occasions provided logistical support:  CG vessels have
been made available to transport researchers and disentanglement teams to event sites, and
vessels and aircraft have been deployed to photo-document floater events.

<P>This effort also involves NMFS staff providing training and materials to Coast Guard vessel
and aircraft personnel; as well as compilation of data and photographs.  When fully
established, this program will provide valuable information on events in the more offshore
areas. 

<P><STRONG>Disentanglement Response and Network</STRONG>

<P>The Recovery Plan calls for the establishment of marine mammal disentanglement program. 
This emergency response to marine mammal entanglements involves:

<UL>
<LI>multi-agency/institution/network to locate, monitor, and safely disentangle marine mammals.
<LI>development and maintainance of a database for entanglements, and provide data access to users, and periodic reports.
<LI>development of regional protocols and plans, including outreach to general public.
</UL>

<P>Because of the critical need for life history and human-impacts data on right whales and other species, and the limited opportunities to collect these data, information from stranded whales is essential.  Networks and standardized protocols have been devloped to help insure that there are no "lost data."  Likewise, when whales become entangled in fishing gear,
judgements must be made as to the efficacy and merits of disentanglement.  Experience has
shown that disentanglement is best undertaken by trained and experienced personnel, with
appropriate protocols for the procedure as well as the associated data collection.  
Disentanglement efforts during 1995 include the following:  

<OL>
<LI>Throughout 1995, the Center for Coastal Studies (CCS) maintained a ready disentanglement team of trained staff members, along with equipment and vessels needed to respond to entanglements of large whales in the waters of the Gulf of Maine.  In all, ten reports were received (6 right whales, 3 humpbacks, and 1 minke whale).  With collaboration from the New England Aquarium, the Coast Guard, and fishermen,  1 right whale, 3 humpbacks, and 1 minke whale were disentangled.  One calf appeared to free itself.  Reporting of, and response to, entangled whales in offshore areas presents additional challenges and will require additional protocols and efforts.
<LI>The New England Aquarium's Right Whale Research Project responded to five events during FY95.  There were three entangled right whales; one was disentangled, one was partially disentangled, and the third was not resighted and an attempt was not possible.  In December of 1994, an 11-month old male that had swam up into the Delaware River was successfully coaxed out into Delaware Bay; i's fate is presently unknown.  Lastly, a stranded 13-year old male was necropsied in Newport, Rhode Island, in July.  All five individuals were identified through the right whale catalog.
</OL>

<P><STRONG>Recent Right Whale Injuries and Mortalities</STRONG>

<P>On July 17, 1995, a juvenile male born in 1993 washed ashore on Second Beach in
Middletown, Rhode Island.  The animal was first seen entangled in 1993 as a calf about six
months old and was resighted in August 1994 in Cape Cod Bay, still entangled. During the
second sighting, an attempt to remove the gear was considered but, because human
intervention can pose risks to both whales and people, was not attempted.

<P>On 20 October 1995, a 40-foot long male right whale washed ashore on the Bay of Fundy
coast in Nova Scotia, Canada. Researchers found crushed vertebra and, upon a closer
laboratory examination, they concluded that the animal died as a result of a ship collision.

<P>In March 1995, the Navy reported that a submarine leaving Moorhead City, North Carolina,
struck a whale that was described as small, black without a dorsal fin.  However, a positive
species identification could not be made.  No carcass was found and there is no further
information to confirm either the species or the outcome of the collision. 

<P>In September, a right whale was observed in Canadian waters east of Grand Manan Island
towing about 800 feet of gillnet anchor line. Researchers from the New England Aquarium
removed about 700 feet of the rope; however, a considerable length of line remained
entangled in the whales mouth.

<P><STRONG>Recovery Plan Research Program</STRONG>

<P>On October 3-7, 1994, the NMFS/Northeast Science Center convened a workshop to review
the right whale research program in the eastern United States.  Its purpose was to develop
recommendations on future research priorities.  Based on recommendations from this
workshop, the research priorities were reviewed.  A summary of contracted research
supported by NMFS/Northeast Fisheries Science Center in 1995 include the following:

<OL>
<LI>Satellite tagging, Year 2:  The purpose of this study is to determine the location and characteristics of unknown wintering and summering grounds.  Tagging in Cape Cod area is projected for spring 1996, northern GOM fall 1996.
<LI>Reduce ship strikes on right whales:  This includes an assessment of shipping traffic relative to high risk areas;  education and outreach programs; an evaluation of deterrents including sonar; and a follow-on to NEA/MIT ship modelling study to include a) shallow water, b) other vessel types, and c) the depth dimension.
<LI>Genetics:  The priority is for working off the backlog of approximately 100 samples, DNA extraction and analysis.  Also, gaps in the genetic database will be identified, analytical procedures reviewed, and a determination as to whether more robust or recently developed techniques may be available.
<LI>Stranding and human impacts response:  Respond to right whale strandings, collaborate with NMFS, Coast Guard, and Center for Coastal Studies on human-impact events.  On-site presence of experienced researchers, maximize data collection following standard protocols, submit reports including cause of death.
<LI>Foraging and habitat Studies in Cape Cod/Massachusetts Bays:  The Center for Coastal Studies will undertake surveys of the bays system to document the development of conditions favorable to right whales.  Emphasis will be on near-field conditions with detailed profiles of physical and biological conditions.  Included will be patterns of habitat use by right whales.  A data integration component will merge data from the bays system with that of the Great South Channel to develop a more comprehensive model of acceptable habitat.
<LI>Data compilation and review: Right whales in New England waters:  Summarize, synthesize and update to present a comprehensive picture of right whales in New England waters.  This will describe distribution and habitat of right whales by area and date, with central trends and outliers.  Anomalies and habitat shifts, if any, will be addressed.  Movements and connections between sub-areas will be included.  Demographics and habitat partitioning.  Data will be made available in GIS form.
<LI>Photo-identification catalog and associated data:  The October 1994 Right Whale Review (NEFSC/NMFS) identified photo-identification, along with the associated mark-recapture techniques as the best way to monitor the North Atlantic right whale population and its trends.  Maintenance of the catalog and associated expertise is therefore central to this and other management goals.  Recommendations for directed and prioritized field collection of photo-ID and associated data will produce continued ability to monitor the population, its trends, and habitat use.
<LI>Maintenance of the computer database for the right whale in waters of the western North Atlantic, and associated analytical expertise:  The long-term sighting and survey database will be maintained, and newly collected information will continue to be added on a timely basis.  Data products and analyses will be provided to collaborating investigators.  In 1996, emphasis will be on addition of missing data and  filling in the holes. 
<LI>Stock Assessment:  In August 1995, NMFS issued final MMPA stock assessments for all marine manunal stocks in U.S. waters.   For the western North Atlantic stock, the minimum population estimate was 295 whales and the PBR level is considered less than one whale. 
</OL>

<A NAME="GME Harbor Porpose"></A><H4>Gulf of Maine Harbor Porpoise, <EM>Phocoena phocoena</EM></H4>

<P>NMFS proposed to list the Gulf of Maine (GME) harbor porpoise population as threatened
under the ESA on January 7, 1993.  The proposal was considered necessary because (1) the
rate of porpoise bycatch in commercial gillnet fisheries in the GME may reduce this
population to the point where it would become threatened throughout all or a portion of its
range, and (2) because there were no regulatory measures in place at the time of the proposed
listing to reduce this bycatch.

<P><STRONG>Bycatch Estimates for the Gulf of Maine</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1988 amendments to the MMPA, the Gulf of Maine multispecies sink gillnet
fishery was classified as Category I, a classification which denotes fisheries with "frequent
incidental takes of marine mammals." Accordingly, the sink gillnet fleet has been subject to
observer coverage since the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Sea Sampling
Observer Program was initiated in 1989.
  
<P>Annual estimates of porpoise bycatch reflect seasonal distribution of the species and of sink gillnet fishing effort. Estimated annual bycatch for 1990 and 1991 were as follows: 2,900 in 1990 (CV=0.32); and 2,000 in 1991 (CV=0.35).  The 1992 estimate of bycatch decreased
from 1990-1991 levels to 1,200 (95% CI 800-1,700) individuals.  The 1993 GME bycatch
estimate of 1,400 (95% CI 1,000-2,000) was not statistically different from the 1992 estimate. 
Bycatch is believed as not to be sustainable over the long term given our best estimate of the
population size.

<P>On August 9, 1995, the NMFS/NEC completed a preliminary analysis of the 1994 bycatch
rates in the southern GME gillnet fishery, and forwarded the analysis to the NEFMC.  The
mortality rate (kills/haul) of porpoise during Winter 1994 (January-May) was not significantly
different that in earlier years.  However, the bycatch rate during Fall 1994 (September-
December) was about three times higher than in previous years (0.071 in 1994 vs. 0.022-
0.024 in Fall 1991-1993).  The 1994 Fall rate  was based on a large sample size, and the
difference between the 1994 Fall rate and those in 1991-1993 was too large to be a statistical
artifact.

<P>Landings data for 1994 were not available in 1995, therefore an estimate of total kills in the GME sink gillnet fishery could not be made for 1994.  However, if landings and landings
patterns during 1994 were similar to those in previous years (and if the distribution of harbor
porpoise was similar to that in preceding years), the higher kill rate observed in Fall 1994
would raise the total annual bycatch in the 1994 fishery by about 50-60 percent relative to the
1991-1993 bycatch levels.  The preliminary analysis indicated that the harbor porpoise
bycatch in the GME in 1994 was be greater than in previous years.

<P><STRONG>The 1995 Stock Assessment and Minimum Abundance Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The 1991-1992 population abundance estimate was 47,200 animals (95% CI 39,500 to
70,600).  The most recent scientific information on marine mammal stock assessments
(NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-SEFSC-363, U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
Marine Mammal Stock Assessments) provided a minimum population estimate (Nmin) for the
Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy of 40,297 animals, based on abundance surveys completed
in 1991 and 1992. (Specifically, Nmin is based on the lower 20th percentile of the 1991 and
1992 log-normal distribution of the average 1991-1992 porpoise population estimate.)

<P>NMFS conducted a third assessment survey in 1995 and the results are expected in Spring
1996. 

<P><STRONG>Bycatch Estimates for the Bay of Fundy</STRONG>

<P>In addition to the harbor porpoise bycatch in the GME, recent information from Canada
indicates the total bycatch estimate for the 1993 summer period was 424 porpoise in the
western Bay of Fundy. The 1994 estimate was 101 (95%CI=80-122) animals.  The estimated
bycatch in 1995 is not yet available.  However, it is expected to be even lower as the gillnet
fishery was closed from July 21 to September 2, the period of greatest bycatch in the Bay of
Fundy, for reasons relevant to the conservation of groundfish.   

<P><STRONG>Bycatch Estimates for the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States</STRONG>
 
<P>Previous evidence from stranded animals has possible takes in some mid-Atlantic coastal net
fisheries.  Porpoise takes were observed in 1995, but  bycatch estimates are not yet available. 

<P><STRONG>Potential Biological Removal</STRONG>

<P>The proposed PBR for the GME harbor porpoise population is the product of the estimated
minimum population size (NMIN) of 40,297, one-half of the maximum rate of increase (0.5
RMAX) = (0.02), and a recovery factor (FR) = (0.50), or 403 animals, or approximately 22% to
24% of the current estimated bycatch.  Thus, the U.S. bycatch of harbor porpoise in
commercial fishing operations should be reduced to 403 animals by April 1, 1997. 

<P><STRONG>Bycatch Reduction Measures Implemented by the New England Fishery Management Council</STRONG>

<P><EM>Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP</EM>

<P>Following a May 1992 harbor porpoise assessment workshop (NMFS, 1992), NMFS
requested that the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) introduce measures
in Amendment 5 to the FMP that would reduce porpoise mortality to acceptable levels.

<P>Amendment 5 to the NEFMC s Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
became effective in March, 1994.  In addition to implementing conservation measures to
eliminate the overfished condition of several multispecies finfish stocks, one of the principal
management objectives was to reduce the bycatch of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine
(GME) sink gillnet fishery.  The NEFMC agreed to develop a management strategy to reduce
porpoise mortality by integrating a plan with fishery management measures.  

<P>The NEFMC initially developed a measure requiring removal of all gillnets from GME waters
for specified 4-day blocks.  The final rule implementing Amendment 5 made these gillnet 4-
day out provisions effective on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994).   

<P><EM>Time-Area Closures</EM>

<P>NEFMC supported use of the 4-day time block measure as an interim protective measure. 
However, because of the imprecise nature of the 4-day time block, NEFMC began developing
a time/area closure management plan based on the location and analyses of the porpoise
bycatch data.  

<P>A framework adjustment mechanism included in Amendment 5 allows additional or alternate
porpoise protective measures to be implemented at any time.   Results of time-area analyses
were first brought before the NEFMC on September 14, 1993.
     
<P><EM>Framework Adjustment 4</EM>

<P>The first adjustment, implemented through Framework 4, occurred in 1994, included three 30-
day closures and were aimed at reducing bycatch 50 percent over the next 4 years.  The
NEFMC program calls for a 20-percent reduction in the porpoise bycatch in each of the first 
3 years of plan implementation.  For example, 20 percent of 1,875 (the average annual
bycatch estimate in the GME during 1990-93) is 375 animals.  If this level of reduction is
achieved and the Year 1 target is met, not more than 1,500 animals will be caught.  Year 2
would require an additional 20 percent reduction (i.e the bycatch in Year 2 should not exceed
1,125 animals, in Year 3 the bycatch should not exceed 750 animals).  If the 20 percent target
is missed in any of the first 3 years, the program will shift that portion of the reduction not
met to the target for the next year (New England Fisheries Management Council, 1994). 
  
<P>The fourth year target was not specified because of anticipated MMPA requirements (the Act
was reauthorized later in 1994) that would, and subsequently have, affected the Council's
actions. As amended, the MMPA now requires the development, review and implementation
of Take Reduction Plans for strategic stocks (of which harbor porpoise is one) in about 12
months from the present time.

<P>Through Framework 4, the NEFMC adopted a four year phased-in time/area closure program
designed to meet the objective of reducing the bycatch to a level not to exceed 2% of the
population based on estimates of abundance and bycatch.  This objective assumes a maximum
bycatch level that should not exceed the product of 50 percent of the maximum recruitment
rate and a conservative estimate of abundance. 
   
<P>The time/area closures for Framework 4 were based on a Northeast Fisheries Science Center
(NEFSC) analysis of harbor porpoise bycatch using the NMFS weighout database and sea
sampling program, information on the distribution of sink gillnet activity and the seasonal and
spatial distribution of harbor porpoise in the GME. The three areas: the Northeast (from
Penobscot Bay to Eastport, Maine), Mid-coast (from Cape Ann to Penobscot Bay) and
Massachusetts Bay (from Cape Cod to Cape Ann). corresponded to periods when porpoise
bycatch would most likely occur. 

<P><EM>Recommendations of the Harbor Porpoise Review Team</EM>

<P>To monitor progress toward its bycatch reduction goals, the NEFMC appointed a Harbor
Porpoise Review Team (HPRT). The team was charged with evaluating the effectiveness of
the Council's mitigation measures and, if necessary, recommending changes at least annually,
based on the Framework 4 goals. 

<P>The HPRT met on September 8, 1995, to review the success of Framework 4 at reducing
porpoise bycatch in 1994.  Based on that review, and data from NMFS/NEC that indicated
that the 1994 bycatch rate in the Mid-Coast area increased significantly in 1994 over previous
years, the HPRT offered several recommendations that relate to framework now under
consideration: 

<UL>
<LI>The time and area closures, as configured, were neither large enough nor long enough to
achieve the Council's bycatch reduction goals. The group agreed that the first year goals were
not met and that the porpoise bycatch was very likely higher in 1994 than in 1993. The
HPRT was unable to evaluate the degree of effectiveness of the individual closures chiefly
due to the lack of data on the fine-scale spatial distribution of fishing effort.
<LI>There is substantial between-year variability in the timing of peak bycatch, with less
variation in the areas in which bycatch occurs. In any given year, the inter-annual variability
could exceed the Council's 20% reduction goal. This may partly explain the 1994 results. The
advice of the HPRT, therefore, was to expand the timing of the closures to achieve bycatch
reductions, and secondarily, to expand areas spatially to include locations which have
historically accounted for bycatch, but were not included in the first year closures.  
<LI>For the Mid-coast Area in 1996, the HPRT recommended the Council adjust and expand
the time frame of the closure as indicated by further analyses and define an area in which
fishing activity would be allowed if nets were deployed with pingers.  Because the Mid-coast
accounts for the porpoise bycatch, the HPRT suggested pinger use for the Jeffreys Ledge/Z-
Band or other limited areas in which studies could be conducted to answer questions about
habituation and exclusion of animals, but in a manner that would not jeopardize the Council's
bycatch reduction goals.
<LI>For the Mass Bay Area, the HPRT recommended the Council adjust the time frame as
indicated by more refined analyses of the data and allow gillnet vessels to fish within the
entire closure area if nets are outfitted with pingers and deployed according to defined
protocols. This closure would allow an evaluation of operational characteristics of acoustic
devices in a commercial fisheries environment. This recommendation is, in part, based on the
low bycatch rates for this area (i.e. if pingers do not perform according to expectations and
more porpoises are caught, the impact on total bycatch should be relatively small).
<LI>A more detailed analysis of the area south of Cape Cod to determine the possible need
for a closure.
</UL>
<P>Based on the HPRT recommendations, the NEFMC/Marine Mammal Committee met, and on
September 11, 1995, forwarded the recommendatioons to the NEFMC.  The NEFMC
proposed implementation of a spring closure in the Mid-coast Area and establishment of an
additional closure area in southern New England.  This action was considered necessary in
order to make further progress toward the bycatch reduction goals for year two (1995-1996)
of the program.  The target adopted by the NEFMC was a 40% reduction in the bycatch or
approximately 780 animals.  Because of the increase in bycatch in the Mid-coast region, the
preliminary estimates for 1994 indicated that the incidental take of harbor porpoise in the
Gulf of Maine still exceeded 1,500 animals.  

<P><EM>Framework Adjustment 12</EM>

<P>Framework 12, implemented in November, 1995, expanded the size of the Mid-coast Closure
Area to include the Jeffreys Ledge or "Z-band" west of 69ø 30'W, but excluded an area
defined as Tillies Bank.  The action also extended the duration of the closure, initially
November 1-30, through November and December, 1995.  The area was closed to fishing
with sink gillnets during that two month period.

<P><EM>Acoustic Deterrent Devices (Pingers)</EM>

<P>NMFS convened a scientific review panel (Panel) on June 9-10, 1994, to review the results of
past experiments, to assess whether the use of these acoustic devices reduced porpoise
entanglement rates and to recommend, as appropriate, future research to address this issue. 
The Panel believed that there may be some potential for acoustic devices to contribute to
bycatch reduction.  The Panel recommended that future studies of the effects of acoustic
alarms to reduce porpoise bycatch should be undertaken in closed areas where high porpoise
takes occur and confounding factors could be controlled.  The Panel further recommended
that these areas should be opened selectively and exclusively to vessels agreeing to adhere to
a controlled and standardized experimental design, and to carry an observer-technician to
document the fishing efforts and to report bycatch. 

<P>As a result of Panel recommendations, NMFS approved a large-scale pinger experiment in the
GME from mid-October through mid-December 1994 in the Mid-coast area.  The experiment
was designed to determine the effectiveness of these "pingers" at reducing bycatch in the U.S.
gillnet fishery.  The survey design incorporated recommendations from the Panel and other
reviewers, including the MMC.  Rresults of the study were provided to NMFS on April 20,
1995.

<P>The results were highly significant.  Twenty five porpoises were taken in 421 control strings (without pingers) and only two porpoises were taken in 423 active strings (with pingers), indicating that alarms were effective in reducing the entanglement rate of harbor porpoises in this area.  Largely as a result of this study, NMFS has authorized further use of pingers in a series of experimental fisheries in the GME.  It is expected that the Take Reduction Plan for reducing harbor porpoise bycatch in the GME sink gillnet fishery will, at least in part, be based on the use of pingers in that fishery.

<P><EM>Experimental Fishery</EM>

<P>On October 13, 1995, an experimental fishery was approved that would allow  use of
"pingers" in a portion of the former "Z-Band" during November and December 1995, an area
otherwise closed due to NEFMC framework measures under Amendment 5.  The New
Hampshire Gillnet Fishermans Association took a lead role in this experimental fishery.  The
primary objective of the fishery was to test operational aspects of pinger use, which had beensuccessfully tested during a 1994 experiment in the same area.  

<P>Observers were instructed to perform their normal duties and not have anything to do with the operational aspects of the pingers.  This is in contrast to the observer efforts in the Fall 1994 experiment where the observers played an active role in handling the pingers.  This
experimental fishery was allowed so as to provide insights on pinger use, their durability
under commercial fisheries conditions and their effectiveness in mitigating bycatch.

<P><EM>Proposed Action Under Framework 14</EM>

<P>The following actions are proposed under the framework for rulemaking procedure established
by Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP.  This framework adjustment was
initiated at the December 13, 1995, NEFMC meeting.  The final meeting is scheduled for
January 25, 1996.

<P>To reduce the bycatch of harbor porpoise in the GME sink gillnet fishery, the NEFMC
recommended initiation of a framework adjustment to close the Mid-coast and Jeffreys Ledge
Areas, west of 69ø30' from March 25 through April 25 inclusive; the area known as Tillies
Bank, described in Framework 12 to the Multispecies FMP, shall be exempt from this closure.
During this period the area would be closed to fishing with sink gillnets. 
   
<P>For the same purpose, the NEFMC also recommended closure of an area to sink gillnets south
of Cape Cod (referred to from this point as the Southern New England Closure Area) from
March 1 through March 30. The boundary extends from the Massachusetts shore south along
70°30'W, west on 40°40'N and north on 71°45'W to the Rhode Island coast. 

<P>The proposed Southern New England Closure was based on sea sampling data for 1993 and
1994. While it was formerly assumed that takes there were infrequent, analyses indicate that
bycatch rates are somewhat higher than in Massachusetts Bay where a closure was
implemented in 1995. This became apparent during discussions of a preliminary analysis of
NEC information. The issue also was identified in the HPRT's recommendations. The
boundaries defined for the area enclose most of sampled effort and should ensure a significant
reduction in the bycatch.
   
<P>The Massachusetts Bay gillnet fishery accounts for approximately 4 to 5 percent of the total
GME porpoise bycatch.  It is closed from March 1 to March 30. The pattern and level of
bycatch in 1994 was not very different from previous years - sporadic during February and
March and highly variable in January and April.  The NEC recommended no change to this
closure. An expansion of time or area would be disproportionate in relation to the level of
takes relative to the other areas. Massachusetts Bay was closed initially in 1995 and will be
closed during the month of March each year. 

<P>These recommendations were based on information, views and comments at a meeting of its
Marine Mammal Committee held in Saugus, Massachusetts on November 28, 1995, at an
informal meeting between NEFMC staff and southern New England gillnet fishermen in
Tiverton, Rhode Island on December 7, 1995 and at a full Council meeting held in Danvers,
Massachusetts on December 13, 1995.  A decision on whether to finalize this framework
adjustment is expected the January 1996 NEFMC meeting.  

<P><EM>Amendment 7 to the Multispecies Groundfish FMP </EM>

<P>The NEFMC is currently formulating Amendment 7 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP (a
replacement for Amendment 5) to accelerate the goal of reducing fisheries mortality for New
England groundfish.  Although it has not yet been finalized, Amendment 7 to the
Multispecies FMP will include a revised objective for harbor porpoise that reflects the
changes required by the reauthorization.  At its December, 1995 meeting, the NEFMC
approved the following for inclusion in the draft amendment: to reduce proportionately,
consistent with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the MMPA
guidelines, the incidental mortality and serious injury of harbor porpoise in the GME sink
gillnet fishery to the PBR level identified for this stock through the process described in
Section 117 of the MMPA by April 1, 1997, the date required for compliance with Section
118(f)(5)(A) of the MMPA. 

<P>The MMPA goal for harbor porpoise is very similar to the one that has been adopted by the
NEFMC, to reduce the bycatch to levels that are less than the PBR level  specified for the
stock. 

<P><STRONG>Bycatch Reduction Measures Being Taken in the Bay of Fundy</STRONG>

<P>A Canadian gillnet fishery in the western Bay of Fundy (BOF), Nova Scotia, also takes
porpoise from this population.  Neither Amendment 5 restrictions nor the MMPA address this
bycatch.  On October 7, 1994, NMFS received from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans-
Canada (DFO) a Harbour Porpoise Conservation Strategy (HPCS) for the BOF for comment. 
During the 1995 season in the BOF, DFO placed observers in the gillnet fishery to monitor
bycatch.  However, during July 21 - September 1 (peak bycatch months), the fishery was
closed to protect stocks of groundfish effectively reducing the bycatch to zero during this
critical period. 

<P>Experimentation with acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, was conducted in 1995.  In
December 1995, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans-Canada (DFO) completed their
HPCS, and in this document, issued a mitigation measure to the effect that once an estimated
110 porpoise had been killed by Canadian gillnet fishers, the fishery would be closed in areas
deemed most responsible for the incidental take.  Closure will be implemented on receipt of
information from the Observer Program indicating high incidental catches and will come into
force within 24 hours of the problem being identified.  Only fisheries in the area of the
problem will be affected.

<P>The DFO is also taking part in the TRT for this species, and is continuing to consider
measures to further reduce bycatch in the BOF gillnet fishery.

<P><STRONG>The Development of Protected Species Measures to Reduce Bycatch in coastal Atlantic States</STRONG>

<P>Section 118 of the MMPA requires NMFS to develop TRTs for any "strategic" stock whose
members shall include, among others, a representative from each coastal state which has
fisheries which interact with the species or stock.  GME porpoise are taken incidental to
coastal gillnet fisheries under state jurisdiction south to, at least, Virginia.  

<P>On September 18, 1994, NMFS met with the Management and Science Committee, Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Committee (ASMFC), to discuss recommendations that state fishery
management plans that would include a standard that conservation programs and management
measures should protect, to the maximum extent possible, those species protected under state
and Federal legislation.  At that meeting the committee recommended that a Protected Species
Subcommittee be formed and that this subcommittee work with NMFS to convene a 2-day
workshop on protected species conservation and management issues in state waters.  

<P>On July 17-19, ASMFC convened a workshop in Richmond, Virginia, on the management of
protected species in state waters.  Recommendations from this workshop were to be
forwarded to the full Commission for their consideration at their fall meeting in Charleston,
South Carolina.  Final recommendations from this workshop are being reviewed by the
Management and Science Committee of ASMFC at this time.  Draft recommendations
discussed at the workshop, and those that were forwarded to the Commission from the MSC,
include the following: amend the ISFMP Charter so that protected species/fisheries
interactions are addressed in the Commissions fisheries management planning process; include
NMFS and USFWS protected species representatives on technical committees and plan
development and review teams; charge the MSC with overall responsibility for coordination
of Commission activities regarding protected species; and address protected species issues on
a plan basis, beginning with the Shad/River herring Interstate Fishery Management Plan as a
model. 

<P>The ASMFC meeting took place October 29-31, 1995, in Charleston, South Carolina.  The
Management and Science Committee presented their recommendations to the Commission
which were adopted without change.  

<P><STRONG>The Proposed Listing of the Gulf of Maine Harbor Porpoise under the ESA</STRONG>

<P>A final determination on whether or not to list the GME harbor porpoise population at
threatened under the ESA depends on the successful reduction of bycatch of that species to
sustainable levels as stated within the MMPA.  Since the proposed listing, several mitigative
measures have been taken which should result in a significant reduction of bycatch. 
However, it is not known at this time whether these measures will be successful at reducing
bycatch to below PBR.  Further evaluations will be needed prior to a final determination of
the proposed listing.  Following a review of these measures for reducing bycatch, NMFS will
further evaluate the proposed listing of GME harbor porpoise as threatened under the ESA.

<A NAME="Hawaiian Monk Seal"></A><H4>Hawaiian Monk Seal, <EM>Monachus schauinslandi</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>Research and Recovery Program Reviews</STRONG>

<P>In 1993 a three-year Hawaiian Monk Seal Work Plan was developed to guide monk seal
research and recovery efforts conducted by NMFS, Southwest Fisheries Science Center,
Honolulu Laboratory, through 1996.  In developing this work plan, consideration was given to
the priority assigned to specific research and recovery tasks in the Recovery Plan for the
Hawaiian Monk Seal, and the recommendations of the Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Team
at its 1992 and 1993 annual meetings.  The 1994-1996 work plan addressed five major
concerns of NMFS and the Recovery Team:  1)  monitoring of the five major breeding
populations and Midway; 2) resolution of the mobbing problem at Laysan and Lisianski
Islands; 3) implementation of the research and management planfor the French Frigate Shoals
population; 4) continuing activities to enhance recovery of the western island populations; and
5) continuing emphasis on data analysis and publication of research findings.  

<P>On November 30, 1994, the Marine Mammal Commission forwarded their recommendations
on recovery actions taken to date to the Assistant Administrator.  The MMC
recommendations to NMFS were similar to those recommended to NMFS by the Recovery
Team following their annual meeting, December 6-7, 1994.  At the Recovery Team annual
meeting, research and management priorities for the 1995 field season were discussed.  One
of the recommendations from that meeting was that the Recovery Team develop a three-year
recovery action plan, 1996-1998, be prepared.  

<P><STRONG>Marine Mammal Commission Hawaiian Monk Seal Program Review</STRONG>

<P>On April 11-13, 1995, the MMC, in cooperation with NMFS/Honolulu Laboratory, covened a
panel to review the status of efforts to encourage the recovery of the monk seal.  Panel
members reviewed research reports and findings presented by NMFS staff at the review, and
summarized the following major findings:  

<OL>
<LI>The panel believed that funding and logistic support levels planned by NMFS for FY1995 are appropriate to carry out NMFS' role in encouraging the recovery of the Hawaiian monk seal, and recommended that this level be maintained for at least the next three years.
<LI>The population assessment and monitoring at major breeding colonies be continued and accorded a high priority.  
<LI>Population assessment needs for each island after 1996 should be re-evaluated.
<LI> 
<LI>The panel believed that rehabilitation and release efforts at Midway are warranted but that, given the high cost of rehabilitation, the low number of seals surviving to reproductive age,and the need for stronger criteria guiding this work, the panel was concerned that the contribution of rehabilitation work to recovery may be small.  The panel, therefore, agreed that criteria be developed to guide future rehabilitation work.  
<LI>Because of the importance of restoring the Midway seal colony to the recovery program, the panel endorses transfer of the Midway Islands to USFWS.  The MMC and the Recovery Team recommend that NMFS work closely with the Navy on plans and funding proposals to restore Midway's seal colony.
<LI>The review panel recommended that NMFS test a testosterone-suppressing drug to reduce male aggressive behavior on captive monk seals.
<LI>The review panel recommended that work on prey analysis and at-sea tracking be expanded.  This included the collection of scat samples, the use of research techniques to identify isotopic and fatty-acid prey species.
<LI>The panel recommended that efforts to re-open the lobster fishery in the northwestern Hawaiian islands exclude French Frigate Shoals unless and until information is adequate to assess whether or not lobster is important in the diet of young seals.
</OL>

<P>The panel recognized the importance of the airfield at Tern Island in French Frigate Shoals,
and recommended that everything possible be done to maintain the airfield.

<P><STRONG>Hawaiian Monk Seal Workplan,  1996-1998</STRONG>

<P>On September 12, 1995, a second three year research and recovery action plan for Hawaiian
monk seals (1996-1998) was drafted by the Recovery Team as Amendment #1 to the
Recovery Plan.  The tasks identified in this plan were again based on priority assignments in
the Recovery Plan and recent recommendations of the Recovery Team, and a 1995 Marine
Mammal Commission review of the monk seal program, following evaluations of those items
completed in the 1994-1996 work plan.  Generally, these tasks are a continuation or
augmentation of high priority activities currently being conducted by NMFS.  The highest
priority needs in this amendment to the Recovery Plan are 1) recover the western populations;
2) mitigate losses of females due to mobbing; 3) mitigate losses due to high juvenile mortality
at French Frigate Shoals; 4) conduct food habits and foraging pattern research; 5) mitigate
fishery interactions; and 6) increase emphasis on data analysis and development of models. 

<P><STRONG>Preliminary Results of the 1995 Hawaiian Monk Seal Field Season</STRONG>

<P>During 1995, long-term field camps were established at the six main breeding islands of the
Hawaiian monk seal--Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island,
Laysan Island, and French Frigate Shoals.  Primary activities at the camps included
assessment of population abundance, survival and reproduction; tagging of pups; collection,
rehabilitation, and translocation of undersized or injured seals; collection, documentation, and destruction of marine debris on the island beaches; disentanglement of entangled animals;
collection of scats for prey species determination; and monitoring for evidence of fisheries
interactions.  The main indicators of the status of these populations are the number of pups
born and the mean beach counts.  The mean beach counts for the five major breeding sites
totaled 383, and the total number of births was 175.  Brief highlights of field activities are
provided below.

<P><EM>Kure Atoll</EM>

<P>A field camp was established at Kure Atoll from May 14 to July 13, under the supervision of
Lucy Keith, cooperating scientist, Joint Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research
(JIMAR), University of Hawaii.  In addition to population assessment, activities included
release and monitoring of seven yearling seals that had been collected as underdeveloped pups
in 1994, and identification and enumeration of the 102 individuals (assumed to approximate
the entire local population) by applied bleach marks, tags, and distinctive scars.  Twelve atoll-wide counts were conducted, resulting in a mean (ñS.D.) of 42.3 (ñ4.4) seals (excluding
pups).  Eleven pups were born (six male, five female).

<P>Two seals were observed entangled in marine debris:  a weaned pup was released from a
shard of net, and a nursing pup which had become entangled in the debris freed itself
unaided.  Potentially hazardous debris items totaling 313 pieces were inventoried and
destroyed.  Fifty-seven scat and spew samples were collected.  

<P><EM>Midway Atoll</EM>

<P>Field studies were conducted at Midway Atoll from March 31 to April 28 under the direction
of Dr. Lee Eberhardt, contractor to the Marine Mammal Research Program, and from August
4 to August 18 under the direction of William Gilmartin, wildlife biologist.  Activities at
Midway focused on tagging of pups and other untagged seals and identification of all seals in
the population.  Six pups were born, the highest documented total from Midway in nearly
four decades.  All pups were tagged (2 were tagged by USFWS personnel), as were an
additional 10 seals.  A preliminary population estimate for the number of seals at Midway is
approximately 45 individuals.

<P>In June 1995, the U.S. Navy provided funding to NMFS for monk seal recovery efforts at
Midway Atoll.  The Navy funding was used to obtain hardware necessary to monitor survival
and haul-out patterns of rehabilitated female pups that are relocated to Midway Atoll.

<P><EM>Pearl and Hermes Reef</EM>

<P>Field studies were conducted at Pearl and Hermes Reef from July 16 to August 31 under the
direction of John Henderson, fishery biologist.  Camps were established at Southeast and
North Islands, ensuring coverage of the entire atoll.  Research objectives included identifying
the entire population by applied bleach marks or known scar profiles of individual seals.  Ten
censuses of all islets in the atoll were conducted.  The mean beach count (excluding pups)
was 81.7 seals (ñS.D. 13.  Twenty-seven pups were born (16 male, 11 female), which is the
highest recorded for the past 15 years.  Twenty-three juveniles were newly tagged, and tags
were replaced on 13 other seals.  A preliminary population estimate for seals at Pearl and
Hermes Reef in 1995 is 225, representing an increase of about 50 animals from the last
population estimate in 1991.  

<P>One seal was disentangled from marine debris, and entanglement scars had appeared on two
seals since the previous field camp in 1993.  Bones from two seals were found, one of which
had been entangled in marine debris.  Hazardous debris (678 items) was inventoried and
destroyed.  Sixty-four scat and spew samples were collected for identification of prey items.

<P><EM>Lisianski Island</EM>

<P>Field studies of the Hawaiian monk seal at Lisianski Island were conducted from April 19 to
July 14 under the direction of Joy Seymour, cooperating scientist, JIMAR.  Research
objectives specific to this population included identification of all seals, and documentation of adult male behavior.  Fourteen censuses were conducted, and the mean (ñS.D.) count
(excluding pups) was 66.7 (ñ7.0).  

<P>Because Lisianski Island was visited for only a single day in 1994, beach count and
population composition data were not obtained for comparison with the current year. 
However, mean beach counts from 1995 were similar to mean counts recorded in 1992 and
1993 (70.5 and 64.0, respectively).  A total of 218 seals were identified.  The male-to-female
sex ratio was 1.6:1.0, continuing the downward trend of recent years (2.0:1.0 in 1992 and
1.7:1.0 in 1993).  Twenty-two pups were born (10 females, 10 males, 2 unknown), compared
with 23 and 17 pups in 1992 and 1993, respectively).  Two emaciated juvenile seals (males)
were found dead, as was a nursing pup that died of unknown causes.  Another emaciated
juvenile male died after it was injured by a shark, and a small weaned pup disappeared. 
Also, one small weaned pup was in deteriorating condition at the end of the field season, and
probably did not survive.  Although mobbing events were not observed, one adult female
sustained a severe mobbing-related injury.  Six seals were entangled: two adult females
escaped by themselves, and four pups (three weaned females and a nursing male) were
released by observers.  The remains of a subadult seal and two pups that had died of
unknown causes since the 1994 field season were also found. 

<P><EM>Laysan Island</EM>

<P>Field studies were conducted from April 21 to July 18 under the direction of Brenda Becker,
wildlife biologist.  Research activities were directed at identifying the entire population and
monitoring behavior of adult seals as part of continuing research on the occurrence of
mobbing.  The mean of 13 beach counts (ñS.D.) was 69.5 (ñ10.0), excluding pups, which is
similar to totals of the past 5 years.  The total number of animals in the population (excluding pups) was 209, 11 fewer than counted in 1994.  This decrease in number was largely due to the translocation of 21 adult males to the main Hawaiian Islands in 1994; none of these males were resighted in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 1995.  The total Laysan population
included 68 adult males and 70 adult females (ca. 1.0:1.0).

<P>Forty-three pups were born (23 female, 18 male, 2 unknown), the third highest number of
births recorded since 1977.  The birth rate was 61% for adult-sized females.  Thirty-seven of
the pups were tagged; one was still nursing at the end of the season.  Five neonate pups (two
male, two female, one unknown) seals were known to have died of unknown causes; two
yearling females disappeared and are assumed dead, one had received injuries from a
mobbing event, and the other was severely emaciated.

<P>Two seals were entangled in marine debris; one disentangled itself, and the other was released uninjured by field staff.  All marine debris capable of entangling an animal was inventoried and destroyed.  Of 17 seals that had been oiled from a spill in 1993, 12 were sighted in 1995.  Of the five not sighted, one was not seen in 1994, and one (adult male) had been translocated to the main Hawaiian Islands from Laysan Island in 1994.

<P><EM>French Frigate Shoals</EM>

<P>Field camps were established from May 8 to September 3 and from October 25 to November
18 under the direction of Mitchell Craig, JIMAR cooperating scientist.  In addition to
population assessment, activities included collection of underdeveloped pups for rehabilitation
at facilities on Oahu and instrumentation of seals with satellite transmitters, time-depth
recorders, and video cameras.  Ten atoll-wide censuses were conducted, resulting in a mean
spring-summer beach count (ñS.D.) of 123.9 (ñ14.3) seals, excluding pups, approximately 35
fewer than in 1994.  Seventy-three pups were born, 38 fewer than in 1994.  Seventeen pups
died or disappeared before weaning.  Of the 56 pups that survived to weaning, 55 were
tagged.  Tags were replaced on 103 seals which had lost or broken tags.  Twelve undersized
female weaned pups were collected for rehabilitation and subsequent release.  Twenty-four
seals were found dead, 12 of which were small weaned pups or stillborn fetuses.  Three male
seals were instrumented with both satellite and radio transmitters in November and were
tracked for three weeks to determine the satellite tag position error.  

<P>Eight other male seals were instrumented with video cameras supplied by the National
Geographic Society for 2 to 18 days during October and November.  These "crittercams"
were used to assess the seals' foraging strategy, and were set to record images and sounds at
periodic intervals (for example, 3 minutes every 30 minutes) during the time the instrumented
seal was at sea.  A depth profile of the seal's movements was recorded continuously
throughout the deployment.

<P>Preliminary examination of the resulting videotape and depth data indicated that the seals
foraged at depths ranging from 10 to 90 meters but always targeted prey associated with the
bottom. Identified prey items included reef fish and octopus.  Foraging activity included
opportunistic searching of the shallow bottom as the seals moved between haulout sites and
periods of intense diving and searching of 60- to 90-meter habitat on the slopes of the atoll. 
Some of this deep habitat contained numerous rocks that one seal was observed to routinely
flip over in search of prey hiding underneath.  Supplementary information, such as aggression
between adult and juvenile seals, was also observed in the videotapes.

<P>These preliminary results provide researchers with unique insights into the foraging strategies of adult monk seals and has distinguished National Geographic's crittercam as a valuable tool for studying foraging behavior.   

<A NAME="Humpback Whale"></A><H4>Humpback Whale, <EM>Megaptera novaeangliae</EM></H4>

<P><STRONG>North Pacific</STRONG>

<P><EM>Review of Research and Management Priorities of the Humpback Whale Recovery Plan and
Hawaiian Island National Marine Sanctuary Management Plan</EM>

<P>On December 1991, NMFS completed the Final Recovery Plan for the Humpback Whale
(Recovery Plan) (NMFS, 1991).  The objectives of the Recovery Plan were compatible with
those of the draft Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary
Management Plan and include maintaining and enhancing humpback whale habitat(s);
reducing human-related mortality, injury and disturbance; measuring and monitoring key
population parameters; and promoting a state/Federal partnership for administration and
implementation of the Recovery Plan.

<P>The Hawaiian Island Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary includes:  (1) the marine
area out to the 100-fathom isobath adjoining the islands of Lanai, Maui, and Molokai,
including Penguin Bank, but not the waters within three nautical miles of Kahoolawe Island;
(2) the deep water area of Pailolo Channel from Cape Halawa, Molokai, to Nakalele Point,
Maui, and southward; and (3) the marine area out to the 100-fathom isobath adjacent to the
Kilauea National Wildlife Refuge on the Island of Kauai.

<P>The primary objectives of the sanctuary are to protect the humpback whales and their habitat
in the waters around the main Hawaiian Islands, to educate and interpret for the public the
relationship of the humpback whale and the Hawaiian marine environment, to manage human
uses of the Sanctuary consistent with the Act, and to identify other marine resources and
ecosystems of national significance for possible inclusion in the Sanctuary.  

<P>In order to facilitate the development of a Sanctuary Management Plan, resource managers
from NOAA, Sanctuaries and Reserves Division (SRD), and NMFS, convened a workshop to
assess research and other needs and opportunities related to humpback whale management in
the Hawaiian Islands on April 26-28, 1995, at Kaanapali, Maui, Hawaii, to bring together
representatives of county, state and Federal agencies, representatives of non-government
agencies and organizations, resource managers, and researchers to participate in developing
research and management objectives for the Sanctuary.  The workshop was to initiate the
development of a Management Plan for the Sanctuary, and implement those items listed
within the Recovery Plan considered necessary for the recovery of the humpback whale in the
North Pacific.

<P>Workshop participants were: (1) to identify information and uncertainties that should be
considered in developing a long-term research plan that meets the management and recovery
objectives of the Sanctuary and the Recovery Plan; (2) to describe the research and long-term
monitoring programs that would be required to characterize the present population status and
to detect and monitor trends in life-history parameters of the humpback whale population in
the North Pacific (with focus on the Hawaiian Islands); (3) to describe the essential
components of humpback whale habitat(s) in the Hawaiian Islands; and (4) identify the
county, state and Federal agencies that would participate in the implementation of Recovery
Plan and the Final Management Plan for the Sanctuary.  

<P>A workshop report providing a summary of the information that was contributed to the
workshop by these participants will be completed in 1996. 

<P><EM>Review of Research and Management Priorities of the Humpback Whale Recovery Plan in the
North Pacific</EM>

<P>On September 20-21, 1995, a small working group convened a meeting at NMFS/Marine
Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, to review the Humpback Whale Recovery Plan relative to
completed tasks identified for the North Pacific, to review the discussion from the
NOAA/NMFS and SRD meeting held in Hawaii the previous May, and to develop a draft
implementation plan for North Pacific humpback whale recovery, for FY 96-FY 98

<P>The working group discussed the overall objective of population assessment and monitoring
of humpback whales in the North Pacific relative to the management needs of NMFS.  There
was general agreement that recommendations should focus on information needed to evaluate
the status and recovery of humpback whale populations in the North Pacific.

<P>The following activities were considered essential to evaluating the status and recovery of
humpback whales in the North Pacific.  
<OL>
<LI>Maintain the North Pacific Fluke Collection (NPFC): Having a single photo-identification
facility that curates photographs of individual humpback whales from an entire ocean basin
facilitates communication among researchers and allows quality control of data.  Maintenance
of the collection will include incorporating photographs submitted during the past four years,
cross matching within the photographic collection to create a working catalog of unique
individuals and updating the video disc used for the matching and archiving of photographs.  

<LI>Study exchange rates of humpback whales within and between geographic regions: 
Using movement patterns of photographically identified individual humpback whales to
estimate exchange rates between putative stocks was considered the primary information
source for determining stock structure.

<LI>Estimate North Pacific basin-wide humpback whale abundance:  The primary objective of
this study was to estimate the size of the entire humpback whale population in the North
Pacific.  Independent researchers have conducted photo-identification studies which now
include all known wintering areas and many different feeding areas.  Using capture-recapture
analyses, these data may be sufficient to provide a more precise estimate of humpback whale
abundance in the North Pacific than is currently available.

<LI>Conduct capture-recapture studies off California, Oregon and Washington:  The
humpback whale population which feeds off the coasts of California and Oregon was
estimated by capture-recapture techniques to include approximately 600 (CV = 0.07)
individuals in 1993.  The resumption of intensive photo-identification studies of humpback
whales off California, Oregon and Washington during 1997 and 1998 will allow for an update
of this estimate and an evaluation of trends in population size.  

<LI>Conduct aerial surveys in Hawaiian waters:  Aerial surveys of abundance of humpback
whales in Hawaiian waters have been conducted intermittently for the past decade with the
most extensive surveys conducted in 1993 and 1995.  Aerial surveys provide an efficient
means of obtaining abundance and distribution of whales at a particular point in time.  The
aerial surveys are being proposed for FY97, following the development of an aerial survey
correction factor in FY96.  This will coincide with the first year of a proposed capture-
recapture study, allowing for a more comprehensive, comparative population survey.

<LI>Develop a correction factor for aerial survey estimates:  Aerial survey correction factors
need to be developed to estimate the proportion of whales not at the surface.  Age, sex and
group size-specific respiration and dive data, which have been collected from shore-based
observations, need to be analyzed and examined for intra- and inter-annual variation.  

<LI>Conduct capture-recapture surveys in Hawaiian waters:  Coordinated photo-identification
surveys throughout the Hawaiian Islands were conducted at weekly intervals during the winter
season in 1995.  The objectives of this study were to: 1) estimate the  abundance of
humpback whales which visit Hawaii during a single year and 2) provide information on
residency and the extent of within season inter-island movements of individuals.  

<LI>Summarize existing information and expand surveys in Southeastern Alaska to study
distribution, survivorship and reproductive success:  Expanded systematic sampling in
southeastern Alaska should provide information on the distribution of adults including
mothers with calves, and return of known-age animals (i.e., those first photographed as
calves), and will provide data for capture-recapture estimates of abundance.  Documenting the
return of known-age animals to feeding areas will allow the estimation of recruitment and/or
recovery rates. 

<LI>Convene second workshop to estimate calf mortality:  In 1991, the first stage of a two-
part workshop was convened to begin the process of synthesizing data needed to estimate calf
mortality of humpback whales based on sightings of females with calves (and the same
females subsequently without calves) on the winter and feeding grounds.  The second
workshop has been tentatively scheduled for the spring/summer of 1996.  Based on the
database of sightings of females with and without calves, calf mortality rates during the first
six months of life will be estimated.

<LI>Convene workshop on adult mortality:  At the first calf mortality workshop, participants
suggested that the next life history parameter to measure should be adult mortality.  This will
be based on longitudinal studies of several individuals over a number of years.

<LI>Monitor anthropogenic noise on the wintering grounds using acoustic tags: 
Anthropogenic noise poses a potential threat to the quality of the habitat used by females to
nurse dependent calves in Hawaiian waters.  At this time, the technology to adequately
monitor the response of humpback whales to anthropogenic noise does not exist.  However,
based on research supported by the ATOC program, a satellite linked transmitter capable of
recording received sound levels, depth of dive information, and position should be
commercially available by FY 98.  Therefore, a pilot study is recommended to determine the
feasibility of attaching such transmitters to 2-5 adult females with calves and 2-5 females
without calves on the wintering grounds.  The information obtained by such an experiment
would be used to design a study that could test the hypothesis as to whether anthropogenic
noise could potentially degrade habitat critical to the recovery of humpback whales.

<LI>Develop a GIS database of whale sightings data, based on aerial surveys:  At present,
information on the distribution of humpback whales in Hawaiian waters is available, but it
has not been synthesized into a single database.  The objective of this activity would be to
develop  a GIS database, which would then be combined with information on the physical
environment, reproductive success and survival of humpbacks, and human-related disturbance
patterns to evaluate whether particular areas are more important than others. 

<LI>Summarize information on physical and biological oceanographic factors that affect the
distribution of humpback whales:  More accurate characterization of humpback whale habitats
and their use will contribute to effective management of this stock.  Factors to be evaluated
more precisely include depth, bottom type and topography, water temperature, turbidity,
acoustic characteristics, and current speed and direction.  Features offering protection from
currents or storms need to be identified, particularly on the wintering grounds. 

<LI>Summarize information on calf distribution in and around the Hawaiian Islands: 
Anecdotal information on distribution of humpback whale mothers and calves implies some
geographic stratification and certain preferred areas.  Systematic data should be collected to
delineate distribution around the Hawaiian Islands.

<LI>Examine prey biomass and oceanographic data from fisheries surveys:  Data on prey
biomass and associated data on physical and biological oceanographic features (bathymetry,
salinity, temperature, plankton, etc.) are collected systematically in a number of areas
throughout the North Pacific as part of other survey projects (e.g., fisheries and other surveys,
etc).  A review of existing state and federal fisheries data collected in areas of interest in the
North Pacific was recommended to evaluate whether integration of these data sets with whale
sightings data would help provide information relating to habitat and prey studies. 
Concurrent collection of marine mammal sightings and prey and oceanographic data was
deemed most valuable and the placement of marine mammal observers aboard fisheries
survey vessels was recommended.

<LI>Develop quantitative criteria for delisting North Pacific large whales under the ESA: 
Section 4(c)(2) of the ESA requires that, at least once every 5 years, a review of the species
on the Endangered Species List be conducted to determine whether any species should be 1)
removed from the List, 2) changed in status from an endangered species to a threatened
species, or 3) changed in status from a threatened species to an endangered species.  NMFS
completed its first 5-year review on the status of endangered whales in 1984.  In January
1990, NMFS announced that it was conducting status reviews on certain listed species under
its jurisdiction.  The status review was completed and made available in June 1991 (56 FR
29471).
</OL>
<P>One of the problems with the current process for amending the status of listed species is that
there are no objective criteria for classifying large whales as threatened or endangered.  That
is, how does one quantify what it means for there to be a significant risk that a species will
become extinct over a major portion of its range?

<P>In FY95, a contract was let to the University of Washington to support a student to initiate
the development of criteria that are 1) quantifiable and 2) applicable to populations of large
whales.  The initial approach was to take advantage of recent work by the IUCN (see IUCN
Red List Categories, 30 November 1994) in quantifying criteria used to classify stocks in
various categories of being threatened (i.e., extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered,
endangered, and vulnerable).  The goal of the project is to associate the two classifications
under the ESA with specific categories of threatened under the IUCN classification scheme
and then use or revise the quantitative criteria for classifying under the IUCN scheme for
classifying large whales under the ESA. 

<P>Objective listing and delisting criteria for the following stocks will be developed over the next
two years: North Pacific humpback whale, North Pacific fin whale, North Pacific right whale,
and possibly sperm whales and bowhead whales.  The performance of the proposed criteria
will be evaluated by simulation trials.  Population projections will be made using computer
simulations which incorporate the effects of demographic, environmental, and catastrophic
stochasticity and changes in meta-population dynamics.  In addition, existing PVA software
will be used to determine the applicability of such software in determining the extinction
probability of large whale stocks, where data on trends in abundance and abundance are either
imprecise or unavailable.

<P>A workshop report providing a summary of the information that was contributed to the
workshop by these participants will be completed in early 1996. 

<P><STRONG>Atlantic Ocean</STRONG>

<P><EM>Humpback Whale Yonah Program.</EM>  Since 1992-1993, NMFS has participated in the Years of
the North Atlantic Humpback (YONAH) project.  YONAH is a large-scale international effort
that uses photographic identification and molecular genetics to study humpback whales across
their entire known North Atlantic range.  The intention is to obtain as large a sample as
possible of individual identifications and skin biopsies to provide reliable answers to questions
on size, structure, and migratory movements, vital rates and mating systems of this
population.

<P>During 1995, much of the research effort was dedicated to maintaining the humpback whale
catalog, and YONAH photo-ID and database tasks,  through a contract with the College of
the Atlantic.  FY95 funds were directed to:

<P><U>Task 1.</U>  Final data quality review and update for YONAH catalog and database;

<P>Much of the analyses have been, and continue to be released, through peer-review journals
and presentations at professional conferences and meetings.

<P><U>Task 2.</U>  Archival of YONAH catalog photographs and database.

<A NAME="Gray Whale"></A><H4>Eastern North Pacific Stock of Gray Whales, <EM>Eschrichtius robustus</EM></H4>

<P>In June 1994, the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whale was removed from the list of
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  The ESA requires that stocks/species removed from the
list be monitored for a minimum period of 5 years and its status reassessed at the end of that
period of time.  Therefore, as part of the delisting process, NMFS developed a 5-year
monitoring and research plan for eastern gray whales and initiated this program in 1994.  

<P>As part of this 5-year plan, counts of southward migrating gray whales were conducted in
January 1995 and in December 1995 to February 1996 as they passed the Granite Canyon
research station in central California.  The project was directed by NMML with assistance
from the SWFSC.  During the January 1995 study, an experiment was conducted using 25-
power binoculars and a thermal sensor to determine the onshore-offshore distribution of
migrating gray whales.  In the 1995/1996 study, the research was directed at determining total
abundance.  The abundance estimate of approximately 22,600 animals was based on the
number of whales observed during the daytime watch and a series of correction factors to
account for whales that were not counted.  This estimate of total abundance was similar in
value to an estimate based on data collected during the winter of 1993/1994.   Support for
this research was provided by the NMFS Office of Protected Resource s Marine Mammal
Assessment Program.

<P>During the 1995 meeting of the Scientific Committee of the IWC several  papers prepared by
NMML and SWFSC staff regarding gray whales were discussed.  A paper by Shelden et al.
(SC/47/AS4) reported a substantial increase in the number and proportion of calves observed
during the southward migration, which may possibly be a response to the increase status of
gray whales relative to their carrying capacity.  Shelden et al. further noted that since the
mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, the median date of the southward migration past the counting
site in central California has been delayed 5 and 9 days, respectively.  Perryman et al.
(SC/47/AS1) reported on the results from the 1994 northward migration to enumerate the
number of gray whale calves in the population.  This survey was conducted from Piedras
Blancas, CA.  Total calf production was estimated at 1,001 calves (SE 92), which represents
4.3% of the best estimate of abundance.  This survey was done in response to concerns raised
over a possible reduction in calf production and indicates that calf production is currently at a reasonable level.  

<P>It was also noted during the 1995 SC meeting that 44 gray whales from the eastern North
Pacific stock were harvested by Russian subsistence hunters in 1994.  The SC noted that this
level of take was extremely unlikely to adversely affect this population.  Catch limits for the
eastern stock of gray whales in the North Pacific for 1995, 1996, and 1997 have been set by
the IWC at 140 animals per year, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to
be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines.

<A NAME="Bering Sea Ecosystem Study"></A><H4>Bering Sea Ecosystem Study</H4>

<P>The MMPA 1994 Amendments require NMFS to undertake a scientific research program to
resolve uncertainties concerning the causes of population declines in marine mammals, sea
birds and other living resources of the ecosystem.  The amendments also require that the
study consider the research recommendations developed by previous workshops on the Bering
Sea and that it include research on subsistence use of resources and ways to provide for the
continued use of these resources.  An important component of the study will be the
involvement of native Alaskan groups in the work, and the use of traditional local knowledge
in the conduct of Bering Sea research.

<P>NMFS and numerous other federal and state agencies and academic institutions already
conduct research in the Bering Sea which contributes to an understanding of the ecosystem
and potential declines in living marine resource populations.  However, the various research
efforts are not coordinated from an ecosystem perspective.  NMFS' objective in undertaking
this research program is not to duplicate research already ongoing, but to coordinate among
these programs and supplement this work as required.  

<P>As a first step, NMFS is developing a comprehensive ecosystem study plan to define
research, monitoring and assessment priorities.  The plan is being developed through a series
of steps involving NMFS, other federal agencies, the State of Alaska and Alaska native
groups.  NMFS completed the first draft of the plan in early 1995.  During this phase,
recommendations of previous Bering Sea workshops and symposia were reviewed and
incorporated into the plan as appropriate.  The plan was circulated to the MMC, State of
Alaska, FWS, NBS, Alaska native organizations and others for review and comment, and
revised.  

<P>In November 1995, NMFS sponsored a workshop in Anchorage to review current Bering Sea
research efforts, determine gaps in current research efforts, finalize the study plan, and
determine how the research would be conducted.  The workshop was attended by over 90
participants from NOAA, the above-mentioned agencies and organizations, and the general
public, and was successful in reviewing current research efforts and research gaps.  Alaska
Native organizations at the workshop focused on the role of traditional environmental
knowledge (TEK) in the study, but were unable to provide specific recommendations on how
to incorporate TEK into the research efforts.  NMFS will continue development of the
scientific plan, and will incorporate and Alaska Native input on TEK once it is available. 
The study plan will be finalized in 1996.

<A NAME="GME Ecosystem Workshop"></A><H4>Gulf of Maine Ecosystem Workshop</H4>

<P>On September 18, 1995, NMFS convened the Gulf of Maine Ecosystem Workshop at
Dartmouth University.  The workshop objectives were to: 1. assess the human-caused factors
affecting the affecting the health and stability of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem; and 2. identify research and management options to restore and/or maintain the environmental quality of the ecosystem.  Over 70 participants from state and federal government, academic institutions, environmental NGOs and fishing groups as well as private citizens gathered to discuss the status of the ecosystem.  

<P>The workshop consisted of plenary presentations and a public comment forum, followed by
focused working groups, and synthesis and drafting sessions.  Plenary subjects included the
Gulf of Maine physical environment, water column processes, benthic environments, fisheries
resources, protected species, and sources, fates and effects of contaminants.  The three
working groups were anthropogenic impacts, fisheries harvesting and protected species/marine
mammals.  In each working group, the status of knowledge for that topic was surveyed,
individual ecosystem stressors (direct and indirect) were identified, and research and
management recommendations were then developed for each.  Habitat, biodiversity, and
ecosystem function were emphasized as cross-cutting themes in each working group.

<P>The following were identified as the major factors affecting the health and stability of the
system:

<UL>
<LI>Overfishing, and related impacts,
<LI>Contaminant introduction,
<LI>Physical alteration and loss of critical habitat,
<LI>Impacts of human-activities and development on endangered/threatened species,
<LI>Factors external to the Gulf which affect seasonally resident and indigenous populations (global warming, mortality to migratory populations while outside the Gulf). 
</UL>

<P>Based on these priority impacts, the workshop made the following recommendations with
regard to research and management:

<P><EM>Research</EM>

<UL>
<LI>Identify critical linkages between ecosystem components and subsystems, and their sensitivity to cumulative and individual stressors;
<LI>Implement additional interdisciplinary research approaches;
<LI>Evaluate the resilience of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and its components known to be affected by stressors;
<LI>Develop criteria to assess sensitivity of coastal embayments and estuaries from an interdisciplinary perspective of habitat change, contaminant introduction, fisheries harvesting and physical and biological processes.
</UL>

<P><EM>Management</EM>

<UL>
<LI>Seek cost-effective solutions through increased integration of rigorous scientific assessment of the problems and potential management options;
<LI>Develop and implement integrated management strategies encompassing the key or sensitive components of both the Gulf of Maine per se and its watersheds;
<LI>Strengthen existing water quality criteria and enforcement activities in the Gulf of Maine;
<LI>Adopt a precautionary approach in the face of uncertainty or insufficient information.
</UL>

<P>The Executive Summary report of the workshop, as well as a NMFS report including major
conclusions and recommendations on research, management and legislation, was forwarded to
Congress on January 23, 1996.  The final workshop proceedings will be available in early
May 1996. 

<A NAME="Regionwide Pinniped-Fishery Interactions Study"></A><H4>Regionwide Pinniped-Fishery Interactions Study</H4>

<P>NMFS has been given the authority to conduct a study on the interaction between pinnipeds
and anadromous fish in at least three areas within the Northwest Region (Washington and
Oregon) to evaluate: 1) fish behavior in the presence of predators; 2) holding times and
passage rates of anadromous fish in the presence and absence of predation; and 3) whether
additional facilities exist, or can be modified to improve escapement.  However, this
investigation will not be conducted until appropriations have been allocated. 

<A NAME="Interaction btw sea lions/salmon"></A><H4>Interaction of California Sea Lions and Pacific Harbor Seals with Salmonid Stocks</H4>

<P>NMFS is to investigate whether California sea lions and Pacific harbor seals are having:  1) a significant negative impact on the recovery of salmonid fishery stocks listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are approaching endangered or threatened status; and 2) broader
impacts on coastal ecosystems of Washington, Oregon and California.

<P>To assist in gathering data for the investigation, NMFS established a working group
comprised of biologists familiar with pinniped and salmonid issues in the Pacific Northwest. 
The working group met twice in 1995, and produced a draft report in October 1995.  The
report is scheduled for completion in May 1996 at which time NMFS will enter into
consultation with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), which will act on
behalf of the states.  NMFS and the PSMFC will make joint recommendations to Congress on
how to mitigate any impacts identified through the investigation.

<A NAME="GME Pinniped-Fishery Interaction"></A><H4>Gulf of Maine Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force</H4>

<P>The 1994 MMPA Amendments require NMFS to convene a task force to provide advice on
issues or problems regarding pinnipeds interacting in a dangerous or damaging manner with
aquaculture resources in the Gulf of Maine.  The task force, appointed in January 1995, was
comprised of salmon growers, a state resource manager, representatives of environmental
organizations, and a pinniped biologist from the academic research community.  Three task
force meetings were held in the Eastport, ME area and one was held in Portland, ME.  All
meetings of the task force were open to the public.  

<P>On February 7, 1996, the task force submitted its final report to NMFS.  Among the
recommendations to mitigate pinniped-aquaculture interactions were:

<UL>
<LI>NMFS should review regulations, permit processes and all restrictions on currently held permits, and revisit those measures which limit a grower's ability to control seal predation through non-lethal measures.
<LI>NMFS should increase transboundary cooperation with Canadian authorities and work to endure that Canadian growers do not have a production or marketing advantage due to less restrictive regulations.
<LI>NMFS should halt the importation of salmon from nations that allow use of lethal measures to control predation at salmon pen-sites.
<LI>NMFS, Maine DMR and the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center should investigate innovative net pen designs.
<LI>NMFS should support research on the effects of acoustic deterrence devices.
<LI>NMFS and Maine DMR should conduct studies of seal life history to better understand the causes underlying interactions with aquaculture operations.
<LI>The salmon aquaculture industry should increase efforts to document losses from predator impacts.
<LI>Salmon growers and Maine aquaculture associations should work with federal and state agencies, academic institutions and NGOs to make predation control measures more effective and affordable.
<LI>NMFS should offer subsidized loans and an insurance program to assist growers to implement predation-control measures and to withstand losses from predators when they occur.
</UL>

<P>NMFS will use the task force report as the basis of a report to Congress, which will include
recommendations on how to mitigate the pinniped-aquaculture interactions.  That report is
scheduled for submission in September

<P>MMPA Section 101(b) provides an exemption to the
moratorium against taking marine mammals for Alaskan Indians, Aleuts, or Eskimos if the
taking is for subsistence purposes or for purposes of creating and selling authentic native
articles of handicrafts and clothing.  These takes, however, may be limited by quota and, in
some cases, other regulations.  Two of the five subsistence takes listed below, bowhead
whales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and the northern fur seals on the Pribilof Islands,
are subject to such limitations.  The remainder are undergoing harvest level assessments.

<A NAME="Bowhead Whales"></A><H4>Bowhead Whales</H4>

<P><STRONG>Subsistence Program Management</STRONG>


<P>NMFS works cooperatively with the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission to manage
bowhead issues.  Catch limits for the subsistence take of bowhead whales are established by
the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  A 3-year quota of 54 strikes per year with no
more than 41 animals landed was set by the IWC for the years 1992 - 1994.  The actual take of bowhead whales in 1993, 1994, and 1995 is presented in <A HREF="#Box 7">Box 7</A>.   At the 1994 IWC Annual Meeting, a new 4-year quota was established.  For the years 1995 - 1998, the number of bowhead whales landed shall not exceed 204, and the number of bowhead whales struck shall not exceed 68 in 1995, 67 in 1996, 66 in 1997, and 65 in 1998, with the exception that any unused portion of the yearly quota may be carried over and added to the subsequent year's
strike  quota, provided that no more than 10 strikes is added to the strike quota for any one
year.

<P><STRONG>Research on Bowhead Whales</STRONG>

<P>No field studies were conducted on bowhead whales by the staff at NMML in 1995.  However, several analyses and reports were either undertaken or completed using existing
data.  For example, three papers were completed that related to the development of a regime
for IWC s management of aboriginal subsistence whaling (ASW).  The papers 
will be presented at the Scientific Committee meetings of the IWC in 
1996.  In addition, NMML staff collaborated with researchers from the University of Washington and LGL Inc. on a report on the utility of photoidentification in estimating the annual survival rate of adult bowhead whales.  This paper will also be submitted to the Scientific Committee of the IWC for consideration at its June 1996 meeting.

<P>Finally, NMML staff in cooperation with other AFSC staff continued their studies on the
utility of radio-isotope aging of bowhead whale ear bones.  The initial studies have used gray
whale earbones, but upon completion of the calibration phase, bowhead whale ear bones will
be aged based on changes in the ratio of lead and radium isotopes in the calcium matrix of
the bone. 

<P>To date, researchers have not been able to develop reliable methods for determining the age
of a bowhead whale.  It is likely that a combination of approaches will have to be used to
cover the full range of the age structure of this species, such as also using carbon-isotope
ratios and eye lens protein racemerization.  

<A NAME="Steller Sea Lions"></A><H4>Steller Sea Lions and Harbor Seals</H4>


<P><STRONG>Alaska Native Subsistence Harvest of Steller Sea Lions</STRONG>

<P>Although Steller sea lions and harbor seals have been a traditional subsistence resource for
Alaska Natives in many areas of the State, information on harvest levels prior to the 1990s is
limited.  Therefore, beginning
 in 
1992, NMFS provided funds to the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game to gather information on the subsistence use of harbor seals (and Steller sea
lions) in Alaska. From surveys with hunters and Native households in coastal villages
throughout the State, details of the subsistence take, including an estimate of total take (i.e.,
landings plus animals struck but lost), have been developed for the years 1992 to 1994.

<P>The estimated total Native subsistence take of Steller sea lions in Alaska for those years was
549 in 1992 (370 killed, 179 struck and lost), 487 in 1993 (348 killed, 139 struck and lost),
and 416 in 1994 (336 killed, 80 struck and lost). 

<P>Almost the entire subsistence take of Steller sea lions has been in the range of the western
U.S. stock, and more than three-fourths of that take occurred on the Pribilof and Aleutian
Islands. The highest annual take from the eastern U.S. stock between 1992 and 1994 was
estimate at six animals in 1992.

<P>In light of concern about the decline of Steller sea lions and their importance as a subsistence
resource, Native residents in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands established an Alaska Native
Steller Sea Lion Commission (ANSSLC) to develop a system of self-regulation and to explore
co-management arrangements with Federal and State resource managers.  The ANSSLC
membership was discussed among Native village representatives, but a meeting was not
convened in 1995.

<P><STRONG>Steller Sea Lion Subsistence Project</STRONG>

<P>In September 1995, NMFS Alaska Region began, under contract, a Steller sea lion tissue
sampling and education project in 3 Alaska Native communities that have a high subsistence
harvest (St. Paul Island, St. George Island, and Unalaska).  Sampling focuses on obtaining
tissue to determine the age, sex, and genetic makeup of harvested animals, as well as their
physical condition, reproductive history, and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants. 

<P>A second major emphasis of the contract is to increase awareness of the plight of the Steller
sea lion and to encourage local management of the subsistence harvest.  The contractor, in
association with NMFS Alaska Region, will hold community workshops to discuss Steller sea
lion recovery efforts and to inform hunters of the tissue collection project.  In future years,
NMFS hopes to expand this program to include other Alaska Native communities that harvest
Steller sea lions, and to increase its emphasis on conservation through improved hunting
practices and local management of harvest.  The project will be continued in 1996, and a first
year project report will be available in fall of 1996.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence Harvests</STRONG>

<P>Under section 10(e) of the ESA, prohibitions on the taking of threatened and endangered
species normally do not apply to takings by native Alaskans if such taking is primarily for
subsistence purposes.  To date, no action has been taken to regulate, or otherwise manage, the
subsistence harvest of Steller sea lions by Alaska native groups.  If subsistence takings
materially and negatively affect the species, regulations or restrictions may be imposed only
after a hearing and a decision is finalized. 

<P>Section 119 of the MMPA allows the Secretary of Commerce to enter into cooperative
agreements with Alaska Native organizations to conserve marine mammals and provide co-
management of subsistence uses.  In 1994, an interim Alaska Native Steller Sea Lion
Commission consisting of representatives from Alaska communities that take Steller sea lions
for subsistence needs was formed to improve communication among indigenous communities
that use sea lions, to advocate for conservation of Steller sea lions, to advocate for protection
of customary and traditional rights of indigenous peoples with regard to access and use of sea
lions, and to serve as the focal point for development of co-management agreements with
NMFS.  Through co-management agreements between NMFS and the Alaska Native Sea Lion
Commission or tribal entities, self-management and regulation of the subsistence harvest by
Alaska Native tribes, communities, or the Commission will be achieved.  NMFS is not
considering regulation of the subsistence harvest at this time but hopes to work with Alaska
Native communities and representatives to ensure that subsistence harvest does not adversely
affect the Steller sea lion population.

<P>Alaska Native subsistence hunters have been estimated to take about 500 Steller sea lions
annually in recent years; virtually all of the subsistence harvest in Alaska occurs within the
range of the western population segment (Wolfe and Mischler, 1993; 1994).  These removals
have an impact on the population although the magnitude of estimates in comparison to the
reported declines indicate that subsistence harvest has not been a significant factor in the
decline.  However, should the western population segment continue to decline and the
subsistence harvest continue at the same level, it may become significant. 

<P><STRONG>Alaska Native Subsistence Harvest of Harbor Seals</STRONG>

<P>The estimated total Native subsistence take of harbor seals in Alaska was 2,888 in 1992
(2,535 retrieved, 353 struck and lost), 2,736 in 1993 (2,365 retrieved, 371 struck and lost) and 2,621 in 1994 (2,313 retrieved, 308 struck and lost).

<P>In September, 1995, NMFS Alaska Region contracted a harbor seal tissue sampling project to
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), Subsistence Division.  Tissues will be
used to further studies of genetics, age and growth determination, cranial morphometrics,
long-term archival and contaminant analyses.  Areas covered include southeast Alaska, Bristol
Bay and the Aleutian Islands.   Results of research analyses will be provided to the Native
community, particularly for dioxin levels in harbor seals near pulp mills in southeast Alaska.

<P>NMFS also contracted ADFG, Division of Subsistence, to estimate the annual take of harbor
seals (and Steller sea lions) by Alaska Natives.  The information was derived by systematic
interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals.  The most recent technical report
regarding this contract includes data collected in 1994.  ADFG reported that 2,621 seals 
(95% CI 2,110 -3,457) were harvested in 1994.  Of this take, 308 (11.8%) seals were struck
and lost.  The estimated number of harbor seals harvested in Alaska by subsistence hunters in
1992 and 1993 was 2,888 and 2,736, respectively.  

<P><STRONG>Research on Harbor Seals</STRONG>

<P>In Alaska, harbor seals range throughout southern Alaska waters, the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian
Islands and along the north side of the Alaska Peninsula and Bristol Bay (to about 59o N). 
Once, harbor seals were considered abundant in all parts of their Alaskan range until surveys
by ADFG researchers in the 1980's indicated declining trends in some areas. The NMML has
conducted surveys in Alaska intermittently since 1976 and yearly since 1991 to obtain a
minimum population estimate for the state.   

<P>The state of Alaska was arbitrarily sub-divided into 4 regions for census purposes.  These
regions roughly follow the estimated stock separations, but logistical considerations were the
primary factor used for this delineation.  NMML, with funding from the NMFS Office of
Protected Resource s Marine Mammal Assessment Program,  has censused each of these 4
regions over the last 4 years (Loughlin 1992 [Bristol Bay, Prince William Sound, and Copper
River Delta], Loughlin 1993 [Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound], Loughlin 1994
[Southeastern Alaska], and Withrow and Loughlin 1995 [Aleutian Islands]). 

<P>In 1995, the NMML began phase II, a re-census and evaluation of each of the 4 regions in
order to provide current population figures and estimates of  trend, especially in areas of
decline and neighboring locations.  Survey areas included the north side of the Alaska
Peninsula and Bristol Bay.  Although data are still in the analysis process, tentative mean
estimates for the north side of the Alaska Peninsula are 7783 seals with a CV = 4.4%. This
represents a difference of  -745 seals (-9.5%) compared with our 1991 surveys.

<P>In 1995 NMML also continued a study to determine the proportion of animals missed during
our molt census aerial surveys.  These surveys miss an unknown number of animals that are
at sea or that move between haulout sites. Also, the number of animals hauled out is
influenced by tidal state at many locations, but tide may not influence haulout patterns at
others. In 1994 NMML initiated the first phase of this study on rocky substrate in Southeast
Alaska just prior to the molt census surveys.  The mean percent number of tagged seals
hauled out each day was 57.5%.  A correction factor of 1.74 was computed with the CV of
the mean equal to 0.068.  In 1995, we worked in Prince William Sound on sandy substrate. 
Twenty-five seals (13 males and 12 females) were captured and  equipped with radio
transmitters. Nineteen were adults, 5 were sub-adults and 1 was a pup of the year.  Data for
this study are still undergoing analysis and results will be reported later.

<A NAME="Northern Fur Seal"></A><H4>Northern Fur Seal Subsistence Harvest</H4>

<P>In 1994 NMFS estimated that the subsistence needs for 1994, 1995, and 1996 could be met
by annual harvests of between 281 and 500 fur seals on St. George Island and between 1,645
and 2,000 fur seals on St. Paul Island.

<P>In 1995 the total subsistence harvest was 1,525 fur seals, including 260 animals on St. George
and 1,265 animals on St. Paul.  Subsistence harvesting of fur seals was conducted on St. Paul
Island on 22 days between July 1, 1995 and August 8, 1995, and on St. George Island on 13
days between June 30, 1995, and August 7, 1995.  A total of 1,265 seals were harvested on
St. Paul Island during the 1995 season and 260 seals were harvested this year on St. George
Island. 

<P>By agreement, the Tribal Government of St. Paul eliminated the butterfly field butchering cut
and all but 30 animals were taken as whole carcasses from the field.  Therefore, the past
procedure of sampling and weighing seals for percent use determinations was not employed
this year.   Of the 30 animals field dressed as butterfly cuts, 11 were the result of broken gall
bladders and potential spoilage of part of the meat by bile.  The remaining 19 seals were field
dressed as butterfly cuts for elders who are physically unable to butcher whole animals.

<P>As in the past, all seals harvested on St. George were field dressed and taken from the field
as whole animals.  Through a cooperative effort between NMFS and the tribal governments of
both islands, a total of 85 seals were disentangled from marine debris during the harvest
period.

<A NAME="Beluga Whales"></A><H4>Beluga Whales</H4>

<P><STRONG>Subsistence Program</STRONG>

<P>The
 Alaska Beluga Committee (ABC) was formed in 1988.  Since that date, the ABC has
met annually to provide harvest information on takes by Alaska Natives.  Hunters from
approximately 50 villages take beluga whales in Alaska.  Animals are harvested from 5 stocks
that are defined by summering areas.


<P>In
 1994, approximately 218 animals were taken in the beluga harvest.   In 1995, 135 animals
were taken in the beluga harvest by areas as follows: Cook Inlet-42, Bristol Bay-6, Norton
Sound-50, Chukchi Sea-34 and the Beaufort Sea-1.  In 1995 the Cook Inlet Marine Mammal
Council (CIMMC) representing Cook Inlet beluga hunters and cooperating with NMFS
prepared the harvest report for their area.  Based on CIMMC verbal accounts, previously
reported harvest information for the Cook Inlet stock has been under reported by at least 50
percent.


<P><STRONG>Research on Beluga Whales</STRONG>

<P>Aerial
 surveys and dive behavior studies of the beluga whales in Cook Inlet Alaska were
conducted in July/August 1995 by 
NMML
 staff. The aerial surveys were flown to determine
the distribution of beluga groups in the inlet, standardize counts of groups and collect aerial
video tape of the groups during the counts. Dive behavior studies were conducted using a
VHF radio tag attached to the whales by a suction cup. A second study using satellite linked
dive recorders was unsuccessful in capturing whales for tag attachment. Using the aerial
counts and correction factors developed from analyzing the dive data and the video tape the
abundance in the inlet was estimated at 750 whales; however, methods to determine the
variance and bias associated with this estimate are still being developed.  At present, NMFS
has followed the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group regarding the
abundance of beluga whales in Cook Inlet, which is to use an estimate of abundance of 1251
(see Small and DeMaster 1995), but is intending to work cooperatively with Native
organizations in establishing a PBR for this stock.  As noted above, the removal level in 1995
associated with native hunting was 68 animals, which represents a removal rate of
approximately 5% of the population.  An aerial survey of the Cook Inlet belugas is planned
for June, 1996 and tentatively planned for even numbered years there after to monitor trends
in the population. The tagging studies and aerial surveys have been conducted with the
cooperation of the Alaska Region Office in Anchorage, the Cook Inlet Marine Mammal
Council and the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee. 


<P>Aerial surveys to determine minimum abundance of beluga whales in Norton Sound were
flown by scientists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in cooperation with NMML.  While the complete area could not be surveyed during the study period because of
fog over the Yukon Delta, the minimum estimate of abundance for this stock was
approximately 8,000 animals.  The PBR for this population will likely be approximately 160
animals, assuming an FR of 1.0 for this stock, which is greater than the average harvest level
in Norton Sound over the last five years (i.e., 147 animals per year).  In addition, research on the stock identification of beluga whales in Alaska was undertaken in 1995 by staff from the
Marine Mammal Division, SWFSC.  The results of the genetic studies are consistent with the
recommendation by NMFS to manage beluga whales in Alaska as five separate stocks: Cook
Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Eastern Bering Sea, and Beaufort Sea stocks.  That is,
unique genetic differences were found for each of these stocks, which implies that rates of
immigration or emigration between stocks is likely to be negligible.  
 

<P>Support for the NMFS portion of these studies was provided by the NMFS Office of
Protected Resource s Marine Mammal Assessment Program.  Support for the rest of this
research was provided for by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee.

<A NAME="Public Display"></A><H4>Public Display, Scientific Research, and Enhancement Permits </H4>

<P>NMFS  administers provisions within the permit program, pursuant to the MMPA, the ESA,
and the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (FSA), as they apply to species under the jurisdiction of the
Secretary of Commerce.  Under these statutes, permits may be issued for certain purposes
(e.g., public display, scientific research, and enhancement), to take, import, export, or conduct an otherwise prohibited activity involving such protected species.  The 1994 amendments to the MMPA also authorize the issuance of permits for a new category, photography.


<P>Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1995, NMFS reviewed 33 permit applications. 
Of these, 20 permits were issued for scientific research and three were issued for public
display.  Four applications were returned or withdrawn, and six applications were awaiting
final action at the end of December 1995.

<P>NMFS also processes permit amendments if the proposed modifications meet the appropriate
regulatory standards, and other permit-related authorizations.  A modification is usually
subject to the same notice, review and comment procedures as a permit application.  During
the reporting period, 90 permit modifications/authorizations were processed.  Tables D-1
through D-5 in Appendix D provide an overview of major permit-related activities during the
reporting period.

<A NAME="Proposed Revisions"></A><H4>Proposed Revisions to Permit Regulations</H4>

<P>On
 October 14, 1993, NMFS published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to amend the
regulations for permits under the MMPA, the ESA and the FSA.  These proposed revisions
were intended to update and consolidate existing permit regulations, to implement
amendments to the MMPA that were enacted November 23, 1988, and to make administration
of the permit program more efficient, consistent, and predictable.  The public comment period
on the proposed rule was extended twice and public hearings were held in Washington, D.C.,
Oakland, CA, and Chicago, IL.  


<P>While
 the proposed rule was undergoing final modifications prior to publication as a final
rule, the 1994 amendments to the MMPA were signed into law.  The 1994 Amendments
made substantial changes to sections 102 and 104 of the MMPA governing permits for public
display, scientific research, and enhancement activities of marine mammal species and stocks. 
Consequently  final regulations incorporating public comments as well as provisions of the
new amendments are expected to be published in early 1996, as well as proposed regulations
for public display and photography permits.

<A NAME="1994 Amendments"></A><H4>1994 Amendments to the MMPA Permitting Process </H4>

<P>When
 the MMPA was amended on April 30, 1994, substantial changes to the permit process
were made, including:
<OL>
<LI>NMFS' authority to condition public display permits by specifying methods of supervision,
care and transport is limited to the initial capture from the wild or initial import. 
<LI>Permits for public display are only required for capture and import of marine mammals
and may be issued to a recipient that meets the following three criteria:
<OL>
<LI>offers a program for education or conservation purposes that is based on professionally recognized standards of the public display community;
<LI>is registered or holds a license issued under 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq., i.e., from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (or, for foreign facilities, meets comparable standards); and
<LI>maintains facilities for the public display of marine mammals that are open to the public on a regularly scheduled basis and to which access is not limited or restricted other than by charging of an admission fee.
</OL>
<LI>Persons holding marine mammals have the right to take, sell, export, or otherwise transfer
possession of  marine mammals, for public display, to any person who meets the 
criteria (cited above) without any additional permit or authorization.
<LI>15-days' advance notification of any transportation, sale, purchase, or export of a marine mammal for public display, scientific research, or enhancement purposes is required.
<LI>The requirement that scientific research not be duplicative was eliminated.
<LI>The 30-day comment period in certain "emergency" situations may be 
waived.
<LI>A General Authorization for non-injurious scientific research (Level B harassment) on
marine mammals was provided.
<LI>A new permit category for photographing marine mammals in the wild for educational and
commercial purposes was 
established.
<LI>NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are required to maintain a basic inventory
of marine mammals held in captivity but limits information to specific categories. 
</OL>

<P><STRONG>Education Standards</STRONG>

<P>When the MMPA was amended on April 30, 1994, one of the changes with regard to the
public display of marine mammals eliminated the requirement for NMFS to determine whether education and conservation programs  are acceptable.  The MMPA now requires that
persons holding marine mammals for purposes of public display, or requesting issuance of a
permit to capture or import marine mammals for purposes of public display, must offer a
program for education or conservation purposes that is based on professionally recognized
standards of the public display community.  In order for NMFS to identify professionally
recognized standards, NMFS contacted representatives of the public display community requesting that a copy of these standards be developed and submitted to NMFS for publication, thus enabling persons seeking marine mammals for public display purposes to reference these standards rather than submitting a list of such standards with each application.

<P>The American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) and the Alliance of Marine Mammal
Parks and Aquaria (Alliance), together representing approximately 60% of U.S. facilities that
currently hold marine mammals, have submitted, for reference purposes, the professionally
accepted standards on which their members base their education and conservation programs. 
A Notice of Receipt of these standards was published on October 6, 1994.  Since AZA and
the Alliance do not represent the entire public display community, NMFS will also consider
and publish notice of any alternative standards that are submitted by other members or
representative organizations of the public display community, or those that are provided as
part of a permit application.


<P><STRONG>Beached and Stranded Marine Mammals</STRONG>

<P>Beached or stranded marine mammals taken under the authority of section 109(h) of the
MMPA may be held only for the purpose of rehabilitation until:  (1) The animal is returned
to its natural habitat; (2) NMFS concurs with a determination by the attending veterinarian
that it is not feasible to return the animal to its natural habitat and permanent holding is
authorized by NMFS; or, (3) although the attending veterinarian determines that the animal is
releasable, NMFS authorizes the permanent retention of the animal as a substitute for the
capture of one of the same species from the wild. 


<P>The permanent retention of a beached or stranded marine mammal previously taken for the
purpose of rehabilitation under section 109(h) of the MMPA must be authorized by NMFS
before an unreleasable animal may be retained by the rehabilitating facility, or transported or
exported to another facility for public display purposes, in accordance with applicable MMPA
requirements.  Additionally, the recipient or retaining facility must meet the three 
public display criteria specified in the 1994 Amendments (and cited above).  

<P>A permit is required to retain or obtain rehabilitated beached and stranded marine mammals
for purposes of scientific research or enhancing the survival or recovery of marine mammal
species or stocks or to retain a releasable marine mammals for purpose of public display in
lieu of a capture.  Proposed regulations implementing these provisions will be ready for
publication in 1996. 


<P><STRONG>Exports</STRONG>
 
<P>Under the 1994 Amendments to the MMPA, a public display permit is no longer required for
the receipt of captive marine mammals by foreign facilities or persons requesting marine
mammals from the United States.  However, NMFS must determine that the recipient meets
the public display criteria (cited above) established by the amendments to receive marine
mammals for public display.  Therefore, in addition to the 15-day advance transport
notification requirement, NMFS must also receive a letter from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service stating that the foreign facility
meets standards that are comparable to those applicable to U.S. licensees and 
others registered under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).


<P>Additionally, NMFS must receive a statement from the appropriate foreign government
agency certifying that: 1)  the information submitted by the foreign facility is accurate; 2) the laws of the foreign government  enable that foreign government to enforce requirements
equivalent to the requirements of the U.S. MMPA and AWA and that the government will
enforce such requirements; and 3) if it is determined that the foreign facility has acted in a
manner inconsistent with a requirement of the MMPA or the AWA that would be applicable
to a U.S. facility, the foreign government will afford comity to any enforcement decision that
may be made by NMFS, including seizure of the marine mammals exported from the United
States and the progeny of such marine mammals, and the recovery of expenses for such
seizure or other disposition.


<P>The  amendments also provide specifically for the export of marine mammals for purposes of
public display without further permit or authorization.  Although no such specific provision
was included for scientific research or enhancement activities, a general provision was
included allowing exports that meet comparable standards.


<P>The following exports of live marine mammals occurred in 1995:
<UL>
<LI>Four (4) Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Chicago Zoological Society to the Lisbon Zoo in Portugal (2 females and 2 males);
<LI>Six (6) California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) from Sea World to Folks Land Aka Amusement & Picnic Resort in India (3 females; 3 males);
<LI>Two (2) California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) from Oklahoma City Zoological Park to Folks Land Aka Amusement & Picnic Resort in India (1 female and 1 male);
<LI>One (1) Northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) from the Marine Mammal Care Center at Fort MacArthur to Mundo Aquatico in Portugal (1 female); and 
<LI>One (1) Northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) from the Marine Mammal Center to Marineland Cote D'Azur in France (1 male).
</UL>
<P><STRONG>General Authorization</STRONG>

<P>The 1994 Amendments required NMFS to issue a general authorization and implementing
regulations for scientific research involving Level B harassment of marine mammals in the
wild.  Level B harassment is defined as any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance which has
the potential to disturb by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited, to migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding or sheltering.  Research activities involving Level A harassment, which is defined as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to injure, will require a scientific research permit.  If the proposed research includes marine mammals listed under the ESA, a permit for such activities must be issued pursuant to the ESA.
  
<P>The holder of a valid ESA permit that authorizes such activities, may conduct Level B harassment on listed marine mammals without submission of a separate letter of intent pursuant to the MMPA General Authorization.

<P>An interim final rule which establishes a streamlined permitting process was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 1994.  This rule: establishes a general authorization for bona fide scientific research projects that do not exceed Level B harassment on species or stocks not listed under the ESA; describes the research activities most likely to be included under the general authorization; and identifies submission requirements for the letter of intent.  Not later than 30 days after submission of a letter of intent, NMFS must issue a letter to the applicant either:confirming that the General Authorization applies; informing the applicant that all or part of the research may result in taking other than Level B harassment and that a scientific research permit is required; or, informing the applicant that the letter of intent lacked sufficient information or that the research is not bona fide as defined in the MMPA (Pub. L. 103-238,   216.3).  The General Authorization includes specific research and
monitoring conditions and reporting requirements.   Public comments were received and are
being considered in the development of the final rule.  

<P>Research activities that are expected to cause no more than Level B harassment include
photo-identification studies, behavioral observations, and vessel and aerial population surveys.  From November 1994 through December 31, 1995, NMFS received 27 letters of intent to
conduct Level B harassment on marine mammal species or stocks for scientific research
purposes; 19 were issued and eight were returned either for insufficient information or
because they included listed species, involved level A harassment, or did not meet the bona
fide research requirements. 

<P><STRONG>Photography Permits</STRONG>

<P>The amendments added a new category of permits to allow marine mammals in the wild to be
photographed for educational and commercial purposes.  These permits are limited to Level B
harassment of non-endangered marine mammals and require that the photographic products be
made available to the public. Two applications were accepted in 1995 as pilot applications for
the development of implementing regulations.

<P><STRONG>Captive Swim-With-The-Dolphin (SWTD) Programs</STRONG>

<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA eliminated NMFS authority to regulate the care of
captive marine mammals held in public display facilities.  However, NMFS continued to
receive inquiries from members of the public and the media about captive Swim-With-The-
Dolphin (SWTD) programs.  In response, NMFS provided to interested parties copies of the
1990 Final Environmental Impact Statement on SWTD programs prepared by NMFS, and the
1994 Final Report of the NMFS-sponsored behavioral study of dolphins involved in SWTD
programs entitled  <EM>Quantitative  Behavioral Study of Bottlenose Dolphins in Swim-With-The-
Dolphin Programs.</EM>   All inquirers were informed that captive SWTD programs are now
under the sole jurisdiction of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to regulate under the AWA.
  
<P>The results of the NMFS-sponsored behavioral study were subsequently published in 
October 1995 (Samuels, A. and T.R. Spradlin. Quantitative behavioral study of bottlenose dolphins in Swim-With-Dolphin programs in the United States.  <EM>Marine Mammal Science</EM>, 
11(4):520-544.)

<A NAME="Notable Permit and Authorization Requests"></A><H4>Notable Permit and Authorization Requests</H4>

<P><STRONG>Reintroduction of Dolphins</STRONG>

<P>In February 1995, the NMFS Permit Division returned the application submitted by The
Dolphin Alliance to release two  captive female Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops
truncatus) to the wild, and requested additional information.  A revised application had not
been received as of December 31, 1995.   

<P>During 1995, there was an increase in public and media interest in releasing captive marine
mammals, such as  Keiko  and  Lolita , to the wild and in release projects like the Sugarloaf
Dolphin Sanctuary and the  Bogie and Bacall Project.   However, NMFS consistently stated,
in both press releases and responses to letters of inquiry, that the release of captive marine
mammals into the wild may result in a "take" as defined in the MMPA, and, therefore, can
occur only after a scientific research permit has been issued.  Since established protocols do
not currently exist for rehabilitating and releasing captive marine mammals back into the
wild, it is the intention of NMFS to develop scientifically sound protocols through the permit
process which affords the opportunity for both scientific and public review.    

<P>NMFS has repeatedly stated that the purpose of the MMPA is to protect individuals, stocks,
and populations of marine mammals.  Congress has entrusted NMFS with the authority to
implement the MMPA by enforcing a moratorium against "taking" marine mammals, unless
authorized under a permit issued for various purposes, including scientific research and
enhancement, photography, and public display.  In the case of releasing captive marine
mammals, both the animals to be released and any population of wild marine mammals that
could come into contact with the released animals could be vulnerable to a take.  Issues of
concern include: disease transmission between released animals and wild marine mammals;
unwanted genetic exchanges between introduced and endemic stocks/populations; the ability
of the released dolphins to adequately forage and defend themselves from predators; and any
behavioral patterns developed in captivity which could prove detrimental to the social
structure of local populations as well as the social assimilation of the released animal.

<P>The sparse history of rehabilitated and released captive dolphins has provided limited
documentation with questionable results.  Such concerns, and the need to prevent them with
respect to potential releases of captive marine mammals, was recently acknowledged by
Congress in the Conference report accompanying H.R. 4650, enacted as Public Law 103-335,
which included provisions for the transfer of dolphins from Navy facilities:  

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>"The conferees are informed that there are no scientifically established or
accepted protocols for such releases.  Moreover, documented success of previous
attempts to reintroduce captive marine mammals to the wild is sparse. 
Accordingly, the conferees believe that any attempts at releasing Navy marine
mammals to the wild should be pursued cautiously and on an experimental basis
until scientifically sound protocols have been developed and reintroductions have
proven successful.  The conferees recognize that the Department of Defense does
not have the authority to allow the return of once-captive Navy Marine mammals
into the wild.  This authority rests with the Department of Commerce, through the
NMFS.  Accordingly, the conferees direct the Navy to cooperate with the
Secretary of Commerce and the Marine Mammal Commission in
developingrigorous scientific protocols for experimental releases.  Given the
potential for "takes" under the [MMPA] or the Endangered Species Act, the
conferees direct that in no case shall any release be attempted unless authorized
by a scientific research permit issued by the Secretary of Commerce under the
appropriate statutory authority." </EM></FONT></UL>

<P><STRONG>ATOC Off the Coasts of California and Hawaii  </STRONG>


<P>Applications were submitted by Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA, for two
scientific research permits under the MMPA and the ESA to allow harassment of several
species of marine mammals and sea turtles by two low-frequency sound sources (peak
frequency 75 Hz, 35 Hz bandwidth; 195 dB level (re 1 uPa at 1 m)), one to be located 14 km
north of Kaihu Point, Kauai, HI ( 850 m depth) and the second on Pioneer Seamount, CA (980 m depth).  This research is part of a 2-year Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program designed to test the feasibility of a future global ocean climate monitoring program and to investigate the possible effects of this sound on marine mammals and sea turtles.  Notice of receipt of these applications was published in the Federal Register, with the
public comment period for the California application opening on May 17, 1995, and the
Hawaii application opening on May 31, 
1995.

<P>Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) were prepared for both projects which contained  the
analyses constituting the basis for the biological assessments required by the Section 7
consultation process.  The Final EISs were made available to the public on May 5, 1996 for
California and May 26, 1995 for Hawaii.

<P>The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) requested initiation of consultation under
Section 7 of the ESA with NMFS for both the Hawaii and California projects.  Section 7
Consultations were provided on July 13, 1995 for the California Project and on September 28,
1995 for the Hawaiian Project.  The permits were issued on July 13, 1995  and October 5, 1995,  respectively.

<P>In November 1995, engineering tests were conducted at the Pioneer Seamount site in
preparation for the Marine Mammal Research Protocol (MMRP) operations.   Due to some
misunderstanding of the permit requirements this testing was done without the involvement of
the MMRP researchers or prior notification of the Region.  A modification to the permit was
issued which made explicit that all future engineering tests were subject to the same
conditions as the operational tests and limited the maximum decibel level to 195 dB (re 1
æPa at 1 m).  

<P>Concerns arose because at the time of  the engineering tests, three dead humpback whales
were observed proximal to the test area.  One washed ashore at Stinson Beach, CA, and two
others were seen floating in the Gulf of the Farallones.  The cause of the deaths could not be
determined conclusively although it appears that they were not  related to the tests.  

<P>After consultations with the Marine Mammal Commission and the MMRP Advisory Board,
the permit was modified as described above and the operational testing was authorized.

<A NAME="Public Interaction"></A><H4>Public Interaction with Marine Mammals in the Wild</H4>
 
<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA eliminated NMFS authority over marine mammal care
issues in captivity, including captive SWTD programs.  This authority now lies solely with
USDA/APHIS.  However, NMFS has retained the authority to enforce against harassment of
marine mammals in the wild.  Based on the current statutory definition of harassment (see
above) and implementing regulations, people who harass marine mammals in the wild can be
subject to civil or criminal prosecution under the MMPA.

<P>In recent years, the public has been seeking close encounters with wild marine mammals at
an alarming rate.  There is a growing trend amongst eco-tourist operators and critics of public
display facilities to promote human encounters with wild animals (such as feeding or swim-
with activities) as a better way to experience the animals since they are in their natural
habitat.  However, NMFS and the scientific community are concerned about the health and
well-being of wild marine mammals that become habituated to humans.  Human activities that
injure or harass marine mammals are illegal under the MMPA.      

<P>Despite the feeding ban, members of the public continue to feed wild marine mammals. 
Although illegal and dangerous, these practices continue to be promoted by commercial
operators, recreational boaters and fishers, and tourists.  Dangers to wild marine mammals
include injury or death from:  development of unnatural behaviors such as begging;
dependence on human provisioning; vessel strikes; intentional human abuse; ingestion of
harmful items; and exploitation and encroachment of critical habitats.  In addition, there are
increasing reports of people being severely injured from aggressive encounters with
provisioned marine mammals.  NMFS is particularly concerned about the growing public
perception that provisioned marine mammals are becoming nuisance animals.  The two
species of marine mammals currently most affected by feeding activities are Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins (<EM>Tursiops truncatus</EM>) in the southeast, and California sea lions (<EM>Zalophus californianus</EM>) on the west coast. 
       
<P><STRONG>Swim-With and Other Recreational Activities</STRONG>


<P>Public interaction with marine mammals in the wild (e.g., swim-with, jet-skiing, kayaking,
touching, petting) are causing problems similar to those associated with feeding.  Of primary
concern to NMFS are the potential negative impacts of exploitation and encroachment of
critical habitats on the behavior, health and well-being of wild marine mammals.  NMFS has
received reports of people harassing Hawaiian spinner dolphins (<EM>Stenella longirostris</EM>), Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (<EM>Tursiops truncatus</EM>), killer whales (<EM>Orcinus orca</EM>), Humpback whales (<EM>Megaptera novaeangliae</EM>), Gray whales (<EM>Eschrichtius robustus</EM>), California sea lions (<EM>Zalophus californianus</EM>), Northern elephant seals (<EM>Mirounga angustirostris</EM>), and harbor seals (<EM>Phoca vitulina</EM>).  

<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA defined harassment (see above) and now clearly prohibit individuals from pursuing, annoying, or tormenting wild marine mammals.  The discovery of marine mammal resting/breeding/feeding areas, and the increased accessibility of ways to approach the animals (jet-skis, kayaks) has led to marine mammals being harassed.  

<P><STRONG>Education Efforts</STRONG>

<P>Continuing problems with members of the public interacting with marine mammals in the
wild resulted in the development of an education/media campaign on the illegality of
harassing cetaceans and pinnipeds in the wild and the harm it causes.  A press release was
distributed to cities in Florida (Panama City, Ft.  Walton Beach, Sarasota, Destin and the
Keys) and Texas (Corpus Christi) where there are known problems.  Staff from NMFS' Office
of Protected Resources gave presentations at the Biennial Conference on the Biology of
Marine Mammal and the International Marine Animal Trainers Association requesting
assistance from the scientific and public display communities to help educate the public to not
interact (feed, swim-with, touch) with marine mammals in the wild.  NMFS had Federal
Warning signs printed and distributed to its regional enforcement offices for posting in
locations where problems are known to occur.

<P>The signs appear as follows:<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../images/feed1.gif"></CENTER>
                                     
<P>NMFS encourages people to appreciate marine mammals in the wild by observing them from
a safe distance.  People should not attempt to feed, approach, or touch marine mammals in
the wild.

<A NAME="Background"></A><H4>Background</H4>

<P>In 1992, the United States Congress enacted the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding
Response Act (MMHSRA) (Public Law 102-587).  The Act contains three basic provisions:
Marine Mammal Stranding Networks, Response to Unusual Mortality Events, and the
National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank.  To implement the  Act, NMFS has instituted the
Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP) with the following components:  
stranding networks, response to unusual mortality events, monitoring, the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank, quality assurance and information management.  A discussion of the accomplishments in each of these areas follows.

<A NAME="Stranding Networks"></A><H4>Stranding Networks</H4>

<P>Marine Mammal Stranding Networks have been established in each of NMFS' regions.  Most
members of the Marine Mammal Stranding Networks are volunteers who respond to both live
and dead strandings of pinnipeds and cetaceans.  The volunteers do not receive monetary
compensation for their efforts.  They must satisfy minimum requirements in terms of marine
mammal experience in order to be issued letters of authorization by the appropriate Regional
Office to respond to strandings.  Different levels of authorization may apply, depending on
the capabilities of the members, e.g., response to live stranded animals is generally limited to
those institutions that have medical expertise and the physical facilities to rehabilitate animals. 
Network members are required to collect certain basic biological data including species name,
sex, length, location, and any evidence of human interaction.  In addition, they are encouraged
to collect other data and tissues for use in scientific research and for educational purposes.


<P>In
 1995, Network members reported 898 cetacean strandings and 1973 pinniped strandings. 
Table E-1 in Appendix E provides detailed information on strandings by species and Region. 
The total number of reported strandings was the lowest of any year since 1990.  Among the
interesting trends is a continuing increase in the number of arctic seals stranding in the
Northeast Region.  As Table E-1 shows, the numbers of harbor seal strandings have remained
relatively constant, but the number of arctic seals--particularly harp seals has risen markedly. 
This increase may reflect an expansion of range for some seal species previously seen only
occasionally in U.S. waters.


<P>As
 part of the effort to generate data on mortalities caused by human interactions, NMFS has
emphasized the importance of checking for human interactions on stranded animals.  Human
interactions include such things as entanglements, animals shot, and animals struck by vessels. 
In 1995, Stranding Network members reported 78 stranded cetaceans with human interactions
and 136 stranded pinnipeds with human interactions.  As part of the effort to enhance the
capabilities of Stranding Network members to detect human interactions, NMFS has
contracted for a detailed manual of human interactions.


<P><STRONG>Regional Stranding Networks</STRONG>

<P><EM>Northeast Region Stranding Network</EM>

<P>In 1995, 144 cetacean and 271 pinniped strandings were reported in the Northeast Region.  In
addition to the pinniped data presented in <A HREF="#Box 8">Box 8</A> and Appendix  E, the most commonly stranded cetacean species in 1995 were harbor porpoise (66) and bottlenose dolphins (38).  Of the harbor porpoise strandings, 8 involved confirmed human interactions; and of the
bottlenose dolphin strandings, 12 involved human interactions.

<P><EM>Southeast Region Stranding Network</EM>

<P>There are 30 institutions currently operating in cooperation with the Southeast Stranding
Network under a Letter of Authorization from the Region.  In addition, there are numerous
state and federal government agencies or organizations
 participating in the collection of
stranding information.  Over 250 individuals from these groups contribute to the network's
efforts.

<P>In
 1995, there were 568 documented marine mammal strandings.  Bottlenose dolphins
comprised 80 percent of the total and 20 species comprised the remainder including 5 harbor
seals and 8 harbor porpoises.  A total of 51 marine mammals stranded live in the Southeast
during 1995.  Nineteen of these animals were taken to rehabilitation facilities and 12 were
released to the wild.  


<P>A mass stranding of <EM>Stenella clymene</EM>, a total of 17 animals with 13 alive, occurred on June 15 in Tarpon Springs, FL.   Of the thirteen live animals, seven were taken to a local
rehabilitation facility.  The six left at the site were stabilized by stranding network members.  One of the six dolphins died within hours, but the remaining five had normal hematology results and were tagged and released offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.  The six animals taken to the rehabilitation facility died within a few days despite medical treatment.

<P>On August 6, 1995 a mass stranding of 14 short-finned pilot whales (<EM>Globicephala
macrorhynchus</EM>) occurred on the Gulf side of the Florida Keys.  Four of the 14 animals were
alive and transported to a rehabilitation facility in the Keys.  An adult female and a juvenile
male survived.  The female had titers for cetacean morbillivirus, but PCR testing determined
the virus was not active.  Marine mammal veterinarians considered the two whales healthy
and releaseable.  After consultation with the Unusual Mortality Working Group, NMFS
deemed both pilot whales releasable and both were tagged and released offshore on October
13, 1995.

<P>Texas had a total of six single live strandings, four <EM>Tursiops truncatus</EM>, one <EM>Stenella frontalis</EM>, and one <EM>Stenella attenuata</EM> during 1995.  All six were taken to rehabilitation facilities.  One <EM>Tursiops</EM> and the <EM>Stenella attenuata</EM> died, one <EM>Tursiops</EM> calf was deemed unreleaseable, and the remaining three dolphins were tagged with satellite transmitters and released.


<P><EM>Southwest Region Stranding Network</EM>

<P>A total of 110 cetacean strandings and 1557 pinniped strandings were reported to the
Southwest Region in 1995.  The most commonly reported pinnipeds were California sea lions
(791), harbor seals (327), and northern elephant seals (303).  Strandings of depleted,
threatened, or endangered pinniped species included seven Steller sea lions, eight northern fur
seals, two Guadalupe fur seals, and one Hawaiian monk seal.  The most commonly stranded
species of cetaceans were common dolphins, harbor porpoises, and gray whales with 35, 16,
and 13 reports respectively.  Other strandings of interest included five northern right whale dolphins, a right whale, and six humpback whales.

<P>The right whale stranding was that of a skull found found under a beach wall that had been
eroded by storms near Crescent City, California.  The beach wall had been originally
constructed in the 1960s.  It is believed that the whale originally stranded and was buried
prior to the construction of the beach wall.  A review of the scientific literature and historical stranding records has revealed that this stranding had not been previously documented.

<P><EM>Northwest Region Stranding Network</EM>

<P>The Northwest Region received reports of 18 stranded cetaceans  (1 minke whale, 1
humpback whale, 4 gray whales, 1 killer whale, 2 Dall's porpoise and 9 harbor porpoise) and
107 stranded pinnipeds  (2 elephant seals, 11 California sea lions, 70 harbor seals and 24
unidentified seals or sea lions) in 1995.  The most commonly stranded pinniped species was
harbor seal with 70 reported.  The most commonly stranded cetacean species was harbor
porpoise with nine reports.

<P><EM>Alaska Region Stranding Network</EM>

<P>In 1995, the Alaska Region Stranding Network investigated 19 cetacean strandings and 35
pinniped strandings.  Harbor seals were the most commonly reported with 26 reports from the
central and southeastern coasts.  Four of the reports involved live animals.  A gray whale
entangled with a buoy off Ketchikan was disentangled by helicopter.  A humpback whale
entangled with a buoy was reported from southeast Alaska.  An unidentified large whale was
seen alive on a beach in southeast Alaska.  Four harbor seal pups, including a male from
Dutch Harbor, a male from Kenai, a female from Cordova, and a female from Ketchikan,
were rehabilitated by the Alaska Region Stranding Network. 

<A NAME="Mortality Events"></A><H4>Unusual Mortality Events</H4>

<P>Section 304 of the MMHSRA establishes a Working Group on Unusual Marine Mammal
Mortality Events.  It includes individuals from a range of scientific disciplines including
veterinary medicine, pathology, epidemiology, toxicology, and marine mammal science.  The
Working Group is consulted when an unusual mortality event is suspected, determines
whether a mortality event is actually occurring and provides advice as to specific actions to
respond to an event.  During 1995, no unusual mortality events involving marine mammals
were observed in the United States.

<P>The MMHSRA also mandates the development of a national contingency plan for response to
unusual marine mammal mortality events.  The contingency plan must contain the following: 
(1) a list of people at local, regional, and national levels who can assist in responding to and assisting in determining the cause of an unusual mortality event; (2) a list of analyses that may be necessary to assist in diagnosis of causes; (3) mobilization and training procedures; and (4) provisions to minimize the deaths of marine mammals.  The contingency plan was completed in 1995, and will be published in 1996.

<A NAME="Monitoring"></A><H4>Monitoring</H4>

<P>The MMHSRP monitoring program consists of: 1) real time evaluation of specimens for
contaminants and health, 2) method development and validation, and 3) research on problem
characterization and  correlation of contaminants and health.  One main goal of the
monitoring component is to provide  baseline information on contaminant loads and diseases
in populations of marine mammals.  The effort is focussed on two main areas:  contaminant
monitoring and health monitoring.

<P><STRONG>Contaminant Monitoring</STRONG>

<P>The Environmental Conservation Division of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center
(NWFSC) is the lead NMFS laboratory in activities associated with the monitoring and
quality assurance components of the MMHSRP and collaborates with the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST)  in the archival of tissues. The primary purpose of the
National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank is archiving marine mammal samples for future
retrospective studies using these samples.

<P>In 1995, over 420 tissue samples (e.g., blubber, liver, kidney, brain, heart, muscle, melon,
mandible fat, blood, milk and stomach contents) from the following species were either
acquired or analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHs).  These include samples from 
bearded seal (<EM>Erignathus barbatus</EM>), beluga whale (<EM>Delphinapterus leucas</EM>), bottlenose dolphin (<EM>Tursiops truncatus</EM>), California sea lion (<EM>Zalophus californianus</EM>), Dall's porpoise (<EM>Phocoenoides dalli</EM>), gray whale (<EM>Eschrichtius robustus</EM>), harbor porpoise (<EM>Phocoena phocoena</EM>), killer whale (<EM>Orcinus orca</EM>), Northern fur seal (<EM>Callorhinus ursinus</EM>), pygmy sperm whale (<EM>Kogia breviceps</EM>), ringed seal (<EM>Phoca hispida</EM>), short- (<EM>Delphinus delphis</EM>) and long-beaked (<EM>Delphinus capensis</EM>) common dolphin, sperm whale (<EM>Physeter catodon</EM>), spotted dolphin (<EM>Stenella spp.</EM>), and Steller sea lion (<EM>Eumetopias jubatus</EM>).  These samples were collected for a variety of projects: 1) ongoing monitoring of contaminants in samples collected during subsistence hunts (e.g., bearded seal, ringed seal), 2) collection of tissues for the Tissue Bank (e.g., beluga whale), 3) analysis of tissues from cetacean and pinniped species that stranded (e.g., pygmy sperm whale), and 4) continued investigation of relationships between contaminant exposure and neoplasia in California sea lions that have neoplasia (i.e., metastatic transitional cell carcinoma) and those that died from trauma.

<P>As part of the monitoring component of the MMHSRP, blubber samples provided by the
SWFSC of short-beaked common dolphins incidentally caught in fishery interactions off the
northern and southern coasts of California and northern coast of Mexico were analyzed for
chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHs) and for the more toxic dioxin-like PCB congeners. In
addition, blubber samples from common dolphins that stranded along the California coast
were also analyzed, providing an preliminary assessment of CHs between stranded and an
apparently healthy (i.e., fishery interaction) sub- group of dolphins.  Initial results showed
possible regional differences in the body burden of CHs in dolphins caught in fishery
interactions; relatively high concentrations of certain organochlorine pesticides, particularly
p,p'-DDE, were found in blubber of dolphins from southern California and northern Mexico.
This study will be expanded with a larger subset of samples to confirm these apparent
regional differences and also to account  for selected life history parameters (i.e., sex, age). 
Additionally, the initial findings will be confirmed using comprehensive analyses of selected
samples. Comparison of concentrations of CHs between the stranded and fishery interaction
dolphins showed no marked differences in the level of bioaccumulation of PCBs or DDTs,
suggesting that there was no direct cause-and-effect connection with this specific stranding
event.  Overall, high concentrations of CHs were found in common dolphin that were
stranded or caught in fishery interactions. The role of significant body burden of PCBs and
DDTs in cetaceans potentially could be having a negative effect on key physiological
functions which may contribute to decreased health in the general dolphin population.  


<P>In collaboration with the Marine Mammal Center in Sausilito, California, blubber samples
from stranded California sea lions were analyzed to assess the relationship between
contaminant exposure and disease.  The highest prevalence of neoplasia in a pinniped
population to date was reported for California sea lions.  Previous studies have suggested that
exposure to chemical carcinogens is strongly associated with neoplasia in several other marine
species.  Exposure to CHs and aromatic compounds (ACs) was determined in a sub-group of
sea lions diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma, as well as in sea lions that had died from a
traumatic incident. The initial analyses showed that sea lions with metastatic carcinoma had
significantly higher (> 3-fold) mean concentrations of both PCBs and DDTs in blubber than
did sea lions that died from trauma. The increased concentrations of DDTs and PCBs in sea
lions exhibiting carcinoma were partially explained by disease, sex, and condition (as assessed
by blubber thickness).  Exposure to ACs, as measured by biliary fluorescent aromatic
compounds and hepatic DNA adducts, appeared to be minimal in both groups of sea lions. 
The etiology of this metastatic carcinoma in California sea lions cannot be determined from
the current findings.  However, the relatively high prevalence of the carcinoma in this
population, the induction of the carcinoma by chemical carcinogens in laboratory rodents, and
the apparent increased concentrations of CHs in diseased sea lions warrants further
investigation of a possible role of environmental contaminants in the induction or progression
of this neoplastic disease. Additional chemical analyses of sea lions with carcinoma are
currently underway to further investigate a possible causal relationship between high tissue
concentrations of CHs and the etiology of this common neoplasia.


<P>The condition of tissues (i.e., possible autolysis or degradation of tissues) collected for
chemical analysis, for both the Tissue Bank and monitoring purposes, may affect the quality
of data determined for certain contaminants. To address this issue, the relationships among
alterations in physical parameters of tissues from bottlenose dolphins and the measurements of
CHs and elements in tissues are being determined by repeated sampling of whole animals that
are allowed to naturally decompose over a period of time on a beach. The collection of tissue
samples is underway  along with monitoring and recording the environmental conditions and
physical parameters of the status of the carcasses. Blubber and liver samples will be analyzed
for CHs and the dry weights of the tissues will be determined; liver samples will also be
analyzed for selected elements. 


<P>In 1995, approximately 200 samples from 9 different marine mammal species were analyzed
for toxic and essential elements.  Liver tissues from 20 bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus)
from the Chukchi sea were analyzed and resulted in expanding our database on these animals. 
Similar to our previous results for pilot whales (Globicephala melaena) and bottlenose
dolphins, the concentrations of mercury and selenium in the livers of bowhead whales were
strongly correlated.  However, the concentrations of these elements were much lower in the
bowhead whales.  The concentration of hepatic cadmium in bowhead whales was relatively
high and comparable to our previous results for pilot whales.  Bowhead whales feed at lower
trophic levels and, thus, would be expected to contain relatively lower concentrations of
cadmium.  These elevated cadmium concentrations warrant further investigation, since they
approach the levels reported by other investigators in northern fur seals from the Pribilof
Islands and in walrus from the Bering and Chukchi seas.


<P>To advance the ability to assess the impact of contaminants on marine mammals,
development of new analytical methodologies is essential. For example, PCBs and DDT are
slowly metabolized and certain methyl sulfone metabolites that have been linked with toxicity
can bioaccumulate in mammals.  Potentially, the methyl sulfones could represent an important
class of toxic CHs in tissues of marine mammals.  Relatively little is known about the
presence and effects of these compounds in a wide range of marine mammals, in part,
because of the complex and time-consuming analytical techniques currently used. In 1995,
NWFSC initiated method development for determining methyl sulfones in marine mammal
tissues.  To date, the measurement of selected methyl sulfone metabolites in marine mammal
tissues by GC/mass spectrometry (MS) is being evaluated. Additionally, the NWFSC also
initiated projects to improve our current analytical method of measuring dioxin-like PCB
congeners in tissues of marine mammals. Certain CHs, such as the dioxins and dioxin-like
PCBs, are among the most toxic and environmentally persistent contaminants. Recent results
suggest that these dioxin-like PCBs may be the major contributors to dioxin-like toxicity in
marine biota.  In 1995, substantial progress was made in increasing the sensitivity of our
rapid technique for measuring selected CHs, particularly the highly toxic dioxin-like PCBs,
through use of a dialysis technique to replace our standard cleanup using silica-based column
chromatography. Initial results indicate that dialysis provides a simple and effective means of
removing much of the interfering lipid components from the analytes of interest in the
analysis of blubber tissue for CHs. 


<P>Aromatic compounds are also widely distributed in the marine environment, especially in
urban embayments, and have been associated with carcinogenesis in mammals and marine
species.  Unlike the slow metabolism of methyl sulfones, ACs are rapidly metabolized and do
not bioaccumulate in tissues of vertebrate species.  Many ACs, however, can exert their
toxicity by reacting with cellular macromolecules, such as DNA during metabolism.  This
interaction with cellular macromolecules is believed to be a critical step in inducing several
toxic responses.  NWFSC has developed a method to measure AC-DNA adducts in tissues of
marine mammals.  This method is routinely used to analyze selected liver samples collected
for monitoring and the Tissue Bank and, in 1995, a number of samples of marine mammals
were analyzed for levels of DNA adducts.


<P>Monitoring studies to assess contaminant exposure with biopsy tissue samples will increase
the current database on levels of chemical contaminants in apparently healthy animals for
comparison to those that stranded or died of disease.  Our screening method for measuring
PCBs in biological tissues has now been proven effective for analyzing the small tissue sizes
acquired through biopsy monitoring studies with marine mammals.  In 1995, analyses for CHs
in blubber biopsy samples from free-ranging gray whales along the coast of California and
killer whales resident to Alaska were completed.  For example, the mean concentrations of
PCB congener 153 and the sum of DDTs in the biopsy samples from the killer whales were
approximately 840 and 5,800 ng/g wet weight, respectively.  As a means of comparison to
other cetaceans where there were data in our marine mammal database, the mean
concentrations of PCB congener 153 and the sum of DDTs in blubber samples from gray
whales that stranded in Alaska were 40 and 170 ng/g wet weight, respectively, 41 and 170
ng/g wet weight, respectively, in bowhead whales from Alaska, and 1,600 and 7,000 ng/g wet
weight, respectively, in pilot whales that stranded on the east coast of the US.

<P><STRONG>Health Monitoring</STRONG>

<P>In 1995, NMFS and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology signed a memorandum of
agreement to study the diseases of marine mammals using stranded and incidentally caught
animals.  Additional pathology support was contracted through the Southeast Region with the
University of Miami.   Examinations included histopathology and PCR evaluations of tissues
for morbillivirus.  AFIP examined tissues from 149 animals including 35 pinnipeds and 114
cetaceans.  Blocks and tissues are archived for future examinations.

<P>Serology testing for disease was contracted through the University of Miami and USDA,
National Veterinary Services Laboratory.  Blood tests on two common dolphins that stranded
live in California showed antibodies to morbillivirus.  Morbillivirus was implicated in
cetacean mortality events in the Mediterranean, off of the Atlantic coast, and in the Gulf of
Mexico.  This is the first report of this pathogen from any cetacean species in the Pacific
Ocean.

<P>Blood tests on a free ranging population of harbor seals in southern Puget Sound showed
positive antibody titers to Brucella sp.  Twelve of 62 animals tested positive for antibodies
using three different techniques.   No clinical symptoms were observed in animals with
positive antibodies to the disease.  This finding is of concern because various species of Brucella can cause spontaneous abortion in domestic livestock and Malta fever in humans. 
Blood samples were sent to the Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services
Laboratories to see if the pathogen could be isolated and identified as to species.  The effort
was unsuccesful.  Additional tests will be conducted to determine how common antibodies are
in northwest pinnipeds and to identify the particular species of Brucella.

<A NAME="Tissue Bank"></A><H4>National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank</H4>

<P>In 1987, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) provided funds to NOAA, OAD to
establish and conduct the Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Program (AMMTAP) for
the collection and long-term storage of tissues from Alaska marine mammals for future
chemical analyses.  In 1994, the administration of AMMTAP was transferred from MMS to
the U.S. National Biological Service (NBS) and the project continues to be conducted as a
part of  the MMHSRP National Marine Mammal Tissue bank involving the collaboration of
NBS, NIST, NMFS and AFIP.  In addition to archiving the samples the NMMTB also
provides some real time analyses of the samples.  <A HREF="#Table 1">Table 1</A> shows the specimens contained in the NMMTB.  In addition, the table indicates which analyses have been performed on these samples.  The program also provides training for personnel.

<P><STRONG>Training</STRONG>

<P>Several organizations are collaborating to collect tissue samples from marine mammals. 
Workshops are held periodically to train individuals or to review and update protocols.  On
April 25, 1995, a workshop on sampling and sample handling procedures for the AMMTAP
and contaminant monitoring component of the MMHSRP was held at the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service Marine Mammal Laboratory, Anchorage, Alaska.  The workshop involved
laboratory demonstration of sample processing and handling procedures using beluga liver and
blubber collected the previous day from subsistence hunters in Cook Inlet.  The workshop
was conducted by personnel from NIST, NMFS- Western Alaska office, and NMFS-
Northwest Fishery Science Center, Seattle.    The workshop also addressed protocols for
sampling and archiving specimens from  walrus, polar bears, and sea otters.

<P><STRONG>Sample collections for 1995</STRONG>

<P>Sample collections for the AMMTAP were coordinated by the NMFS, Western Alaska Field
Office.  In collaboration with the Cook Inlet Marine Mammal Commission and local Alaska
native hunters, 10 beluga whales were sampled in Cook Inlet.  In collaboration with the North
Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management, 3 ringed seals were sampled in Barrow
Alaska.  Collections for subsistence taken walrus were provided by the USFWS, Anchorage,
Alaska.  These walrus samples were collected from the St. Lawrence Island harvest in the
northern Bering Sea.  Coordination of supplies and sample shipments were provided by
personnel from  NMFS, Western Alaska Field Office.  

<P><STRONG>Sample Analyses</STRONG>

<P>During 1995, analyses from 6 pinnipeds (4 ringed seals and 2 bearded seals) from Norton
Sound and from 13 Beluga whales from Cook Inlet were performed by NIST, Gaithersburg,
Md.   For the pinnipeds, only the total mercury analyses have been completed to date.  In
total, 115 samples have been analyzed for contaminants.  These include 47 for organics (CHs,
primarily blubber) and 68 for inorganics (trace elements (TE), mostly liver) from pilot whales
(2+11), harbor porpoise (2+6), white-sided dolphin (0+4), northern fur seals (8+6), ringed
seals (10+18), spotted seals (0+1), bearded seals (0+3), bowhead whales (0+3), and belugas
(25+16).  The following is a brief description of the results of the beluga analyses.

<P>Blubber samples from 13 belugas  (7 adult males, 5 adult females and 1 female fetus) were
analyzed for 32 PCB congeners and 9 pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, a-
hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex, heptachlor epoxide, trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, trans-
nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, dieldrin, DDT and DDT metabolites).   Subsamples of the same
tissues were also sent Dr. Derek Muir, DFO Canada, for additional analyses for chlordane,
toxaphene, and other pesticides.

<P>The concentrations of PCBs and pesticides that are being measured in the blubber of the belugas from Cook Inlet are basically the same as what have been found in the animals
sampled at point Hope and somewhat lower than what has been measured in the animals from
Point Lay.  However, the animals sampled for Point Hope were younger than those from
Point Lay and all of them have been females.  PCBs and chlorinated pesticides tend to
accumulate with age and females typically have lower levels than males.  In order to provide
an adequate comparison of the Cook Inlet animals with other populations of belugas, ages of
the animals have to be determined.  The teeth from these animals are currently being
evaluated by personnel at the NMFS, Western Alaska Field Office, Anchorage.  In addition,
the histopathology of the kidney and livers of these animals is currently being evaluated by
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.

<P>Liver samples from 6 animals (3 adult males, 2 adult females, and 1 female fetus) were
analyzed for methyl mercury by NIST.  Other analyses for total mercury, cadmium, and other
metals are currently underway.

<P>As is the case for PCBs and chlorinated pesticides, methyl mercury tends to accumulate with
age in liver tissue.  Marine mammals have the ability to demethylate mercury to less toxic
forms and store these in the liver.  This ability appears not to be present to a great extent in young animals, therefore the percentage and actual methyl mercury levels in young animals
are higher relative to the overall concentrations of mercury.

<P>Methyl mercury concentrations in the liver tissue of the adult Cook Inlet belugas ranged from 0.34 to 2.11 ppm wet weight, which is comparable to the levels determined for the belugas
from Point Lay and Point Hope (0.37 - 2.01 ppm).  The concentration of methyl mercury in
the beluga fetus was 0.09 ppm.  Total mercury concentrations are pending.

<P><STRONG>Workshop on Environmental Monitoring of Subsistence Species in Alaska </STRONG>

<P>Personnel from NMFS, NIST, and NBS participated in  workshops sponsored by the Alaska
Department of Health and social Services.  The DHSS is gathering published and unpublished
contaminant data on subsistence food resources and is developing a human health risk
assessment program to address the issue of potential effects to human consumers of
anthropogenic contaminants in fish and wildlife.  The MMHSRP is providing data on the
contaminant loads of marine mammal tissues to the DHSS for human risk assessments.

<A NAME="Quality Assurance"></A><H4>Quality Assurance</H4>

<P>The Office of Protected Resources initiated the quality assurance program (QA) in 1992 in
response to a legislative mandate to improve the quality and comparability of chemical
contaminant data on marine mammals.  The QA program is coordinated by NIST with the
NWFSC as the designated lead NMFS laboratory.  The goal is to assess the accuracy,
precision, level of detection and comparability of results among laboratories analyzing marine
mammal tissues.  The program has been developed as a performance-based evaluation system. 
In addition to the laboratory intercomparisons, NIST is also developing Standard Reference
Materials (SRMs) for marine mammal tissues.  These SRMs can be used for calibration of
instrumentation or as controls and are certified to contain specific amounts of contaminants
such as chlorinated hydrocarbons  (pesticides, PCBs, dioxins and others) and trace elements
(elements such as lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc and others).  To date a blubber standard
reference material (SRM-1945) has been developed, certified for 27 PCB congeners and 15
chlorinated pesticides, and is available for use.  This SRM -1945 can be ordered from NIST,
Gaithersburg, Md.  Approximately 20 samples were distributed in 1995.  Development and
certification of a liver standard reference material will begin in 1996.

<P>In 1995, NWFSC and NIST began a collaborative effort to improve the comparability of
results of concentrations of CHs in tissues of marine mammals.  In the 1994 Marine Mammal
Intercomparison Exercise, differences in CH results done by both laboratories were observed
in two of the six samples analyzed. The  analyses of blubber samples are particularly complex
due to their high lipid content. The NWFSC re-analyzed the original sample extracts by an
additional instrumental method and found that the differences in the results were not due to
interfering lipid compounds. Consequently, the blubber samples which contained extremely
high concentrations of CHs were re-analyzed by both laboratories. Preliminary results showed
that comparison of the re-analyzed samples improved considerably but some differences
remained. These differences could be attributed to variation in each laboratory's methods for
instrument calibration, suggesting the importance of using a standard protocol for calibration
of analytical equipment in inter-laboratory exercises.

<P>The Department of Commerce furthers the protection and conservation of marine mammals through participation in existing international agreements, and, when necessary, negotiation of new agreements.  This chapter describes NMFS involvement in international programs and activities during 1995.

<A NAME="CCAMLR"></A><H4>The  Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</H4>

<P>The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and
its Scientific Committee were established in 1982.  The Commission meets annually to
consider issues related to Antarctic marine living resources.  The Scientific Committee
reviews the status of marine mammal populations, and, as necessary, makes recommendations
to the Commission.  The Commission also reviews annual reports by member nations
concerning population assessments and steps taken to avoid incidental mortality of Antarctic
marine living resources.

<P>The Commission held its Fourteenth Annual Meeting in 1995 and reported and/or took the
actions described in the sections which follow.

<P><STRONG>Antarctic Pack Ice Seal Program  </STRONG>

<P>Recognizing the need for a better understanding of the Antarctic pack ice seals and the role
that they play in the Antarctic marine ecosystems, the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal Program (APIS) was initiated in 1990.  Under the guidance of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists on Seals, this five-year program is intended to provide an intellectual and logistic focus for pinniped researchers in the Antarctic pack ice zone.  By
encouraging scientists from various national programs to share logistic resources, to
collaborate on multi-disciplinary projects, and to identify and utilize centers of specialized
analytical expertise, the APIS Program seeks to build a cooperative, multi-national science
effort that is not only efficient and cost-effective, but when taken as a whole, will produce
scientific opportunities and results that are far greater than the sum of its parts.  

<P>A planning meeting for the APIS program, partially funded by CCAMLR this year, was held
at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center s National Marine Mammal Laboratory, June 7-9.
1995.  With the broad aspects of science and logistics having been addressed in previous
meetings, this planning meeting was convened to further the process of coordinating the
operational details of the program, and to ensure the commencement of the program s first
field season during the 1995/1996 austral summer.


<P>A wide variety of research is being planned for the Antarctic pack ice seals (crabeater 
seal,leopard seal, Ross seal and Weddell seals).  The Chairman of the Scientific Committee
(CCAMLR) will write to the Convener of the SCAR Group of Specialists on Seals requesting
that the group consider the collection and analysis of data relevant to the aims of CCAMLR
and its Ecosystem Monitoring Program CEMP, in particular.   Proposed research on crabeater
seals, a CEMP species selected for  monitoring, will address topics of direct relevance to
CCAMLR.  The CCAMLR Chairman will also write to SCAR and to the Scientific
Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to request reports on the status of
Antarctic seals and whales, respectively, for review at the 1996 meeting of the Scientific
Committee.  

<P>APIS intends to produce recommended standard methods for crabeater seal research.  The
Chairman of the Scientific Committee will write to the Convener of the Scientific Committee
on Antarctic Science (SCAR) Group of Specialists on Seals requesting that the group consider
the collection and analysis of data relevant to the aims of CCAMLR and the CEMP program
in particular.  The Scientific Committee will continue close liaison with SCAR in planning
and implementing the APIS Program. 


<P><STRONG>Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM)</STRONG>

<P>The Commission congratulated the Scientific Committee on the considerable progress it made
on monitoring methods and data acquisition for the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring
Program (CEMP) and endorsed its data requirements.  It also endorsed the Committee's
decision to establish a subgroup on the further development of monitoring methods and a
subgroup on statistics in order to be able to cope with the increasing workload relating to the
development of new methods and the potential revision of all methods, and to improve
analysis, interpretation and presentation of CEMP indices.  Text for new CEMP methods 
on Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) will be provided to members of the CCAMLR
Scientific Committee intercessionally for comment.  

<P>The U.S. shore-based operations at the Seal Island CEMP site will be discontinued because
the location of the field station has been considered unsafe due to geologic instability. 
Research on Antarctic fur seals has been conducted by the U.S. at this site in each of the past
10 years.  A new site is being sought in the Antarctic Peninsula so that the land-based work
can continue.  

<P>Data have been submitted for the CEMP database by Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States from CEMP sites.  The United States informed
WG-EMM of long-term data from Anvers Island and Admiralty Bay, King George Island.  

<P><STRONG>Assessment and Avoidance of Mortality Incidental to Fishery Operations</STRONG>

<P>Reports on the assessment and avoidance of incidental mortality in the Convention Area for
the 1994/95 season were received from seven Member countries, including the United States. 
Separate reports on surveys of beached marine debris were received from two members.  The
Commission noted with concern that current survey data do not suggest any reduction in the
amount of marine debris in the Convention Area and do indicate that fishing vessels are
probably still an important source of this type of pollution.  Members were reminded of the
importance of complying with ANNEX V of MARPOL 73/78 in the prevention of pollution
by garbage from ships.  The Commission reminded Members that, consistent with a
CCAMLR conservation measure, the use on fishing vessels of plastic packaging bands to
secure bait boxes will be prohibited after the 1995/96 season.

<P>The Commission noted that reports by the United Kingdom on entanglement indicate a trend
to continuing reduction in the entanglement of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia. 
However, the coincidence of the higher entanglement rates with the start of local longline
fisheries also indicated that fishing vessels need to exercise greater care in disposal of waste at sea.

<P>The Scientific Committee reaffirmed its recommendation that, whenever possible, two
scientific observers should be used to collect data on incidental mortality necessary for
appropriate assessments by CCAMLR.  The Scientific Committee endorsed the need for
further intercessional analysis of data on interactions with marine 
mammals.

<P><STRONG>Cooperation with the International Whaling Commission</STRONG>

<P>CCAMLR is involved in a number of current and planned projects with the IWC.  These
include scientific participation in a steering group meeting on research related to the
conservation of large baleen whales in the Southern Ocean; a symposium and workshop on
the effects of climate change on cetaceans to be held in March 1996; and CCAMLR's request
for information on interactions between cetaceans and fisheries, and for updated estimates of
whale stock sizes.  A four-week cruise for blue whales will take place off Australia, between
Fremantle and Hobart and down to 45øS, in December/January 1995/96, supported jointly by
IWC and Japan.  The major aim is to provide scientifically-based criteria for distinguishing
"true" from "pygmy" blue whales in the field, to allow more accurate estimates of "true" blue
whale numbers on future surveys.  Passive acoustics, photo-identification, 
photogrammetry and tissue biopsy will be employed.  Secondary target species will be the southern right whales and humpback whales.

<A NAME="Driftnet Fishing"></A><H4>Large-Scale High Seas Driftnet Fishing</H4>

<P><STRONG>Current Status of the United Nations Driftnet Moratorium, UNGA Resolution 46/215</STRONG>

<P>As of December 31, 1995, the United Nations (UN) global moratorium on large-scale high
seas driftnet fishing, pursuant to UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 46/215, has been
in effect for three years.  International implementation of the moratorium in the world's
oceans and enclosed and semi-enclosed seas has been generally successful.  

<P><EM>North Pacific Ocean</EM>

<P>No unauthorized driftnet fishing activities in the North Pacific Ocean by vessels of Japan,
Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, or the People's Republic of China (PRC) were detected by the
United States, or reported by the fisheries enforcement authorities of those countries, in 1995. 

<P>Japan's 1995 driftnet fishery enforcement efforts consisted of the deployment in the North
Pacific Ocean of one dedicated patrol vessel for a total of 47 ship days at sea from May
through July 1995.  

<P>Taiwan's 5-year vessel buy-back program ended in June 1995.  The purpose of the program
was twofold: (1) to eliminate Taiwan's high seas driftnet fishing fleet in compliance with the
UN driftnet moratorium and (2) to upgrade Taiwan's fishing fleet by scrapping older vessels. 
Over the duration of the program, the Kaohsiung Fisheries Administration spent
approximately $37 million to purchase and dispose of 635 fishing vessels.  These vessels
were either destroyed or sunk to create artificial reefs.  NMFS has no specific information on
how many of the 635 vessels were high seas driftnet vessels.

<P><EM>North Atlantic Ocean</EM>

<P>The United States did not detect, or receive any reports of, large-scale high seas driftnet
fishing in the North Atlantic Ocean in violation of the UN driftnet moratorium in 1995.  The
European Union (EU) played a stronger role in monitoring compliance with the driftnet
moratorium.  The EU Fisheries Commission's 1995 driftnet enforcement plans included the
chartering of a vessel to support France's enforcement of EU driftnet regulations in the Bay of
Biscay albacore tuna fishery beginning in June 1995.  The vessel was then scheduled to move
to the Mediterranean Sea to monitor Italian enforcement of the summer swordfish driftnet
fishery.  

<P>A number of confrontations occurred between French and Spanish fishermen in the Northeast
Atlantic albacore tuna fishery in 1994, when Spanish fishermen tried to seize French driftnets
they claimed were longer than the 2.5 kilometers allowed under EU regulations.  Increased
enforcement efforts by the French Government directed at its driftnet fleet eventually resolved
the dispute.  To prevent a recurrence of the 1994 Bay of Biscay conflict in 1995, France
instituted a program to inspect 100 percent of the French tuna driftnet fleet upon departure
from and return to port, to verify driftnet lengths.  In addition, vessels were no longer allowed to carry backup driftnets, i.e., only one net per vessel was permitted. 

<P><EM>Mediterranean Sea</EM>

<P>On May 3, 1995, a suit was filed against the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of
State in the U.S. Court of International Trade, under the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries
Enforcement Act, 16 U.S.C. 1826a-1826c.  Plaintiffs are the Humane Society of the United
States, the Humane Society International, Defenders of Wildlife, the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, and Earth
Island Institute.  Plaintiffs seek an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to identify Italy as a country whose nationals or vessels are conducting large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas, as a result of reports of Italian fishing vessels employing large-scale driftnets in the Mediterranean swordfish fishery in violation of the 1995 United Nations driftnet moratorium. As of December 31, 1995, the Court had not ruled on the case.  For further information on this case, see the discussion of Humane Society of the United States v. Brown in <A HREF ="chap12.html">chapter XII</A> of this report.

<P><STRONG>United States Driftnet Actions</STRONG>

<P><EM>1995 Driftnet Enforcement Efforts</EM>

<P>To monitor compliance with the driftnet moratorium in 1995, NMFS, U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian Maritime Forces continued to carry out surveillance activities in the North Pacific areas that in the past were routinely fished by driftnet vessels.  U.S. Coast Guard cutters
logged 93 vessel days at sea and Coast Guard aircraft flew 294 hours of surveillance patrols
in the 1995 driftnet monitoring program.  An additional 212 cutter days were available for
response to specific information.  Canadian Pacific Maritime Forces aircraft contributed 6
one-week patrols to the effort.  A NMFS Special Agent accompanied each of these flights.

<P>All Coast Guard operations were planned and executed in cooperation with enforcement
officials of Japan, Canada, and Russia.  In addition, direct lines of communication have been
established between the Coast Guard and the Russian Border Guard to facilitate sharing of
sighting information.

<P>In June 1995, a Canadian Forces CP-140 aircraft on surveillance patrol observed one
suspected high-seas driftnet vessel in transit in the North Pacific.  The vessel's nationality was concealed and it was not flying a flag.  However, driftnet retrieval equipment was visible on the afterdeck.  In July 1995, a second suspected high seas driftnet vessel was sighted by a
Canadian forces aircraft.  This vessel had also concealed all traces of its identity.  Both
vessels were photographed and the position, course and speed of each recorded.  Flights and
surface patrols on subsequent days failed to relocate the vessels.

<P>On July 10, 1995, in response to information received from U.S. albacore fishermen operating
northwest of Midway Island, U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft located and filmed a high seas
driftnet vessel with nets deployed.  The vessel was subsequently tracked by Coast Guard
aircraft while a Coast Guard high endurance cutter was vectored to intercept.  Following a 5-
day chase, in which the vessel refused various Coast Guard signals and actions to stop, Coast
Guard crews successfully fouled the fishing vessel's propeller with line.  The Coast Guard on
July 20, 1995, boarded, seized, and began towing the vessel to Guam where it was turned
over to NMFS Enforcement officials for investigation and prosecution under the Federal
judicial system.  Coast Guard operations in this case were supported by U.S. Navy aircraft
and a Navy oiler.  The seizure resulted in the vessel master, a Taiwan citizen, being charged
under the Magnuson Act for refusing to allow authorized officers to board his vessel for
inspection.  On September 22, 1995, he was sentenced to six months in jail and received an
$8,000 fine.  In addition, forfeiture action is pending against the vessel.

<P>Because the vessel master, first mate, and engineer of the stateless vessel were Taiwan
nationals, Taiwan fisheries authorities and Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
have undertaken an interagency investigation of the incident.  Taiwan authorities have assured
the United States that they intend to prosecute the case in order to deter other potential
violators of Taiwan's ban on large-scale driftnet fishing.  As a first step, they revoked the
working licenses of the three officers on August 14, 1995.    

<P><EM>PRC Ship Rider Program</EM>

<P>During 1995, the PRC provided three fisheries officers to accompany U.S. Coast Guard
cutters during high-seas driftnet patrols in the North Pacific Ocean.  The first PRC ship rider
accompanied the cutter RUSH and the other two riders accompanied the cutter HAMILTON. 

<P><EM>Other Reports of Unauthorized Driftnet Fishing</EM>

<P>NMFS has continued to work with the Coast Guard and the Departments of Defense and
State to monitor the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea for unauthorized
high-seas driftnet fishing activity.  In fact, NMFS provided several briefings for U.S. Naval
commands in England, Italy, and Spain during 1995.  These commands deploy to the
Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic for patrol operations.  

<P><EM>Fisheries Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</EM>

<P>On October 11, 1993, the Secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, and Defense entered into
an MOU to more effectively enforce domestic laws and international agreements that
conserve and manage the living marine resources of the United States.  The MOU, required
under Section 202 of Public Law 102-582, the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act,
establishes a mechanism for the use of the surveillance capabilities of the Department of
Defense (DOD) for locating and identifying vessels violating U.S. marine conservation laws
and international agreements, including UNGA Resolution 46/215.  The MOU also sets
formal procedures for communicating vessel locations to the Secretary of Commerce and the
U.S. Coast Guard.  A copy of the MOU was attached to the 1993 Driftnet Report to the
Congress.

<P>The U.S. Coast Guard has used DOD surveillance information in previous years' high seas
driftnet patrol efforts and will continue to do so under the provisions of the MOU.  NMFS is
already working with the Department of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command, Undersea Warfare Programs Office, on a project to detect any possible large-scale
driftnet fishing vessels in the North Pacific Ocean using the Integrated Undersea Surveillance
System (IUSS).  A very successful test of IUSS assets in detecting and tracking driftnet
vessels was conducted in 1992.  Efforts continued through 1994 to refine the use of this
system into a primary surveillance tool regarding possible driftnet fishing activity in the North Pacific.  NMFS and the Coast Guard will continue to explore other possible uses of DOD
surveillance assets for the monitoring of driftnet fishing vessels and fishing activity.

<P><EM>UN Driftnet Reports</EM>

<P>Since December 1992, the United States has been instrumental in ensuring that
implementation of the high seas driftnet moratorium remains a priority of the UNGA.  It has
supported UNGA resolutions and decisions, including UNGA Resolution 50/25 adopted on
December 5, 1995, requesting that the UN Secretary-General submit to the General Assembly
annual reports on developments relevant to the implementation of the UN driftnet
moratorium.

<P>In order to execute the reporting requirements of UNGA Decision 49/436, i.e., the call for  all members of the international community, intergovernmental organizations, regional economic
integration organizations, and appropriate non-governmental organizations to provide the
Secretary-General with information relevant to the implementation of resolution 
46/215", the United States submitted to the Secretary-General in June 1995 a paper regarding U.S. views on large-scale pelagic high seas driftnet fishing and UNGA Resolution 46/215.  The paper describes in detail the actions taken individually and collectively by the United States to implement the UNGA global driftnet moratorium in 1995.  It was integrated into the
Secretary-General's report entitled "Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing and its impact on the living marine resources of the world's oceans and seas,"  A/50/553, October 12, 1995.

<A NAME="IWC"></A><H4>International Whaling Commission</H4>

<P><STRONG>Preparations for 1995 Annual Meeting</STRONG>

<P>A Working Group of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) met in 
Reine, Norway, January 9-13, to discuss a system of supervision and control of commercial whaling operations.  The new system, once complete, will be part of the Revised Management Scheme being developed to manage commercial whaling.  The meeting identified the key factors
which countries felt should be part of a system of supervision and control, but no progress
was made in resolving differences on these factors.  Most countries felt that there should be
an international observer on every vessel licensed to take whales, and that this program
should be paid for by the whalers as a cost of doing business.  These countries also sought increased IWC oversight of whaling operations, including the establishment of a panel to review observers' reports and other relevant material, the establishment of some form of DNA testing or real time reporting to the IWC by observers, etc.  Pro-whaling nations felt that the
current systems of national enforcement were sufficient and that the additional costs imposed
by the IWC should be borne by all member nations, especially those who demanded 
them.

<P><STRONG>1995 Annual Meeting</STRONG>

<P>The 47th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) took place in
Dublin, Ireland (8 May-20 May:   Scientific Committee Meeting; 29 May- 2 June: Commissioner s Meeting).  The most notable result was the failure of the Scientific Committee members to agree on a new abundance estimate for the  North Atlantic Minke whale, the stock which is currently the subject of Norway's commercial whale hunt.  An earlier abundance estimate from 1992 was considered invalid.  

<P>In response to the scientific ambiguity, the Commission passed a resolution calling for
Norway to halt its whaling activities immediately and to withdraw its legal objection to the
moratorium on commercial whaling.  In addition, the Commission agreed to hold two intersessional workshops to work on providing recommendations on a new estimate of abundance.  Norway offered to host an intersessional meeting of the Scientific Committee to ensure that an estimate of abundance would be approved prior to Norway's 1996 commercial hunt, which is scheduled to start before the 1996 Annual Meeting of the IWC.  

<P>On a related matter, the Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee would not use
population estimates in the implementation of the RMP unless the data were obtained in
accordance with the relevant guidelines, and called for IWC oversight by foreign nationals of
surveys conducted by contracting governments.

<P>Other significant events included:  
<UL>
<LI>the passage of a resolution calling for countries to improve mechanisms to prevent illegal trade in whale meat;
<LI>the passage of a resolution calling for contracting governments to refrain from issuing special permits for lethal research whaling in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary; and,
<LI>the decision to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling.
</UL>

<P>The Working Group on Supervision and Control met for a full day.  Little progress was
made, however, in resolving outstanding differences.

<P>During the Scientific Committee meeting, additional details were presented by scientists from Russia on the former Soviet Union's massive under-reporting of post World War II whale
catches in the Southern hemisphere.  Russia tried to delete all references to those data on the
basis that its government had never officially approved the data submission, and Russia
refused to accept the report of the Scientific Committee because it contained references to this situation. 

<P>France introduced a resolution to establish an agenda item addressing the effects of
environmental changes and threats upon Arctic whale stocks.  The Commission agreed to
refer this item to the Scientific Committee for advice and to consider it at next year's meeting.

<P>The Scientific Committee agreed to have an intensive review of Japan's lethal research
program in the Antarctic, a 16-year program of which eight years have been completed.  It
was determined that there should be an intersessional meeting on this subject.  The Scientific
Committee proposed that this meeting be held in FY 1995/96, but it was postponed one year
for financial reasons.

<P>The Commission reviewed its criteria for conducting lethal research on whales.  In 1986 and
1987, the Commission adopted recommended criteria for lethal whale research programs. 
This year, the Commission updated those criteria by adopting a resolution recommending that
scientific research to assist the comprehensive assessment of whale stocks should be done by
non-lethal means and that scientific research involving the killing of cetaceans should be
permitted only in exceptional circumstances.

<P>This year, the Commission again denied Japan's request for an  interim relief allocation  of 50 minke whales for four traditional whaling communities.  The majority of delegations
considered the request inconsistent with the moratorium on commercial whaling, as the sale
of meat would still be allowed in some guest houses.  The IWC did recognize that the
proposal submitted by Japan contained constructive management elements in accordance with
IWC regulations.

<P>The U.S. indicated that the Makah Indian Tribe of Washington State had expressed an interest
in taking up to five gray whales for ceremonial and subsistence purposes and that it may wish
to submit a formal proposal at a future date.

<P>Russia stated that they would request a quota for five bowhead whales in 1996 for subsistence purposes, indicating that they would be willing to reduce their gray whale quota by five animals accordingly.

<P><STRONG>Workshop on Whale Killing Methods</STRONG>

<P>A Workshop on Whale Killing Methods met from 23-25 May 1995.  The Alaska Eskimo
Whaling Commission (AEWC) presented information on its weapons improvement program
and offered data on the U.S. bowhead whale hunt.  This information was welcomed and
commended by the Workshop.

<P>The main focus of the Workshop was on the electric lance, used by Japan as a method to kill
whales that are not killed instantaneously when harpooned.  The Workshop noted that
alternative secondary killing methods are available, such as using a second harpoon or a rifle,
but no conclusion was reached regarding what the best alternative is.  Japan informed the
Workshop that the use of a rifle to kill whales was contrary to its domestic laws.  
IWC agreed to consider banning the electric lance next year and urged Japan to suspend the use of the electric lance as a method for killing whales in the meantime.

<P><STRONG>Events Since the IWC Annual Meeting</STRONG>

<P>Norway issued itself a quota of 232 minke whales for commercial 
purposes; 215 whales were taken.  Norway also completed an extensive scientific survey of minke whales in the northeastern North Atlantic this summer.  Several American scientists took part in this survey. 

<P>This summer, Japan took all 100 minke whales under its special permit for scientific whaling
in the North Pacific.  The research whaling fleet left Japan in early November for the
Antarctic, where it is expected to take up to 440 minke whales in 1996 for research purposes
in the southern ocean whale sanctuary.

<P>As a result of its continuing concern about the expansion of research whaling, the Commerce
Department certified Japan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of
1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978) on December 11, 
1995.

<P>The certification of the Secretary of Commerce was based on the issuance by the Government
of Japan of permits to its nationals allowing the killing of North Pacific minke whales for
research purposes and an expansion of the research whaling in the southern ocean whale
sanctuary. Secretary Brown conveyed his concerns not only over the whales that have been
killed in this program but also over the possibility of further expansion of lethal research,
particularly in the Southern Hemisphere which, since December 6, 1994, has been an IWC
whale sanctuary, an area intended to be free of whaling, the creation of which was strongly
supported by the United States.

<P>The AEWC struck a total of 57 bowhead whales out of a strike limit of 68.  Of those 
57 whales, 45 were landed.  This is an efficiency rate of 79 percent, a rate above the IWC target for this year.

<A NAME="US-Russia Project"></A><H4>U.S.-Russia Marine Mammal Project, 02.05-61, under Area V of the Environmental Protection Agreement</H4>

<P>The Marine Mammal Project, 02.05-61, is one of eight projects in Area V of the US-Russia
Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Protection.  The goal of this Project
is to conduct cooperative research on the biology, ecology and population dynamics of marine
mammal species shared by both countries, leading to the development of methods for the
rational management and protection of these animals.

<P>During 1995, a total of eleven exchanges involving 27 American and 29 Russian scientists
took place. Joint research activities began in April with a U.S. scientist traveling to the
Laptev, Kara and Barents Seas in the western Russian Arctic to work with colleagues on
capture and satellite tracking of polar bears to obtain data on movements, migrations, and
distribution patterns. That work included a workshop in Moscow with Russian and Norwegian
scientists to develop a cooperative program to determine radionuclide levels in polar bears
throughout their range. Polar bear studies continued in July 1995 with 2 Russian scientists
visiting Alaska to work on analyses of survey data and to prepare manuscripts for publication.

<P>Joint efforts continued in August 1995 with cetacean studies that  involved 3 NMFS scientists working with Russian colleagues on surveys and biological studies of bowhead and gray whales in the Sea of Okhotsk off  the east coast of northern Sakhalin Island. Also in August, 2 Russian scientists visited the U.S. to work on pinnipeds in Alaska. One scientist from KamchatNIRO (the Kamchatka Research Institute for Fisheries and Oceanography) spent 3
weeks on the Pribilof Islands working with NMFS scientists from NMML on population
studies of northern fur seals and to learn new radio tagging and tracking techniques. The
other scientist, from the Kamchatka Fisheries Inspection Service (KamchatRybVod)  worked
with NMML researchers on Alaska harbor seal biological studies designed to determine
appropriate correction factors for population assessments.

<P>In September 1995, three major conferences were held in Kamchatka. The first was the Fifth
Biennial Sea Otter Workshop that included 7 American and 16 Russian specialists reviewing
past work and planning future studies on sea otter biology and population dynamics. The
second conference included 12 American specialists meeting to review and agree on
principles for joint conservation and management of the Alaska-Chukotka polar bear
population, and to carry out preliminary planning for a joint agreement on management of the
Bering-Chukchi walrus population. The last conference was the 13th Meeting of the Marine
Mammal Project, and included 6 American specialists and over 20 Russian participants. Joint
and cooperative research activities conducted during the previous 20 months were reviewed,
and the group developed a comprehensive plan for research over the next two years. Proposed
activities include: 5 joint studies on gray, bowhead, and beluga whales; 9 studies on walrus
biology, harvest monitoring, data synthesis and analysis, and continuation of work toward a
joint agreement; 13 cooperative activities on sea otters, ranging from examination of past
harvest records to genetic analyses for stock determination to benthic community studies; and
12 proposed studies on pinnipeds, including 7 on harbor and ice dwelling seals involving
work on aerial survey methodology, foraging ecology, analyses of satellite tag data, and
reproductive ecology and behavior. Finally, there are also 6 proposed activities on  Steller sea lion biology and assessment to take place across almost the entire range of the species, from the Gulf of Alaska to the Kurile Islands and Kamchatka, and 2 studies on northern fur seals to take place on the Pribilof Islands.

<P>Additionally, in November a Russian Academy of Sciences researcher visited the U.S. to
work with American scientists to assess the effects of accumulated radiation doses on
long-lived mammals of the Russian Arctic, and in December another Russian scientist visited
Alaska to work on data analyses of spotted seals and develop a multi-agency cooperative
study on harbor seals in both Alaska and Kamchatka. Finally, a National Biological Service
(NBS) scientist visited Magadan, Russia to help plan and establish a Pacific Walrus
International Database with the Institute for Study of Biological Problems of the North.  

<A NAME="CITES"></A><H4>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)</H4>

<P>NMFS continues to be active in implementation of CITES for marine species.

<P><STRONG>Significant Trade Reviews</STRONG>

<P>International trade for commercial purposes is prohibited for species listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), except for countries
which have taken reservations under the treaty.  Species listed in Appendix II of CITES may
be traded, provided that the country of export has granted a permit for the shipment. 
Countries issuing permits must make a finding that the export will not be detrimental to the
survival of the species concerned, and that the specimens were legally obtained.  Issuance of
permits must be monitored and if necessary, limited, in order to maintain that species
throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs
and well above the level at which that species might become eligible for inclusion in Appendix 
I. 
  
<P>In order to determine whether such limitation is necessary, the Animals Committee of CITES
undertakes reviews of species for which there are significant amounts of international trade. 
Such a study was done this year, with input from range States, for narwhal (Monodon
monoceros).  The Animals Committee will make recommendations for the conservation of
this species during 1996.

<P><STRONG>Illegal Trade in Whale Meat</STRONG>

<P>At the Ninth meeting of the Conference of the CITES Parties, in November 1994, a resolution
was passed to address continuing illegal international trade in whales, in spite of their listing in Appendix I of the treaty.  The resolution recognizes the work of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) on the issue and urges CITES Parties to investigate illegal trade in whale meat and cooperate with the CITES Secretariat in the collection of this information.  It also encourages the sharing of information between the IWC and CITES on illegal trade and
directs the Secretariat to share with the IWC any information it collects regarding illegal trade in whale meat.  NMFS has met on several occasions with Japanese government officials to
facilitate exchange of information about ways to stop illegal trade in whales.

<P><STRONG>Withdrawal of Russian Reservations on Whale Species</STRONG>

<P>Under the CITES treaty, Contracting Parties may take reservations to any species listed under the Convention.  The taking of a reservation indicates the Parties intention of non-compliance with the treaty.  During 1995, the government of Russia announced the withdrawal of their reservations to species of great whales listed in Appendix I of the Convention.  The United States commended this step on behalf of worldwide whale conservation.

<P><STRONG>American Tunaboat Association v. Brown</STRONG>

<P>[67 F.3d 1404 (9th Cir. 1995), <U>aff'g</U> No. 94-0736 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 6, 1994) (mem. opinion and order granting partial summary judgment), <EM>dismissed by stipulation</EM> Nov. 6, 1995]  The American Tunaboat Association (ATA) sought to enjoin the enforcement of a notice of
closure issued by NMFS to ban purse seine tuna fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean
(ETP).  The district court denied the application for preliminary injunction and granted partial summary judgment in favor of NMFS.  ATA appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court decision.  The parties agreed to a joint stipulation
for dismissal.    

<P>On February 7, 1994, NMFS notified U.S. tuna fishing fleet members that all tuna fishing
involving the setting of purse seine nets on dolphins in the ETP was prohibited for the
remainder of the year because the fleet had reached the annual quota of dolphin mortalities
specified in section 306(a)(4) of the MMPA.  On February 25, 1994, ATA filed a complaint
in the District Court for Southern District of California seeking injunctive and declaratory
relief from the closure notice issued by NMFS.  Because of the existence of related litigation, <EM>Earth Island Institute v. Brown</EM>, No. C88-1380 (N.D. Cal.), the case was transferred to the Northern District of California.

<P>ATA claimed NMFS improperly determined that the U.S. tuna fleet in the ETP had reached
its allowable quota of dolphins killed for 1994 and that the closure of the fishery therefore
violated the MMPA.  NMFS based its determination on section 306(a)(4) of the MMPA,
which specifies that the U.S. fleet-caused dolphin mortality, for every year after 1992, may
not exceed the number of mortalities for the preceding year.  In addition, this section requires total dolphin mortalities occurring under the ATA general permit continue to decline each year by statistically significant amounts.  Observer records indicated that there were 115
dolphin mortalities caused by the U.S. fleet in 1993.  During January and the first week of
February 1994, NMFS received reports that an unusually high rate of dolphin mortality
already had occurred and that the fleet would reach and exceed the entire quota of 114
dolphins for 1994 by the end of the day on February 7, 1994. 

<P>The plaintiffs claimed that the correct quota was 800 dolphins for the period January 1, 1993, to February 28, 1994, under section 306(a)(1) of the MMPA, and that the phrase "each year
after 1992" used in section 306(a)(4) should be construed to mean any consecutive 12 month
period, not a calendar year.  Finally, ATA alleged that the form of the notice of closure was
improper because ATA was notified directly rather than by publication of a notice in the
Federal Register as specified in NMFS' regulations.  On April 15, 1994, the district court
denied ATA's motion for a temporary restraining order.  On July 6, 1994, the court granted
partial summary judgment to the government on the substantive issue of whether NMFS had
applied the correct quota in 1994, and denied ATA's motion for a preliminary injunction.

<P>ATA filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit alleging that district
court's decision to deny the preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion.  The circuit
court determined that the appeal was not moot and affirmed the district court's grant of
summary judgment, with Judge Rymer concurring in part and dissenting in part.  The circuit
court upheld NMFS' interpretation of the annual reduction provision and of the terms "year"
and "preceding year."  The court recognized that an agency's interpretation of a statute it
administers is entitled to deference, that Congress, in all likelihood, did not anticipate a
situation in which dolphin mortality in the first few weeks of 1994 threatened to outstrip the
number of dolphin mortalities in 1993, that Congress clearly did not intend for such a
situation to occur, and that NMFS' interpretation effectuated the underlying purposes of
section 306(a)(1) and (4)(A) of the MMPA.  The circuit court also agreed with the district
court's denial of ATA's application for a preliminary injunction, finding that ATA was likely
to prevail on the issue of proper notice, but that ATA failed to show the likelihood of
irreparable injury.  On October 31, 1995, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation for dismissal, and on November 6, 1995, the district court approved the stipulation and dismissed the case.

<P><STRONG>Strahan v. Linnon</STRONG>

<P>[No. 94-11128 (D. Mass. order issued May 2, 1995)]  In the past four years U.S. Coast Guard
vessels struck and killed two northern right whales.  On June 7, 1994, the plaintiff in this
case filed a complaint alleging that such takings of right whales were illegal and that the
Coast Guard violated the MMPA, the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act and the
Whaling Convention Act.  The complaint asserted that the Coast Guard violated the ESA by
failing to consult with NMFS and by failing to ensure that its actions were unlikely to
jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  The complaint also alleged that the
Coast Guard did not comply with the National Environmental Policy Act because it had not
prepared an environmental assessment on the effects of its operations.  The plaintiff claimed
that takings of right whales are illegal and sought to enjoin certain Coast Guard activities,
including the issuance of vessel documentation certificates.  In addition to other relief, Mr.
Strahan asked the court to order the Coast Guard to prohibit its own vessels and other vessels
from approaching within 500 yards of a northern right whale or within 100 yards of any other
species of whale.  

<P>The Coast Guard initiated consultation under section 7 of the ESA on the effects of its actions on endangered whales and sea turtles and reviewed vessel operating procedures to identify environmental problems and to implement measures that would avoid collisions with right whales and other marine species.  On February 10, 1995, the court held a hearing on this
case.  On May 2, 1995, the court issued its order on the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary
injunction.  As a preliminary matter, the court ruled that the plaintiff only had standing to
challenge Coast Guard activities in the First Coast Guard District, which includes the area
between Maine and New Jersey.  With respect to claims asserted under the ESA, the court
ruled that Coast Guard lacked discretion over vessel documentation and inspection activities
and thus, such actions were not subject to consultation requirements of the Act.  However,
with respect to the operation of Coast Guard vessels in the First District, the court found that such operations would not be in full compliance with the Act until the section 7 consultation was completed.  Nonetheless, the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction noting that the Coast Guard had taken steps to prevent its vessels from striking whales and that likelihood of such an occurrence was in dispute.   
     
<P>In terms of the MMPA claims, the court noted that a small take authorization is required for
activities that may result in the taking of a marine mammal and, on that basis, ordered the
Coast Guard to apply for such an authorization by May 31, 1995.  The court also found that
the Coast Guard had violated the National Environmental Policy Act and ordered the
preparation of a draft environmental assessment.  The court dismissed claims based upon
alleged violations of the Whaling Convention Act.

<P>On June 2, 1995, the Coast Guard applied to NMFS for a small take authorization.  At the
end of the year, NMFS was reviewing that application.  On September 15, 1995, NMFS
issued its biological opinion on Coast Guard activities along the Atlantic Coast.  The opinion
concluded that, given specified mitigation measures, such activities were not likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of threatened or endangered species.  On October 9, 1995,
a Coast Guard vessel struck another whale.  The species could not be identified with any
degree of certainty, but it was suspected of being a humpback whale.  Under the terms of the
biological opinion, reinitiation of consultation is required if any endangered whale is struck. 
NMFS continues to be engaged in discussions with the Coast Guard on this 
issue.

<A NAME="New"></A><H4>New Legal Actions</H4>

<P><STRONG>Strong v. U.S.</STRONG>

<P>[No. C-95-438 (S.D. Tex. complaint filed Aug. 29, 1995).]  The plaintiffs in this case
operated a tour boat engaged in the business of feeding dolphins.  In 1991, NMFS amended
the regulatory definition of the term "take" to include feeding or attempting to feed marine
mammals in the wild.  In prior litigation discussed in previous Annual Reports, the plaintiffs
challenged the regulatory definition.  The district court held that feeding bottlenose dolphins
in the wild did not constitute harassment and, therefore, was not a form of taking under
 the MMPA.  On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that feeding wild dolphins could disturb their normal behavior, and thus, was harassment under the Act, and
vacated the judgment of the district court.   <EM>Strong v. U.S.</EM>, 811 F. Supp. 246 (S.D. Tex. 1992), <EM>vacated per curiam</EM> 5 F.3d 904 (5th Cir. 1993).  

<P>The 1994 Amendments to the MMPA included a statutory definition of the term harassment.   This term is defined as any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that has the potential to injure or to disturb a marine mammal or a marine mammal stock in the wild by disrupting behavior patterns, including but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding or sheltering.  In this new litigation plaintiffs, Erv and Sonja Strong, claimed that the 1994 statutory definition superseded the regulatory definition.  The Strongs did not ask the court to hold that the feeding of dolphins was permitted under the MMPA, but rather they requested the court to grant declaratory relief in the form of a ruling that feeding
dolphins in the wild, per se, is not a violation of the Act.  Such a ruling would require the
agency to establish not merely that feeding in general could disrupt normal behavior, but in
the context of a specific enforcement action that feeding in that particular case caused
harassment.  The government filed a motion to dismiss the case on October 27, 1995.  The
government argued, first, that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment
because there was no pending enforcement action or other case or controversy appropriate for
judicial review.  Second, it was argued that the same issue was adjudicated in previous
litigation, <EM>Strong v. U.S.</EM>, 5 F.3d 904 (5th Cir. 1993), and the new statutory definition was consistent with that decision.  On November 21, 1995, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice.


<P><STRONG>Tepley v. NOAA</STRONG>

<P>[No. C-95-0844 (N.D. Cal. order issued Nov. 28, 1995).]  On May 10, 1992, Mr. Tepley and
a woman companion pursued and approached a pod of pilot whales in a small boat.  Mr. Tepley and his companion entered the water with the whales.  The companion began to touch and pet the whales while Mr. Tepley filmed the animals.  One of the whales nipped the woman and shortly thereafter grabbed her ankle in its mouth and dived to a depth of about forty feet.  About a minute later the whale brought the woman to the surface and released her. The woman was taken to a hospital and received stitches in her leg.

<P>On November 18, 1992, NOAA issued a notice of violation charging Mr. Tepley with the unlawful taking by harassment of one or more pilot whales through operations of a powerboat
and subsequent activities in the water.  After a hearing before an administrative law judge
(ALJ), Mr. Tepley was found guilty of harassing the whales.  The ALJ determined that
Tepley chased the whales and that it was primarily the chase that constituted a sustained and
serious disruption of normal marine activity.  The ALJ also found that Mr. Tepley's camera
may have emitted a sound that harassed the whales.

<P>On March 12, 1995, Mr. Tepley filed an action for judicial review of the agency's decision. 
Relying upon <EM>United States v. Hayashi</EM>, 22 F.3d 859 (9th Cir. 1993) <EM>superseding</EM> 5 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir. 1993), a case discussed in last year's Annual Report, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California concluded that the standard for harassment under the MMPA refers to a direct, serious disruption of a marine mammal's customary pursuits.  Using this standard the court concluded that the ALJ erred in finding that the actions of Mr. Tepley constituted harassment.  Unlike the ALJ, the court found that there was no substantial evidence that the whales were being chased or that their behavior was being disrupted under the Hayashi standard.   Likewise, the court found there was no substantial evidence that the operation of the camera or other underwater activities constituted harassment.  On November 28, 1995, the court granted Mr. Tepley's motion for summary judgment and set aside the agency's decision.

<P>After the events in this case, Congress amended the MMPA to include a statutory definition
of harassment.  The new statutory definition differs from the standard enunciated in <EM>Hayashi</EM> and applied in <EM>Tepley</EM>.  As noted above the definition refers to any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that has the potential to injure or to disturb a marine mammal or a marine mammal stock in the wild by disrupting behavior patterns, including but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding or sheltering.  Given the statutory change, the significance and impact of the <EM>Hayashi</EM> and <EM>Tepley</EM> cases are expected to be limited.

<P><STRONG>Humane Society of the United States v. Brown</STRONG>

<P>[No. 95-05-00631, U.S. Court of International Trade.]  On May 3, 1995, a suit was filed
against the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State in the U.S. Court of
International Trade, under the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, 16 U.S.C.
1826a-1826c.  Plaintiffs are the Humane Society of the United States, the Humane
Society International, Defenders of Wildlife, the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, and Earth Island
Institute.

<P>Plaintiffs sought an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to identify Italy as a
country whose nationals or vessels are conducting large-scale driftnet fishing on the high
seas.  Such an identification would require the State Department to initiate consultations
with Italy.  If those consultations were not satisfactorily concluded within 90 days, the
United States would be required to prohibit importation of fish, fish products, and sport
fishing equipment from Italy.

<P>On August 18, 1995, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction,
because plaintiffs had not made a showing of immediate and irreparable harm.  The
Court also dismissed one count of the complaint, which was based on the Secretary's
failure to identify Italy as a driftnetting nation on January 10, 1993 (the original
statutory deadline), because the statute of limitations had run.  The defendants' motion
for a protective order was denied, however; defendants have since responded to
numerous interrogatories and requests for production of documents.

<P>Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on October 6, 1995; defendants filed
their motion for judgment on the Agency record on October 31, 1995.  The Court heard
arguments on the suit on December 19, 1995, in New York City.  However, as of
December 31, 1995, the Court had not ruled on the case.

<H3>Harbor Seal (<EM>Phoca vitulina richardsi</EM>):  Southeast Alaska Stock</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Harbor seals inhabit coastal and estuarine waters off Baja California, north along the western coasts of the U.S., British Columbia, and Southeast Alaska, and west through the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, and in the Bering Sea north to Cape Newenham and the Pribilof Islands.  They haul out on rocks, reefs, beaches, and drifting glacial ice, and feed in marine, estuarine, and occasionally fresh waters.  Harbor seals generally are non-migratory, with local movements associated with such factors as tides, weather, season, food availability, and reproduction (Scheffer and Slipp 1944; Fisher 1952; Bigg 1969, 1981), although some long-distance movement (174 km) of tagged animals in Alaska has been recorded (Pitcher and McAllister 1981).  Strong fidelity of individuals for haul out sites also has
been recorded (Pitcher and Calkins 1979, Pitcher and McAllister 1981).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, natal dispersal characteristics unknown, breeding dispersal very limited, year-round site fidelity observed, seasonal movements greater than 300 km rare (Harvey 1987) except in western Alaska (Hoover-Miller 1994); (2) Population response data: substantial differences in population dynamics between Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea (Hoover-Miller 1994); (3) Phenotypic data: clinal variation in body size and color phase (Shaughnessy and Fay 1977, Kelly 1981); (4) Genotypic data: undetermined for Alaska, mitochondrial DNA analyses currently underway.  Based on this information, harbor seal stock structure is equivocal.  Preliminary mtDNA results show no evidence of geographical separation of populations; however, until additional samples are analyzed (projected for June 1995) preliminary conclusions regarding Alaskan harbor seal stock structure based on genetic analyses are premature (Westlake et al. unpubl. report).  Specifically, the small number of samples analyzed to date (31) does not provide sufficient statistical power to accept the conclusion of a single stock.  Therefore, based primarily on the  significant population decline of seals in the Gulf of Alaska versus the stable population in Southeast Alaska and the apparent stability of the population in the Bering Sea, three separate stocks are recognized in Alaskan waters: Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure were equivocal, and thus stock structure of harbor seals could not be defined.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The most recent aerial survey of harbor seals in Southeast Alaska was conducted during the autumn molt in 1993.  Eleven separate areas, with a mean of 39 (21-59) sites each, were surveyed 5-9 times each; the minimum number of surveys for each of the 427 sites was usually 4 or 5.  Ten of 11 areas were surveyed during the 3rd week of September; one area was surveyed from 31 August to 6 September.  Some of the survey effort was therefore after the molt peak, and if it is assumed that harbor seals decrease their amount of time hauled out after the molt, the counts from the 1993 surveys may have underestimated the number of seals.  All known harbor seal haul out sites in eacharea were surveyed, and reconnaissance surveys were flown prior to photographic surveys to establish the location of additional sites.  Aerial surveys were flown within 2 hours on either side of low tide, based on the assumption that at locations affected by tides, harbor seals haul out in greatest numbers at and around the time of low tide (Pitcher and Calkins 1979, Calambokidis et al. 1987).  Glacial haul-outs were flown as close to noon as possible because haul out behavior is thought to be mostly diurnal rather than affected by tide (Hoover 1988).

<P>The sum of all mean counts was 21,523 with a combined CV=0.026 (Loughlin 1994).  This method of estimating abundance and its CV assumes that during the survey period no migration occurs between sites and that there was no trend in the number of animals ashore. The number of seals moving between areas was assumed to be small considering each area's large geographic size, though a small number of seals may have been counted twice.  A correction factor to account for animals in the water is currently unavailable for this stock, but it is under investigation.  Thus, the correction factor developed for harbor seals in the state of Washington (1.61, CV=0.062) was utilized, resulting in a population estimate of 34,652 (21,523 x 1.61; CV=0.0673) for the Southeast Alaska stock of harbor seals.  This correction factor is based on the proportion of seals hauled during the pupping season, which in Alaska is higher than the proportion hauled during the molt.  Consequently, the correction factor is considered
conservative.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines  NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 34,652 and its associated CV of 0.0673, NMIN for this stock of harbor seals is 32,745.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Population trend data are available from 2 sites for the Southeast Alaska stock:  Sitka and Ketchikan.  When counts from 1993 were compared with those made in the 1980s, mean counts of harbor seals were lower, but were not significantly different at Sitka trend sites whereas counts decreased significantly at the Ketchikan sites (Loughlin 1994).  Prior to the 1993 surveys, Pitcher (1990) reported that harbor seal numbers in Southeast Alaska appeared
relatively stable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>Reliable rates of maximum net productivity have not been estimated for the Southeast Alaska stock of harbor seal.  Population growth rates of 6% and 8% were observed between 1991 and 1992 in Oregon and Washington, respectively.  Harbor seals have been protected in British Columbia since 1970, and the population has responded with an annual rate of increase of approximately 12.5% since 1973 (Olesiuk et al. 1990).  However, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0 (NMFS in prep.), as population levels have remained stable with a known human take (Pitcher 1990, J. Lewis unpubl. data, Alaska Dep. Fish and Game, 333 Raspberry Rd., Anchorage, AK 99518).  Thus, for this stock of harbor seals, PBR = (32,746 x 0.06 x 1.0), or 1,965 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers have not been assigned to fisheries in Southeast Alaska; thus, no mortalities of harbor seals incidental to commercial fisheries has been observed.  The only source of information on the number of harbor seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, included an annual mean of 8 injured and 6 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 32 injured and 28 mortalities due to legal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  These data are from the Southeast Alaska salmon drift gillnet and Yakutat salmon set gillnet fisheries.  Injuries and mortalities due to gear interaction were 2-3 times greater in the set gillnet fishery.  The majority (82%) of the injuries and mortalities from legal deterrence occurred in 1990.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 6, based entirely on logbook data because no observer data were available.  At present, annual mortality levels less than 196 animals per year (i.e., 10% of PBR) can be considered insignificant.  However, a reliable estimate of the mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is currently unavailable because of the absence of observer placements in the gillnet fisheries mentioned above.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the kill rate is insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The 1992 and 1993 subsistence harvest of harbor seals in Alaska was estimated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, under contract with the NMFS (Wolfe and Mishler 1993, Wolfe and Mishler 1994).  In both years, data were collected through systematic interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals in approximately 2,100 households in about 60 coastal communities within the geographic range of the harbor seal in Alaska; interviews were conducted in 18 communities in Southeast Alaska.  The subsistence take for the entire state of Alaska was similar for 1992 and 1993: total take, 2,867 (95% CI 2,317-3,677) and 2,729 (95% CI 2,513-3,464); struck and lost, 342 (11.9%) and 369 (13.5%).  In both years, the majority of the seals were taken in Southeast Alaska: 1,671 (58.3%) and 1,615 (59.2%), with a mean annual take of 1,643.  In 1992, the number of seals harvested (i.e., landed) from this stock was 1,481, while 190 were struck and lost.  In 1993, the number of seals harvested was 1,425, while 190 were struck and lost.   The age-specific kill of the harvest for this stock during 1992 and 1993 was approximately 81.3% adults, 7.8% juveniles, 0.7% pups, and 10.2% of unknown age; sex-specific kill was approximately 46.9% males, 21.0% females, and 32.1% of unknown sex.

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Illegal intentional killing of harbor seals by commercial fishers, sport fishers, and others may occur, but the magnitude of this mortality is unknown.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the annual rate of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries is unavailable.  Therefore, it is unknown if the estimated annual level of total human-caused mortality and serious injury exceeds the PBR (1,965) for this stock.  Until additional information on mortality incidental to commercial fisheries becomes available, the Southeast Alaska stock of harbor seals is not classified as strategic based on stable population levels recently observed.  This classification is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 14).

<H3>Harbor Seal (<EM>Phoca vitulina richardsi</EM>): Gulf of Alaska Stock</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Harbor seals inhabit coastal and estuarine waters off Baja California, north along the western coasts of the U.S., British Columbia, and Southeast Alaska, and west through the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, and in the Bering Sea north to Cape Newenham and the Pribilof Islands.  They haul out on rocks, reefs, beaches, and drifting glacial ice, and feed in marine, estuarine, and occasionally fresh waters.  Harbor seals generally are non-migratory, with
local movements associated with such factors as tides, weather, season, food availability, and reproduction (Scheffer and Slipp 1944; Fisher 1952; Bigg 1969, 1981), although some long-distance movement (174 km) of tagged animals in Alaska has been recorded (Pitcher and McAllister 1981).  Strong fidelity of individuals for haul out sites also has been recorded (Pitcher and Calkins 1979, Pitcher and McAllister 1981).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, natal dispersal characteristics unknown, breeding dispersal very limited, year-round site fidelity observed, seasonal movements greater than 300 km rare (Harvey 1987) except in western Alaska (Hoover-Miller 1994); (2) Population response data: substantial differences in population dynamics between Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea (Hoover-Miller 1994);(3) Phenotypic data: clinal variation in body size and color phase (Shaughnessy and Fay 1977, Kelly 1981); (4) Genotypic data: undetermined for Alaska, mitochondrial DNA analyses currently underway.  Based on this information, harbor seal stock structure is equivocal.  Preliminary mtDNA results show no evidence of geographical separation of populations; however, until additional samples are analyzed (projected for June 1995) preliminary conclusions regarding Alaskan harbor seal stock structure based on genetic analyses are premature (Westlake et al. unpubl. report).  Specifically, the small number of samples analyzed to date (31) does not provide sufficient statistical power to accept the conclusion of a single stock. Therefore, based primarily on the significant population decline of seals in the Gulf of Alaska versus the stable population in Southeast Alaska and the apparent stability of the population in the Bering Sea, three separate stocks are recognized in Alaskan waters: Southeast Alaska, Gulf of
Alaska, and Bering Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure were equivocal, and thus stock structure of harbor seals could not be defined.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Extensive photographic aerial surveys of harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska were conducted during the autumn molt in 1991 (23 August - 29 August):  Prince William Sound and the Copper River Delta; and 1992 (25 August - 9 September):  south side of the Alaska Peninsula, Cook Inlet, Kenai Peninsula, the Kodiak Archipelago, and Prince William Sound.  All known harbor seal haul out sites in each area were surveyed, and reconnaissance surveys were flown prior to photographic surveys to establish the location of additional sites.  Aerial surveys were flown within 2 hours on either side of low tide, based on the assumption that at locations affected by tides, harbor seals haul out in greatest numbers at and around the time of low tide (Pitcher and Calkins 1979, Calambokidis et al. 1987).  Glacial haul-outs were flown as close to noon as possible because haul out behavior is thought to be mostly diurnal rather than affected by tide (Hoover 1988).  At least four repetitive photographic counts were obtained for each major
rookery and haul out site within each study area.  Coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for multiple surveys and found to be &lt;0.19 in all cases.  This method of estimating abundance and its CV assumes that during the survey period no migration occurs between sites and that there was no trend in the number of animals ashore. The number of
seals moving between areas was assumed to be small considering each area's large geographic size, though a small number of seals may have been counted twice.  

<P>The total count for the 1991 and 1992 surveys was 12,232 (CV=0.030) harbor seals, with the following mean counts for the major survey areas: Copper River Delta 3,491; Prince William Sound 2,394; Kenai Peninsula 695; Cook Inlet 1,105; Kodiak Archipelago 2,422; south side of the Alaska Peninsula 2,125 (Loughlin 1992, 1993).  A correction factor for this stock is currently unavailable; yet, a correction factor study was performed during autumn 1994 in Southeast Alaska and analyses are nearly complete.  Instead, the correction factor developed for harbor seals in the state of Washington (1.61, CV=0.062; Huber et al. 1993) was utilized.  This correction factor is based on the proportion of seals hauled during the pupping season, which in Alaska is higher than the proportion hauled during the molt; consequently, the correction factor is considered conservative.  Thus, the estimated abundance for the Gulf of Alaska stock of harbor seals is 19,694 (12,232 x 1.61; CV=0.0689).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below. 

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>In Prince William Sound, harbor seal numbers have declined by as much as 57% from 1984 to 1992 (Pitcher 1989, Frost and Lowry 1993); the decline appears to have begun before the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, yet may have accelerated thereafter.  A steady decrease in numbers of harbor seals has been reported throughout the Kodiak Archipelago since 1976.  On southwestern Tugidak Island, formally one of the largest concentrations of harbor seals in the world, counts declined 85% from 1976 (6,919) to 1988 (1,014) (Pitcher 1990); the 1994 count (678) represents
a 33% decline since 1988.  Overall counts for Kodiak Island, based on an aerial photographic route established in 1992, increased slightly (11%) from 1993 (1,424) to 1994 (1,604) (J. Lewis unpubl. data, Alaska Dep. Fish and Game, 333 Raspberry Rd., Anchorage, AK 99518); however, the overall population remains low compared to the 1970s and 1980s.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>Reliable rates of maximum net productivity have not been estimated for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea stock of harbor seal.  Population growth rates were estimated at 6% and 8% between 1991 and 1992 in Oregon and Washington, respectively (Huber et al. 1994).  Harbor seals have been protected in British Columbia since 1970, and the population has responded with an annual rate of increase of approximately 12.5% since 1973 (Olesiuk et al. 1990).  However, until additional data become available from which more reliable estimates of population growth can
be determined, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries within the range of the Gulf of Alaska stock of harbor seals during 1990-93:  Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which observed incidental mortality occurred was the Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl, with a mean annual (total) mortality of 1 (CV=0.54).  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 212,000 tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 42%, and the incidental catch rate (defined as the  number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0563 (CV=0.54).

<P>In the Prince William Sound driftnet fishery, observers recorded 2 incidental mortalities of harbor seals in 1990 (Wynne et al. 1991), and 1 in 1991 (Wynne et al. 1992).  The extrapolated kill estimates were 36 (95% CI 2-74) in 1990 and 12 (95% CI 1-44) in 1991, resulting in an extrapolated mean kill of 24 animals per year for this fishery.  Combining the estimate from the Gulf of Alaska groundfish trawl fishery presented above (1) with the estimate from
the Prince William Sound driftnet fishery (24) results in an estimated annual observed incidental kill rate of 25 harbor seals per year.  In 1990, observers boarded 300 (57.3%) of the 524 vessels that fished in the Prince William Sound driftnet fishery, monitoring a total of 3,090 sets, or 3.9% of the estimated number of sets made by the fleet after 1 July when observers were fully deployed.  The South Unimak driftnet fishery was monitored in 1990 (but not 1991), and observers boarded 59 (38.3%) of 154 vessels, monitoring a total of 373 or 4.1% of the sets.  In 1991, 116,674 or 5.04% of the sets were observed in Prince William Sound districts.  The estimated mortality rate of harbor seals based on the 1990 and 1991 observed mortalities is 0.0002 kills per set.

<P>An additional source of information on the number of harbor seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, from the Gulf of Alaska indicated an annual mean of 10 injuries and 10 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 7 injuries and 7 mortalities due to legal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  These estimates are based on all available logbook reports for Gulf of Alaska fisheries, except the groundfish fisheries, for which observer data were presented above.  The fishery for which the majority of the incidental take occurred was the Copper River and Bering River salmon drift gillnet fishery.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is 35, based on observer data (25) and logbook reports (10) where observer data were not available.  However, a reliable estimate of the mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is currently unavailable because of the absence of observer placements in the fisheries mentioned above.  Further, at present, a protocol for estimating a PBR for this stock has not been developed.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the kill rate due to commercial fishing is insignificant. 

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The 1992 and 1993 subsistence harvest of harbor seals in Alaska was estimated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, under contract with the NMFS (Wolfe and Mishler 1993, Wolfe and Mishler 1994).  In both years, data were collected through systematic interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals in approximately 2,100 households in about 60 coastal communities within the geographic range of the harbor seal in Alaska; interviews were conducted in 27 communities in the Gulf of Alaska.  The subsistence take for the entire state of Alaska was similar for 1992 and 1993: total take, 2,867 (95% CI 2,317-3,677) and 2,729 (95% CI 2,513-3,464); struck and lost, 342 (11.9%) and 369 (13.5%).  For 1992 and 1993, the number of seals taken in the Gulf of Alaska was 852 (29.7%) and 814 (29.8%), respectively, with a mean annual take of 833.  The number of seals harvested for this stock was 790 and 728, whereas the number struck and lost was 62 (7.8%) and 86 (11.8%) for 1992 and 1993, respectively.  The age-specific kill of the harvest for this stock during 1992 and 1993 was approximately 62.6% adults, 20.6% juveniles, 1.9% pups, and 14.9% of unknown age; sex-specific kill was approximately 40.6% males, 15.6% females, and 43.8% of unknown sex.

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Illegal intentional killing of harbor seals by commercial fishers, sport fishers, and others may occur, but the magnitude of this mortality is unknown.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Estimates of Potential Biological Removal and status under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) have not been determined because this marine mammal stock is (1) not listed under the Endangered Species Act or MMPA, (2) subject to Alaska Native subsistence harvests, and (3) fisheries-related mortality and serious injury incidental to commercial fishing is absent or is a relatively minor contribution to total human-related mortality and injury.  Sustainable harvest levels and status determination for this stock will be determined from the analysis of information gathered through the co-management process, and will reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with the information obtained for this stock.

<P>Extensive photographic aerial surveys of harbor seals in the Bering Sea were conducted during the autumn molt in 1991 (26 August - 5 September):  Eastern Bristol Bay and the north side of the Alaska Peninsula; and 1994 (29 August - 8 September): Aleutian Islands.  All known harbor seal haul out sites in each area were surveyed, and reconnaissance surveys were flown prior to photographic surveys to establish the location of additional sites.  Aerial surveys were flown within 2 hours on either side of low tide, based on the assumption that at locations affected by tides, harbor seals haul out in greatest numbers at and around the time of low tide (Pitcher and Calkins 1979, Calambokidis et al. 1987).  At least four repetitive photographic counts were obtained for each major rookery and haul out site within each study area.  Coefficients of variation were determined for multiple surveys and found to be &lt;0.19 in all cases.  This method of estimating abundance and its CV assumes that during the survey period no migration occurs between sites and that there was no trend in the number of animals ashore. The number of seals moving between areas was assumed to be small considering each area's large geographic size, though a small number of seals may have been counted twice. 

<P>The total mean count for the 1991 survey was 9,324 harbor seals, with mean counts of 797 for Bristol Bay and 8,527 for the north side of the Alaska Peninsula (Loughlin 1992), whereas the sum of mean counts from the 1994 Aleutian Islands survey was 2,056 (NMFS unpubl. data, National Marine Mammal Laboratory, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98115).  A reliable estimate of the number of seals on Otter Island (Pribilof Islands) is currently not available; a minimum count in July 1978 was 707 (Kelly unpubl. report).  Thus, the population estimate for the
Bering Sea stock of harbor seals is 11,380 (9,324 + 2,056; CV=0.057).  A correction factor for this stock is currently unavailable; although a correction factor study was performed during autumn 1994 in Southeast Alaska, and analyses are nearly complete.  Instead, the correction factor developed for harbor seals in the state of Washington (1.61, CV=0.062; Huber et al. 1993) was utilized.  This correction factor is based on the proportion of seals hauled
during the pupping season, which in Alaska is higher than the proportion hauled during the molt; consequently, the correction factor is considered conservative.  Thus, the estimated abundance for the Bering Sea stock of harbor seals is 18,322 (11,380 x 1.61; CV=0.0722).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR  Guidelines (NMFS in prep.):  NMIN = N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 18,322 and a CV of 0.0722, NMIN for this stock of harbor seals is 17,243.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The population on the north side of the Alaska Peninsula appears to have remained relatively stable from 1975 to 1991, fluctuating around 9,000 animals.  However, an increase of about 5,600 seals was observed from 1975 to 1976, an increase which Loughlin (1992) considered unlikely to be due from an addition of new pups.  During 1975 to 1991 the combined counts at Bristol Bay sites declined; however, Loughlin (1992) stated that if the high count in 1976 was
excluded as anomalous, the decline becomes equivocal.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>Reliable rates of maximum net productivity have not been estimated for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea stock of harbor seal.  Population growth rates were estimated at 6% and 8% between 1991 and 1992 in Oregon and Washington, respectively (Huber et al. 1994).  Harbor seals have been protected in British Columbia since 1970, and the population has responded with an annual rate of increase of approximately 12.5% since 1973 (Olesiuk et al. 1990).  However, until additional data become available from which more reliable estimates of population growth can be determined, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0, the value for pinniped stocks with stable population status (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for this stock of harbor seals, PBR = (17,243
x 0.06 x 1.0), or 1,035 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries within the range of the Bering Sea stock of harbor seals during 1990-93: Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The mean annual (total) mortality was  1 (CV=0.35) for the Bering Sea groundfish trawl fishery, and 1 (CV=0.75) for the Bering Sea groundfish longline fishery.  No harbor seal mortality was observed by NMFS observers in the pot fishery.  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught), observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed), and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was also estimated for the 2 fisheries where incidental mortality occurred:  Bering Sea groundfish trawl, effort=1.84 million tons, observer coverage=64%, and catch rate=0.0064 (CV=0.34); and Bering Sea groundfish longline: effort=95,000 tons, observer coverage=44%, and catch rate=0.0598
(CV=0.75).

<P>An additional source of information on the number of harbor seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, from the Bering Sea indicated an annual mean of 12 injuries and 10 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with an additional 12 injuries and 24 mortalities due to legal deterrence. 
However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  These estimates are based on all available logbook reports for the Bering Sea fisheries, except those fisheries for which observer data were presented above.  The fisheries for which the majority of the incidental take occurred in the Bering Sea was the Bristol Bay salmon set and drift gillnet fisheries.

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (12; based on observer data (2) and logbook reports (10) where observer data were not available) is less than 10% of the PBR (110).  However, a reliable estimate of the mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is currently unavailable because of the absence of observer placements in the gillnet fisheries mentioned above.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the kill rate is insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The 1992 and 1993 subsistence harvest of harbor seals in Alaska was estimated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, under contract with the NMFS (Wolfe and Mishler 1993, Wolfe and Mishler 1994).  In both years, data were collected through systematic interviews with hunters and users of marine mammals in approximately 2,100 households in about 60 coastal communities within the geographic range of the harbor seal in Alaska; interviews were conducted in 15 communities in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.  The subsistence take for the entire state of Alaska was similar for 1992 and 1993: total take, 2,867 (95% CI 2,317-3,677) and 2,729 (95% CI 2,513-3,464); struck and lost, 342 (11.9%) and 369 (13.5%).  For 1992 and 1993, the number of seals taken from the Bering Sea stock was 344 (12.1%) and 300 (11.0%), respectively, with a mean annual take of 322.  The number of seals harvested was 253 and 207, whereas the number struck and lost was 91 (36.0%) and 93 (44.9%) for 1992 and 1993, respectively.  The age-specific kill of the harvest for this stock during 1992 and 1993 was approximately 60.3%
adults, 25.4% juveniles, 4.7% pups, and 9.6% of unknown age; sex-specific kill was approximately 29.8% males, 16.5% females, and 53.7% of unknown sex.

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Illegal intentional killing of harbor seals by commercial fishers, sport fishers, and others may occur, but the magnitude of this mortality is unknown.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury (12 + 322=334) does not exceed the PBR (1,035), thus the Bering Sea stock of harbor seals is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Spotted Seal (<em>Phoca largha</em>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Spotted seals are distributed along the continental shelf of the Beaufort, Chukchi, Bering, and Okhotsk Seas south to the northern Yellow Sea and western Sea of Japan (Shaughnessy and Fay 1977).  Little is known of their winter distribution and migration routes.  During spring they inhabit mainly the southern margin of the ice, with movement to coastal habitats after the retreat of the sea ice (Fay 1974, Shaughnessy and Fay 1977).  In summer, spotted seals
may be found as far north as 69-72N in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas (Shaughnessy and Fay 1977, Porsild 1945).  To the south, along the west coast of Alaska, spotted seals are known to occur around the Pribilof Islands, Bristol Bay, and the eastern Aleutian Islands.  Of 8 known breeding areas, 3 occur in the Bering Sea, the remaining 5 are in the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan.  There is little morphological difference between seals from these areas.  Spotted
seals are closely related to and often mistaken for North Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina).  The two species are often seen together and are partially sympatric, as their ranges overlap in the southern part of the Bering Sea (Quakenbush 1988).  Yet, spotted seals breed earlier and are less social during the breeding season, and only spotted seals are regularly associated with pack ice (Shaughnessy and Fay 1977).  These and other ecological, behavioral, and morphological differences support their recognition as two separate species (Quakenbush 1988).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, and the absence of any significant fishery interactions, there is currently no strong evidence to suggest splitting the distribution of spotted seals into more than one stock, therefore only the Alaska stock is recognized in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of spotted seal population abundance is currently not available.  However, early estimates of the world population were in the range of 335,000-450,000 animals (Burns 1973).  The population of the Bering Sea, including Russian waters, was estimated to be 200,000-250,000 based on the distribution of family groups on ice during the mating season (Burns 1973).  Fedoseev (1971) estimated 168,000 seals in the Okhotsk Sea.  Aerial surveys
were flown in 1992 and 1993 to examine the distribution and abundance of spotted seals in Alaska.  In 1992, survey methods were tested and distributional studies were conducted over the Bering Sea pack ice in spring and along the western Alaskan coast during summer (Rugh et al. 1993).  In 1993, the survey effort concentrated on known haul sites in autumn (Rugh et al. 1994).  The sum of maximum counts of hauled out animals were 4,145 and 2,951 in 1992
and 1993, respectively.

<P>Studies to determine a correction factor for the number of spotted seals at sea missed during surveys have been initiated, but only preliminary results are currently available.  The Alaska Department of Fish and Game placed satellite radio transmitters on 4 spotted seals in Kasegaluk Lagoon to estimate the ratio of time hauled out vs. time at sea.  Preliminary results indicate that the proportion hauled out averages about 6.8% (CV=0.85) (Lowry et al. 1994).  Using this correction factor with the maximum count of 4,145 from 1992 results in an estimate of 59,214.  However, the count is from a survey that covered only the eastern portion of the spotted seal's geographic range and may have included harbor seals, and therefore must be considered equivocal.  In addition, the correction factor data have not been stratified by season, tide, and time of day. 

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>A reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock can not presently be determined because current reliable estimates of abundance are not available.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance for the Alaska stock of spotted seals are unavailable.  However, Frost et al. (1993) report that counts of spotted seals have been relatively stable at Kasegaluk Lagoon since the late 1970s.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Alaska stock of spotted seals.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:

<UL>PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX  x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for pinniped stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of NMIN is currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.</UL>

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted with spotted seals during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  Observers did not report any mortality or serious injury of spotted seals incidental to these groundfish fisheries.  An additional source of information on the number of spotted seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated an annual mean of 1 injury and 1 mortality from gear interactions, and 1 injury and 0.7 mortalities from legal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are
considered to be minimum estimates.  The fisheries involved were the Alaska Peninsula salmon drift gillnet and the Bristol Bay salmon set and drift gillnet fisheries.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 1 animal per year, based on logbook data.  Yet, it should be noted that most interactions with these fisheries are likely to be harbor seals rather than spotted seals, and that due to the difficulty of distinguishing between spotted and harbor seals, the reliability of such data is questionable.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual mortality level is insignificant.  However, if there were 50,000 spotted seals the PBR would equal 1,500 (50,000 x 0.06 x 0.5 = 1,500), and annual mortality levels less than 150 animals (i.e., 10% of PBR) would be considered insignificant.  Currently, there is no reason to believe there are less than 50,000 spotted seals in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Spotted seals are an important species for Alaskan subsistence hunters with estimated annual harvests of 850-3,600 seals taken during 1966-76 (Quakenbush 1988), primarily in the Bering Strait and Yukon-Kuskokwim regions (Lowry 1984).  From September 1985 to June 1986 the combined harvest from 5 villages was 986.  Wolfe and Mischler (1993) estimated the 1992 subsistence harvest of spotted seals at 437, all of which were killed in the northern part of Bristol Bay; an estimate of variance for the harvest was not available.  Reliable information on subsistence harvests from the remainder of Alaska during 1992 is not available, thus 437 should be considered an underestimate of unknown magnitude.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of the minimum population, PBR, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available.   Due to a lack of information suggesting subsistence hunting is adversely affecting this stock and because of the minimal interactions between spotted seals and any U.S. fishery, the Alaska stock of spotted seals is not classified as a strategic stock.  This classification is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 26).

<h3>Bearded Seal (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Bearded seals are circumpolar in their distribution, extending from the Arctic Ocean (85N) south to Hokkaido (45N) in the Pacific.  They generally inhabit areas of shallow water (less than 200 m) that are at least seasonally ice covered.  During winter they are most common in broken pack ice (Burns 1967) and in some areas also inhabit shorefast ice (Smith and Hammill 1981).  In Alaskan waters, bearded seals are distributed over the continental shelves of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas (Ognev 1935, Johnson et al. 1966, Burns 1981).  They are evidently most concentrated from January to April over the northern part of the Bering Sea shelf (Burns 1981, Braham et al. 1984).  Many of the seals that winter in the Bering Sea migrate north through the Bering Strait from late April through June, and spend the summer along the ice edge in the Chukchi Sea (Burns 1967 and 1981).  The overall summer distribution is quite broad, with seals rarely hauled out on land, and some seals do not migrate but remain in open-water areas of the Bering and Chukchi Seas (Burns 1981, Nelson 1981, Smith and Hammill 1981).  An unknown proportion of the population migrates southward from the Chukchi Sea in late fall and winter, and Burns (1967) noted a movement of bearded seals away from shore at that season as well.

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, and the absence of any significant fishery interactions, there is currently no strong evidence to suggest splitting the distribution of bearded seals into more than one stock; therefore, only the Alaska stock is recognized in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Early estimates of the Bering-Chukchi Sea population range from 250,000 to 300,000 (Popov 1976, Burns 1981). Until additional surveys are conducted, reliable estimates of abundance for the Alaskan stock of bearded seals are considered unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>A reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock can not presently be determined because current reliable estimates of abundance are not available.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance for the Alaska stock of bearded seals are unavailable, though there is no evidence that population levels are declining.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Alaska stock of bearded seals.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for pinniped stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance NMIN is currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted with bearded seals during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which incidental kill was observed was the Bering Sea groundfish fishery, with reports of 3 mortalities in 1991, although one of these observed kills was later identified as a juvenile elephant seal (K. Wynne, pers. comm., Univ.
AK, 900 Trident Way, Kodiak, AK 99615).  These mortalities resulted in a mean annual (total) mortality of 1.2 (CV=0.35).  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort [tons] multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0064 (CV=0.34).

<P>An additional source of information on the number of bearded seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated an annual mean of 10 injuries and 5 mortalities from gear interactions, and 13 injuries and 6 mortalities from legal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased
(Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  The only fishery involved was the Bristol Bay salmon drift gillnet.  Anecdotal reports indicate small numbers are taken in bottom trawl fisheries.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 6.2 animals per year, based on observer data (1.2) and logbook data (5) where observer data were not available.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual mortality level is insignificant.  However, if there were 50,000 bearded seals the PBR would equal 1,500 (50,000 x 0.06 x 0.5 = 1,500), and annual mortality levels
less than 150 animals (i.e., 10% of PBR) would be considered insignificant.  Currently, there is no reason to believe there are less than 50,000 bearded seals in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Bearded seals are an important species for Alaskan subsistence hunters, with estimated annual harvests of 1,784 (SD=941) from 1966 to 1977 (Burns 1981).  Between August 1985 and June 1986, 791 bearded seals were harvested in 5 villages based on reports from the Eskimo Walrus Commission (Kelly 1988).  A current reliable estimate of the annual number of bearded seals taken by Alaskan Natives for subsistence is currently unavailable.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of the minimum population, PBR, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available.   Due to a lack of information suggesting subsistence hunting is adversely affecting this stock and because of the minimal interactions between bearded seals and any U.S. fishery, the Alaska stock of bearded seals is not classified as a strategic stock.  This classification is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 26).

<h3>Ringed Seal (<em>Phoca hispida</em>):  Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Ringed seals have a circumpolar distribution from approximately 35N to the North Pole, occurring in all seas of the Arctic Ocean (King 1983).  In the eastern North Pacific, they are found in the southern Bering Sea and range as far south as the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan.  Throughout their range, ringed seals have an affinity for ice-covered waters and are well adapted to occupying seasonal and permanent ice.  They remain in contact with ice most of the year and pup on the ice in late winter-early spring.  Ringed seals are found throughout the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas, as far south as Bristol Bay in years of extensive ice coverage.  During late April through June, ringed seals are distributed throughout their range from the southern ice edge northward (Burns and Harbo 1972, Burns et al. 1981, Braham et al. 1984).  The overall winter distribution is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the ice edge in late spring and summer (Burns 1970).  Thus, ringed seals occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi Seas in winter apparently are migratory, but details of their movements are unknown.  The seasonal migrations of seals wintering in the northern Chukchi and Beaufort Seas presumably are less extensive.

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  Based on this limited information, and the absence of any significant fishery interactions, there is currently no strong evidence to suggest splitting the distribution of ringed seals into more than one stock, therefore only the Alaska stock is recognized in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>A reliable abundance estimate for the Alaska stock of ringed seals is currently not available.  Crude estimates of the world population have ranged from 2.3 to 7 million, with 1 to 1.5 million in Alaskan waters (Kelly 1988).  The most recent abundance estimates of ringed seals are based on aerial surveys conducted in 1985, 1986, and 1987 by Frost et al. (1988).  Survey effort was directed towards shorefast ice, though some areas of adjacent pack ice were also surveyed, in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas from southern Kotzebue Sound north and east to the U.S.-Canada border.  The abundance estimate from 1987 was 44,360 + 9,130 (95% CI); however, it represents only a portion of the geographic range of the stock, as many seals occur in the pack ice and along the Russian coast.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>A reliable minimum population estimate NMIN for this stock can not presently be determined because current reliable estimates of abundance are not available.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance for the Alaska stock of ringed seals are unavailable, though there is no evidence population levels are declining..

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Alaska stock of ringed seals.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the pinniped maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 12% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological  removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for pinniped stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance NMIN is currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted with ringed seals during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which incidental kill was observed was the Bering Sea groundfish fishery, with 2 mortalities in 1992.  These mortalities resulted in an estimated annual mortality of 0.8.  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0043 (CV=0.42).  An additional source of information on the number of ringed seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated no injuries or mortalities from either gear interactions or legal deterrence.

<P>The estimated average mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 0.8 animals per year, based on observer data (0.8) and logbook data (0) where observer data were not available.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual mortality level is insignificant.  However, if there were 50,000 ringed seals the PBR would equal 1,500 (50,000 x 0.06 x 0.5 = 1,500), and annual mortality levels less than 150 animals (i.e., 10% of PBR) would be considered insignificant.  Currently, there is no reason to believe there are less than 50,000 ringed seals in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Ringed seals are an important species for Alaskan subsistence hunters.  The annual subsistence harvest in Alaska dropped from 7,000-15,000 in 1962-72 to an estimated 2,000-3,000 in 1979 (Frost unpubl. report).  Based on data from St. Lawrence Island, the current total annual take in Alaska likely exceeds 3,000 seals (Kelly 1988), but reliable estimates are currently not available.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of the minimum population, PBR, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available.   Due to a lack of information suggesting subsistence hunting is adversely affecting this stock and because of the minimal interactions between ringed seals and any U.S. fishery, the Alaska stock of ringed seals is not classified as a strategic stock.   This classification is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 26).

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Ribbon seals inhabit the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent fringes of the Arctic Ocean.  In Alaskan waters, ribbon seals are found in the open sea, on the pack ice, and only rarely on shorefast ice (Kelly 1988).  They range northward from Bristol Bay in the Bering Sea into the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas.  From late March to early May,  ribbon seals inhabit the Bering Sea ice front (Burns 1970, 1981; Braham et al. 1984).  They are most abundant in the
northern part of the ice front in the central and western parts of the Bering Sea (Burns 1970, Burns et al. 1981).  As the ice recedes in May to mid-July the seals move farther to the north in the Bering Sea, where they haul out on the receding ice edge and remnant ice (Burns 1970, 1981; Burns et al. 1981).  There has been little agreement on the range of ribbon seals during the rest of the year.  Recent sightings and a review of the literature suggest that many
ribbon seals migrate into the Chukchi Sea for the summer (Kelly 1988).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution continuous, (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; (4) Genotypic data: unknown.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>A reliable abundance estimate for the Alaska stock of ribbon seals is currently not available.  Burns (1981) estimated the worldwide population of ribbon seals at 240,000 in the mid-1970s, with an estimate for the Bering Sea at 90,000-100,000.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>A reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock can not presently be determined because current reliable estimates of abundance are not available.

The only fishery for which incidental kill was observed was the Bering Sea groundfish fishery, with 1 mortality in 1990.  This mortality resulted in a mean annual mortality rate of 0.4.  Fishing effort (based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0021 (CV=0.62).  An additional source of information on the number of ribbon seals killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated no injuries or mortalities from either gear interactions or legal deterrence.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 0.4 animals per year, based on observer data (0.4) and logbook data (0) where observer data were not available.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual mortality level is insignificant.  However, if there were 50,000 ribbon  seals the PBR would equal 1,500 (50,000 x 0.06 x 0.5 = 1,500), and annual mortality levels less
than 150 animals (i.e., 10% of PBR) would be considered insignificant.  Currently, there is no reason to believe there are less than 50,000 ribbon seals in U.S. waters.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Ribbon seals are an important species for Alaskan subsistence hunters.  The annual subsistence harvest was estimated to be less than 100 seals annually from 1968 to 1980 (Burns 1981).  Currently, the Eskimo Walrus Commission estimates the subsistence take is less than 100 seals annually (Kelly 1988), yet reliable estimates are not available.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of the minimum population, PBR, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available.   Due to a lack of information suggesting subsistence hunting is adversely affecting this stock and because of the minimal interactions between ribbon seals and any U.S. fishery, the Alaska stock of ribbon seals is not classified as a strategic stock.    This classification is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 26).

<h3>Beluga Whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>):  Beaufort Sea Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Beluga whales are distributed throughout seasonally ice-covered arctic and subarctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gurevich 1980), and are closely associated with open leads and polynya in ice-covered regions (Hazard 1988).  Depending on season and region, beluga whales may occur in both offshore and coastal waters, with concentrations in Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Mackenzie Delta (Hazard 1988).  It is assumed that most beluga whales from these summering areas overwinter in the Bering Sea, excluding those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Shelden 1994).  Seasonal distribution is affected by ice cover, tidal conditions, access to prey, temperature, and human interaction (Lowry 1985).  During the winter, beluga whales occur in offshore waters associated with pack ice.  In the spring, they migrate to warmer coastal estuaries, bays, and rivers for molting (Finley 1982) and calving (Sergeant and Brodie 1969).  Annual migrations may cover thousands of
kilometers (Reeves 1990).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying beluga whale stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous in summer (Frost and Lowry 1990), distribution unknown outside of summer; (2) Population response data: possible extirpation of local populations; distinct population trends between regions occupied in summer; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4)
Genotypic data: preliminary mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate distinct differences among summering areas, except between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay (G. O'Corry-Crowe, unpubl. data, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038); however, the number of samples collected from Bristol Bay was too small (n=5) to provide sufficient statistical power to delineate between these two areas.  Based on this information, 5 putative stocks of beluga whales are recognized within U.S. waters: 1) Cook Inlet, 2) Bristol Bay, 3) Norton Sound,
4) Eastern Chukchi Sea, and 5) Beaufort Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound were equivocal, and thus stock structure of beluga whales could not be defined for these areas (DeMaster 1995a: pp. 4). 

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The sources of information to estimate abundance for belugas in the waters of northern Alaska and western Canada have included both opportunistic and systematic observations.  Duval (1993) reported an estimate of 21,000 for the Beaufort Sea stock, similar to that reported by Seaman et al. (1985).  The most recent survey was conducted in 1992, when approximately 20,805 (CV=0.102) belugas were counted (Dep. Fisheries and Oceans, unpub. data, 501 University Crescent, Winnipeg, Canada R3T 2N6).  A correction factor of 2 has been recommended for the Beaufort Sea stock (Duval 1993), resulting in a population estimate of 41,610 (20,805 x 2).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>For the Beaufort Sea stock of belugas, the minimum population estimate (NMIN) is calculated from equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, NMIN =  N/exp(0.842*[ln(1+[CV(N)]2)]).  Using the population estimate (N) of 41,610 and an associated CV of 0.102, NMIN for this stock is 38,194.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group considered this estimate of abundance to be conservative because not all of the range of this stock was surveyed and because the applied correction factor is likely to be negatively biased.  

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>The Beaufort Sea stock of beluga whales is considered to be stable or increasing (DeMaster 1995b: pp. 16).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Beaufort Sea stock of beluga whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  As this stock is stable or increasing (DeMaster 1995b: pp. 16), the recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0 (NMFS in prep.).   Thus, for the Beaufort Sea stock of beluga whales, PBR = (38,194 x 0.02 x 1.0), or 764 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There are no reports of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries for this stock in recent years.  At present, annual mortality levels less than 76 animals per year (i.e., 10% of PBR) are considered insignificant. 

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The subsistence take of beluga whales within U.S. waters of the Beaufort Sea is reported by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC), who reported that the number of whales harvested for subsistence has averaged approximately 47 during the 5-year period from 1990-94 (Frost and Suydam 1995); the 1994 estimate is not currently available.  Estimates from the Canadian harvest for this stock over the same 5-year period have averaged 113 whales.  Thus, the
mean estimated subsistence kill for the Beaufort Sea stock is 160 (47 + 113).  This estimate is based on household surveys and on-site harvest monitoring, but is negatively biased because it has not been corrected for hunters that did not respond, and there is not a reliable estimate for the percent struck and lost.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The level of human-caused mortality and serious injury (160) does not exceed the PBR (764), thus the Beaufort Sea stock of beluga whales is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Beluga Whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>):  Eastern Chukchi Sea Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Beluga whales are distributed throughout seasonally ice-covered arctic and subarctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gurevich 1980), and are closely associated with open leads and polynya in ice-covered regions (Hazard 1988).  Depending on season and region, beluga whales may occur in both offshore and coastal waters, with concentrations in Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Mackenzie Delta (Hazard 1988).  It is assumed that most beluga whales from these summering areas overwinter in the Bering Sea, excluding those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Shelden 1994).  Seasonal distribution is affected by ice cover, tidal conditions, access to prey, temperature, and human interaction (Lowry 1985).  During the winter, beluga whales occur in offshore waters associated with pack ice.  In the spring, they migrate to warmer coastal estuaries, bays, and rivers for molting (Finley 1982) and calving (Sergeant and Brodie 1969).  Annual migrations may cover thousands of kilometers (Reeves 1990).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying beluga whale stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous in summer (Frost and Lowry 1990), distribution unknown outside of summer; (2) Population response data: possible extirpation of local populations; distinct population trends between regions occupied in summer; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4)
Genotypic data: preliminary mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate distinct differences among summering areas, except between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay (G. O'Corry-Crowe, unpubl. data, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038); however, the number of samples collected from Bristol Bay was too small (n=5) to provide sufficient statistical power to delineate between these two areas.  Based on this information, 5 putative stocks of beluga whales are recognized within U.S. waters: 1) Cook Inlet, 2) Bristol Bay, 3) Norton Sound,
4) Eastern Chukchi Sea, and 5) Beaufort Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound were equivocal, and thus stock structure of beluga whales could not be defined for these areas (DeMaster 1995a: pp. 4).

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Frost et al. (1993) estimated the minimum size of the eastern Chukchi stock of belugas at 1,200, based on counts of animals from  aerial surveys conducted during 1989-91.  Survey effort was concentrated on the 170 km long Kasegaluk Lagoon, an area known to be regularly used by belugas during the open-water season.  Other areas belugas are known to frequent (e.g., Kotezbue Sound) were not surveyed, thus the survey effort resulted in a minimum count. 
If this count is corrected for the proportion of animals that were diving and thus not visible at the surface (2.62, Frost and Lowry 1995), and for the proportion of newborns and yearlings not observed due to small size and dark coloration (1.18; Brodie 1971), the total corrected abundance estimate for the eastern Chukchi stock is 3,710 (1,200 x 2.62 x 1.18).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The survey technique utilized for estimating the abundance of beluga whales is a direct count which incorporates correction factors.  Although CVs of the correction factors are not available, the Alaska Scientific Review Group  concluded that the population estimate of 3,710 can serve as an estimate of minimum population size because the survey did not include areas where beluga are known to occur. 

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Based on similar counts of belugas in Kasegaluk Lagoon since 1978, the Eastern Chukchi Sea stock of beluga whales should be considered stable (Frost et al. 1993).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock of beluga whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  This stock is relatively stable and not declining in the presence of known take, thus the recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0, (DeMaster 1995b: pp. 17, NMFS in prep.).  Thus,
for the eastern Chukchi Sea stock of beluga whales, PBR = (3,710 x 0.02 x 1.0), or 74 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted with beluga whales in the Chukchi Sea during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  Observers did not report any mortality or serious injury of beluga whales incidental to these groundfish fisheries.  An additional source of information on the number of beluga whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, did not include any mortality or injury to beluga whales from this stock. 

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries (0) is less than 10% of the PBR (7) and, therefore, is considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The subsistence take of beluga whales within the eastern Chukchi Sea is reported by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC), who reported that the number of whales harvested for subsistence has averaged approximately 65 during the 5-year period from 1990-94 (Frost and Suydam 1995).  This estimate is based on household surveys and on-site monitoring, but is negatively biased because there is not a reliable estimate for the percent struck and lost.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury (65) does not exceed the PBR (74), thus the Eastern Chukchi Sea stock of beluga whales is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Beluga Whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>):  Norton Sound Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.
Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Beluga whales are distributed throughout seasonally ice-covered arctic and subarctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gurevich 1980), and are closely associated with open leads and polynya in ice-covered regions (Hazard 1988).  Depending on season and region, beluga whales may occur in both offshore and coastal waters, with concentrations in Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Mackenzie Delta (Hazard 1988).  It is assumed that most beluga whales from these summering areas overwinter in the Bering Sea, excluding those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Shelden 1994).  Seasonal distribution is affected by ice cover, tidal conditions, access to prey, temperature, and human interaction (Lowry 1985).  During the winter, beluga whales occur in offshore waters associated with pack ice.  In the spring, they migrate to warmer coastal estuaries, bays, and rivers for molting (Finley 1982) and calving (Sergeant and Brodie 1969).  Annual migrations may cover thousands of kilometers (Reeves 1990).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying beluga whale stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous in summer (Frost and Lowry 1990), distribution unknown outside of summer; (2) Population response data: possible extirpation of local populations; distinct population trends between regions occupied in summer; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4)
Genotypic data: preliminary mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate distinct differences among summering areas, except between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay (G. O'Corry-Crowe, unpubl. data, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038); however, the number of samples collected from Bristol Bay was too small (n=5) to provide sufficient statistical power to delineate between these two areas.  Based on this information, 5 putative stocks of beluga whales are recognized within U.S. waters: 1) Cook Inlet, 2) Bristol Bay, 3) Norton Sound,
4) Eastern Chukchi Sea, and 5) Beaufort Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound were equivocal, and thus stock structure of beluga whales could not be defined for these areas (DeMaster 1995: pp. 4).

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>A reliable abundance estimate for this stock is currently unavailable (DeMaster 1995: pp. 4).   DeMaster et al. (1994) estimated the minimum abundance of belugas from aerial surveys over Norton Sound in 1992, 1993, and 1994 at 2,095, 620, and 695, respectively (see also Lowry et al. 1995).  The variation between years was due, in part, to variability in the timing of the migration and movement of animals into the sound, and thus the 1993 and 1994 estimates were considered to be negatively biased.    Correction factors recommended from studies of belugas range from 2 to 3.27.  For Norton Sound, the correction factor of 2.98 (CV[CF] not available) has been recommended for the proportion of animals that were diving and thus not visible at the surface (DeMaster et al. 1994, based on methods of Frost and Lowry 1995).  If this correction factor is applied to the 1992 count (2,095, CV=0.32) along with the additional correction factor for the proportion of newborns and yearlings not observed due to small size and dark
coloration (1.18; Brodie 1971), the total corrected abundance estimate for Norton Sound is 7,367 (2,095 x 2.98 x 1.18).   A  CV(N) that incorporates variance due to all of the correction factors is currently not available.  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Surveys to estimate population abundance in Norton Sound were not conducted prior to 1992-94.  Thus, reliable information on population trends is currently not available (Frost and Lowry 1990).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Norton Sound stock of beluga whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted  with beluga whales in Norton Sound during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  Observers did not report any mortality or serious injury of beluga whales incidental to these groundfish fisheries.  An additional source of information on the number of beluga whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, did not include any mortality or injury to beluga whales from this stock. 

<P>The estimated annual mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is zero, and although the PBR for this stock is currently unknown this mortality rate is considered to be insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The subsistence take of beluga whales within Norton Sound is reported by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC), who reported that the number of whales harvested for subsistence has averaged approximately 147 during the 5-year period from 1990-94 (Frost and Suydam 1995).  This estimate is based on household surveys, but is negatively biased because it has not been corrected for hunters that did not respond, and there is not a reliable estimate for the percent struck and lost.  In addition, an unknown proportion of the animals harvested each year may belong to other beluga stocks migrating through Norton Sound in both the fall and spring. 

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Estimates of PBR and status under the MMPA have not been determined because this marine mammal stock is (1) not listed under the ESA or MMPA, (2) subject to Alaska Native subsistence harvests, and (3) fisheries-related mortality and serious injury incidental to commercial fishing is absent or is a relatively minor contribution to total human-related mortality and injury.  Sustainable harvest levels and status determination for this stock will be determined
from the analysis of information gathered through the co-management process, and will reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with the information obtained for this stock.

<h3>Beluga Whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>):  Bristol Bay Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Beluga whales are distributed throughout seasonally ice-covered arctic and subarctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gurevich 1980), and are closely associated with open leads and polynya in ice-covered regions (Hazard 1988).  Depending on season and region, beluga whales may occur in both offshore and coastal waters, with concentrations in Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Mackenzie Delta (Hazard 1988).  It is assumed that most beluga whales from these summering areas overwinter in the Bering Sea, excluding those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Shelden 1994).  Seasonal distribution is affected by ice cover, tidal conditions, access to prey, temperature, and human interaction (Lowry 1985).  During the winter, beluga whales occur in offshore waters associated with pack ice.  In the spring, they migrate to warmer coastal estuaries, bays, and rivers for molting (Finley 1982) and calving (Sergeant and Brodie 1969).  Annual migrations may cover thousands of kilometers (Reeves 1990).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying beluga whale stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous in summer (Frost and Lowry 1990), distribution unknown outside of summer; (2) Population response data: possible extirpation of local populations; distinct population trends between regions occupied in summer; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4)
Genotypic data: preliminary mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate distinct differences among summering areas, except between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay (G. O'Corry-Crowe, unpubl. report, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038); however, the number of samples collected from Bristol Bay was too small (n=5) to provide sufficient statistical power to delineate between these two areas.  Based on this information, 5 putative stocks of beluga whales are recognized within U.S. waters: 1) Cook Inlet, 2) Bristol Bay, 3) Norton Sound,
4) Eastern Chukchi Sea, and 5) Beaufort Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound were equivocal, and thus stock structure of beluga whales could not be defined for these areas (DeMaster 1995: pp. 4).

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The sources of information to estimate abundance for belugas in the waters of western and northern Alaska have included both opportunistic and systematic observations.  Frost and Lowry (1990) compiled data collected from aerial surveys conducted between 1978 and 1987 that were designed to specifically estimate the number of beluga whales.  Surveys did not cover the entire habitat of belugas, but were directed to specific areas at the times of year when
belugas were expected to concentrate.  Frost and Lowry (1990) reported an estimate of 1,000-1,500 for Bristol Bay, similar to that reported by Seaman et al. (1985).  Most recently, the number of beluga whales in Bristol Bay was estimated at 1,555 in 1994 (Frost and Lowry 1995a), based on a count of 503 animals, which was corrected for the proportion of animals that were diving and thus not visible at the surface (2.62, Frost and Lowry 1995b), and for the proportion of newborns and yearlings not observed due to small size and dark coloration (1.18; Brodie 1971).

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The survey technique utilized for estimating the abundance of beluga whales in this stock is a direct count which incorporates correction factors.  For the Bristol Bay stock of belugas, the minimum population estimate (NMIN) is 1526, which is from Frost and Lowry (1995a).  Equation 1 from the PBR Guidelines (NMFS in prep.) was not used because of the  unavailability of a CV(N).  Because an estimate of the variance of abundance is currently not available, the estimate of NMIN should be considered preliminary.  This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Alaska Scientific Review Group.  

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Abundance estimates from surveys conducted in 1983, 1993, and 1994 are similar to estimates from the 1950s, suggesting this stock of beluga whales should be considered stable (Frost and Lowry 1990).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for the Bristol Bay stock of beluga whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  As this stock is considered stable (Frost and Lowry 1990), the recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 1.0 (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for the Bristol Bay stock of beluga whales, PBR = (1,529 x 0.02 x 1.0), or 31 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>


<P>Fisheries Information

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 3 different fisheries that could have interacted with beluga whales in Bristol Bay during 1990-93:  Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  Observers have not monitored the Bristol Bay salmon set and drift gillnet fisheries, the largest commercial fishing fleet affecting belugas in western Alaska.   Observers did not report any mortality or serious injury of beluga whales
incidental to the groundfish fisheries.  An additional source of information on the number of beluga whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators as required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, included 1 mortality and 1 injury due to gear interaction in the Bristol Bay salmon set and
drift gillnet fishery.  Thus, logbook records indicate an annual mean of 0.3 injuries and 0.3 mortalities from interactions with fishing operations, with no additional injuries or mortalities due to illegal deterrence.  However, because logbook records are most likely negatively biased (Credle et al. 1994), these are considered to be minimum estimates.  In 1983, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game documented 12 beluga whale mortalities in Bristol Bay
related to fishing.

<P>The current estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is 0.3 animals per year, based entirely on logbook data.  It should be noted that no observers have been assigned to those fisheries that are known to interact with this stock of belugas.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the kill rate can be considered insignificant and approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The subsistence take of beluga whales within Bristol Bay is reported by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC), who reported that the number of whales harvested for subsistence has averaged approximately 13 during the 5-year period from 1990-94 (Frost and Suydam 1995); estimates are not available for 1992.  This estimate is based on household surveys, but is negatively biased because it has not been corrected for hunters that did not respond, and there is not a reliable estimate for the percent struck and lost.  A study conducted by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, in cooperation with the ABWC and the Indigenous People's Council for Marine
Mammals, estimated the subsistence take in 1993 at 39 whales based on surveys of 42 hunters from 10 different communities in Bristol Bay (Chythlook and Coiley 1994).  Replacing this 1993 estimate with the estimate from Frost and Suydam (1995) and using the other 3-years of data from the ABWC results in an estimated subsistence take of 22 belugas each year.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury (22) that can be estimated  does not exceed the PBR (31), thus the Bristol Bay stock of beluga whales is not classified as a strategic stock.  However, as noted, fisheries-related mortality is undetermined and, therefore, may be underestimated.

<h3>Beluga Whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>):  Cook Inlet Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep.
Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Beluga whales are distributed throughout seasonally ice-covered arctic and subarctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gurevich 1980), and are closely associated with open leads and polynya in ice-covered regions (Hazard 1988).  Depending on season and region, beluga whales may occur in both offshore and coastal waters, with concentrations in Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and the Mackenzie Delta (Hazard 1988).  It is assumed that most beluga whales from these summering areas overwinter in the Bering Sea, excluding those found in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Shelden 1994).  Seasonal distribution is affected by ice cover, tidal conditions, access to prey, temperature, and human interaction (Lowry 1985).  During the winter, beluga whales occur in offshore waters associated with pack ice.  In the spring, they migrate to warmer coastal estuaries, bays, and rivers for molting (Finley 1982) and calving (Sergeant and Brodie 1969).  Annual migrations may cover thousands of kilometers (Reeves 1990).

<P>The following information was considered in classifying beluga whale stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution discontinuous in summer (Frost and Lowry 1990), distribution unknown outside of summer; (2) Population response data: possible extirpation of local populations; distinct population trends between regions occupied in summer; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4)
Genotypic data: preliminary mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate distinct differences among summering areas, except between Norton Sound and Bristol Bay (G. O'Corry-Crowe, unpubl. report, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, La Jolla, CA 92038); however, the number of samples collected from Bristol Bay was too small (n=5) to provide sufficient statistical power to delineate between these two areas.  Based on this information, 5 putative stocks of beluga whales are recognized within U.S. waters: 1) Cook Inlet, 2) Bristol Bay, 3) Norton Sound, 4) Eastern Chukchi Sea, and 5) Beaufort Sea.  The Alaska Scientific Review Group concluded that the scientific data available to determine stock structure in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound were equivocal, and thus stock structure of beluga whales could not be defined for these areas (DeMaster 1995: pp. 4).

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Aerial surveys for beluga whales in Cook Inlet were conducted in June 1994 using an 'approach' survey technique that involves repeated circling of observed groups, and videotape recording.  The approach technique differs from 'passing mode' surveys performed for belugas in other stocks, in that during passing surveys the aircraft maintains a straight flight path.  The approach technique allows each group of whales observed and recorded on video to be corrected for 1) animals that were under the surface, and 2) animals missed by observers yet recorded on video.  The sum of corrected counts for all groups observed in the 1994 survey has not yet been determined.  The maximum single day count from the 1994 survey was 431 (CV=0.14) belugas.  Based on information collected during the 1994 survey on mean surface time and mean time between surfacings, and the methodology of Frost and Lowry (1995), a correction factor of 2.46 (CV not available) was estimated for this stock.  As recommended by the Alaska Scientific Review Group (DeMaster 1995: pp. 5), if this correction factor is applied to the 1994 count along with the additional correction factor for the proportion of newborns and yearlings not observed due to small size and dark coloration (1.18; Brodie 1971), the total corrected abundance estimate for Cook Inlet Sound is 1,251 (431 x 2.46 x 1.18).  A CV(N) that incorporates variance associated with the correction factors is currently not available.  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below. 

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>In general, population estimates have ranged from 300 to 500 beluga whales (uncorrected counts) within Cook Inlet since the early 1960s.  Based on these surveys, this population is considered to be stable (Shelden 1994).

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently not available for the Cook Inlet stock of beluga whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Not determined, see "Status of Stock" section below.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>Three types of fishing gear occur in Cook Inlet: purse seine, drift-net, and set-net, which are used to catch each of the five species of Pacific salmon as well as Pacific herring.  NMFS observers have not monitored any of these fisheries within Cook Inlet.  An additional source of information on the number of beluga whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators through the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92, logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated no injuries or mortalities from either interactions with fishing operations or illegal deterrence.  Unsubstantiated information obtained by the NMFS Anchorage Field Office includes net entanglement, which occurred when fisheries were active between May and August.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is zero.  At present, a PBR for this stock can not be determined (see "Status of Stock" section below).  Further, a reliable estimate of the mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries is currently unavailable because of the absence of observer placements in the fisheries mentioned above.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the kill rate is insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>The only documented human-caused mortality of beluga whales within the Cook Inlet stock is that reported by the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC), who reported that the number of whales harvested for subsistence has averaged approximately 13 during the 5-year period from 1990-94 (Frost and Suydam 1995); estimates are not available for 1991.  This estimate is based on household surveys, and has been corrected for hunters that did not respond.  However, this estimate is negatively biased because there is not a reliable estimate for the percent struck
and lost, and it does not include the number of animals killed by residents from outside Cook Inlet.  A study conducted by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, in cooperation with the ABWC and the Indigenous People's Council for Marine Mammals, estimated the subsistence take in 1993 at 17 whales based on surveys of 16 of 19 households known to have hunted in 1993 Stanek (1994).  This was considered a minimum estimate, and was increased by adding the estimated number of whales taken from households not surveyed (3) and by hunters from areas outside of Cook Inlet (10) resulting in an estimated total take of 30 (17 + 3 + 10) whales.  Using this 1993 estimate of 30 belugas from Stanek (1994), because it was a more comprehensive survey, and the estimates from 1990, 1992, and 1994 from the ABWC results in an estimated average subsistence take of 17 belugas per year.  However, in consultation with native elders from the Cook Inlet region, the Cook Inlet Marine Mammal Council has estimated the number of belugas taken by subsistence hunters to be significantly greater than 17.  Thus, the estimate
of 17 belugas taken each year is considered to be an underestimate, and until additional comprehensive surveys are conducted, a reliable estimate of the annual subsistence take of belugas in this stock is considered unavailable.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>Estimates of PBR and status under the MMPA have not been determined because this marine mammal stock is (1) not listed under the ESA or MMPA, (2) subject to Alaska Native subsistence harvests, and (3) fisheries-related mortality and serious injury incidental to commercial fishing is absent or is a relatively minor contribution to total human-related mortality and injury.  Sustainable harvest levels and status determination for this stock will be determined
from the analysis of information gathered through the co-management process, and will reflect the degree of uncertainty associated with the information obtained for this stock.

<h3>Killer Whale (<EM>Orcinus orca</EM>): Eastern North Pacific Resident Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Killer whales have been observed in all oceans and seas of the world (Leatherwood and
Dahlheim 1978).  Although reported from tropical and offshore waters, killer whales prefer
the colder waters of both hemispheres, with greatest abundances found within 800 km of major
continents (Mitchell 1975).  In Alaskan waters, killer whales occur along the entire Alaskan
coast from the Chukchi Sea, into the Bering Sea, along the Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska,
and into Southeast Alaska (Braham and Dahlheim 1982).  Their occurrence has been well
documented in British Columbia and inland waterways of Washington State (Bigg et al. 1990),
and along the outer coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (Green et al. 1992, Barlow
1995, Forney et al. 1995).  Seasonal and year-round occurrence has been noted for killer
whales throughout Alaska (Braham and Dahlheim 1982) and in the intracoastal waterways of
British Columbia and Washington State (Bigg et al. 1990). Through examination of
photographs of recognizable individuals and pods, movements of whales between geographical
areas have been documented.  For example, whales identified in Prince William Sound have
been observed near Kodiak Island (Heise et al. 1991, Dahlheim et al. in prep. a); whales
identified in Southeast Alaska have been observed in Prince William Sound, British Columbia,
and Puget Sound (Leatherwood et al. 1990; Dahlheim et al.  in prep.a; Dahlheim et al. in
prep. b).  Movements of killer whales between Southeast Alaska and off central California
have also been documented (Goley and Straley 1994).

<P>Killer whales along British Columbia and Washington State have been labeled as resident and
transient (Bigg et al. 1990).  Although less is known about killer whales in Alaska, it appears
from a preliminary examination of data that both forms also exist in these waters.  The two
sympatric forms are believed to differ in several aspects of morphology, ecology, and
behavior; that is, dorsal fin shape, saddle patch shape, pod size, home range size, diet, travel routes, dive duration, social integrity of pods.  For example, in Pacific Northwest waters, significant differences occur in call repertoires (Ford and Fisher 1982), saddle patch
pigmentation (Baird and Stacey 1988), and diet (Baird et al. 1992).  Studies on mtDNA
restriction patterns provide evidence that the resident and transient pods are genetically distinct (Stevens et al. 1989; Hoelzel 1991; Hoelzel and Dover 1991).  Using such information,
Matkin and Saulitis (1994) proposed 8 provisional killer whale stocks in the eastern North
Pacific.  However, in reviewing the discreteness of all the characteristics proposed to separate the two forms, Heyning and Dahlheim (1993) concluded that other than saddle patch
pigmentation and genetic studies, most information is preliminary, lacks critical statistical
evaluation, and is thus equivocal.  Following the phylogeographic approach to classify stock
structure (Dizon et al. 1992), killer whales occurring from Alaska to the inland waters of
Washington State (east of Cape Flattery) represent 2 separate stocks, resident and transient,
based primarily on genetic differences.  Because the stock area is defined as waters of Alaska
to the inland waters of Washington, resident whales in Canada are considered part of the
resident stock.  Killer whales in waters south of Cape Flattery along the U.S. West Coast are
considered a separate stock (see Assessment Reports for the Pacific Region, available upon
request from J. Barlow, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box 271, LaJolla, CA
92038).  

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>In the late 1970s, researchers began collecting identification photographs of killer whales in Prince William Sound, Alaska (Hall 1981).  The whales were assigned to pods in 1984
(Leatherwood et al. 1984) which resulted in the first catalogue of Prince William Sound killer
whales being produced (Ellis 1984).  The catalogue was updated in 1987 (Ellis 1987) and
again in 1991 (Heise et al. 1991).  In 1984, photographic studies on killer whales were also
initiated in Southeast Alaska (Leatherwood et al. 1984) with photographs of individual killer
whales from Southeast Alaska also included in Ellis (1984, 1987).  Although opportunistic
photographs of killer whales were collected between the years 1985 through 1988 (Prince
William Sound and Southeast Alaska), photo-identification research was limited in both areas. 
Beginning in 1989, dedicated killer whale photo-identification studies were initiated by the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory, primarily in Southeast Alaska.  

<P>Preliminary analysis of photographic data resulted in the following minimum counts for
Alaskan killer whales (Note: individual whales have been matched between geographical
regions and missing animals likely to be dead have been subtracted).  Based on data collected
from Seward, Alaska, west to Kodiak Island, then westward along the Alaskan Peninsula into
the southeastern Bering Sea to include the eastern Aleutian Islands (Dahlheim and Waite 1993,
Dahlheim 1994, Dahlheim in prep.,  Dahlheim et al.  in prep. a), 277 individual whales have
been identified.  In Prince William Sound, 310 whales have been identified (Leatherwood et
al. 1990; Heise et al. 1991; Dahlheim et al. in prep. a).  For Southeast Alaska, 259 whales
have been identified (Dahlheim and Waite 1993, Dahlheim 1994, and Dahlheim et al. in prep
b).  Combining these counts gives a total for Alaskan waters of 846 (277 + 310 + 259)
whales.  For the inland waters, only, of Washington State, 158 killer whales have been
documented (Ford et al. 1994).  Minor adjustments to counts will be made based on final
analysis; for example, a relatively small number of internal matches between Washington State
and Alaska (&lt;10 whales) could decrease counts.  Thus, the estimated abundance of killer
whales in Alaska and the inland waters of Washington State is 1,004 (846 + 158) (Dahlheim
et al. a in prep), with approximately 759 (75.6%) identified as residents.  The distinction
between resident and transient whales was based primarily on genetics and saddle patch shape,
and the morphological, ecological, and behavioral characteristics presented above. 
Additionally,  250 resident whales that have only  been observed in Canadian waters. 
Therefore, the best estimate of abundance for this stock, including resident  animals found off
the coast of British Columbia, is 1,009 (759 +  250).  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The survey technique utilized for obtaining the abundance estimate of killer whales is a direct count, and a correction factor is currently unavailable.  Given that researchers continue to identify  new whales, the estimate of abundance based on the number of uniquely identified individuals known to be alive is likely conservative.  Other estimates of the overall population size (i.e., NBEST) and associated CV are not currently available.  Thus, the minimum population estimate (NMIN) for the resident stock of killer whales is 759, which does not include animals found in Canadian waters (see PBR Guidelines regarding the status of non-migratory stocks, NMFS in prep.).  This approach is consistent with the recommendations of 
the Alaska Scientific Review Group.  

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance for this stock of killer whales are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock of killer whales.  Olesiuk et al. 1990, studied a resident population of killer whales in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State, and estimated the population was
below carrying capacity and grew at 2.92% from 1973-87.  However, a population increases
at the maximum growth rate (RMAX) when the population is at extremely low levels; thus, the
estimate of 2.92% is not an estimate of RMAX.  Hence, until additional data become available,
it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4%
be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential
biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x
0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks
with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for this stock PBR = (759 x 0.02 x
0.5), or 7.6 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries that could have interacted
with killer whales during 1990-93: The Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) and Gulf of Alaska
groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which incidental kill was
observed was the Bering Sea/Gulf of Alaska groundfish fishery, with 2 mortalities observed in 
4 years.  This mortality resulted in an estimated mean annual mortality of 0.8.  Fishing effort
(based on total metric tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number
of observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was
0.0043 (CV=0.42). Observers did not report any mortality of killer whales incidental to
commercial fisheries in Washington State during the same 1990-93 time period.

<P>An additional source of information on the number of killer whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92,
logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated no injuries or mortalities
from gear interactions; no injuries or mortalities due to illegal deterrence were reported.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is 0.8
animals per year, based on observer data (0.8) and logbook data (0.0) where observer data
were not available.  Mortalities incidental to commercial fisheries have not been identified as
either resident or transient killer whales.  At present, the estimated annual mortality level (0.8) is approximately equal to 10% of the PBR (i.e., 0.8); therefore mortality incidental to
commercial fishing is not considered insignificant for this stock. 

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Since 1986, research efforts have been made to assess the nature and magnitude of killer
whale/blackcod (sablefish; Anoplopoma fimbria) interactions (Dahlheim 1988; Yano and
Dahlheim 1994).  Fishery interactions have occurred each year in the Bering Sea and Prince
William Sound, with the number of annual reports varying considerably.  Data collected from
the Japan/U.S. cooperative longline research surveys operating in the Bering Sea indicate that
interactions may be increasing and expanding into the Aleutian Island region (Yano and
Dahlheim 1994).  During 1991 surveys conducted in the Bering Sea and near Kodiak Island, 5
of 12 (42%) pods encountered had evidence of bullet wounds (Dahlheim and Waite 1993). 
The relationship between wounding due to shooting and survival is unknown.  In Prince
William Sound, the pod responsible for most of the fishery interactions has experienced a high
level of mortality: between 1986-91, 22 whales out of a pod of 37 (59%) are missing and
considered dead (Matkin et al. 1994).  The cause of death for these whales is unknown, but it
is likely related to gunshot wounds or effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill (Dahlheim and
Matkin 1994).

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual level of human-caused mortality and serious injury of 0.8 animals per
year does not exceed the PBR (7.6), thus the resident stock of killer whales is not classified as a strategic stock.

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Killer whales have been observed in all oceans and seas of the world (Leatherwood and
Dahlheim 1978).  Although reported from tropical and offshore waters, killer whales prefer
the colder waters of both hemispheres, with greatest abundances found within 800 km of major
continents (Mitchell 1975).  In Alaskan waters, killer whales occur along the entire Alaskan
coast from the Chukchi Sea, into the Bering Sea, along the Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska,
and into Southeast Alaska (Braham and Dahlheim 1982).  Their occurrence has been well
documented in British Columbia and inland waterways of Washington State (Bigg et al. 1990),
and along the outer coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (Barlow 1995, Forney et al.
1995).  Seasonal and year-round occurrence has been noted for killer whales throughout
Alaska (Braham and Dahlheim 1982) and in the intracoastal waterways of British Columbia
and Washington State (Bigg et al. 1990).  Through examination of photographs of
recognizable individuals and pods, movements of whales between geographical areas have
been documented.  For example, whales identified in Prince William Sound have been
observed near Kodiak Island (Heise et al. 1991, Dahlheim et al. in prep. a); whales identified
in Southeast Alaska have been observed in Prince William Sound, British Columbia, and Puget
Sound (Leatherwood et al. 1990, Dahlheim et al. in prep. a, Dahlheim et al. in prep. b). 
Movements of killer whales between Southeast Alaska and off central California have also
been documented (Goley and Straley 1994).

<P>Killer whales along British Columbia and Washington State have been labeled as resident and
transient (Bigg et al. 1990).  Although less is known about killer whales in Alaska, it appears
from a preliminary examination of data that both forms also exist in these waters.  The two
sympatric forms are believed to differ in several aspects of morphology, ecology, and
behavior; that is, dorsal fin shape, saddle patch shape, pod size, home range size, diet, travel routes, dive duration, social integrity of pods.  For example, in Pacific Northwest waters, significant differences occur in call repertoires (Ford and Fisher 1982), saddle patch
pigmentation (Baird and Stacey 1988), and diet (Baird et al. 1992).  Studies on mtDNA
restriction patterns provide evidence that the resident and transient pods are genetically distinct (Stevens et al. 1989, Hoelzel 1991, Hoelzel and Dover 1991).  Using such information,
Matkin and Saulitis (1994) proposed 8 provisional killer whale stocks in the eastern North
Pacific.  However, in reviewing the discreetness of all the characteristics proposed to separate the two forms, Heyning and Dahlheim (1993) concluded that other than saddle patch
pigmentation and genetic studies, most information is preliminary, lacks critical statistical
evaluation, and is thus equivocal.  Following the phylogeographic approach to classify stock
structure (Dizon et al. 1992), killer whales occurring from Alaska to the inland waters of
Washington State (east of Cape Flattery) represent 2 separate stocks, resident and transient,
based primarily on genetic differences.   Killer whales in waters south of Cape Flattery along
the U.S. West Coast are considered a separate stock (see Assessment Reports for the Pacific
Region, available upon request from J. Barlow, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, P.O. Box
271, LaJolla, CA 92038).  

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>In the late 1970s, researchers began collecting identification photographs of killer whales  in Prince William Sound, Alaska (Hall 1981).  The whales were assigned to pods in 1984
(Leatherwood et al. 1984) which resulted in the first catalogue of Prince William Sound killer
whales being produced (Ellis 1984).  The catalogue was updated in 1987 (Ellis 1987) and
again in 1991 (Heise et al. 1991).  In 1984, photographic studies on killer whales were also
initiated in Southeast Alaska (Leatherwood et al. 1984) with photographs of individual killer
whales from Southeast Alaska also included in Ellis (1984, 1987).  Although opportunistic
photographs of killer whales were collected between the years 1985 through 1988 (Prince
William Sound and Southeast Alaska), photo-identification research was limited in both areas. 
Beginning in 1989, dedicated killer whale photo-identification studies were initiated by the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory, primarily in Southeast Alaska. 

<P>Preliminary analysis of photographic data have resulted in the following minimum counts for
Alaskan killer whales (Note: individual whales have been matched between geographical
regions and missing animals likely to be dead have been subtracted).  Based on data collected
from Seward, Alaska, west to Kodiak Island, then westward along the Alaska Peninsula into
the southeastern Bering Sea to include the eastern Aleutian Islands (Dahlheim and Waite 1993,
Dahlheim 1994, Dahlheim in prep., Dahlheim in prep. a), 277 individual whales have been
identified.  In Prince William Sound, 310 whales have been identified (Leatherwood et al.
1990, Heise et al. 1991, Dahlheim in prep. a).  For Southeast Alaska, 259 whales have been
identified (Dahlheim and Waite 1993, Dahlheim 1994, and Dahlheim in prep. b).  Combining
these counts gives a total for Alaskan waters of 846 (277 + 310 + 259) whales.  For the
inland waters, only, of Washington State, 158 killer whales have been documented (Ford et al.
1994).  Minor adjustments to counts will be made based on final analysis; for example, a
relatively small number of internal matches between Washington State and Alaska (&lt;10
whales) could decrease counts.  Thus, the estimated abundance of killer whales in Alaska and
the inland waters of Washington State is 1,004 (846 + 158) (Dahlheim in prep. a), with
approximately 245 (24.4%) identified as transients.  The distinction between resident and
transient whales was based primarily on genetics and saddle patch shape, and the
morphological, ecological, and behavioral characteristics presented above.  An estimate of the
abundance of transient whales that have only been observed in Canada is not currently
available.  

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>The survey technique utilized for obtaining the abundance estimate of killer whales is a direct count, and a correction factor is currently unavailable.   Given that researchers continue to identify new whales, the estimate of abundance based on the number of uniquely identified individuals known to be alive is likely conservative.   Additional estimates of the overall population size (i.e., NBEST) and associated coefficient of variation (CV) are not currently available.  Thus, the minimum population estimate (NMIN) for the transient stock of killer whales is 245.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance for this stock of killer whales are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock of killer whales.  Olesiuk et al. 1990, studied a resident population of killer whales in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State, and estimated the population was
below carrying capacity and grew at 2.92% from 1973-87.  However, a population increases
at the maximum growth rate (RMAX) when the population is at extremely low levels; thus, the
estimate of 2.92% is not an estimate of RMAX.  In addition, no reliable estimates of R MAX are
currently available for transient killer whales.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential
biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x
0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks
with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  Thus, for this stock PBR = (245 x 0.02 x
0.5), or 2.4 animals.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>NMFS observers monitored incidental take on 6 different fisheries that could have interacted
with killer whales during 1990-93: The Bering Sea (and Aleutian Islands) and Gulf of Alaska
groundfish trawl, longline, and pot fisheries.  The only fishery for which incidental kill was
observed was the Bering Sea/Gulf of Alaska groundfish fishery, with 2 mortalities observed in
4 years.  This mortality resulted in a mean annual mortality rate of  0.8.  Fishing effort (based on total tons of fish caught) was 1.84 million tons, observer coverage (defined as the
percentage of effort observed) was 64%, and incidental catch rate (defined as the number of
observed dead in the catch divided by the observed effort (tons) multiplied by 10-4) was 0.0043
(CV=0.42). Observers did not report any mortality of killer whales incidental to commercial
fisheries in Washington State during the same 1990-93 time period.

<P>An additional source of information on the number of killer whales killed or injured incidental to commercial fishery operations is the logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program.  During the 3-year period between 1990-92,
logbook reports, where observer data were not available, indicated no injuries or mortalities
from gear interactions; no injuries or mortalities due to illegal deterrence were reported.

<P>The estimated mortality rate incidental to commercial fisheries recently monitored is
approximately 0.8 animals per year, based on observer data (0.8) and logbook data (0) where
observer data were not available.  Mortalities incidental to commercial fisheries have not been
identified as either resident or transient killer whales.  At present the estimated  annual mortality level (0.8) is greater than 10% of the PBR (i.e., 0.2; therefore, mortality incidental to commercial fishing in not considered insignificant for this stock.  

<P><STRONG>Other Mortality</STRONG>

<P>Since 1986, research efforts have been made to assess the nature and magnitude of killer
whale/blackcod (sablefish; Anoplopoma fimbria) interactions (Dahlheim 1988, Yano and
Dahlheim 1994).  Fishery interactions have occurred each year in the Bering Sea and Prince
William Sound, with the number of annual reports varying considerably.  Data collected from
the Japan/U.S. cooperative longline research surveys operating in the Bering Sea indicate that
interactions may be increasing and expanding into the Aleutian Island region (Yano and
Dahlheim 1994).  During 1991 surveys conducted in the Bering Sea and near Kodiak Island, 5
of 12 (42%) pods encountered had evidence of bullet wounds (Dahlheim and Waite 1993). 
The relationship between wounding due to shooting and survival is unknown.  In Prince
William Sound, the pod responsible for most of the fishery interactions has experienced a high
level of mortality: between 1986-91, 22 whales out of a pod of 37 (59%) are missing and
considered dead (Matkin et al. 1994).  The cause of death for these whales is unknown, but
likely related to gunshot wounds or effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill (Dahlheim and Matkin
1994).

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual level of human-caused mortality and serious injury of 0.8 animals per
year does not exceed the PBR (2.4), thus the transient stock of killer whales is not classified as a strategic stock.

<h3>Sperm Whale (<EM>Physeter macrocephalus</EM>): Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>The sperm whale is one of the most widely distributed of any marine mammal species, perhaps only exceeded by the killer whale (Rice 1989).  They feed primarily on medium- to large-sized squids but may also feed on large demersal and mesopelagic sharks, skates, and fishes (Gosho et al. 1984).   In the eastern north Pacific, sperm whales are distributed widely.  Females and young sperm whales usually remain in tropical and temperate waters year-round, while males move north in the summer to feed in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and waters around the Aleutian
Islands.  In the winter, sperm whales are typically distributed south of 40°N.

<P>The following information was considered in classifying stock structure based on the Dizon et al. (1992) phylogeographic approach:  (1) Distributional data: geographic distribution indicates three "somewhat" discrete population centers (i.e., Hawaii, West Coast of continental U.S., and Alaska); (2) Population response data: unknown; (3) Phenotypic data: unknown; and (4) Genotypic data: unknown.  The International Whaling Commission (IWC) proposed two management stocks (eastern and western) in the North Pacific, but has not reviewed sperm whale stock boundaries in recent years (Donovan 1991).  Based on this limited information, and lacking additional information on sperm whale population structure, three tentative stocks of sperm whales are proposed for the eastern North Pacific: 1)Alaska, 2) California/Oregon/Washington, and 3) Hawaii.

<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>The sperm whale is the most abundant species of the large whales (Braham 1992).  The abundance of sperm whales in the North Pacific was reported by Rice (1989) to be 930,000 in the late 1970s and 1,260,000 prior to exploitation, for which 1979 was the final season for pelagic whaling; confidence intervals were not provided.  These estimates include the California/Oregon/Washington stock, for which a separate abundance estimate is currently available (see Assessment Reports for the Pacific Region).  As the data used in estimating the abundance of sperm whales in the entire North Pacific are well over 5-years old at this time and there are no available estimates for numbers of sperm whales in Alaskan waters, a reliable estimate of current abundance for the Alaskan stock is  not available. 

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable estimate of minimum abundance for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are not available.   

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>Reliable information on trends in abundance for this stock are currently not available (Braham 1992).  

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>It is recommended that the cetacean maximum net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed for this stock at this time (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for this stock is 0.1, the value for cetacean stocks which are classified as endangered (NMFS in prep.).  However, because a reliable estimate of minimum abundance NMIN is currently not available, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There have been no observed reports of incidental mortality related to commercial fishery operations in the North Pacific in the last 5 years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) interim exemption program during the 3-year period between 1990-92, no injuries or mortalities from gear interactions or illegal deterrence were reported.

<P>Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual mortality level is insignificant. 

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>Sperm whales have never been reported to be taken by subsistence hunters (Rice 1989).

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>This stock is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and is, therefore, classified as a strategic stock.  On the basis of total abundance, current distribution, and regulatory measures that are currently in place, it is unlikely that this stock is in danger of extinction or threatened with becoming endangered in the foreseeable future (Braham 1992).

<h3>Baird's Beaked Whale (<EM>Berardius bairdii</EM>): Alaska Stock</h3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM><STRONG>Small, R.J. and D.P. DeMaster. 1995. Alaska marine mammal stock assessments 1995.  U.S. Dep. Commer., NOAA Tech. Memo. NMFS-AFSC-57, 93p.</STRONG></EM></FONT>

<P><STRONG>STOCK DEFINITION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE</STRONG>

<P>Baird's beaked whales inhabit the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent seas (Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Cortez in the southern Gulf of California, Mexico), with the best-known populations occurring in the coastal waters around Japan (Balcomb 1989).  Within the North Pacific Ocean Baird's beaked whales have been sighted in virtually all areas north of 35°N, particularly in regions with submarine escarpments and seamounts (Ohsumi 1983, Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984).  An apparent break in distribution occurs in the eastern Gulf of Alaska, but from mid-Gulf to the Aleutian Islands and in the southern Bering Sea there are numerous sighting records (Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984).  Tomilin (1957) reported that in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, Baird's beaked whales arrive in April-May, and are particularly numerous in summer.  They are the most commonly seen beaked whales within their range, perhaps because they are relatively large and gregarious, traveling in schools of a few to several dozen, which makes them  more noticeable to observers.  Baird's beaked whales are migratory, arriving in continental slope waters during summer and fall months when surface water temperatures are the highest (Dohl et al. 1983, Kasuya 1986).

<P>There are insufficient data to apply the phylogeographic approach to stock structure (Dizon et al. 1992) for Baird's beaked whale.  Therefore, Baird's beaked whale stocks are defined as the two  non-contiguous areas within Pacific U.S. waters where they are found: (1) Alaska and (2) California/Oregon/Washington. These two stocks were defined in this way because of (1) the large distance between the two areas and the lack of any information about whether animals move
between the two areas, (2) the somewhat different oceanographic habitats found in the two areas, and (3) the different fisheries that operate within portions of those two areas, with  bycatch of Baird's beaked whales  only reported from the drift gillnet fishery in California.     
<P><STRONG>POPULATION SIZE</STRONG>

<P>Reliable estimates of abundance for this stock are currently unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Minimum Population Estimate</STRONG>

<P>At this time it is not possible to produce a reliable minimum population estimate (NMIN) for this stock, as current estimates of abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>Current Population Trend</STRONG>

<P>At present, reliable data on trends in population abundance are unavailable.

<P><STRONG>CURRENT AND MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY RATES</STRONG>

<P>A reliable estimate of the maximum net productivity rate is currently unavailable for this stock.  Hence, until additional data become available, it is recommended that the cetacean maximum theoretical net productivity rate (RMAX) of 4% be employed (NMFS in prep.).

<P><STRONG>POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL</STRONG>

<P>Under the 1994 re-authorized Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the potential biological removal (PBR) is defined as the product of the minimum population estimate, one-half the maximum theoretical net productivity rate, and a recovery factor:  PBR = NMIN x 0.5RMAX x FR.  The recovery factor (FR) for these stocks is 0.5, the value for cetacean stocks with unknown population status (NMFS in prep.).  However, in the absence of a reliable estimate of minimum abundance, the PBR for this stock is unknown.

<P><STRONG>ANNUAL HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY AND SERIOUS INJURY	</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Fisheries Information</STRONG>

<P>There have been no observed reports of incidental mortality related to commercial fishery operations in Alaskan waters in the last 5  years.  Based on logbook reports maintained by boat operators required by the MMPA interim exemption program during the 3-year period between 1990-92, no injuries or mortalities from gear interactions or illegal deterrence were reported.  Because the PBR for this stock is unknown, it is currently not possible to determine what annual level of mortality incidental to commercial fisheries is considered insignificant.

<P><STRONG>Subsistence/Native Harvest Information</STRONG>

<P>There is no known subsistence harvest of beaked whales.

<P><STRONG>STATUS OF STOCK</STRONG>

<P>The estimated annual rate of human-caused mortality and serious injury is very minimal for these stocks, and thus the Alaska stock of Baird's beaked whale is not classified as strategic.

The Office of Protected Resources, located in Silver Spring, Maryland, coordinates marine species protection, conservation and restoration for the National Marine Fisheries Service. Authority for these programs comes from two pivotal environmental laws of the 1970's; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. 
</P><P>
Within the office, specialists in marine resources and ecology, fishery biology, and veterinary medicine coordinate and manage programs in the following areas:  Biodiversity Assessment and Conservation, Endangered Species Protection, Marine Mammal Protection, Research and Public Display Permits, and a Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program.  The office assists in managing these programs with regional management offices and science centers located in coastal areas of the United States from New England to the Atlantic coastal states, the Gulf of Mexico, California, the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P><P>
Office actions are governed by the <A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov/protected_species.html">
Recover Protected Species Initiative
</A> of NOAA's Strategic Plan, which proposes to:           
</P><UL>
<LI>
Promote the recovery of currently depleted species and take proactive steps to avoid depletion of species of concern
</LI><LI>
Complete assessments of all protected species
</LI><LI>
Develop management strategies and technologies that will reduce the impact of interactions between protected species and users of marine resources

     I'm appending part of a regular update I prepare for
congressional staff on fisheries and marine mammal public policy
issues as I see them -- a selection of issues which I view as
having potential public policy implications for the U.S.
Congress.   My role is to provide objective, non-partisan,
unbiased public policy analysis for Congress.  Thus, it is useful
weekly to pass this summary by those subscribing to this list to
solicit input about areas where my objectivity could be improved,
where someone's bias shows through and should be adjusted, and
where there are simply other issues of which I am unaware. 
Anyway, what follows is today's summary.  Generally I add new
items every morning, and remove items after they have been on the
summary for about a month.  Items in the summary are modified as
I receive new information.<P>
     In deference to those who have to pay for communications
time, I will post the entire summary once each month on the first
Friday of the month. Today's posting is the longer version for
the first Friday of April 1996.  Please<P>
note that archived copies of "first Friday" longer summaries for
February 1994 through the present are now available at
"http://www.lsu.edu/guests/~sglegal" <P>
     I would appreciate your feedback on this summary.  Comments
should be directed to me (gbuck@crs.loc.gov).  I will post this
summary each Friday on this list as long as I continue to receive
helpful feedback on issues. <P>
     To further assist me in providing a broad scope of
information resources to Congress, I would appreciate being added
to any mailing lists of publications, news releases, newsletters,
etc. relevant to marine mammals and fisheries. Where there is a
subscription cost, a sample copy would provide a basis for
deciding whether or not a subscription could be justified. 
Thanks for your assistance in this matter.<P>

Summary follows:<P>
<P>
Marine Fisheries<P>
     NMFS FY1997 Budget.  On Mar. 19, 1996, the Clinton
Administration's FY1997 budget was released, proposing a 9% ($24
million) increase for fisheries and protected species programs in
the Dept. of Commerce (NMFS) to $306 million.  Included is $10
million in anticipated revenue from proposed fees on
fishing-quota holders.  On Mar. 27, 1996, the House Resources
Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans held an oversight
hearing on the NMFS FY1997 budget. [FY1997 Budget, Greenwire,
personal communication]<P>
     Magnuson Act Reauthorization.  On Mar. 19, 1996, the Senate
Commerce Committee released a 113-page staff working redraft of
S. 39.  At the Senate Commerce Committee mark-up on Mar. 28,
1996, an amended version of S. 39 was reported, incorporating
most of the revisions of the Mar. 19 staff working redraft. 
Provisions of the measure regarding a four and one-half year
moratorium on and federal study of individual quotas remain
highly controversial. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Elimination of Six FMPs.  In early March 1996, Commerce
Secretay Brown announced that NMFS is proposing elimination of
six fishery management plans (FMPs) and implementing regulations. 
The six FMPs (and regions affected) are American lobster (New
England), bluefish (Mid-Atlantic), spiny lobster (South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico), stone crab (Gulf of Mexico), northern
anchovy (Pacific), and high-seas salmon (North Pacific).  These
fisheries are believed to be adequately managed by States or
interstate commissions. [NOAA press release]<P>
Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
     {Sacramento River Spring Chinook.  On Apr. 4, 1996, the CA
Fish and Game Commission voted 3-1 against a study that could
lead to the listing of Sacramento River's spring chinook salmon
as endangered under CA State law.  However, the Commissioners
agreed to reconsider the issue in three months.} [Assoc Press]<P> 
    {Canadian Salmon Revitalization.  On Mar. 29, 1996, Canada's
Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin announced a far-reaching proposal
on revitalization of the Canadian salmon industry, including a
voluntary C$80 million salmon vessel buy-back program, other
measures to reduce total salmon fleet capacity by 50%, area
licensing for all salmon fishers, and single-gear licensing for
gillnet and troll license holders.  No special assistance or
compensation programs were announced to deal with fisheries
unemployment.} [Assoc Press]<P>
     {Dworshak Dam.  On Mar. 29, 1996, Army Corps of Engineers
officials announced that they were delaying a grouting project at
the dam and would not require water drawdowns in the reservoir
this summer.  On Apr. 1, 1996, a federal executive committee on
salmon restoration rejected any commitment to maintain specific
water levels in Dworshak Reservoir and not draw down the water
level as extensively as has been done in years past.  The
committee decided that a plan for Dworshak water use will not be
finalized until June.} [Assoc Press]<P>
     Wild Chinook and Steelhead Juvenile Migration.  In late
March 1996, ID Fish and Game Dept. biologists predicted only
220,000 wild juvenile chinook salmon would pass Lower Granite Dam
on their downstream migration this spring.  This is a record low
estimate and compares to 1.3 million wild juvenile chinook salmon
counted last year.  Wild juveniles will be joined by about 1.7
million hatchery-reared chinook juveniles.  About 567,000 wild
juvenile steelhead trout are estimated to pass Lower Granite Dam,
a decrease of 126,000 from last year's count.  Wild steelhead
will be joined by about 8.3 million juvenile hatchery-reared
steelhead. [Assoc Press]  <P>
     Steelhead Trout ESA Listing.  In mid-March 1996, U.S.
District Judge Susan Illston (San Francisco, CA) ruled that the
lack of budgeted funds for new Endangered Species Act (ESA)
listings excuses NMFS from meeting deadlines for acting on
petitions to list West Coast steelhead trout as endangered or
threatened under the ESA.  Environmental and fishing groups that
had filed suit in Sept. 1995 to force NMFS to act on listing
petitions were granted attorneys' fees since they had proven
violation of law. [Assoc Press] <P>
<A NAME=QuickMark></A>     Oregon Attorney General's Opinion on
Klamath Water.  In mid-March 1996, Oregon's Assistant Attorney
General Stephen Sanders issued an opinion that the federal
government has no authority to take water set aside for
irrigation and allow it to flow down the Klamath River to protect
salmon. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Clinton FY1997 Budget.  On Mar. 19, 1996, the
Administration's FY1997 budget was released, proposing $107
million for the Corps of Engineers to construct and improve
juvenile fish bypass facilities at eight Corps dams on the
Columbia and Snake Rivers.  A three-year initiative proposes $111
million to remove two dams and restore Washington's Elwha River.
[FY1997 Budget, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Portland Oregonian
via Greenwire, Corps of Engineers press release]<P>
     Salmonberry Railroad Repair.  On Mar. 17, 1996, the Port of
Tillamook, OR, agreed to limit railroad repair work in the
Salmonberry River drainage after fishing interests complained
that sediment and disturbance could harm wild steelhead trout and
that the railway should be abandoned. Repair crews have agreed to
be out of the riverbed by Apr. 1 when steelhead spawning peaks. 
Repair of the railway is being partially funded by Federal
disaster relief because February 1996 floods caused the damage.
[Assoc Press, personal communication]<P>
     Idaho Power Settles with Nez Perce Tribe.  On Mar. 15, 1996,
Idaho Power Co. announced that it had agreed to pay the Nez Perce
Tribe $16.5 million over a period of several years to settle a
1992 lawsuit over lost  fishing rights due to construction of
three dams in the Hells Canyon area.  The Nez Perce have
committed $5 million of the settlement payments to fish
restoration efforts.  Payment of part of the settlement is
contingent upon Nez Perce support of Idaho Power Company's dam
relicensing application before the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Salvage Timber Suit.  On Mar. 13, 1996, the Klamath Tribes
filed suit in U.S. District Court, Portland, OR, charging that
their Treaty hunting and fishing rights are being violated by
eight timber sales in the Winema and Fremont National Forests
permitted under the recent salvage logging enactment. [Portland
Oregonian and Medford Mail Tribune via Greenwire] <P>
     Another Salmon Suit.  On Mar. 14, 1996, eight fishermen's
and environmental groups filed suit in federal court charging
that NMFS, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of
Reclamation are violating the Endangered Species Act by
developing salmon restoration measures that fall short of what is
required for operating 8 dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers
to meet flow targets, and failing to follow even their flawed
restoration plan.  Judge Malcolm Marsh is likely to hear this
case.  On Mar. 22, 1996, the Yakima Indian Nation announced that
it would join the eight fishermen's and environmental group in
this suit. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Early Salmon Release.  On Mar. 12, 1996, negotiations were
completed allowing Oregon, Washington, and NMFS each to
contribute $110,000 for maintenance of 8.2 million juvenile fall
chinook salmon in two hatcheries through April and May, instead
of releasing the fish early.  Early release was scheduled for
Mar. 15 after FY1996 Mitchell Act funding for Columbia Basin
hatcheries was reduced by $3.5 million.  About 8 million juvenile
fall chinook salmon were released early from the Bonneville
hatchery. [Assoc Press]<P>
     USDA Salmon Purchases.  On Mar. 8, 1996, U.S. Dept. of
Agriculture officials announced that USDA planned to purchase
surplus canned pink salmon from the 1995 harvest that was
voluntarily inspected under a Dept. of Commerce program, with
additional salmon to be purchased from the 1996 harvest.  Canned
salmon will be used in USDA food bank and school lunch programs. 
Alaskan critics say this purchase would take only a small
percentage of the 1.8-million-case industry surplus because only
about 3% of the harvest was inspected, with a near-record harvest
predicted for 1996.  On Mar. 19, 1996, the Senate adopted
Amendment 3524 to H.R. 3019 (FY1996 Continuing Appropriations)
removing a requirement that canned salmon purchased by USDA must
be packed under a voluntary inspection program. [Congr. Record,
Assoc Press]<P>
     1996 Salmon Regulations.  On Mar. 11-15, 1996, the Pacific
Fishery Management Council met in Portland, OR, to adopt
preliminary options for regulating the 1996 salmon harvest in
waters offshore of Washington, Oregon, and California.  On Mar.
15, 1996, the Council approved four harvest options and
criticized a Mar. 11 order from NMFS requiring the Council to
protect winter chinook from the Sacramento River resulting in a
50% reduction of chinook salmon harvests off California. 
Otherwise proposed Option 2 harvests would be similar to the 1995
season.  After public hearings, final regulations will be adopted
at meetings Apr. 8-12, 1996, in San Francisco, CA.  Although
Oregon coastal natural coho salmon returns are predicted to
improve slightly from 60,000 last year to 63,000 in 1996, chinook
salmon returns to the Sacramento River drainage will be sharply
lower (500,000 fish) than last year's record return of 1.3
million fish. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Salmon Price-Fixing Suit.  On Mar. 6, 1996, Anchorage (AK)
Superior Court Judge Larry Card indicated that, although
defendants would not be prohibited from communicating with
fishermen, fishermen who signed waivers might not be excluded
from the $720 million class action suit wherein Bristol Bay
salmon fishermen charge more than two dozen defendants with
conspiring to set salmon prices.  Class certification and
tentative settlements are to be filed by Mar. 22; defendants may
file their opposition to class action by May 24, and plaintiffs
rebuttal must be made by June 21. [Assoc Press] <p>
     Salmon and Steelhead Conference.  On Apr. 26-30, 1996, a
Sustainable Fisheries Conference entitled "Towards Sustainable
Fisheries: Balancing the Conservation and Use of Salmon and
Steelhead in the Pacific Northwest" will convene in the Victoria
Conference Center, Victoria, British Columbia.  This conference
is sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Fisheries Foundation
and the North Pacific International Chapter of the American
Fisheries Society. [personal communication]<P>
     NPPC Meeting.  On Mar. 12, 1996, the Northwest Power
Planning Council (NPPC) met and accepted public comments in
Spokane, WA, as part of a 180-day review of salmon recovery
measures required by language in FY1996 energy and water
appropriations legislation.  Additional meetings are to be
scheduled in Seattle and the Pasco/Kennewick area. [Assoc Press]  
     Pacific Salmon Treaty.  In early March 1996, Canadian
officials sent a protest to the U.S. Dept. of State disputing
U.S. interpretation of  international maritime law as expressed
in Title IV of P.L. 104-43, the Fisheries Act of 1995.  This
measure dealt with reimbursement for U.S. fishermen charged fees
by Canada in 1994 for vessel transit between Washington State and
Alaska, and says that the United States will not tolerate any
future action by Canada that would impede or restrict transit. 
On Mar. 12, 1996, British Columbia fisheries managers announced
that only about 1.3 million sockeye salmon are expected to return
to the Fraser River drainage this year -- one of the weakest
returns since the 1950s.  The weak return is unlikely to support
a commercial harvest.  On Mar. 28, 1996, Canadian fisheries
officials announced that there would likely be no fishery
whatsoever for Fraser River sockeye salmon this year, unless
return estimates improve.  As few as 1.4 million sockeye salmon
are forecast to return to the Fraser River system.  {On Mar. 28,
1996, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy suggested that the
United States and Canada consider using arbitration to settle
salmon treaty differences.} [Assoc Press, Reuters]<P>
     Idaho Salmon Policy.  On Mar. 11, 1996, the Idaho Senate
followed State House action and voted 29-6 to provide 427,000
acre-feet of Snake River water annually for four years to the
Bureau of Reclamation for enhancing salmon migration on a
"willing-seller, willing-buyer" basis.  The Senate also voted
29-6 to approve a resolution objecting to flow augmentation and
reservoir drawdown as long-term solutions to salmon recovery.
[Assoc Press, Northwest Power Planning Council press release]<P>  
   Pacific Northwest Floods.  In early March 1996, Oregon Fish
and Wildlife Dept. managers reported heavy mortalities of clams
in Yaquina and Alsea Bays due to siltation and excessive
freshwater runoff; losses are also anticipated in Nestucca,
Netarts, Tillamook, and Nehalem Bays. [Assoc Press, Portland
Oregonian via Greenwire]<P>
Aquaculture<P>
     U.S. Pen-Raised Salmon Production Increases.  In early March
1996, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's Economic Research Service
reported that U.S. production of pen-raised salmon increased 36%
in 1995 to a total of 34 million pounds. [Assoc Press]<P>
Freshwater Fisheries<p>
     Klamath River Fisheries Case in Supreme Court.  On Mar. 25,
1996, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case wherein Oregon
ranchers and irrigation districts seek the ability to use the
citizen suit provisions of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to
force legal action potentially detrimental to ESA-listed fish
species (Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker). [Greenwire]<P>

        {Magnuson Reauthorization Bill Report Filed.  On May 23,
1996, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation reported S. 39, amending and reauthorizing the
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.} [Congr.
Record]<p>
        North Pacific Warming.  On May 17, 1996, NMFS scientists
reported uncommonly warm temperatures have been observed in the
North Pacific since October 1995, without any El Nino pattern
existing. [Assoc Press]        <P>
        Pelican Seafood Processing Facility.  On May 4, 1996, the
Kake Tribal Corp. announced that it would be purchasing the
Pelican Seafood processing plant in Pelican, AK, this week and
reopen the facility within a month.  On May 22, 1996, Kake Tribal
Corp. announced that negotiations to buy the Pelican Seafood
processing plant were almost concluded and that the plant would
reopen by June 10, 1996. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
        Scientific Board Meeting.  On May 28, 1996, the
Independent Scientific Advisory Board held its inaugural meeting
in Portland, OR.  The Board is an 11-member committee formed by
NMFS and the Northwest Power Planning Council (NPPC) to better
review, inform, monitor, and advise salmon recovery efforts.
[NPPC press release, Assoc Press]<P>
        USDA Salmon Purchases.  On May 22, 1996, the U.S. Dept.
of Agriculture announced that it would purchase Alaska pink
salmon valued at as much as $14 million for the school lunch and
other nutrition programs.  This program will purchase salmon from
the upcoming 1996 harvest, although some stockpiled canned salmon
from the 1995 harvest may also be considered. [Assoc Press,
Reuters]<P>
        NPPC Executive Order.  On May 15, 1996, the Northwest
Power Planning Council (NPPC) met in Pasco, WA, and approved a
report for Congress that requests the Clinton Administration
issue an Executive Order giving the NPPC more authority over
federal agencies to better coordinate salmon restoration efforts. 
Such an Order would require federal agencies to take actions
consistent with the NPPC's fish and wildlife plan.  If no
Executive Order is forthcoming, the report suggests that Congress
should amend the 1980 Northwest Power Act to give the NPPC the
necessary authority. [Assoc Press, NPPC press release]<P>
        Award for Salmon Habitat Restoration.  On May 7, 1996,
the American Forest &amp; Paper Assoc. announced that the Hancock
Timber Resource Group (Boston, MA) would receive its fourth
annual Wildlife Stewardship Award for its comprehensive salmon
management program focusing on wild salmon habitat restoration on

        Public Utility Salmon Concessions.  On May 6, 1996, the
Chelan County (WA) Public Utility District voted 3-2 to withdraw
from the "Northwesterners for More Fish" campaign after receiving
NMFS concessions likely to include seats on salmon recovery
committees and consideration of a flow study for juvenile salmon
passage. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Alaska Salmon Management.  On May 3, 1996, the Alaska
Senate passed, by an 11-8 vote, a bill directing the State to
manage salmon by individual drainage, requiring that the Board of
Fisheries set spawning goals  for each stream and assure that
such goals were met. [Assoc Press] <P>
        Salmon Price Protest.  On May 2, 1996, salmon fishers at
Moss Landing, CA, protested prices offered by processors by not
fishing or by giving salmon away free to the public rather than
selling to processors.  Processors cite an abundance of salmon on
the world market as the reason for low prices. [Assoc Press]<P>   
     ESA Salmon Listings.  On May 6, 1996, NMFS officials
announced that Endangered Species Act listing proposals for
steelhead trout from northern California to Washington State were
anticipated this spring and that a proposal on coastal coho
salmon in California and Oregon would be released by July 1996. 
On May 28, 1996, NMFS officials announced that a preliminary
decision on whether to list {10 populations of} Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, and California steelhead trout as threatened
or endangered would be issued by early December 1996.  A decision
on listing Umpqua River, OR, cutthroat trout will be announced by
early September 1996.  A decision on whether to list Oregon and
Northern California coho salmon will be postponed until 1997.

Whitewater Rafting Restrictions.  On May 1, 1996, U.S. Forest
Service officials in the Sawtooth National Forest
announced new restrictions for rafters and private boaters on the
upper Salmon River, ID, beginning {Aug. 21, 1996.}  Rafters and
boaters will be required to carry their craft around selected
salmon spawning areas.  In 1995, three dozen salmon were reported
to have spawned in the stretch of river used by 11,000 floaters. 
Camping along the river will also be restricted to designated
sites. [Assoc Press] <P>
        Kenai River Habitat Protection.  In early May 1996, state
and federal managers announced that 15 areas of about 16 miles of
river bank, most on public lands, would be closed to fishing from
July 1 through Sept. 15 this summer. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Canadian Salmon Fleet Restructuring.  On May 2, 1996,
Canadian Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin traveled to BC to listen
to fishers' concerns.  On May 8, 1996, protesting fishers
occupied the Vancouver and Tofino DFO offices.  On May 9, 1996,
BC Premier Glen Clark announced a new agency, Fishery Renewal
B.C., would be established to develop habitat conservation plans
and draft a new strategy to reduce the fishing fleet.  On May 16,
1996, DFO officials planned to ask the BC Supreme Court for an
injunction to force protestors to leave DFO offices.  On May 21,
1996, the BC government announced that it is seeking a court
injunction to halt the DFO plan to reduce the salmon fleet,
claiming the plan exceeds authority to alter license conditions. 
On May 22, 1996, Canadian Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin
announced the appointment of BC lawyer Jim Matkin to chair the
Fleet Reduction Committee, which will oversee the voluntary
license retirement program.  Bids for retiring licenses are due
by May 24, with the entire program to be completed by June 30,
1996.  On May 23, 1996, BC Supreme Court Justice John Cowan
rejected an injunction to halt the federal plan.  As of May 23,
1996, a total of 780 fishermen had signed up for the federal
license buy-back program to retire their vessels. [Assoc Press,

        Pacific Salmon Treaty.  On May 7, 1996, federal and State
fisheries officials met to discuss quotas for 1996 Southeast
Alaska chinook salmon harvests.  On May 4, 1996, Alaska Governor
Tony Knowles announced that he would meet with Oregon Governor
John Kitzhaber and Washington Governor Mike Lowry on May 20 in
Sitka, AK, to discuss salmon harvest strategies and develop a
unified approach to negotiations with Canada.  On May 9, 1996,
Canada's negotiator, Ambassador John Fraser, met with selected
Pacific Northwest Senators and staff.  On May 12, 1996, Canadian
Member of Parliament Joe Comuzzi announced that an agreement had
been reached during a May 10 interparliamentary conference to
reimburse the United States for transit fees imposed on U.S.
fishers in 1994.  However, on May 13, 1996, Canadian Foreign
Affairs officials confirmed that there has been no change in
Canadian policy and that Canada does not plan to reimburse the
United States for the 1994 transit fees.  On May 14, 1996,
Canadian Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin indicated that some
fishing will be allowed on Fraser  River salmon stocks this year. 
On May 16, 1996, Canadian negotiators suggested that an
independent public review panel be convened to break the Treaty
impasse.  On May 20, 1996, Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, Oregon
Governor John Kitzhaber, and Washington Governor Mike Lowry met
in Sitka, AK, signed an agreement to restore salmon stocks, and
adopted 11 principles for cooperative salmon conservation.  On
May 24, 1996, Canada announced a ban on troll fishing for chinook
salmon off the West Coast of Vancouver Island as well as a
partial ban on net fishing to conserve chinook salmon stocks.

<BODY><A NAME=QuickMark></A>Fisheries Groups:<P>
     I'm appending part of a regular update I prepare for
congressional staff on fisheries and marine mammal public policy
issues as I see them -- a selection of issues which I view as
having potential public policy implications for the U.S.
Congress.   My role is to provide objective, non-partisan,
unbiased public policy analysis for Congress.  Thus, it is useful
weekly to pass this summary by those subscribing to this list to
solicit input about areas where my objectivity could be improved,
where someone's bias shows through and should be adjusted, and
where there are simply other issues of which I am unaware. 
Anyway, what follows is today's summary.  Generally I add new
items every morning, and remove items after they have been on the
summary for about a month.  Items in the summary are modified as
I receive new information.<P>
     In deference to those who have to pay for communications
time, I post the entire summary once each month on the first
Friday of the month, for those who do not monitor the group each
week or wish the more complete format. This is the longer first
Friday posting for August 1996.<P>
NOTE:  Archived copies of "first Friday" longer summaries for
February 1994 through the present are now available at:<P>
       "http://www.lsu.edu/guests/sglegal/public_html/"<P>
     I would appreciate your feedback on this summary.  Comments
should be directed to me (gbuck@crs.loc.gov).  I will post this
summary each Friday on this list as long as I continue to receive
helpful feedback on issues. <P>
     To further assist me in providing a broad scope of
information resources to Congress, I would appreciate being added
to any mailing lists of publications, news releases, newsletters,
etc. relevant to marine mammals and fisheries. Where there is a
subscription cost, a sample copy would provide a basis for
deciding whether or not a subscription could be justified. 
Thanks for your assistance in this matter.<P>

        {World Fisheries Council Formed.  On July 31, 1996, world
fishery scientists meeting in Brisbane, Australia, at the Second
World Fisheries Congress founded a non-governmental World
Fisheries Council, to monitor global fisheries and recommend
management measures based on best scientific knowledge.  Council
information and data would be distributed rapidly and at no cost
to all nations.} [Dow Jones News, Assoc Press]<p>
     Illegal High Seas Driftnet.  On July 6, 1996, the U.S. Coast
Guard cutter Boutwell intercepted an unidentifiable 110-foot
fishing vessel using a 2-mile long illegal driftnet to catch
salmon, 250 miles southwest of Attu Island in the Aleutians.  As
of July 8, the Boutwell was 500 miles southwest of Attu and still
following the vessel, which had cut loose its driftnet.  On July
9,  1996, the vessel, now 700 miles southwest of Attu, ran up a
Taiwanese flag and identified itself as the Chang Fu 31.  The
U.S. Coast Guard is seeking permission from Taiwanese officials
to board the vessel.  On July 11, 1996, the U.S. Coast Guard, now
1,200 miles southwest of Attu, continued to pursue the Chang Fu
31, which was reported by Taiwanese authorities to have been
prosecuted in 1989 for salmon violations.  The Taiwanese
government reported it plans to prosecute the owners of the Chang
Fu 31 for driftnet violations.  On July 13, 1996, U.S. Coast
Guard personnel and Taiwanese police boarded the Chang Fu 31 600
miles off the Japanese coast.  No nets or fish were found aboard
the vessel.  The U.S. Coast Guard will continue to escort the
Chang Fu 31 toward Taiwan and a meeting with a Taiwanese patrol
vessel.  On July 18, 1996, a second Taiwanese patrol vessel met
the Chang Fu 31 about 420 miles off the Japanese coast, and the
U.S. Coast Guard cutter Boutwell departed to return to U.S.
waters.  On July 25, 1996, the captain of the Charngder No. 2
(previously referred to erroneously as the Chang Fu 31) admitted
to a Taiwanese prosecutor that he had fished for salmon with an
illegal driftnet following orders from the vessel's owner.  Crew
members reported that 6 tons of salmon were sold to another
vessel on June 26 and about 60 tons of salmon were discarded
overboard after the U.S. Coast Guard spotted the vessel. [Assoc

        Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
        Steelhead ESA Listing.  On July 25, 1996, Secretary of
the Interior Babbitt announced that on July 30, 1996 the federal
government will recommend that several west coast steelhead trout
populations be added to the Endangered Species List, decisions on
several additional populations will be deferred, and listing will
be denied to several populations.  A total of 15 populations were
studied for possible protection.  {On July 30, 1996, NMFS
announced that it was proposing that 5 Pacific coast steelhead
trout populations be listed as endangered (central and southern
CA and upper Columbia River, WA) and 5 populations be listed as
threatened (northern CA, coastal OR, and Snake River, ID), and
that listing of four populations is not warranted (coastal WA and
Willamette River, WA).  The middle Columbia River population will
be considered a candidate for further study.} [Assoc Press, NMFS

        USDA Salmon Purchases.  On July 25, 1996, the
Administrator of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's Agricultural
Marketing Service announced that USDA would purchase as much as
$14 million in pink salmon products from the 1995 and 1996
harvests for school lunch and other feeding programs.  $10
million will be spent for canned pink salmon with as much as $4
million for pink salmon nuggets and pink salmon in 4-pound
pouches.  Bids for purchase would be solicited from salmon
processors beginning Aug. 12, 1996. [Assoc Press]<P>
        {Floatboat Regulations Upheld.  In late July 1996, the
Deputy Regional Forester of the Intermountain Region, Clair
Beasley, upheld changes in regulations announced in May 1996 for
floatboats on the Salmon River, with minor modifications to
consult with floatboat permit holders to set permit standards and
consequences for permit violations.  Beasley eliminated a
provision whereby permitees could lose permit rights
permanently.} [Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon Recovery Plan Injunction.  On July 23, 1996,
representatives of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund announced
that a limited agreement had been negotiated with the Clinton
Administration to spill more water for salmon at Snake and
Columbia River dams this summer.  As a result of the agreement,
the June 12, 1996 request by 10 environmental groups for a
preliminary injunction was dropped. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Bristol Bay Salmon Price-Fixing Suit.  On July 23, 1996,
a plaintiffs' motion was filed in Alaska Superior Court asking
Judge Larry to approve settlements in part of this case with nine
defendants totalling an estimated $425,000, on the condition that
the pending lawsuit is certified as a class action.  Plaintiffs
had filed a $720 million lawsuit alleging price-fixing by 
Bristol Bay sockeye salmon processors and several major Japanese
firms. Additional settlements are anticipated. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Snake River Basin Water Release Plans.  On July 17, 1996,
a regional committee approved an agreement between states,
tribes, and federal agencies for summer 1996 water releases in
the Snake River basin.  The agreement provides that Dworshak
Reservoir will drop only 20 feet by mid-August, with needed water
coming from a 35-foot drop at Brownlee Reservoir.  Warmer
Brownlee water will be released first with colder Dworshak water
to be used later.  Dworshak Reservoir would be lowered to between
55 and 60 feet below full by the end of August, with an
additional 20 foot drop scheduled for September.  In mid-July
1996, Payette River, ID, water users reached agreement on
managing water releases from Cascade Reservoir.  To assist
salmon, 72,500 acre-feet will be released annually during July
and August, with the remaining 72,500 acre-feet to be released in
winter. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Elwha Dam Removal.  On July 16, 1996, the Senate
Committee on Appropriations ordered H.R. 3662 (FY1997 Dept. of
Interior appropriations) reported, with Sec. 115 containing an
amendment to P.L. 102-495 (Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries
Restoration Act) permitting the State of Washington to purchase
Elwha Dam and Glines Dam after these dams are acquired by the
federal government and thereafter repealing P.L. 102-495.  The
State of Washington would then assume responsibility for removal
of both dams. [Greenwire, personal communication]<P>
        Salmon Recovery Funding.  On July 16, 1996, the Senate
Committee on Appropriations ordered S. 1959 (FY1997
appropriations for energy and water development) reported, with
language in Title V directing the Northwest Power Planning
Council to appoint a five-member Independent Scientific Review
Panel that would review and recommend Bonneville Power
Administration funding awards for Columbia River basin salmon
restoration projects.  Panel members are to be nominated by the
National Academy of Sciences. [Assoc Press, personal

        {Record Skeena River Sockeye Return.  In mid-July 1996,
Canada's Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans reported a record return
of 2 million more sockeye salmon than the 3-4 million anticipated
in British Columbia's Skeena River.} [Assoc Press]<P>
        Lower Return of Bristol Bay Sockeye Salmon.  In mid-July
1996, Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game managers revised estimates to
recognize that the Kvichak-Lake Iliamna drainage would likely
receive only about 1.5 million of a predicted 4 million sockeye
salmon return.  The June 1996 fishery on sockeye salmon moving
through False Pass in the Aleutians was so low that many eastern
Aleutian villages are facing financial problems.  Fish sales and
raw fish tax revenues are expected to be only about $15,000 this
year in False Pass, compared to $100,000 last year. [Assoc
Press]<P>
        Fertilizer Spill Penalty Use.  On July 11, 1996, Idaho
Governor Batt approved use of $24,000 in mitigation funds derived
from a state suit against a trucking company for a Dec. 1987
accident when a tractor-trailer carrying red fertilizer dumped
chemicals into the Little Salmon River, killing all fish for
miles.  Funded projects, to be conducted by local Soil
Conservation Districts and a chapter of Trout Unlimited, will
improve salmon and steelhead trout habitat on private property
along the Little Salmon River. [Assoc Press]<P>
        British Columbia Salmon Fleet Restructuring.  On July 11,
1996, the BC government released a study projecting that the jobs
of 2,200 salmon fishers are a risk from the DFO's West Coast
commercial salmon fleet restructuring proposal.  In addition, the
study estimated that the jobs of 6,200 fishers, shoreworkers, and
sport fish industry workers are threatened by this year's poor
fishing season.  On July 15, 1996, Canada's Dept. of Fisheries
and Oceans signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the British
Columbia government recognizing an agreement to review their
respective roles and responsibilities in managing the Pacific
salmon fishery.  This review is to be concluded by February 1997.
[Assoc Press, personal communication]<P>
        Salmon Processing Labor Shortage.  On July 10, 1996, the
Alaska Labor Dept. issued a call for additional seasonal laborers
for Alaska seafood processing plants to process unexpectedly
large quantities of salmon.  As many as 500 temporary workers are
needed, primarily in the Anchorage, Kenai, Valdez, Petersburg,
and Bethel areas. [Assoc Press] <P>
        Lake Washington Sport Sockeye Fishery.  On July 13, 1996,
a 3-day sport fishery for sockeye salmon will open on Lake
Washington, near Seattle, WA.  This is the first opening of this
fishery since 1988, in response to an estimated return of about
450,000 fish to the Cedar River drainage.  An estimated harvest
of 100,000 fish is to be evenly divided between sport anglers and
Indian treaty harvesters. [Assoc Press, WA Dept. of Fish and Game
press release]<P>
        Mitchell Act Hearing.  The House Resource Committee's
Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans has indefinitely
postponed an oversight hearing on Mitchell Act hatcheries in the
Columbia River basin, which had been tentatively scheduled for
July 16, 1996. [personal communication]<P>
        Record Alaska Chum Salmon Catch.  In early July 1996,
Alaska biologists reported that southeast Alaska chum salmon
catch may be twice as large as the 10 million fish originally
estimated.  Hatchery programs contributed substantially to the
increased chum salmon abundance, and the abundance has depressed
prices paid to fishermen.  In mid-July 1996, the sport catch
limit for chum salmon was doubled in some portions of southeast
Alaska.  At least one southeast Alaska hatchery began
controversial roe-stripping chum salmon, taking eggs but dumping
about 500,000 salmon carcasses.  The price of chum salmon has
fallen to as low as $.05 per pound and all the excess fish cannot
be given away.  Other hatcheries have applied to the State of
Alaska for dumping permits.  {On July 30, 1996, Earth (an
Anchorage, Alaska emergency food assistance group) filed suit
with the Alaska Supreme Court seeking to halt roe stripping from
chum and pink salmon and dumping of salmon carcasses by Alaska
salmon hatcheries. Earth charges that the Alaska Dept. of Fish
and Game did not have the authority to exempt hatcheries from
Alaska's salmon waste law; Earth would like to see salmon
carcasses shipped to food banks.} [Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon Price-Fixing Suit.  On July 12, 1996, Alaska
Superior Court Judge John Reese has scheduled a hearing on
whether to certify as a class action the $720 million lawsuit
alleging 26 seafood processors and 10 Japanese trading companies
with conspiring since 1989 to fix the price of Bristol Bay
sockeye salmon. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Pacific Salmon Treaty.  On July 10, 1996, the 10-day
Southeast Alaska commercial troll harvest of chinook salmon ended
with an estimated catch of 65,000 fish.  Once the catch is more
accurately determined, a decision will be made on whether to
reopen the fishery in August.  Canadian officials announced they
are considering random inspections of U.S. fishing vessels
traveling between Alaska and Washington State and possible court
action against Alaska to indicate their displeasure and concern. 
On July 15, 1996, Canadian officials asked the Pacific Salmon
Commission to establish a technical dispute settlement board to
review scientific and technical disagreement and address chinook
salmon concerns raised by the recent agreement among U.S. states
by Sept. 30, 1996.  This is the first time under this Treaty that
either nation has requested such a non-binding dispute resolution
panel.  In addition, Canadian officials announced that U.S.
vessels transiting Canadian waters will be required to request
clearance from the Canadian Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans and, if
clearance is granted, will be required to stow their fishing gear
while in Canadian waters.  On July 19, 1996, the WA State Dept.
of Fish and Wildlife along with federal and tribal officials
concluded successful negotiations with Canada for a one-year
agreement on catch levels for Washington-bound coho salmon and
British Columbia-bound sockeye salmon, permitting a catch of
75,000 coho salmon along the Washington coast.  Canada agreed to
limit its commercial harvest of coho salmon along the west coast
of Vancouver Island to 1 million fish, while Washington agreed to
a conservative plan for a Treaty tribe harvest of 30,000 to
50,000 summer-run sockeye salmon bound for BC's Fraser River. 
Based on pre-season forecasts and escapement objectives, no
non-tribal commercial fishery for Fraser River sockeye salmon
will be permitted.  If actual returns  are larger than
anticipated, the U.S. share of any commercial harvest will be
16.1%.  {On July 23, 1996, Canada's Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans
announced that new regulations on foreign fishing vessel
clearance will be enforced beginning July 29, 1996.  The new
regulations do not apply to U.S. sport fishing vessels.  On July
30, 1996, the Pacific Salmon Commission reported that the Fraser
River sockeye salmon return appeared slightly better than
anticipated, with about 500,000 sockeye in the early summer run
compared to an early prediction of 233,000 fish.  Predictions for
the total Fraser River sockeye return have been increased from
1.6 million to 1.85 million.  It will be 10 days to 2 weeks until
numbers of returning sockeye are well enough known to determine
whether any commercial harvest might be allowed.  On Aug. 1,
1996, Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game officials announced revised
catch statistics of 74,000 salmon for early July 10-day southeast
Alaska commercial troll chinook salmon fishery.} [Assoc Press,

        Alaska Subsistence Fishery Management.  In late June
1996, the U.S. Dept. of the Interior issued a report
"Implications of a Federal Management of Subsistence Fisheries in
Alaska" estimating that assumption of management of Alaska
fisheries for subsistence would cost the federal government $31
million without state assistance, excluding $1 billion to replace
state equipment necessary to manage these fisheries. [Assoc

        Salmon Harvest Weir Contract Award.  On July 16, 1996,
the Michigan Administrative Board approved the Sault Tribe of
Chippewa Indians' bid of $0.17 per pound of fish and $2.20 per
pound for loose eggs to operate the State of Michigan's six
salmon harvest weirs.  Only two bids were submitted for this
contract. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Umpqua Cutthroat Trout.  In early July 1996, U.S.
District Judge Donald C. Ashmanskas made public an order, in
response to December 1995 lawsuit by fishing and environmental
groups, that NMFS decide by July 31, 1996, whether it will list
Umpqua River sea-run cutthroat trout under the Endangered Species
Act.  {On July 30, 1996, NMFS announced that it would list all
Umpqua River, OR, cutthroat trout as endangered.} [Assoc Press,

        Lake Erie Commercial Fishing.  On July 1, 1996, the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Sept. 1994 lower court
decision and ruled that Ohio's restrictions on commercial fishing
in Lake Erie are valid.  Commercial fishers had challenged Ohio's
regulations as too restrictive and favoring sport anglers. [Assoc

<BODY>Subject: 5/3/96 (LONG)-<A NAME=QuickMark></A>- Info Summary
for U.S. Congress and Staff <P>
(Partial report received from Gene Buck.  Complete report
available at:
"http://www.lsu.edu/guests/sglegal/public_html/")<P>
<P>
Salmon Fisheries <P>
        South Unimak-False Pass Salmon Fishery.  On Apr. 15,
1996, the Alaska Board of Fisheries approved an explanation of
its June South Unimak and False Pass sockeye salmon interception
fishery management plan, as a required condition for lifting the
injunction on this fishery imposed by  Superior Court Judge
Richard Ehrlich and allowing this fishery to occur.  Controversy
had arisen over the Board's decision to allow a bycatch of
700,000 chum salmon when 60% of the intercepted chum salmon are
bound for Northwest Alaska drainages -- many of which have had
commercial and subsistence fisheries reduced, restricted, or
closed in recent years.  On Apr. 15, 1996, the Board also amended
its plan to require full retention of all salmon caught during
the fishery. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Coho Salmon Restoration Funding.  On Apr. 12, 1996,
Oregon's Legislative Emergency Board delayed a funding decision
until June 21, 1996, on providing $1 million for Gov. John
Kitzhaber's Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative and another $1
million for watershed projects focused on keeping coho salmon
from being listed as threatened as has been proposed by NMFS.
[Assoc Press]<P>
        Oregon Spill Variance.  On Apr. 12, 1996, the Oregon
Environmental Quality Commission unanimously approved a variance
for NMFS allowing water spilled over Columbia River dams to
exceed the State's dissolved nitrogen standard of 110% to a limit
of as much as 120%.  However, conditions attached to the variance
raise concern for NMFS officials, including a requirement that
the impact of spills and spawning be determined, that an
empirical estimate of the survival of spilled salmon be made, and
that all violations of the variance be reported in writing within
24 hours of occurrence. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Canadian Aboriginal Fisheries Lawsuit.  In early April
1996, three fishermen filed a lawsuit against the Canadian
government on behalf of all British Columbia salmon and herring
commercial fishermen, charging mismanagement of salmon stocks and
seeking to declare current aboriginal fishing policy
unconstitutional and to recover damages. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Oregon Irrigation Lawsuit.  On Apr. 10, 1996, WaterWatch,
Oregon Trout, and the Northwest Environmental Defense Center
filed a lawsuit in Marion County Circuit Court charging that the
State of Oregon's Dept. of Water Resources grant of one-year
extensions of nine permits allowing Boeing Agri-Industrial
irrigators to draw 50,000 acre-feet of water from the McNary Dam
reservoir on the Columbia River would threaten salmon
restoration. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Alaska Sport Fishing Initiative.  On Apr. 5, 1996, Alaska
Superior Court Judge Larry Weeks rejected a bid by commercial
fishermen to remove a sport fishing initiative from the November
1996 election ballot for violating  the Alaska State Constitution
by appropriating public assets via the ballot box.  The
initiative would require that as much as 5% of the State's
projected salmon catch be reserved each year for sport anglers.
[Assoc Press]<P>
        Low SE Alaska Winter Chinook Catch.  By early April 1996,
the winter chinook salmon catch in SE Alaska was reported by
Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game managers to be falling short of its
45,000 fish cap.  Only 7,200 fish have been taken, possibly due
to severe winter weather and low fish prices, with the season
closing Apr. 14. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Columbia Salmon Downstream Migration.  In early April
1996, NMFS managers announced that high water conditions in the
Columbia and Snake River basins indicate a 50-50 split between
downstream barging and natural migration will be adopted for
juvenile salmon this spring.  In 1995, between 70% and 78% of
downstream migrating juvenile salmon were barged. A total of
about 250,000 wild sockeye, spring-summer chinook, and fall
chinook juveniles are anticipated to migrate downstream this year
compared to about 1 million juveniles last year. [Assoc Press]<P> 
       Sacramento River Spring Chinook.  On Apr. 4, 1996, the CA
Fish and Game Commission voted 3-1 against a study that could
lead to the listing of Sacramento River's spring chinook salmon
as endangered under CA State law.  However, the Commissioners
agreed to reconsider the issue in three months. [Assoc Press]<P>  
      Canadian Salmon Fleet Restructuring.  On Apr. 14, 1996,
delegates to the Council of the Canadian Auto Workers Union
passed a resolution demanding that the Canadian Government
withdraw its plan to restructure the BC commercial salmon fleet,
claiming it would increase overcapitalization without reducing
overall capacity, would hurt small operators and coastal
communities, would shift salmon restoration costs to the
Province, and would encourage corporate concentration.  On Apr.
17, 1996, hundreds of BC commercial salmon fishers marched in
protest against the salmon fleet restructuring plan, claiming the
program is moving too fast by requiring them to choose fishing
areas and pay license fees by May 24, 1996.  {On Apr. 28, 1996,
BC Fisheries Minister David Zirnhelt and 44 others departed BC
for Ottawa to try to persuade the Canadian federal government to
alter its proposed salmon fleet restructuring program by
committing more funds to protect salmon habitat, train displaced
fishery workers, and buy-out vessel licenses.  On Apr. 29, 1996,
protesting fishers occupied DFO offices in Nanaimo and Port
Hardy, BC.  On May 2, 1996, Canadian Fisheries Minister Fred
Mifflin will travel to BC to listen to fishers' concerns.} [Assoc
Press]         .<P>
        Dworshak Dam.  On Apr. 1, 1996, a federal executive
committee on salmon restoration rejected any commitment to
maintain specific water levels in Dworshak Reservoir and not draw
down the water level as extensively as has been done in years
past.  The committee decided that a plan for Dworshak water use
will not be finalized until June.  On Apr. 18, 1996, the Corps
announced that it planned to begin lowering Dworshak reservoir
water level in mid-July with a maximum drawdown of about 70 feet
anticipated by Labor Day to meet NMFS target flows for salmon. 
However, Idaho officials are working to see if a plan could be
negotiated whereby Upper Snake River reservoirs could supply
sufficient water so that Dworshak water would not be needed.
[Assoc Press]<P>
        1996 Salmon Regulations.  On Apr. 12, 1996, the Pacific
Fishery Management Council voted to increase the minimum size for
sport and some commercially-caught chinook salmon, to limit CA
chinook harvest to 390,000 fish, to prohibit fishing for coho
salmon south of the Columbia River mouth, and to allow 75,000
coho salmon to be caught north of the mouth of the Columbia River
only if Canada's coho catch is 1.3 million fish or less.  Limited
harvests of chinook salmon off the Oregon and Washington coasts
will be permitted. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon and Steelhead Conference.  On Apr. 26-30, 1996, a
Sustainable Fisheries Conference entitled "Towards Sustainable
Fisheries: Balancing the Conservation and Use of Salmon and
Steelhead in the Pacific Northwest" will convene in the Victoria
Conference Center, Victoria, British Columbia.  This conference
is sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Fisheries Foundation
and the North Pacific International Chapter of the American
Fisheries Society. [personal communication]<P>
        Pacific Salmon Treaty.  In mid-April 1996, Alaska
officials announced that they would be setting the southeast
Alaska troll chinook salmon quota significantly lower than last
year's 230,000 fish limit.  In mid-April 1996, BC Premier Glen
Clark was reported to have requested that the Canadian federal
government cancel a treaty allowing U.S. Navy ships access to
Canadian Maritime Experimental and Test Range facilities at
Nanoose Bay, BC, as leverage in the salmon dispute.  In addition,
the Premier is reported to have requested stricter enforcement of
customs, immigration, and safety inspections.  {On May 7, 1996,
federal and State fisheries officials are to meet to discuss
quotas for 1996 Southeast Alaska chinook salmon harvests.} [Assoc
Press, Reuters, Seattle Post-Intelligencer via Greenwire]        
Freshwater Fisheries    .<P>
        International Fishing Hall of Fame.  On Apr. 10, 1996,
P&amp;L Promotions announced that they are planning to open an
International Fishing Hall of Fame at an undisclosed location in
the Nashville, TN, area, with groundbreaking in fall 1996 and
opening sometime in 1997. [Assoc Press]         .<P>
        Bull Trout.  On Apr. 2, 1996, the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, San Francisco, CA, reinstated a lawsuit by four Montana
conservation groups seeking to force an Endangered Species Act
listing of bull trout.  Overturning a lower court decision that
had dismissed the lawsuit, the new ruling stated that bull trout
status has a potentially enormous impact on a variety of projects
and activities in the Pacific northwest as well as an
indisputable impact on ecosystems and habitats where bull trout
exist.  The case was returned to the U.S. District Court in
Portland, OR. [Assoc Press]<P>

<BODY><A NAME=QuickMark></A>Fisheries Group:<P>
     I'm appending part of a regular update I prepare for
congressional staff on fisheries and marine mammal public policy
issues as I see them -- a selection of issues which I view as
having potential public policy implications for the U.S.
Congress.  My role is to provide objective, non-partisan,
unbiased public policy analysis for Congress.  Thus, it is useful
weekly to pass this summary by those subscribing to this list to
solicit input about areas where my objectivity could be improved,
where someone's bias shows through and should be adjusted, and
where there are simply other issues of which I am unaware. 
Anyway, what follows is today's summary.  Generally I add new
items every morning, and remove items after they have been on the
summary for about a month.  Items in the summary are modified as
I receive new information.<P>
     In deference to those who have to pay for communications
time, I am shortening the summary to include only new items added
since my last posting.  However, I will post the entire summary
once each month on the first Friday of the month, for those who
do not monitor the group each week or wish the more complete
format.<P>
     I would appreciate your feedback on this summary.  Comments
should be directed to me (gbuck@crs.loc.gov).  I will post this
summary each Friday on this list as long as I continue to receive
helpful feedback on issues. <P>
     To further assist me in providing a broad scope of
information resources to Congress, I would appreciate being added
to any mailing lists of publications, news releases, newsletters,
etc. relevant to marine mammals and fisheries. Where there is a
subscription cost, a sample copy would provide a basis for
deciding whether or not a subscription could be justified. 
Thanks for your assistance in this matter.<P>

Marine Fisheries<P>
     Russia-Japan Fishery Agreement?  Russian and Japanese
negotiators met on Feb. 19-21, 1996 for a fifth round of
discussions on fishing rights in the South Kurils area since
March 1995, but no agreement was concluded.  Russia discussed
permission for Japanese vessels to legally catch fish and crabs
on a compensation basis in an effort to stop illegal  fishing<P>
in the area.  However, Japan objected to paying fees that could
be interpreted as a recognition of Russian sovereignty.

     Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<p>
     {Salmon and Steelhead Conference.  On Apr. 26-30, 1996, a
Sustainable Fisheries Conference entitled "Towards Sustainable
Fisheries: Balancing the Conservation and Use of Salmon and
Steelhead in the Pacific Northwest" will convene in the Victoria
Conference Center, Victoria, British Columbia.  This conference
is sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Fisheries Foundation
and the North Pacific International Chapter of the American
Fisheries Society.} [personal communication]<P>
     Water Quality Exemptions.  On Feb. 23, 1996, the Washington
Dept. of Ecology {approved a request} by NMFS for temporary
modification of water quality standards allowing higher nitrogen
saturation levels when water is spilled over Columbia River basin
hydroelectric dams between Mar. 14 and Aug. 31, 1996, to benefit
juvenile salmon downstream migration.  {On Feb. 23, 1996, the
Oregon Dept. of Environmental Quality postponed consideration of
a similar request until Apr. 11, 1996, awaiting data on adequacy
of Federal monitoring of fish for possible damage from gas
supersaturation.} [Assoc Press]<P>
     {Umpqua River Sea-Run Cutthroat Trout.  On Feb. 23, 1996, a
coalition of sport and commercial fishing organizations filed a
motion for summary judgment in Federal court in Portland, OR,
seeking to force NMFS to list the Umpqua River (OR) sea-run
cutthroat trout under the Endangered Species Act.} [personal
communication]<P>
     NPPC Meeting.  On Feb. 20-22, 1996, the Northwest Power
Planning Council (NPPC) will meet and accept public comments in
Boise, ID, as part of a 180-day review of salmon recovery
measures required by language in fiscal year 1996 energy and
water appropriations legislation. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Kenai River Salmon.  In early February 1996, Alaska Dept. of
Fish and Game biologists preliminarily estimated the July 1996
return of chinook/ king salmon to the Kenai River will be 91,811
fish -- the largest return since statistics have been collected
and surpassing the July 1986 return of 79,837 fish.  On Feb. 17,
1996, representatives from the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game,
Alaska Dept. of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service asked the Alaska Board of Fisheries for authority to
close sensitive public lands along the Kenai River to better
protect salmon habitat. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Alaska Salmon Initiative.  In mid-February 1996, Alaska Lt.
Governor Fran Ulmer certified that petitions had obtained the
required number of signatures to place the "Fairness in Salmon
Harvest" (FISH) initiative on the Nov. 1996 State ballot.  This
measure would mandate a Statewide harvest priority on
subsistence, personal use, and sport harvest, requiring State
managers to reserve allocations to meet these needs, but not to
exceed 5% of the Statewide harvest. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Pacific Salmon Treaty.  On Feb. 13-16, 1996, the Pacific
Salmon Commission is meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, to
discuss salmon harvest allocation for the 1996 season. 
Commission scientists estimated the 1996 sockeye return to the
Fraser River would be only 1.4 million fish, likely forcing
closure of commercial fishing.  On Feb. 13, 1996, Canadian
fisheries officials announced that conservation problems should
be addressed before catch-sharing issues are discussed.  U.S.
negotiators have rejected initial proposals by mediator
Christopher Beeby, which would have imposed sacrifices for both
Canada and the United States, but have agreed to continue
mediation. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Idaho Salmon Policy.  In early February 1996, Idaho
officials circulated a draft policy calling for an equitable
balance between barging and spilling water to move juvenile
salmon downstream.  The plan also calls for a lower target flow
(65,000 cubic feet per second rather than 100,000 cfs recommended
by NMFS) for spilling water over Lower Granite Dam. Dworshak
Reservoir may be used to augment spring flow, but summer
reservoir levels are to be maintained for recreation and log
transport.  No dam drawdowns are recommended by the draft policy. 
On Feb. 19, 1996, the Idaho House Committee on Resources and
Conservation unanimously approved a bill providing 427,000
acre-feet of Snake River water annually for four years to the
Bureau of Reclamation for enhancing salmon migration on a
"willing-seller, willing-buyer" basis.  The Committee also voted
11-3 to approve a resolution objecting to flow augmentation and
reservoir drawdown as long-term solutions to salmon recovery.  On
Feb. 20, 1996, Idaho Governor Phil Batt submitted Idaho's
proposed salmon policy to the Northwest Power Planning Council. 
{On Feb. 23, 1996, the Idaho House voted 64-3 to provide 427,000
acre-feet of Snake River water annually for four years to the
Bureau of Reclamation for enhancing salmon migration on a
"willing-seller, willing-buyer" basis.  The House also voted 60-7
to approve a resolution objecting to flow augmentation and
reservoir drawdown as long-term solutions to salmon recovery.}
[Assoc Press, Northwest Power Planning Council press release]<P>  
   Pacific Northwest Floods.  In early February 1996, floods in
Oregon, Idaho, and Washington destroyed salmon habitat, washed
away salmon eggs from spawning gravel, and damaged hatcheries. 
In some areas, landslides have moved substantial debris into
salmon spawning streams.  A spokesperson for the Association of
Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics reported that,
of 185 landslides observed by air, 114 occurred in clearcuts, 68
were along roads, and 3 were in undisturbed areas. In addition,
about 1.5 million juvenile salmon were released early due to
water supply interruptions and flooding of rearing facilities. 
Oyster and clam resources may also have been damaged by
siltation.  Others claim that the floods were potentially
beneficial in creating new fish habitat.  {On Feb. 26, 1996, the
Pacific Rivers Council and the Pacific Federation of Fishermen's
Assoc. called for an emergency halt to logging and road building
on Pacific Northwest national forests until widespread flood
damage can be assessed. Forest Service authorities estimate flood
damage to Washington and Oregon national forests at $60 million,
with thousands of landslides damaging more that 1,000 miles of
stream, hundreds of fish habitat improvement projects damaged or
destroyed, and significant water quality damage in more than 200
watersheds.  Of 254 landslides in the Clackamas River drainage,
OR, 72% occurred in logged or roaded areas.} [Assoc Press,
Portland Oregonian via Greenwire]<p>
     Condit Dam Relicensing.  In early February 1996, the draft
environmental impact statement was released on the application by
PacifiCorp utility to relicense Condit Dam on the White Salmon
River, WA.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's preferred
alternative for relicensing calls for PacifiCorp to equip the dam
with fish passage facilities costing $26 million to $31 million. 
A public hearing on this issue is scheduled for Feb. 29, 1996, in
White Salmon, WA. [Assoc Press, Reuters, Portland Oregonian via
Greenwire]<P>
     Columbia River Spring Chinook Forecast.  In early February
1996, preliminary forecasts were released indicating that 37,500
adult spring chinook salmon are expected to pass Bonneville Dam
in 1996.  This is an improvement from the 10,200 adult spring
chinook salmon passing the Dam in 1995, but still among the
lowest returns on record. [Assoc Press]<P>
     Salmon Glut?  On Feb. 5, 1996, representatives from ten
Alaska salmon processors met with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles
and other State officials to discuss how the Alaska salmon
industry might best cope with depressed salmon prices resulting
from large Alaska harvests, increased competition from farmed
salmon, and increased Russian salmon production. [Assoc Press]<P> 
    Alaska Board of Fisheries Meetings.  On Feb. 17, 1996, the
Alaska Board of Fisheries began 12 days of meetings to decide how
the allocate Cook Inlet salmon between commercial and sport
fisheries.  On Feb. 20, 1996, the Board considered how to manage
the June salmon interception fishery at False Pass, which was
halted in Sept. 1995 by an injunction from Kotzebue Superior
Court Judge Richard Erlich until the Board explains why False
Pass fishermen are allowed to continue taking chum salmon bound
for Western Alaska rivers.  On Feb. 21, 1996, the Board scheduled
a special Apr. 13, 1996 meeting to discuss chum salmon issues and
the injunction on the June False Pass sockeye salmon fishery. 
{On Feb. 26, 1996, the Board voted to grant the Alaska Dept. of
Fish and Game authority to close public lands along freshwater
streams to protect riparian habitat.  On Feb. 27, 1996, the Board
unanimously approved new regulations increasing sockeye salmon
escapement into the Kenai River to benefit sport anglers, but set
a goal of zero net habitat loss as a condition for increased
river fishing.} [Assoc Press]  <P>
     Columbia River Basin Hatchery Reductions.  On Feb. 5, 1996,
managers at Oregon's Bonneville Hatchery released 8 million
juvenile chinook salmon early; survival of prematurely released
fish is likely to be minimal. Oregon has scheduled the release of
13.2 million additional juvenile chinook salmon in about two
weeks.  On Feb. 20, 1996, Oregon Governor Kitzhaber announced
that he would use $65,000 from a lottery-financed strategic
reserve fund to operate two hatcheries and a rearing pond through
Mar. 15 to postpone further early release of juvenile chinook
salmon. [Wash. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife press release, Assoc
Press]<P>
     Canadian Salmon.  On Feb. 1, 1996, British Columbia's
Fisheries Minister David Zirnhelt called on the Federal
Government of Canada to commit $1 billion to address salmon
industry problems with a total, comprehensive renewal effort. 
{In late February 1996, Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans researchers
concluded, in a Federal-Provincial study, that chinook and coho
salmon provided more economic value when caught by sport
fishermen.} [Assoc Press]<P>
     Salmon Price-Fixing Case.  On Feb. 9, 1996, fishermen asked
Judge Reese to bar processors from talking to fishermen involved
in the suit seeking $720 million in damages for alleged
price-fixing for Bristol Bay sockeye salmon.  Fishermen accuse
processors of encouraging fishermen to sign waivers denying
interest in the lawsuit. [Assoc Press]<P>
Aquaculture<P>
     Crisis in Salmon Market.  In mid-February 1996, the European
Parliament adopted a common resolution on the current crisis in
the Atlantic salmon market, recognizing that a minimum import
price strategy had been ineffective in restoring stability to the
Atlantic salmon market in the European Union and asking the
European Commission to implement quantitative restrictions on
imports of Norwegian salmon. [Agence Europe via Reuters]<P>

     I'm appending part of a regular update I prepare for
congressional staff on fisheries and marine mammal public policy
issues as I see them -- a selection of issues which I view as
having potential public policy implications for the U.S.
Congress.  My role is to provide objective, non-partisan,
unbiased public policy analysis for Congress.  Thus, it is useful
weekly to pass this summary by those subscribing to this list to
solicit input about areas where my objectivity could be improved,
where someone's bias shows through and should be adjusted, and
where there are simply other issues of which I am unaware. 
Anyway, what follows is today's summary.  Generally I add new
items every morning, and remove items after they have been on the
summary for about a month.  Items in the summary are modified as
I receive new information.<P>
     In deference to those who have to pay for communications
time, I post the entire summary once each month on the first
Friday of the month, for those who do not monitor the group each
week or wish the more complete format. This is longer the first
Friday posting for September 1996. <P>
NOTE:  Archived copies of "first Friday" longer summaries for
February 1994 through the present are now available at:<P>
         "http://www.lsu.edu/guests/sglegal/public_html/"<P>
       I would appreciate your feedback on this summary. <P>
Comments should be directed to me (gbuck@crs.loc.gov).  I will
post this summary each Friday on this list as long as I continue
to receive helpful feedback on issues. <P>
     To further assist me in providing a broad scope of
information resources to Congress, I would appreciate being added
to any mailing lists of publications, news releases, newsletters,
etc. relevant to marine mammals and fisheries. Where there is a
subscription cost, a sample copy would provide a basis for
deciding whether or not a subscription could be justified. 
Thanks for your assistance in this matter.<P>

Summary [for 9/6/96] follows:<P>
     New info and changes since 08/29/96 are bracketed  {...}.    
Marine Fisheries<P>
        {Fisheries Oversight Hearing.  On Sept. 12, 1996, the
house Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans has
tentatively scheduled an oversight hearing on implementation of
provisions of the Fisheries Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-43).} [personal
communication]<P>
        Magnuson Act.  In early August 1996, House and Senate
negotiators were reported to have reached a compromise agreement
on Magnuson Act amendments, agreeing to enact broad conservation
provisions, phase-in community development quotas for Bering Sea
crab for western Alaska communities over 3 years, and impose a
moratorium on new individual transferable quota (ITQ) programs
while the National Academy of Sciences conducts a 3-year study. 
{Senate floor consideration of S. 39 was tentatively scheduled
for Sept. 4, 1996, but was postponed until late September or
early October when Senate consideration of appropriations
measures took precedence.} [Greenwire, personal communication,
Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
        {Oregon Salmon Study Funded.  On Sept. 3, 1996, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's)
Coastal Ocean Program announced that it had awarded a $225,000
grant to the Oregon Dept. of Land Conservation and Development
for design and coordination of a new study of Pacific salmon --
the Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystem Regional Study. This
Study is projected to receive $5 million in funds over 5 years. 
The Study will improve the scientific base for restoration and
management of salmon and other coastal resources and develop ways
for coastal managers to predict ecosystem, economic, and social
impacts of proposed restoration and management strategies. 
Special focus will be directed to factors affecting the estuarine
survival of salmon.  Other participants in the study include NMFS
and the Sea Grant Programs at Oregon State Univ. and the Univ. of
Washington.} [NOAA press release]<P>
        Snake River Sockeye Release.  In September 1996, ID Dept.
of Fish and Game biologists plan to release 120 adult sockeye
salmon into Redfish Lake to spawn naturally.  These fish are
offspring of 8 wild sockeye adults that returned to spawn in 1993
and were reared in hatcheries. [Assoc Press]                 .    
    {Washington Vessel Permit Buyout.  On Aug. 29, 1996, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposed
two options for a $5.2 million second phase of salmon vessel
permit buyouts in Washington State as part of the Northwest
Emergency Assistance Plan.  After 296 salmon vessel permits were
purchased in phase one of this program, a new proposed phase two
option responds to criticism that primarily marginal or part-time
permits were purchased during the first phase by calculating a
ratio using an individual's salmon decline impact.} [NOAA press
release]<P>
        Squawfish Scam.  In late August 1996, a Spokane, WA,
individual was charged with theft, alleging that he cheated
Bonneville Power Administration's Snake River squawfish bounty
program by turning in more than 300 squawfish actually taken from
the Spokane River.  BPA pays a bounty on squawfish to reduce
their numbers as they prey extensively on juvenile salmon and
steelhead trout. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Alaska FISH Initiative Unconstitutional.  On Aug. 26,
1996, the Alaska Supreme Court declared the November general
election ballot initiative FISH (Fairness in Salmon Harvest) to
be unconstitutional as it would strip state managers of their
ability to allocate salmon among competing user groups.  The FISH
Initiative sought to guarantee a specific allocation of salmon to
sport, subsistence, and personal-use fishermen.  The Supreme
Court reversed an April 1996 Superior Court ruling that held the
Initiative to be constitutional. [Reuters, Assoc Press]<P>
        Oregon Recovery Plan.  On Aug. 23, 1996, Oregon Governor
John Kitzhaber released the Oregon Coastal Salmon Restoration
Initiative for coho salmon and steelhead trout.  The plan's goals
include increase enforcement of existing laws, create local
watershed councils, establish tax incentives for landowners and
businesses who protect or restore salmon habitat, reform hatchery
practices, and eliminate illegal irrigation diversions. [Assoc
Press, Greenwire]<P>
        Dworshak Dam Release.  In mid-August 1996, 22,000
cubic-feet-per second (cfs) water releases began from Dworshak
Dam to assist in flushing juvenile chinook salmon downstream. 
Releases will continue at this level through the end of August,
and will decrease to 14,000 cfs during early September, until the
reservoir drops to 80 feed below full. [Assoc Press]              
        Canadian Aboriginal Commercial Fishery.  On Aug. 21,
1996, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected claims by British
Columbia Indians that they have an aboriginal right to sell fish
taken outside the conventional commercial fishery.  However,
Native leaders say the ruling outlines what they must prove
concerning whether fish bartering or sale was part of their
culture before Europeans arrived. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Washington State Draft Salmon Policy.  In mid-August
1996, the Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife began circulating
a draft proposal to assist wild salmon and steelhead trout
recovery.  The proposal would reduce salmon and steelhead harvest
by at least 25%, reduce the production of hatchery fish, require
more and wider buffers along streams and wetlands, limit paving
and construction to no more than 10% of a watershed, toughen
permit standards for well and irrigation water withdrawal, and
improve enforcement of water quality standards. [Assoc Press,
Greenwire]<P>
        Salmon Donation Program.  On Aug. 16, 1996, NMFS
announced the selection of Northwest Food Strategies as an
authorized tax-exempt distributor of Pacific salmon to
economically disadvantaged individuals under the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council's Salmon Donation Program; salmon to
be distributed are taken as bycatch in North Pacific
groundfisheries.  The distribution permit is valid for 3 years.
[Fed. Register]<P>
        Hecla Wastewater Violations.  On Aug. 16, 1996, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency alleged that the Hecla Mining Co.
violated its waterwater discharge permit during May 1994 and
between June 1995 and June 1996, by discharging excessive
cyanide, mercury, and suspended solids into tributaries of the
Salmon River, northeast of Stanley, ID.  EPA is seeking a $85,000
penalty for the alleged violations. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Alaska Logger Sentenced for Salmon Damage.  On Aug. 15,
1996, a Homer, AK, logger was convicted of bulldozing silt into
Stariski Creek and damaging salmon spawning habitat without
Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) or AK Division of
Forestry permits and, on Aug. 19, 1996, he was sentenced to 20
days in jail and fined $25,000 for this crime.  In addition, the
logger will be required to remove the soil that washing into the
Creek under ADF&amp;G supervision. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Cordova Salmon Strike.  On Aug. 11, 1996, more than 200
Cordova, AK fishermen began a strike, refusing to harvest Copper
River coho salmon unless processors increase the price paid for
these fish from the 40 to 50 cents per pound offered to 65 cents
per pound.  Processors claim the abundant returns of salmon make
it uneconomic to offer a higher price. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Western Power Blackout Impacts.  In partial response to
an Aug. 10, 1996 power blackout to more than 4 million residents
of the western United States and temporary loss of power from the
Diablo Canyon, CA nuclear facility, Bonneville Power
Administration requested of NMFS and was granted a waiver of the
Endangered Species Act on Aug. 12 to allow the generating station
at the Dalles Dam in eastern Oregon to operate at full power for
the remainder of the week.  The facility had been operating at
about one-third capacity in accordance with spill criteria in
salmon recovery measures. NMFS estimates as many as 16,000
juvenile fall chinook salmon may be killed each day that spills
are not provided, including possibly 4 to 6 from a wild
population listed as endangered, as all water is passed through
turbines to generate electricity.  Limited spills for juvenile
salmon migration at the Dalles Dam were begun on the night of
Aug. 14, and were to continue for 2 days.  Water was drawn from
several upstream reservoirs to provide extra water for spills at
The Dalles Dam.  On Aug. 16, 1996, spills were increased to their
pre-blackout levels.  In late August 1996, the Columbia River
Alliance for Fish, Commerce, and Communities alleged that the
power blackout was at least partially caused when the reduced
power output at The Dalles Dam (due to spills for salmon)
threatened the stability of the West Coast power system. [Los
Angeles Times and Journal of Commerce via Greenwire, Assoc Press]
<P>
         Salvage Logging.  On Aug. 6, 1996, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, by a 3-0 ruling, upheld a December 1995 lower
court decision allowing salvage logging on the Thunderbolt sale
(on the South Fork of the Salmon River, ID) and on several other
sales.  The ID Sporting Congress and others argued that erosion
from logging would damage endangered chinook salmon spawning
habitat. [Boise Idaho Statesman via Greenwire]<P>
        Salmon River Floatboat Regulations.  On Aug. 15, 1996,
Sawtooth National Forest officials announced that public floaters
in two days had amassed enough violations that closure of a
15-mile stretch of the upper Salmon River from the Yankee Fork to
the national recreation area boundary was imminent  In late
August 1996, floatboat outfitters will be required to fund a
$13,600 spawning bed monitoring program by the Forest Service and
the ID Dept. of Fish and Game or the river will be closed to
commercial operators after Aug. 21.  On Aug. 19, 1996, Sawtooth
National Recreation Area officials announced it was closing a
15-mile stretch of the upper Salmon River below Sunbeam Dam to
public floaters to better protect salmon spawning areas. 
Commercial outfitters are not restricted by this closure. [Assoc
Press]<p>
        Record Alaska Chum and Pink Salmon Catch.  In early
August 1996, the Alaska Supreme Court declined to hear Earth's
suit seeking to halt roe stripping from chum and pink salmon and
dumping of salmon carcasses by Alaska salmon hatcheries and
advised Earth that their suit should more appropriately be filed
with the state Superior Court, which Earth declined to do.  On
Aug. 12, 1996, an Earth activist began a hunger strike to protest
roe stripping and carcass dumping.  By mid-August 1996, 9 Alaska
hatchery corporations had sought state permission to dump pink
and/or chum salmon carcasses.  {On Aug 31, 1996, Earth activists
distributed 40,000 pounds of excess hatchery salmon from Alaska
free to about 1,500 people in Federal Way, WA.} [Assoc Press] <P>
        Pacific Salmon Treaty.  On Aug. 1, 1996, Alaska Dept. of
Fish and Game officials announced revised catch statistics of
74,000 chinook salmon for early July 10-day southeast Alaska
commercial troll salmon fishery.  On Aug. 7, 1996, the Pacific
Salmon Commission decided sockeye salmon returns to the Fraser
River were of sufficient strength and allowed a limited
commercial harvest.  However, Greenpeace demonstrators disrupted
the gillnet fishery, arguing that the Canadian government was
underestimating the required adult salmon escapement.  An initial
48-hour Fraser River commercial sockeye harvest was estimated to
have taken 160,000 fish.  On Aug. 12, 1996, Alaskan officials
were reported to have calculated the total 1996 sport/commercial
troll salmon chinook harvest as 126,000 fish since Jan. 1, 1996,
with an additional 20,000 chinook having been taken by seiners. 
On Aug. 14, 1996, the United States failed to designate a
representative for the Technical Dispute Settlement Board
requested by Canada on the 1996 Alaska chinook quota.  In
mid-August 1996, Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game officials
announced that the southeast Alaska commercial chinook salmon
troll fishery would open for two days beginning Aug. 19, allowing
7,000 more fish to be harvested.  On Aug. 19, 1996, Pacific
Salmon Commission officials announced that, based on current
adult escapement counts, no further Canadian commercial fishery
for Fraser River sockeye will be scheduled. Canadian commercial
fishermen took their allowable catch of 1 million sockeye during
two openings, while U.S. fishermen are close to catching their
300,000 fish quota.  Total sockeye return to the Fraser River is
now estimated at 4.4 million fish.  On Aug. 21 and 23, 1996,
British Columbia commercial fishermen in 25 fishing vessels
staged protest salmon fisheries to contest native-only fishing
for Fraser River salmon.  In late August 1996, the Governors of
Alaska, Washington, and Oregon wrote a letter to the Pacific
Salmon Commission proposing that salmon allocations be discussed
on a regional, rather than area-wide, basis in an effort to
stimulate productive negotiations. On Aug. 28, 1996, Alaska
Governor Tony Knowles met with White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta to request administration assistance to renew efforts to
negotiate a resolution with Canada on salmon.  {In early
September 1996, Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game biologists reported
the Yukon River fall chum salmon run appeared to be about 200,000
fish larger than anticipated and that all escapement obligations
to Canada had been met.} [Assoc Press, Reuters, WA Dept. of Fish
and Wildlife press release, personal communication, Canadian
Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans press release]<P>
Aquaculture<P>
        {Atlantic Salmon Dumping.  On Sept. 2, 1996, the European
Commission announced that it had decided to begin separate
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of farmed Atlantic
salmon from Norway, in response to July 1996 complaints by the
Scottish Salmon Growers' Assoc. and the Shetland Salmon Farmers'
Assoc.} [Reuters]<P>
        {Umpqua River Cutthroat Trout.  On Sept. 8, 1996, a
federal ban on all fishing in the Umpqua River Basin, OR, will be
implemented to protect endangered cutthroat trout.  OR fishery
managers have requested that NMFS issue a special incidental take
permit to allow limited fishing to continue, but  a public
comment period on the permit application does not end until Sept.
6.} [Assoc Press]<P>
        {Kolob Reservoir Fish Kill.  On Sept. 1, 1996, the Utah
Div. of Wildlife Resources reported that more than 4,000
cutthroat trout had died in Kolob Reservoir, UT, this summer
after the water level was lowered to within 4 feet of a 5-foot
silt layer on the reservoir bottom to permit work on the dam.}
[Assoc Press]<P>
        Lake Pend Oreille Level.  On Aug. 20, 1996, the Army
Corps of Engineers announced that it would keep the level of Lake
Pend Oreille, ID, four feet higher than normal to improve kokanee
spawning and survival during a 3-year test. [Assoc Press]<P>

        New info and changes since 06/28/96 are bracketed 
{...}.<P>
Marine Fisheries<P>
        Straddling Stocks Agreement.  On June 26, 1996, the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved and ordered
favorably reported the Agreement for the Implementation of the
Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management
of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, with
one declaration, for Senate floor action on advice and consent
concerning ratification. [Congr. Rec.]<P>
        Seabird Deaths.  In mid-June 1996, mortalities of as many
as 10,000 seabirds (e.g., common murres) offshore of the central
Oregon coast raised concerns about changing oceanic conditions. 
Warmer ocean conditions are believed to have depressed normal
upwelling and changed nearshore production patterns, resulting in
starvation of the seabirds.  Murres have also abandoned usual
nesting colonies. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Sea of Okhotsk Agreement.  On June 13, 1996, the United
States and Russia signed a bilateral agreement recognizing that
all fishing within the international waters (peanut hole) in the
central Sea of Okhotsk completely surrounded by the Russian
economic zone should be conducted in line with Russian Federation
rights, duties, and interests.  In addition, the United States
agreed to observe all Russian efforts to preserve fishery
resources in the Sea of Okhotsk and cooperate with Russia in
actions against fishing vessels of third countries. [Interfax]<P> 
       Exxon Agreement with Seattle Fish Processors.  On June 11,
1996, U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland released his opinion
overturning a secret 1991 agreement whereby Exxon Corp. would
have recovered about $730 million in punitive damages from the
Exxon Valdez settlement awarded seven Seattle, WA fish
processors.  Judge Holland ruled that the processors had settled
with Exxon and were due nothing further.  Exxon is likely to
appeal Judge Holland's decision. [Assoc Press]<P>
        NTSB Concern for Older Fishing Vessels.  On June 11,
1996, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials
reported that lax fire safety standards endanger an estimated
230,000 people working on fishing vessels built prior to 1991 and
not currently required to meet more recent safety requirements. 
The NTSB recommended that the Coast Guard and other regulators
require older fishing vessels to phase-in new safety requirements
including smoke detectors and water sprinkler systems. [Assoc
Press]<P>
        WWF Action Plan and Status Report.  On June 6, 1996, the
World Wide Fund for Nature published a status report entitled
"Marine Fishes in the Wild," including a 10-point action plan to
deal with concerns related to the condition of marine fisheries.
[personal communication, Reuters]         .<P>
        Brunswick Brand Sale.  On June 5, 1996, Brunswick Corp.
(Lake Forest, IL) announced that it had agreed to sell assets
related to its Starcraft and MonArk fishing boat brands to
Starcraft Marine LLC (New Paris, IN). [Dow Jones News]<P>
        Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
        {Mitchell Act Hearing.  The House Resource Committee's
Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans has indefinitely
postponed an oversight hearing on Mitchell Act hatcheries in the
Columbia River basin, which had been tentatively scheduled for
July 16, 1996.} [personal communication]<P>
        Plum Creek Habitat Conservation Plan.  On June 27, 1996,
the Plum Creek Timber Co. signed a 50-year habitat conservation
plan with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National
Marine Fisheries Service, for management of 170,000 acres of
timber in Washington State's Cascade Mountains.  In exchange for
new management initiatives (e.g., large buffer areas along
streams and wetlands protection), Plum Creek will be able to log
areas previously restricted for endangered species protection. 
However, environmental groups have voiced concerns about the
inability to respond to changing conditions under this plan.
[Assoc Press, Plum Creek Timber Co. press release]<P>
        Salmon Price-Fixing Suit.  On July 12, 1996, Alaska
Superior Court Judge John Reese has scheduled a hearing on
whether to certify as a class action the $720 million lawsuit
alleging 26 seafood processors and 10 Japanese trading companies
with conspiring since 1989 to fix the price of Bristol Bay
sockeye salmon. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Nez Perce Logging OK.  On June 24, 1996, the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Dec. 1994 lower court
ruling that logging on three large U.S. Forest Service timber
sales in the Cove and Mallard drainages in Idaho's Nez Perce
National Forest would not harm salmon, saying the Forest Service
adequately studied possible effects on Snake River chinook
salmon. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Klamath Salmon Case.  On June 24, 1996, the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld a lower court decision that offshore commercial and
sport salmon fishing had to be limited to protect the fishing
rights of Yurok and Hoopa Valley Tribes to Klamath River salmon
in California.  The challenge was based on the contention that
the tribes lacked fishing rights since their reservations were
created by executive order, rather than by treaty. [Assoc Press]  
        .<P>
        Supplementation Hatchery Groundbreaking.  On June 19,
1996, ground-breaking ceremonies were held for the first
large-scale supplementation hatchery for spring chinook salmon on
the Yakima River near Cle Elum, WA.  Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA) provided $14 million for hatchery
construction.  The hatchery is expected to be operating by April
1997. [Dow Jones News, BPA press release]<P>
        Sport Canning of Salmon.  In mid-June 1996, Alaska's
Attorney General issued an opinion that barter of sport-caught
salmon is illegal.  The opinion outlined three criteria for
identifying illegal barter, which can occur when sport fish are
canned by non-professional processors. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Outfitters' Appeal.  On June 17, 1996, four Salmon River,
ID, outfitters were to have filed an appeal of U.S. Forest
Service restrictions limiting  rafting on sections of the Salmon
River during salmon spawning season. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Sacramento River Spring Chinook Lawsuit.  On June 17,
1996, CA State Senator Tom Hayden announced that he had joined
the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental
Protection Information Center in filing a lawsuit on June 12th in
San Francisco Superior Court seeking a court order to compel the
CA Fish and Game Commission to begin the process of placing the
Sacramento/San Joaquin River spring chinook salmon on the CA
state endangered species list.  The lawsuit seeks a reduction in
pumping of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and other
protective measures during the time the spring chinook are
migrating through these waters. [Assoc Press, Sacramento Bee via
Greenwire]<P>
        Oregon Budget Cuts.  On June 12, 1996, officials of the
Oregon Dept.of Fish and Wildlife announced a 4% budget cut in
response to a projected $6.8 million shortfall in revenues,
primarily due to severely reduced salmon sport fishing license
revenues.  About 40 employees will be released in addition to 11
OR State Police fish and game officers. [Assoc Press]             
        .<P>
        Salmon Recovery Plan Injunction.  On June 12, 1996, a
coalition of 10 fishing and environmental groups filed a motion
for preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court, Portland, OR,
accusing NMFS, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of
Reclamation of failing to implement water flow guidelines
detailed in the March 1994 biological opinion on Snake River
salmon.  In mid-June 1996, the State of Oregon joined this
lawsuit as a friend of the court. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Salmon and Steelhead Recovery Hearing.  On June 11, 1996,
the Senate Environment and Public Works' Subcommittee on Drinking
Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife held a hearing on implementation
of Pacific Northwest salmon and recovery measures, including
installation of the surface collector at Lower Granite Dam.

        ESA Salmon and Steelhead Listings.  On June 7, 1996, a
coalition of 20 conservation and fishing groups filed a challenge
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco to NMFS's court-ordered
timetable for listing steelhead trout submitted on May 28.  The
coalition seeks to minimize any further delay in listing.  On
June 14, 1996, NMFS announced the following schedule for ESA
listing decisions on additional species:  chum salmon (Feb.
1997), sockeye salmon (Sept. 1997), chinook salmon (Dec. 1997),
and cutthroat trout (Jan. 1998).  On June 26, 1996, U.S. District
Judge Susan Illston made public an order, {in response to the
June 7, 1996 lawsuit, that NMFS decide by July 31, 1996,} whether
it will list Pacific coast steelhead trout under the Endangered
Species Act. [Seattle Post-Intelligencer via Greenwire, Assoc
Press]  <P>
        Pacific Salmon Treaty.  On June 13, 1996, AK Dept. of
Fish and Game announced that sport catch of chinook salmon in
southeast Alaska would be reduced on June 15 to one fish 28
inches or longer per day to better conserve chinook salmon
spawning in BC waters.  On June 20, 1996, Canadian DFO officials
announced an estimated BC harvest of 7.325 million salmon, with
no fishing on the Fraser River except for a possible October chum
salmon opening.  The anticipated 1996 harvest is about
one-quarter of the average annual catch of 27 million salmon.  On
June 24, 1996, the three U.S. Commissioners to the Pacific Salmon
Commission representing the States of Alaska, Washington and
Oregon, and the Northwest Tribes signed a multi-year agreement on
chinook salmon harvest quotas and restoration of damaged salmon
habitat.  The 1996 Southeast Alaska troll chinook salmon catch
will be set between 140,000 and 155,000 fish, excluding Alaska
hatchery production.  The 1995 limit was 230,000 fish, but the
fishery was halted by court action after a catch of about 175,000
chinook.  The agreement among U.S. parties relies on in-season
salmon abundance (Alaska's method) rather than preseason
forecasts (the method used by Canada, Washington, and Oregon) as
the basis for determining harvest quotas, and will be reviewed in
2003 to determine if renegotiation is necessary.  Canadian
officials have requested that the 1996 Southeast Alaska chinook
harvest be limited to 60,000 fish. [Assoc Press, Reuters]<P>

        {Cochetopa Fish Kill.  On June 27, 1996, a tanker truck
crashed and spilled between 5,000 and 7,500 gallons of liquid
ammonium nitrate fertilizer into Cochetopa Creek southwest of
Gunnison, CO, killing thousands of brown and rainbow trout.}
[Assoc Press]<P>
        San Juan River Lawsuit.  On June 27, 1996, the attorney
for the San Juan Fly Fishing Federation was planning to file a
motion in U.S. District Court (Albuquerque, NM) requesting that
their lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation be reopened. 
The lawsuit contends the Bureau is not complying with
environmental regulations in water tests at Navajo Reservoir and
that a planned four-month test beginning in November 1996 could
harm trout populations in waters below the reservoir.  The
Federation had agreed to dismiss the lawsuit in return for
information from a two-week test in January. The agreement also
provided that the lawsuit could be reopened by July 15, 1996.
[Assoc Press]<P>
        Alaska Subsistence Fishing.  On June 10, 1996, the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review a 1995 Alaska Supreme Court
ruling, in the case of Totemoff v. Alaska, that the State of
Alaska has regulatory authority over subsistence hunting and
fishing on navigable waters. [Assoc Press] <P>

        Salmon Along the Pacific Coast<P>
        Salmon Spill Review.  On Sept. 26, 1996, the chairman of
Oregon's Environmental Quality Commission called for a review of
water spills at hydropower dams to assure that more benefit than
harm is being done for salmon.  This review responds to concerns
following two controversial spills at The Dalles Dam during
August and September 1996. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Flow Deflectors at John Day Dam.  On Sept. 26, 1996, the
Army Corps of Engineers announced that it had awarded a $7.6
million contract for construction of flow deflectors at John Day
Dam on the Columbia River.  Flow deflectors modify dam spillways
to help reduce the level of supersaturated nitrogen gas, thus
improving safety for juvenile salmon migrating downstream.
Construction is to be completed by mid-1998. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Marketing Tribal Salmon.  On Sept. 21, 1996, an impromptu
dockside market for tribal-caught salmon developed at Marine
Park, Cascade Locks, OR, in response to the low price ($0.30 per
pound) offered for fresh fall chinook salmon by wholesalers
compared to $2.00 per pound paid by consumers at the dockside
market. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Yakama Salmon Habitat Complaint.  On Sept. 12, 1996, the
Yakama Indian Nation filed a complaint with the Eastern
Washington Growth Management Hearings Board, requesting that the
Board review Klickitat County for alleged failure to protect
salmon habitat as required by Washington State's Growth
Management Act.  A hearing date on the petition has not yet been
set. [Assoc Press]<P>
        Record Alaska Chum and Pink Salmon Catch.  On Sept. 25,
1996, Alaska Governor Tony Knowles directed the Alaska Dept. of
Fish and Game to suspend all permits for stripping roe and
dumping salmon carcasses by salmon hatcheries due to concerns for
the health of an Earth activist on a hunger strike over this
issue.  Gov. Knowles also agreed to hold a summit meeting of
hatchery operators, food banks, charities, and state agencies to
coordinate better ways to fully utilize excess fish. [Assoc

Tiburon, California 94920<P>
</H2>

<Body>
<P>
The Tiburon facility is located on 10 acre site in southern Marin
County on San Francisco Bay.<P>
<P>
Research is divided into four areas: groundfish physiological
ecology; groundfish analysis; groundfish communities; and
director's office research.  Groundfish physiological ecology
studies determine the inherent and environmental factors that
most affect health, growth and reproduction.  Groundfish analysis
produces stock assessments to support west coast groundfish
management.  Fishery-dependent data are collected through a
cooperative port sampling program with the west coast states
(PACFIN) and fishery-independent data on recruitment and coastal
oceanography are obtained by NOAA and charter vessels. 
Groundfish communities studies identify effects of natural change
in the marine environment on the distribution, abundance an year
class strength of groundfish.  Understanding natural effects is
necessary before the effects of human activities on groundfish or
their environment can be recognized.  All three of the groundfish
programs are integrated to support west coast groundfish
management.<P>
<P>
The Director's research includes economic and computer analysis,
Klamath and Sacramento River salmon studies, and fisheries and
habitat issues affecting San Francisco Bay and the Gulf of
Farallones.  Tiburon staff conduct field research primarily from
Monterey to Mendocino, with emphasis on long-term studies of the
Gulf of the Farallones, Cordell Bank, and inshore habitats on the
Sonoma and Mendocino coasts.<P>

<STRONG><CENTER>NMFS ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THE     
COASTAL WETLANDS PLANNING, 
PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ACT: 
</CENTER></STRONG></A><P><BR>

<BR><STRONG>I.  Background</STRONG><P>

The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act of 1990 (CWPPRA) required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to establish a Task Force composed of members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Department of Commerce (DOC), represented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); the Department of the Interior, represented by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the U.S. Department of Agriculture, represented by the Soil Conservation Service; and the State of Louisiana.  The Task Force must annually prepare and submit to Congress a project priority list (PPL) of wetland restoration projects in the State of Louisiana. The site selection process is based on the proposed project's technical (scientific) merit, cost effectiveness, and predicted wetland quantity and quality. The Task Force was responsible for the preparation of a comprehensive coastal Restoration Plan for the State of Louisiana which was completed at the end of 1993. The Plan will provide much of the basis for selecting future restoration projects.  <P>

Each CWPPRA project requires the sponsorship of a federal agency Task Force member for implementation. The Act utilizes a trust fund, which is supported by revenues from tax receipts on small engines and other equipment and managed by the COE. Of the amount appropriated from this Fund, 70% (an amount not to exceed $70 million annually) is available for wetland restoration projects and associated activities in the State of Louisiana. CWPPRA mandates a cost-share agreement of 75% federal funds to 25% State funds for all Louisiana projects. The State complies with this mandate by using the money in the State Coastal Restoration Trust Fund created in 1989.  <P>


<STRONG>II.  NMFS Funding and Major Accomplishments </STRONG><P>
The NMFS was provided approximately $0.5 million from the federal Trust Fund for expenditure on CWPPRA activities in FY 1993. The monies were used to support the CWPPRA planning activities of the NMFS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, the NMFS offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and St. Petersburg, Florida, and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) laboratories in Lafayette, Louisiana, Galveston, Texas and Beaufort, North Carolina. A reimbursable account was created by the NMFS to account for all program expenditures.<P>


The NMFS FY 1993 Planning Program accomplished the following:<P>

<EM>*Continued coordination between field, laboratory and headquarters offices. </EM> The NMFS Restoration Center (RC), Southeast Regional Office (SERO), and SEFSC continued to implement a CWPPRA Program Development Plan which defined the role and involvement of the three offices. The active participation of each organization resulted in the NMFS establishing itself as a leader in the development of priority projects and the quality and timeliness of analyses. Documentation that the NMFS supplied to the Task Force assisted greatly in overall program decision making.  Particularly important was the role of SERO Baton Rouge staff in developing and editing the Restoration Plan. This has led to SERO management identifying the CWPPRA program as a model for future interactions that involve regional and headquarters staff.<P>

<EM>*Procurement of computers, network equipment, and boat for NMFS SERO, SEFSC, and RC.</EM>  CWPPRA funds were used to provide the local field offices and laboratories with computer support to conduct the detailed analyses necessary to select restoration projects for the PPL based upon cost effectiveness. Additionally, the hardware has eased communication with NMFS headquarters and other regional offices and has significantly improved both the field office's and laboratory's communications and analysis capabilities. FY93 also saw the delivery of vessel to the SERO Baton Rouge office. This acquisition has greatly enhanced NMFS capability to evaluate CWPPRA sitesz for possible funding and to oversee restoration project implementation.<P>
  
<U>*Development of Task Force monitoring protocols for CWPPRA restoration projects. </U> NMFS was an early advocate in the development of comprehensive monitoring protocols for all CWPPRA-funded restoration projects. The SEFSC's Galveston Laboratory, along with other CWPPRA member agencies, was instrumental in developing a comprehensive fisheries monitoring guidance document. This document was approved for implementation by the Task Force in October 1992. SERO and SEFSC staff have since worked with other Federal and State agencies to oversee the creation of a formal Monitoring Work Group and the standardization of the review and approval of all monitoring plans for CWPPRA funded restoration projects.<P>

<EM>*Provided contractual support to the RC and SERO for restoration planning and project development.</EM>  CWPPRA funds enabled the NMFS to acquire the services of Dr. Ivor van Heerden, of Louisiana State University, to work with the RC, SERO, and SEFSC in obtaining project site information, analyzing the information, and preparing site reports on projects assigned to the agency for evaluation.  With his assistance, NMFS developed site-specific information on numerous potential restoration projects.  Indeed, NMFS was recognized by the CWPPRA Task Force for meeting every deadline for analyses and documentation, thereby serving as a model for other participating agencies. In addition to Dr. van Heerden's support, the RC also negotiated a task-order based support services contract with GOTECH, Inc., of Baton Rouge, to provide engineering and scientific support to NMFS.  <P>

<EM>*Development of the comprehensive CWPPRA Restoration Plan.</EM> The Restoration Plan and the accompanying final environmental impact statement mandated by CWPPRA was produced in December 1993. NMFS assisted in conducting numerous public meetings to help develop nine basin-wide restoration strategies and identifing potential wetland restoration projects. Information from these meetings was then integrated into Louisiana's coast-wide restoration strategy and key projects for each basin were identified. NMFS also participated in team planning efforts to expand these strategies into restoration action items and to evaluate the potential benefits of the proposed projects. Furthermore, NMFS SERO staff made significant contributions in the preparation of the draft and final restoration plan.  <P>

*Proposal and funding by the Task Force of four NMFS-sponsored restoration projects to be implemented from the third PPL. During the planning process for the third PPL, the NMFS identified and presented 7 restoration and 5 demonstration projects for possible funding by the Task Force. Of the 14 restoration and 3 demonstration projects selected by the Task Force, 3 restoration and 1 demonstration project were sponsored by NMFS. Funding for the four projects, likely to be implemented by NMFS via a cooperative agreement with the State in FY94 and subsequent years, is about $9.5 million.  Descriptions of the projects are included in this report.<P>


<STRONG>III.  Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored
         Restoration Projects in FY 1992</STRONG><P>

NMFS is now working with the State of Louisiana to begin restoration of two of the 1992 PPL1 sites compiled by the CWPPRA Task Force. CWPPRA mandates that the Federal government fund 75% of the total cost of the restoration project, while the State will provide the remaining 25%. A cooperative agreement between NMFS and the State of Louisiana will implement the projects and the cost-sharing arrangements.<P>


<EM>A.  LOWER  BAYOU  LACACHE HYDROLOGIC
       RESTORATION   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM>  Since 1932, 15 mineral access canals have been dredged into or across the project area from Bayou Terrebonne (to the east) to Bayou Petit Caillou (to the west). This has allowed the intrusion of salt water into the low-salinity marshes in the interior of the project site.  Additionally, the banks of Bush Canal, at the northern border of the area, have largely disappeared. This has converted about 70% of the northern third of the project area to open water. Water flow appears to have significantly increased in most of the area and the subsequent tidal scouring appears to have contributed to significant marsh loss. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> The intent of this project is to restore natural north-south tidal exchanges and salinity gradients, and to reduce water flow through the dredged canals.  This would be accomplished by constructing shell-reinforced levees at the mouths of each of the nine canals along Bayou Petit Caillou and the six canal plugs along Bayou Terrebonne. This should reduce saltwater intrusion and eliminate the tidal scouring in the canals. The project, over the next 20 years, is expected to enhance 4500 acres of wetlands and slow the loss of an estimated 256 acres of marsh .<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in November 1992. A successful feasibility study and preliminary engineering/design report was completed in April 1994. Final engineering plans will commence Fall, 1994 with construction expected in Fall, 1995.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> This project will cost about $1.6 million dollars.  The federal contribution is about $1.2 million.<P>


<EM>B.  FOURCHON RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description </EM> The project area comprises a 2500-acre impoundment created from dredged material. It has become a large brackish-water pond with minimal tidal exchange with the adjacent Bayou LaFourche. High water levels inside the impoundment and the absence of further sediment deposition are converting marsh to open water.  Furthermore, due to the lack of water exchange with adjacent water bodies, the area provides only minimal habitat for fish and wildlife. Migratory fish, especially juveniles of commercially important species, are largely excluded.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The restoration project would reestablish fisheries access and restore saline marsh habitat within the shallowest portion of the impoundment. This objective would be accomplished by placing culverts beneath a shell road at the north perimeter of the area, thereby allowing regular tidal exchange, increased drainage, and ingress and egress of marine organisms. Lowering the mean water level will produce an additional 145 acres of emergent marsh.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> Emergency construction in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew has partially addressed the proposed restoration of this site. Accordingly, the State is no longer willing to share the cost for additional work.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> It is anticipated that federal funds will not be expended for this project.<P>


<STRONG>IV.  Selection of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration
         Projects for FY 1993</STRONG><P>
Three projects were selected from the Task Force PPL2 for NMFS sponsorship during FY 1993. These projects are likely to be funded through cooperative agreements between the State of Louisiana and the NMFS. The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75%:25% cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA. <P>


<EM>A.  POINT Au FER  </EM><P> 
<EM>Site Description</EM> Point Au Fer is located near the delta of the Atchafalaya River in Terrebone Parish. Saltwater wetlands dominate the seaward parts of the island, while the northern area consists primarily of intermediate marshes. Two pipeline canals, one dredged around 1960 from Mosquito Bayou to the Gulf of Mexico which intersects another older canal linking Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, have allowed for rapid salt water intrusion into the brackish and/or intermediate marshes. At a second site on the western side of the island, approximately 600 yards of beach separating the Gulf of Mexico from an oil access canal near Locust Bayou, is experiencing overwash and salt water intrusion. The effects of Hurricane Andrew exacerbated the problems at both locations. The north-south canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico was opened by the hurricane, allowing salt water intrusion into the marshes. The beach area located at the second project site was also breached. Therefore, it is important that restoration activities start immediately. This project is targeted to be the first of three to be implemented in the Atchafalaya delta region.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> Four canal plugs will be constructed in the pipeline canal between Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier. Similarly, three plugs will be constructed in the north-south pipeline canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. The existing plug at the seaward end of the north-south canal will be strengthened and a portion of the canal 200 feet behind the plug will be backfilled.  About 3500 acres of wetlands along the eastern canals will be enhanced. At the second site, 600 yards of the eroding shoreline along the western part of the island will be enhanced by use of dredged material and shell reinforcement, thereby protecting 1900 acres of wetlands.  <P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in January 1994. Final engineering plans are currently underway with completion by early Fall, 1994. Construction is expected to commence in Fall, 1994.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost  </EM> The total cost for this project is estimated at $1.1 million with the 75% federal share equalling about $0.8 million.<P>



<EM>B.  BIG ISLAND   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> Big Island, located at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, was created with dredged material from the Atchafalaya River navigation channel. Although no spoil has been deposited on the island since the mid-1980s, the location and height of the island prevents the river delta from expanding and creating new wetlands along the western side of the river's main channel. Dredging and other alterations have prevented the Atchafalaya River delta complex from growing despite enormous sediment inputs. Combined with erosion, an estimated 2034 acres could be lost within 20 years.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> A channel with a bottom width of 500 feet and a depth of 6 feet is to be dredged at a 45 degree angle through Big Island.  This will allow water and sediment to flow around a series of delta lobes, to be created with the sediment removed from the channel, thereby allowing the delta to grow.  It is expected that 300 acres of wetlands will be created using dredged material and 1200 acres of marsh are expected to form naturally over the life of the project.<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> A final draft cooperative agreement was received by the DOC in late June, 1994 and is currently being reviewed by NOAA Grants.<P>
 

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The total cost for this project is approximately $4.2 million with the federal portion being $3.1 million.<P>


<EM>C.  ATCHAFALAYA DELTA NATURAL
       SEDIMENT DELIVERY </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description </EM> The COE began placing dredged material at the heads of delta lobes of the eastern (natural) half of the Atchafalaya Delta.  They assumed that this would stabilize existing deltaic islands and the river channel. Unfortunately, in 1988, natural sediment transport processes and erosion sealed the delta's Natal Channel. With the gradual closing of another major delta channel (Radcliffe Pass), the loss of sediment delivery will reduce the eastward growth of the delta complex and increase the impacts of winter storm erosion on existing wetlands. Total loss over a 20-year period is estimated at 1932 acres. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> Dredging both Radcliffe Pass and Natal Channel will allow the natural sediment delivery process to continue. Beneficial use of dredged material will allow creation of 300 acres of new marsh.  Natural marsh accretion over 20 years could total 1800 acres. This would represent a major increase of new marsh in the Atchafalaya delta.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> A final draft cooperative agreement was received by the DOC in late June, 1994 and is currently being reviewed by NOAA Grants.<P> 

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> This project would cost approximately $0.9 million.  The federal share is $0.7 million.<P>


<STRONG>V.  Selection of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration
       Projects in FY 1994</STRONG><P>

Four NMFS-sponsored wetland restoration projects (one deferred) and one shoreline protection demonstration project were selected by the Task Force for PPL3. In addition, a NMFS-sponsored project heads the list of three deferred projects. The funded projects are likely to be constructed through cooperative agreements between the State and the NMFS. The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75:25 percent cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA. <P>


<EM>A.  BAYOU PEROT/RIGOLETTES PROJECT   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description  </EM> The project area is the 4,255-acre peninsula between Bayou Rigolettes  and Bayou Perot in Jefferson Parish which lies in an area of maximum subsidence between the Mississippi River and Bayou LaFourche channel systems. The sediments which make up the peninsula are very fine grained and organic with little structural strength. Since the late 1920s, when the present levees along the Mississippi River were constructed, sediment input into this area has been substantially reduced. As a consequence, the bulk density of the marsh soils has fallen, causing increased marsh loss. In addition to the general marsh loss, shoreline erosion rates are very high.  Unless this peninsula is given a substantial injection of sediments, it will soon be lost.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The object is to mine 600,000 cubic yards of sediments from Bayous Rigolettes and Perot and to place these sediments along the shoreline of the peninsula. A shallow-draft barge fitted with a spray nozzle will spread the sediments into a 250-foot wide strip along the shoreline raising it by about one foot. This shoreline elevation will increase its stability.  As the shoreline erodes over time, much of the dredged material would be moved inward, significantly increasing the life of the peninsula. The project will enhance 190 acres, create 100 acres and protect about 1,065 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> The cost of this project is approximately $1.8 million with the federal share being $1.4 million.<P>


<EM>B.  LAKE CHAPEAU SEDIMENT INPUT AND HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description</EM> The project area, located in Terrebonne Parish, includes 13,000 acres of Point au Fer Island. Point au Fer has lost about 30 percent of its land area since the 1930s due to subsidence, erosion and construction of oil and gas canals.  While the rate of wetland loss on the island as a whole is decreasing due to sediment input from the Atchafalaya River, the Lake Chapeau area is losing marsh as a result of tidal circulation through the northern portion of the island. This circulation is made possible by the many natural and manmade waterways in this area, as well as large areas of open water and broken marsh.  Major marsh loss has occurred in the area surrounding Lake Chapeau and continues at a rate of nearly 15 acres per year. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> The project will include mining 500,000 cubic yards of sediment from the Atchafalaya Bay bottom, spray-jetting the sediment over an 1,800-acre area along Lake Chapeau's shorelines and installing numerous plugs in abandoned oil and gas access canals. The project will restore marshes west of Lake Chapeau, reestablish the hydrologic separation of the Locust Bayou and Alligator Bayou watersheds, and reestablish natural drainage patterns of the Lake Chapeau area. Over 260 acres of open water will be converted to marsh.  Reducing open water areas and filling shallow breaks in the marsh will protect 2,500 acres from wind-wave erosion and an additional 1,000 acres from tidal scour. Plugging man-made canals and gapping spoil banks will restore natural sediment pathways enhancing 12,000 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Current Status: </EM> A first draft cooperative agreement was received in July, 1994 and is currently under review by the Restoration Center.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $4.2 million with the federal share being about $3.1 million.<P>


<EM>C.  EAST TIMBALIER ISLAND SEDIMENT
       RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> The 400-acre island in LaFourche Parish is part of an island chain that fronts Terrebonne/Timbalier Bay. Louisiana's barrier islands play an important role in protecting the Terrebonne, Barataria, and St. Bernard barrier-built estuaries and their surrounding wetlands from the destructive forces of high wave energy, storm surges and salt water intrusion. All of Louisiana's barrier islands are experiencing landward migration, island narrowing and land loss as a consequence of a complex interaction among global sea level rise, subsidence, wave and storm processes, inadequate sediment supply and intense human disturbance. The loss of these barrier islands will result in the accelerated deterioration of the estuaries and the wetlands they protect, thus severely reducing coastal fisheries habitat.  <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The project calls for mining 890,000 cubic yards of sediment and placing it in three embayments along the landward shoreline of East Timbalier Island. This will double the width of the island making it less vulnerable to hurricane and winter storm damage, thus increasing the island's life expectancy. The project will create at least 86 acres of vegetated land on the island and give additional protection to about 1,900 acres of mainland marshes.<P>

<EM>Current Status:</EM> A first draft cooperative agreement was received in July, 1994 and is currently under review by the Restoration Center.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $2.1 million with the federal share being $1.5 million.<P>


<EM>D.  LAKE SALVADOR SHORELINE
       PROTECTION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT  </EM><P> <EM>

Site Description</EM> The project area is located on the southwest end of Lake Salvadore near Bayou Des Allemands in St. Charles Parish. This area has suffered from high rates of land loss caused by shoreline erosion. The lake rim  is breached at several locations, allowing tidal and wave energy to erode the highly organic marsh surface, resulting in large shallow ponds in the interior of the marsh. Since 1956, the project area has lost more than 1,000 acres of marsh, equating to a loss of about 25 percent of the land in the project area.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> This project is designed to test the effectiveness of two separate types of segmented timber breakwaters in highly organic, unconsolidated sediments with poor load bearing capacity. Approximately 11,100 feet of segmented breakwaters, in various configurations, will be constructed and their effectiveness analyzed. In addition, one mile of shell armored berm will be placed at existing blowouts. The project is expected to enhance about 1,003 acres of marsh and shallow water habitat, protect about 166 acres of brackish marsh and restore about 10 acres of marsh along the Lake Salvador shoreline. <P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> The cost of this project is approximately $1.5 million with the federal share being $1.1 million.<P>



<EM>E.  LITTLE VERMILION BAY SEDIMENTATION
      PROJECT (DEFERRED)</EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> The project area covers about 900 acres in Little Vermilion Bay, a shallow arm on the western end of Vermilion Bay in Vermilion Parish.  The most important hydrologic change for this area was the dredging of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW). This channel is a conduit for sediment-rich waters from the Wax Lake Outlet to Little Vermilion Bay. Since the early 1970s about 3 feet of sedimentation has occurred in the study site. Presently, there are two man-made channels that cross the project site from the GIWW.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> By constructing a system of distributary channels off the two man-made channels in the project site, it is expected that increased sedimentation will be induced in shallow areas away from the main channels to eventually create emergent marsh and protect the existing shoreline from wind-wave erosion. To diminish the effects of wind-wave erosion and enhance the development of emergent marsh, a series of dredged terraces will be placed along the landward flank of each dredged distributary channel. Smooth cordgrass and bullwhip will be planted along terraces and the shoreline to reduce erosion and enhance sedimentation.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> This project is on the deferred list for PPL3, which means it may be funded if one or more of the priority projects cannot be constructed.  The cost of this project is approximately $1.5 million with the federal share being about $1.1 million.<P>

<STRONG>VI.  Conclusion</STRONG><P>
NMFS participation in CWPPRA activities resulted in a successful merging of the technical and management resources of the SERO, RC and SEFSC to meet the requirements of the Act, as requested by the working committees of the interagency Task Force. NMFS has been an advocate of a comprehensive monitoring program.  NMFS also proposed and nominated projects for priority lists which were important for wetland-dependent fisheries, and is the lead agency for a total of nine restoration projects from the first three PPLs. Lastly, NMFS contributed to the planning and composition of drafts and the final Restoration Plan.<P>
  
Future activities will include the revision to the Restoration Plan for Louisiana; the annual selection of priority projects; participation in monitoring and preparation of the monitoring report; and the implementation of NMFS-sponsored priority projects. <P>
 
<STRONG> <CENTER>POINT AU FER ISLAND RESTORATION PROJECT</CENTER> </STRONG>


<EM>Site Description</EM> Point Au Fer is located near the delta of the Atchafalaya River.  Saltwater wetlands dominate the Gulf coast of the island, while northern area is primarily intermediate marshes. Two pipeline canals from Mosquito Bayou to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the canal linking Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, dredged around 1960, have allowed for rapid salt water intrusion into the brackish and/or intermediate marshes. At a second site on the western side of the island,  approximately 600 yards of beach separating the Gulf of Mexico from an oil canal near Locust Bayou, is also experiencing overwash and salt water intrusion. The effects of Hurricane Andrew exacerbated the problems. The north-south canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico was blown open by the hurricane, allowing salt water intrusion into the marshes.  Additionally, the beach area located in the second project site was breached. Therefore, it is important that restoration activities commence immediately. This project is targeted to be the first of the three to be implemented.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> Four canal plugs will be constructed in the pipeline canal between Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, and similarly, three plugs will be constructed in the north-south pipeline canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. The existing plug at the seaward end of the north-south canal will be strengthened and the portion of the canal two hundred feet behind the plug will be backfilled. Approximately 3500 acres of wetlands along the eastern canals will be enhanced. At the second site, 600 yards of the eroding western shoreline of the island will be enhanced through spoil deposition and shell reinforcement, thereby protecting 1900 acres of wetlands.  <P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> The total cost for this project is estimated at $1,100,000, with the 75% federal share equalling $825,000.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in January 1994. Final engineering plans are currently underway and should be completed by early Fall, 1994. Construction is expected to commence in late Fall, 1994.<P>

 <STRONG>ATCHAFALAYA SEDIMENT DELIVERY
 RESTORATION PROJECT</STRONG> <P>


<EM>Site Description </EM> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began placing dredged material at the heads of delta lobes of the eastern (natural) half of the Atchafalaya Delta, assuming that this would stabilize existing deltaic islands and river channel locations. Unfortunately natural sediment transport processes and erosion processes sealed the Natal Channel in the delta in 1988.  With the gradual closing of another major delta channel, Radcliffe Pass, the loss of sediment delivery will reduce the eastward growth of the delta complex and increase the impacts of winter storm erosion on existing wetlands.  Total loss over a twenty year period is estimated at 1932 acres. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  Dredging both Radcliffe Pass and Natal Channel will allow the natural sediment delivery process to continue. As a result of dredged material disposal, 300 acres of new marsh will be created. Natural marsh accretion over twenty years could total 1800 acres. This would represent a major increase of new marsh created in the Atchafalaya delta.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is approximately $907,800, with the federal share being $680,900.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> NMFS and the State signed a cooperative agreement in August, 1994 to implement the Atchafalaya Sediment Delivery project in conjuction with the Big Island Mining project. Construction is expected to be underway by September, 1995.   <P>

 <STRONG>BIG ISLAND MINING RESTORATION PROJECT </STRONG><P>


<EM>Site Description</EM>  Big Island, located at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, was created with dredge spoil from the Atchafalaya River navigational channel.  Although no spoil has been deposited on the island since the mid-1980s, the location of the island prevents the river delta from prograding and creating new wetlands along the western side of the river's main channel. Due to navigational dredging and other alterations, the Atchafalaya River delta complex has ceased to grow despite enormous sediment inputs from the river. Combined with the erosional problems in the area, an estimated 2034 acres could be lost over 20 years.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> A channel with a bottom width of 500 feet and a depth of 6 feet is to be dredged at a 45 degree angle through Big Island.  This will allow water and sediment to flow around a series of delta lobes, to be created with the material from dredging the channel, thereby allowing the delta to prograde. It is expected that 300 acres of wetlands will be created during construction as a result of dredged material deposition, and 1200 acres are expected to accrete naturally over the life of the project.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The total cost for this project is approximately $4,100,000 with the federal portion being $3,075,000.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> NMFS and the State signed a cooperative agreement in August, 1994 to implement the Big Island Mining project in conjuction with the Atchafalaya Sediment Delivery project. Construction is expected to be underway by September, 1995. <P>

 <STRONG>LOWER  BAYOU  LACACHE HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION  </STRONG><P>


<EM>Site Description </EM> Since 1932, twelve mineral access canals have been dredged into or across the project area from Bayou Terrebonne (to the east) to Bayou Petit Caillou (to the west). This has resulted in the intrusion of salt water into the low-salinity marshes in the interior of the project site. Additionally, the banks of Bush Canal, at the north border of the area, have largely disappeared, resulting in the conversion of about 70% of the northern third of the project area to open water. Tidal exchange rate in the area appears to have changed from north/south flow at restricted velocities to a rapid flow-through pattern throughout most of the area. Tidal scouring appears to have contributed to significant marsh erosion.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The intent of this project is to restore natural north-south tidal exchanges and salinity gradients, and to reduce flow through the dredged canals by constructing shell-reinforced levees at the mouths of each of nine canals along Bayou Petit Caillou and six canal plugs along Bayou Terrebonne. This should reduce saltwater intrusion and eliminate tidal scouring occurring throughout the series of access canals. The project will enhance 4500 acres of wetlands and slow the loss of an estimated 256 acres over the next 20 years.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $1.7 million dollars, with the federal contribution being approximately $1.3 million.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in November 1992. A successful feasibility study and preliminary engineering/design report was completed in April 1994. Final engineering plans will commence Fall, 1994. Construction expected to begin in Fall, 1995.<P>

<TITLE>Northeast Constituents Meeting - Gloucester</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<center><H4>Constituents Meeting - 11/12/96 - Gloucester House Restaurant</H4></center>
<P>
Andy made opening remarks and briefly explained the Strategic Plan of NMFS.  Wants to make it useful document for internal and external use.  Going on for past years, with internal development of principles and goals over next 5 years.  Meetings going on in all regions and HQ.  Necessary to get input on our draft from those involved in industry.  Expect there will be changes to Plan.  Will use your input for further development of Plan before finalizing.  All have copy of Plan.  We will walk through the Plan.  Would like your comments for development in Plan.  We will go as long as we need to--a few hours or all day.  Will walk through Plan section by section.  Everyone went around and introduced themselves--name and organization/vessel.  
<P>
One gentleman asked that NMFS employees participate in discussions to get their input as well as industry input.  Andy explained the meeting was for comments on Plan only.  Philip Heller went over agenda.  Andy will brief group then comments will be taken.  Hopes everyone will participate in discussions.  Will do one section at a time.  This is not a Q&A session--comments are welcome.
<P>
Heller explained that we will go around room for non-NMFS comments, including others comments.  One woman asked if comments had to be made during the meeting or if they could be submitted later.  Andy said comment sheets could be completed but should be submitted within a few weeks--prior to December meeting.
<HR>
<H4>Mission - Vision</H4>
<P>
1.  Pollution is a cloud hanging over fisheries management--energy costs.  Getting robbed in NY state waters.  Fuel stocks going up, big boats staying close to shore.  Quota for this area isnt coming up with true history due to pollution.  Comments were to express pollution/energy cost.
 <P>
Someone asked what he meant by cost of energy.  He gave Iran/Contra as an example.
<P>
2.  Mission is appropriate.
<P>
3.  Under vision, what is a trust partner?  (Mike S.--American Samoa, Guam, etc.)  Respondent suggested that trust partnership should include private conservation organizations and, therefore, should be added to document.
<P>
4.  Regarding mission, should see shared stewardship.  One of NMFS problems is not good constituent support.  Shared stewardship/vision.
<P>
5.  Poor constituent turnout.  Disappointed that there are so few constituents here.  Would like to find out who and how constituents were invited.  Didnt you expect to see many constituents?  (Andy explained that 275 were invited--council members, SAW members, etc.)
<P>
Vito felt that constituents should be able to make comments as they think of it--not put off until later as it could be forgotten.
<P>
6.  Mission is fine.
<P>
7.  Politics get in the way.
<P>
8.  I wish more fishermen were here--dont want to do all the talking--would like to 
hear input from others in this area.  
<P>
9.  Would like to see NMFS have a vision that the American people are stewards.  They should have stewardship role.  Add American people to stewardship role. 
<P>
10.  Surprised when RA said 2/3 of NMFS are scientists and support people.   Should increase the perceived credibility of NMFS.
<P>
11.  Unrealistic to have no human" impacts to protected species--unrealistic "non-human" impact cause to protected resources.
<P>
12.  Educating American people and elected officials should be included in Mission statement.
<P>
13.  Consumer and recreational interests are left out of process.
<P>
14.  Meaningful communication should be added to Vision, page 6, bullets 6 & 7.
<P>
15.  Meaningful and effective communication with recreational and commercial fishery added to #14.
<P>
16. ??? (Dont think anything was recorded under this.)
<HR>
<H4>Goal 1 - Sustainable Fisheries</H4>
<P>
17.  Will there be funding for all these things (Goal #1)?  Andy Rosenberg explained the difference between MFCMA authorization and a Congressional appropriation for the NMFS budget.
<P>
18.  Performance objectives--Under objective to work with councils--look at councils in other regions to see how they work.
<P>
19.  Page 11--it states that we start with list of currently over fished stocks.  When will we have that list?  What is the time frame?  Identify time frame on overfished list.
<P>
20.  Performance measures are good.
<P>
21.  Does NMFS formally or informally designate fisheries as either commercial, subsistence, or recreational?  Andy answered no to this query.
<P>
22.  Would like to see recreational added to second bullet on slide--Regional Objective #1.
<P>
23.  Suggests wording say all species under the purview of NMFS.
<P>
24.  Add with reasonable and understanding regulations".
<P>
25.  Highlight stock enhancement in objectives in Regional plan (elevate stock enhancement to Regional plan.)
<P>
26.  Using risk adversement management approach across the board is extreme.  Why is it used across the board?
<P>
27.  Second objective--Like risk adverse management approach.
<P>
28.  Disagree with risk adverse management approach across board.  (No vote same as #26.)
<P>
29.  What does #2, pg. 9--Performance measures--mean (Reduce uncertainty....)?
<P>
30.  Just as important to take action on every species as well as particular species.  Risk taking is important.  We dont need anymore emergencies.  We need risk taking right off.  Not just risk species.
<P>
31.  Re:  Stock Assessment Workshop--Would like to see NMFS collaborate with marine users and academia when stock assessments are made.  Use commercial fishing vessels to collect data.
<P>
32.  Strategic approaches need to be clearly defined.  Clarification to what periodically means (pg. 9--Strategic Approach).
<P>
33.  Use fishermen as another source of data.  (Need more than one source of data to conduct assessments.)
<P>
34.  Reaction to questions 31 and 32--There should not be equal weight given to scientists and  fishermen sources of data.
<P>
35.  Should have commercial people/interests tempered because they have a vested interest in catching fish.  Scientists are more impartial.  (# has to do with Stock Assessment Workshop.)
<P>
36.  NMFS samples where there aren't any fish.  Scientific data should be collected on a fishing vessel using NMFS staff to collect data--builds upon #31.
<P>
37.  Page 10, last sentence--Swap information with academia and other venues.   
<P>
38.  Word determined is confusing on page 9, #2.   Does it mean diminished?
<P>
39.  Need to emphasize user groups--value fishermen knowledge.
<P>
40.  Define subsistence fisheries.  Why is it used?
<P>
41.  Change increase to promote--RO #3, pg. 13-14.  
<P>
42.  The word "increase" is very important.
<P>
43.  Think both words are very important--"increase & promote".
<P>
44. Maximize is hazy.  Both commercial and recreational fisheries have to co-exist.  Commercial needs to be emphasized.
<P>
45.  How will NMFS lower fish prices and increase fisher profits?
<P>
46.  How will effort be measured in these performance measures?
<P>
47.  Page 14--where it says building upon existing partnerships.....  Add building of non-profits, academia, fishery communities, etc.
<P>
48.  Referencing #44, we cant specialize in commercial fishing.  Must come up with a compromise to involve all fishery users to develop a rebuilding of the resource.
<P>
49. RO #3--Need to develop more markets and preserve commercial waterfront.
<P>
50.  Add increase angler catch and satisfaction.
<P>
51.  RO #3--Goal of lowering fresh fish prices should not be included.  Should not be elevated to that status.
<P>
52.  Increased biomass/stock will result from all of these things happening in RO3.
<P>
53.  Would like to see increased emphasis within NMFS on marketing.
<P>
54.  Add while ensuring their sustainability--pg. 13 & 14.
<P>
55.  Pg. 14--It is strange that NMFS will only collaborate with native Americans.  Should use the words collaborate with a lot more often in the document.
<P>
56.  Pg. 13, item 13--Separate bin should be used for by-catch.  It has value.  Skipper gets his expenses for bringing that in.  Utilize by-catch, separate bins.  Profits should go into separate (dedicated) insurance accounts for bonafide fishermen, crew, captains, etc.
<P>
57.  NMFS and fishing community--over what time frame to maximize social economic, and health benefits?  NMFS should define time frame so NO #3 can be realized.
<P>
58.  Very pleased to see NER has put stock enhancement at that level.  At National level, sound  aquaculture and stock enhancement should be added.  
<P>
59.  Something specific should be stated regarding appropriate locations for this aquaculture effort--specific offshore locations.  Tie stock analyses into aquaculture to a level of feeding.
<P>
60.  Establish an Aquaculture Council.  Like to see a council for just  aquaculture.  Set up a separate council to develop aquaculture in the region.  Would like more diverse council.
<P>
61.  Pg. 15, second sentence--Clarification of why there is a distinction between aquaculture that is produced for wild release and market release.  Are wild and natural aquaculture distinguishable?  Need better language.
<P>
62.  Add other interested parties including industry, non-profits, etc., to first sentence of last paragraph of page 15.
<P>
63.  Dont take good fishing grounds and develop for aquaculture.
<P>
64.  Investigate stock enhancement opportunities by determining appropriate sites, species, and scale.  (Pt. four, pg. 15)
<P>
65.  Number "one" priority of aquaculture should be to release fish into the wild.
<P>
66.  Suitable species (cod/haddock) should be added to number 65.
<P>
67.  Simplify permitting process.  Elevate it to a goal--its a challenge.
<P>
68.  Objective 5,  Pg. 16--Like to reword it to work with the fishermen to recover and maintain protected species and work with user groups to reduce conflicts.  Want NMFS to work with us.
<P>
69.  Concern is funding for assessments--how will NMFS fund that?
<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - Protected Resources</H4>
<P>
70.  Any cost/benefit analyses?  Such analysis should be conducted to evaluate the zero mortality rate goal (Zmrg). 
<P>
71.  At what point do we say enough, i.e., right whales and harbor porpoise, and stop spending money? 
<P>
72.  Re:  Strategic approach--Is there an evaluation on whether protected species are being protected by man--evaluation of impact by humans.  Are changes due to man-made impacts or natural stressors/variation?
<P>
73.  These performance measures are good ones.
<P>
74.  Objective #6, pg. 18--Last sentence of second to last paragraph is confusing--not written well, especially around the word ecological.  Should emphasize research toward ecologically sound development.
<P>
75.  Like the second sentence in first paragraph of page 18--In addition,....  Implication is that marine mammals can cause damage.
<P>
76.  Pg. 17--applies to Magnuson Act and RO6 slide--likes this sentence--We will establish.....  Need cooperative agreements for ESA, MMPA, and MFCMA.
<P>
77.  Pg. 19--Use consensus management in other areas and other conflicts.
<HR>
<H4>Goal 3 - Habitat</H4>
<P>
78.  What happens if biologists discover that trawlers and draggers destroy habitat?  Will we close those areas?  Let area lie fallow and allow small hook and line trawlers to focus on those areas during certain times.  Should also encourage the establishment of man-made reefs for fishing--they work. 
<P>
79.  What will you do if you find out dragging gear on bottom is actually cultivating and establishing an ecosystem of its own, increasing biodiversity?  Theres good and bad to working the habitat.
<P>
80.  Both of them raise implementation policy issues.  Will environmental habitat considerations drive fisheries management decisions?  Does it automatically imply that you will take implementation measures on this broad policy.  Is the policy to end activities or mitigate?
<P>
81.  First paragraph, pg. 19, first sentence--Depends in part on the health of their habitat... 
<P>
82.  Both of these objectives have restore in there.  How do you restore and create at the same time?  Restore is not a strong enough word.  The word enhance sounds better.   Do you want to restore or create and enhance?  Restore limits you.  
<P>
83.  Habitat is the most critical issue to all rebuilding efforts.   Somehow emphasize the necessity of good science in identifying habitats.  Recognize the importance of good science (best efforts) in rebuilding protective fisheries.
<P>
84.  NMFS will support and provide leverage for funding of research on habitat issues, including essential habitat and fishing gear.
<P>
85.  Pg. 19, objective says no net loss when it should say net gain - to increase habitat--goal should include "net gain".
<P>
86.  Pg. 20, last paragraph, this is a hell of a statement--very supportive.  Add U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to this list.
<P>
87.  The second to last paragraph, sentence beginning, Through partnership... should include Fish and Wildlife . . . to recognize their funding input.
<P>
88.  Pg. 19, pt. 2, add present and past to performance measures.
<P>
89.  Pg. 21, objective:  biodiversity--Still have the problem with restore--its too limiting and should be changed to create and enhance.
<P>
90.  Use all three words--create, restore, enhance.
<P>
91.  Felt this is tightly written.  Big shift from single species to multispecies.  How do you gauge success?  
<P>
92.  Strong support for ecosystem management.
<P>
93.  Measure success by rebuilding the stock of resource and rejuvenating the stocks.
<P>
94.  More stress should be put on last sentence of paragraph 1, ecosystem safe fishing technologies.
<HR>
<H4>Foundations for Stewardship</H4>
<P>
95.  Pg. 21, last paragraph--Need to develop partnerships is more than international.
<P>
96.  Pg. 23--Objective--accurate and timely should replace better management decision.
<P>
97.  NEFSC should publish a running list of their technical publications.
<P>
98.  Pg. 22--last four words in first paragraph are weak.  What is the desired result?
<P>
99.  Pg. 22, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence--after the comma (,), scratch that phrase.  Replace with  NOAA Fisheries must help develop a sense of stewardship.
<P>
100. Page 25--Objective is of paramount importance.
<P>
101. First sentence on page 25 is very strong statement.  Agree with it, especially open and honest exchange.
<P>
102.  Exchange as two-way process.  NOAA out or back and forth?  Develop partnership with users.
<P>
103.  Constituent Groups are needed to advise NMFS on issues.
<P>
104.  Notify media and interested parties at least 2-4 weeks prior to meeting.
<P>
105.  Like to see NOAA employees allowed to take part in collaborative problem-solving and brain-storming methods rather than sit there and say nothing.  Example would be the Harbor Porpoise Working Group.
<P>
106.  Page 26--NOAA should be a steward for the resource.  It seems like you are duplicating Law Enforcement.  Coast Guard and Environmental Police do good job.  An extra enforcement party is making it even more confusing.  NOAA should remain stewardship organization that explains state of the resource and how to preserve it from going bad and how it can be improved.
<P>
107. Last paragraph, pg. 26--making regs more comprehensible....  should say commercial and recreational fishermen--not just fishermen.
<P>
108.  Agree with #106--get rid of NMFS Enforcement.  Have enough enforcement with CG & EPA (State).
<P>
109. Law Enforcement in general ought to support fisheries regulations.  Whether its done by NOAA or State, it should have adequate resources.  Current enforcement is inadequate.
<P>
110. State Fisheries and Wildlife and Div. Of Env. Law Enforcement are doing a good  job considering the amount of money and employees they have to work with.  Judges are the problem.
<P>
111. Maybe conflict can be resolved regarding duplicate and inadequate law enforcement agencies.  Agree that we should reduce duplication and overlap.
<P>
**Andy explained that they dont have overlapping responsibilities.  NMFS has dockside authorization while CG has the sea and State has State regs.
<P>
112.  Deploying uniformed agents is a good idea.  
<P>
113.  Establishing Compliance Advisory Groups is a tremendous idea.  Helps control possibility of breaking law.  Support idea of self-policing by fishers.
<P>
114.  Like whats up on slide no. 12--NMFS should put Regional objectives into National Plan.
<P>
115.  Quality of personnel is very important.
<P>
116.  Involve constituents in inter-regional problem-solving teams.
<HR>
<H4>Other Comments - WHATS MISSING - Is the big picture complete?</H4>
<P>
117.  Did not have enough time to review the Strategic Plan.  It should have been sent out earlier.
<P>
118.  Plan should be handed out at Council Meetings.  Not discussed, but given out to prepare constituents for meeting.
<P>
119.  Plan should have been sent out with invitation letter.
<P>
120.  Should have at least 10 minutes to describe the type of meeting being held.  Explain the process up front.
<P>
121.  Would like to see quick synopsis of what youve done since existence.  List some accomplishments, where meeting is taking off from.  
<P>
122.  Would like to know just what NOAAs responsibilities are.  What Divisions are within NOAA and what authority does NOAA have.
<P>
123.  Have short, open discussion of Plan up front then go to review.  A format change was proposed that would allow stakeholders to throw out ideas while not taking ownership of them.
<P>
124.  Pg. 2--Investigate stock enhancement as national objective.
<P>
125.  Would like to see the outcome of the meeting--the plan after its redrafted.
<P>
*Andy said they should see something by the end of January.
<P>
126. Funding is a big roadblock.
<P>
127. Constituent input is needed to prioritize NMFS activities.
<P>
128.  Will there be a disposition on the comments made?  Who will make those decisions on what comments are incorporated and what ones are not incorporated?
<P>
*Andy explained that it will be discussed at National Leadership Meeting in December.  Rollie Schmitten will make the final decision.  NMFS hopes to finalize National Strategic Plan by the end of January 1997.  NER will then finalize regional implementation plan.
<P>
*Minutes of meeting will be supplied upon request.
<P>
129.  What authority does NOAA have regarding selection of Fishery Management Council members?  Andy described the process:  governor's recommendations forwarded to NMFS and then elevated to the Secretary of Dept. of Commerce.
<P>
130.  Think its exactly the right approach to hold constituent meetings.
<P>
131.  Like to do this same process with NOAA employees and representatives.

42.	The aquaculture objective should be broadened to incorporate the ocean ranching concept (where aquaculture outputs are released to common property users rather than directly into the market).(4 red, 8 green)
<P>
43.	In reference to pg 14.  Eliminating regulations that raise the cost of fishing may conflict with objectives 1. and 2.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
44.	In reference to pg 9.  Change it to "maintain healthy stocks of marine resources".(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
45.	In reference to pg 15.  It would be better to say NOAA Fisheries role is to ensure aquaculture activities are environmentally sound.  The role should be more protective that advocative.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
46.	In reference to pg 13.  Regulations should be based on performance measures rather than command and control measures, e.g. judge bycatch by what is caught rather than what type of net caught it.  Carrot vs. stick approach.(0 red, 14 green)

<P>
63.	In reference to pg 16, last paragraph 1st sentence.  It is not clear for what species recovery plans should be developed.  Plans should be developed for all species that are reduced, declining, or significantly affected by human activities, and should be produced by a team including the major stakeholders.(0 red, 13 green)
<P>
64.	In reference to pg 16.  Add "recognize importance of partnerships with state, Alaska native, and academic agencies.(0 red, 18 green)

68.	In reference to pg 16.  The first paragraph should not narrow to marine ecosystems.  It should include freshwater and estuarine systems as well.(0 red, 13 green)
<P>
69.	In reference to pg 16.  Uncertainty of stock status should not be synonymous to strategic stock.  NMFS should not waste resources on species that are known to be "healthy", albeit of uncertain size.(2 red, 6 green)
<P>
70.	Comment #61 should be elevated to a performance measure.(1 red, 3 green)
<P>
71.	In reference to pg 16, last paragraph.  Add wording that conservation and recovery plans should include criteria for evaluating population status and NMFS should use those criteria.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
72.	In reference to pg 18, second paragraph.  Recognize practices along with technologies.(0 red, 11 green)
<HR>
<H4>GOAL 3.  HEALTHY COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS</H4>
<P>
73.	The present performance measures are actually activities.  Restate them in terms of outcomes.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
74.	In reference to pg 19 #1.  Add "human-caused damage" to "human-caused loss".(0 red, 8 green)
<P>
75.	In reference to pg 19 #2.  Coordinating no-net loss of habitat at the national level is wrong.  Redirect it to a regional or local level.(0 red, 9 green)

<P>
80.	A general comment:  Emphasize preservation rather than restoration and/or creation.(1 red, 10 green)
<P>
81.	No net-loss is a flawed concept that causes us to lie about our ability to replace or restore habitat.(0 red, 7 green)
<P>
82.	In reference to pg 20.  Partnering with other agencies to level external funding is a good idea.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
83.	In reference to comment #80.  Preserve and restore need emphasis.  Has problem with concept of create.(0 red, 7 green)
<P>
84.	Term "habitat availability" is vague.  What does it mean?(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
85.	Preservation is first in priority and then do the other two (restoration and creation).(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
86.	Institute commercial and recreational fishing practices that are the least detrimental to fishery habitat.(1 red, 9 green)
<P>
87.	Add involvement of local people in design and conduct of research to give them a sense of ownership in the results.(0 red, 9 green)
<P>
88.	Develop prioritized research needs list in partnership with other local, state, and federal agencies, and stakeholders.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
89.	In reference to pg 26.  Institute fishery management measures that place responsibility for fishing practices on vessel operators rather than the owners.(1 red, 4 green)
<P>
90.	In reference to pg 23.  Use a team approach when evaluating NOAA fisheries science programs.  Team should include stakeholders.(0 red, 8 green)
<P>
91.	In reference to pg 23.  Add bullet:  strengthen the NMFS relationship with NOAA's OAR and academic communities.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
92.	Develop a public (non-fishing segment) education program on a national level regarding fisheries issues.  Non-fishing public is not aware of reasons for issues.(1 red, 11 green)
<P>
93.	In reference to pg 26.  Suggest a new performance measure:  strengthen agency enforcement by leveraging enforcement resources with other law enforcement agencies, e.g. Coast Guard, USDI Fish and Wildlife Service, States, and tribes.(0 red, 9 green)

<P>
96.	In reference to pg 24.  Add "ecological"  to "economic and ecological assessments".(0 red, 8 green)
<P>
97.	Encourage NOAA partnerships with primary and secondary educational institutions to encourage interest in science.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
98.	In reference to pg 26.  Institute management measures that economically reward individual performance and compliance. example: reward halibut fishers that catch only halibut.(1 red, 10 green)
<P>
99.	In reference to pg 24.  Reword:  Develop increased understanding of living marine resource natural variations.(0 red, 9 green)

<HR>
<H4>WHAT'S MISSING?</H4>
<P>
106.	Separating fishery management from the need to conserve non-target species is a non-ecological approach.  You can't separate these two functions.(0 red, 9 green)
<P>
107.	Throughout the document:  Sport, subsistence, and commercial fishing should be stated (treated) as being on an equal plane.  There should be no implied priority for commercial fishing.(2 red, 3 green)
<P>
108.	Overall, the document needs a dedicated section on performance measures related to communication with stakeholders and other agencies.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
109.	Thank you.  This is a good first step, keep the process alive, don't let it stagnate.(0 red, 12 green)
<P>
110.	NOAA needs to move toward ecosystem-based management.  Will the agency really do this?(0 red, 7 green)
<P>
111.	In reference to the Vision (pg 6).  Add "socially, economically, and ecologically viable species.(1 red, 6 green)
<P>
112.	Fish culturing practices in general should be addressed (state, federal, and private, escapement problems, genetic manipulation, conflicts that arise when hatcheries are integrated into fishery restoration).(0 red, 4 green)
<P>
113.	A definition of ecosystem-based management should be included.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
114.	Change "aquaculture" to "aquaculture and fisheries enhancement".(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
115.	Comment.  Our desire to reduce bycatch may be inconsistent with ecosystem-based management.  We need to know more about interrelationships.(3 red, 5 green)
<HR>
<H4>ADDITIONAL WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM CONSTITUENTS</H4>
<P>
Must increase understanding of natural versus human-caused changes in fishery & protected species stocks.  I.e.  strengthen the knowledge link of climate & fisheries.
<P>
Change "aquaculture" to "aquaculture & fisheries enhancement" in all places.
<P>
Rather than write a document for NOAA Fisheries activity - make the document reflect NMFS Leadership in working with scientists in other agencies and from academia in reaching these same goals.  Thus strengthen the science partnership approaches.
<P>
NOAA has recognized the value of its partnership with the nation's university community.  Some of the best are in the area of fisheries and climate.  This document should reflect that.
<P>
Given poor records of predicting the response of fisheries stocks to management actions and objectives, NOAA needs to incorporate the state of the art of ecosystem level ecological risk assessment -- designed to use scientific research to predict outcomes from management actions.
<HR>
<H4>COMMENT SUBMITTED IN WRITING THROUGH MAIL (I.E. NOT PRESENT AT MEETINGS)</H4>
<P>
Include ocean ranching in aquaculture objective.
<P>
Include ocean ranching in aquaculture objective.

<H3>ITEMS (ISSUES/CONCERNS/SUGGESTIONS, ETC) PRESENTED BY CONSTITUENTS</H3>

<H5>GOAL I.    SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES</H5>
<P>
1. Eliminate line on page 15 "As discussed here, aquaculture is production for immediate entry into markets and does not apply to production of products released to the wild and intended for later harvest or rebuilding of stocks."(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
2. NMFS should move toward ecosystem management not single species.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
3. Regarding overfishing, the current focus is on increasing yield.  Need definition of overfishing that focuses on ecological rather than economic functions (sustainability).(2 red, 1 green)
<P>
4. Under increasing economic benefits need to mitigate impacts on investors.(1 red, 0 green)
<P>
5. On comment #3, commentor thinks that is the current definition.(2 red, 0 green)
<P>
6. Instead of advance aquaculture NMFS role should be to supervise or to monitor. Production mode of aquaculture should be in private sector.(2 red, 2 green)
<P>
7.	Page 15 objective. NMFS should stay out of business of promoting one competing group against another.(1 red, 1 green)
<P>
8.	Need separate objective that states:  Reduce bycatch and associated mortality and address use of clean gear.(1 red, 1 green)
<P>
9.	NMFS needs a strong observer program with national coordination in order to have high data integrity.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
10.	Regarding increase economic objective - NMFS is setting itself up to manage conflicting mandates, maximize economic production vs resource protection.(2 red, 2 green)
<P>
11.	On comment # 8, need to define clean gear.(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
12.	Overfishing word usage is negative.  Need a more positive statement.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
13.	Regarding recreational fishing plan, what does this refer to?  Need better sharing with public of what NMFS is planning to do.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
14.	Eliminate Overfishing objective; should be rewritten to read - Rebuild stocks by eliminating...(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
15.	NMFS should de-emphasize pure economic analysis and emphasize all three; social, health, and economic.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
16.	Specify in detail NMFS policy on IFQ/ITQ.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
17.	Agree with comment #6, but NMFS should be advancing aquaculture research not the actual production.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
18.	Regarding unknown status of stocks, NMFS needs to expand efforts to determine status.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
19.	NMFS should not be in business of expanding markets where none exist.(2 red, 2 green)
<P>
20.	There are more things that effect stocks in addition to overfishing such as pollution, predators, and other human impacts.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
21.	Language of first objective needs modification to address consideration of overfishing in adjacent waters - transboundary stocks.(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
22.	Transboundary stocks not just fishery issue but also involve endangered/protected species (NMFS should be more active). Example given was anecdotal catch of sea birds in non-U.S. waters.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
23.	Expand overfishing definition to address when a stock is over fished it is also affecting the ecosystem. Definition should include ecosystem impacts/indices.  What is impact on ecosystem of overfishing?(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
24.	In addition to considering impacts/effects of overfishing, NMFS needs to consider outside influences such as climate, forage species, predation.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
25.	NMFS should reduce the role of observers in allocative issues and focus more on collecting information on health of stocks of commercial fisheries.(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
26.	Agree with comment # 25, NMFS should increase focus on biological information rather than safety, etc.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
27.	For first performance measure add after benefits ...to citizens of the United States or Nation.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
28.	Need a new objective that states: Promote a healthy and economically viable fishing industry within the biological constraints identified.(1 red, 7 green)
<P>
29.	Keep social impacts in mind when considering increased benefits.(0 red, 4 green)
<P>
30.	Promote better utilization of bycatch.(1 red, 6 green)
<P>
31.	Too many multiple uses/demands on natural resources makes NMFS job difficult.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
32.	Page 13 number 3.  Modify to include elimination of habitat destruction.  Put bycatch back in water alive, if not possible need to promote better utilization.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
33.	Eliminate the sentence -"However, aquaculture can have significant detrimental effects on the habitats of natural stocks of living marine resources" on page 15 if #1 comment is adopted.(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
34.	Not sure NMFS should be in the business of fostering aquaculture.(1 red, 7 green)
<HR>
<H4>GOAL II.   RECOVER PROTECTED SPECIES</H4>
<P>
35.	Under #1 objective, maintain...  NMFS needs to address concerns/problems related to overpopulated and or excessive populations of marine mammals such as California sea lions.(1 red, 7 green)
<P>
36.	Need to consider marine bird populations in NMFS gear management scheme.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
37.	Add a performance measure to decrease or cease suspected human caused threats even in the absence of absolute scientific knowledge.(5 red, 0 green)
<P>
38.	Add seabird populations to performance measure #1.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
39.	Arent seabirds managed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service?(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
40.	NMFS has responsibility to reduce fishery conflicts related to seabirds.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
41.	In the first paragraph on page 16 add Migratory Bird Treaty Act under statutes.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
42.	Page 16, second sentence of first paragraph under strategic approach add:  Address conflicts of species at high historical levels.(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
43.	Regarding comment #41 - jurisdiction is within 0-3 miles on Migratory Bird Treaty Act.(0 red, 0 green)
<HR>
<H4>III.  HEALTHY COASTS</H4>
<P>
44.	No net loss is often an excuse for degrading essential habitat with empty promises to restore elsewhere.  Hope this isnt NMFS intent.(1 red, 1 green)
<P>
45.	In reference to habitat what does the word "create" mean?  Do you mean protect, restore, or to create using artificial means?(0 red, 0 green)
<P>
46.	Assessment of net loss of habitat should occur at the regional level.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
47.	Under strategic approaches under restore, etc on page 21, add wording to include field studies in addition to simulation modeling.  Field studies are preferable to computer modeling in understanding ecological interactions.(0 red, 1 green)
<HR>
<H4>IV.  INFRASTRUCTURE</H4>
<P>
48. 	How is NMFS going to achieve the high quality science without sufficient funds?(0 red, 10 green)
<P>
49.	Add language to encourage collaboration with industry and industry groups to complement NMFS research and management responsibilities.(0 red, 8 green)
<P>
50.	NMFS should continue to have peer reviews of programs and findings such as done by the National Marine Mammal Laboratorys Steller sea lion program.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
51.	Re:  Comments # 48 and # 49.  Who pays?  General fund or ourselves?(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
52.	Need to bridge gap between educational institutions and private stakeholders. (More collaboration)(0 red, 4 green)
<P>
53.	Improve cooperation and collaborative efforts with state agencies.(0 red, 4 green)
<P>
54.	Under foundations for stewardship, NMFS is setting itself up for failure by managing/balancing multiple conflicting demands.(2 red, 0 green)
<P>
55.	Important for scientific community to avoid premature announcements on stock status.  This can impact economic markets.(1 red, 5 green)
<P>
56.	On comment #54, mission of regulatory agency is to balance competing interests.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
57.	Industry seminar series of School of Marine Affairs, UW, is an excellent example for improving communications with industry.(1 red, 4 green)
<P>
58.	NMFS needs to expand usage of Internet type communications.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
59.	NMFS needs to improve communications with observers.  NMFS decisions impact observers and this is often not communicated.(1 red, 1 green)
<P>
60.	Complete knowledge is often unattainable and we must often act with what is available.  Lack of complete scientific knowledge should not be an excuse for delay.(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
61.	Dont penalize vessels that carry observers.  They are source of data.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
62.	Regarding #61 - What does penalize mean?  Answer: vessels that do not carry observers should not gain an advantage.(0 red, 1 green)
<P>
63.	If observers retain compliance role then they should receive adequate pay and appropriate training.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
64.	Agree with comment # 63(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
65.	Add to comment # 63 something to the effect that if regulations are in place that they need to be enforced across the board.  Observer accommodation regulations are often not enforced.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
66.	NMFS should pursue effective quota monitoring and accurate measure of harvest.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
67.	Important to strengthen agency infrastructure.  Demands on staff are high and perhaps unsustainable.  Staff is limited.(0 red, 6 green)
<P>
68.	NMFS should coordinate with industry efforts to improve agency budget.(0 red, 8 green)
<HR>
<H4>WHAT'S MISSING?</H4>
<P>
69.	Elaboration on #49.  In cases where NMFS does not have fiscal or personnel resources, industry may be able to come up with resources. This kind of collaboration (as in Sea State Program) should be encouraged.(0 red, 2 green)
<P>
70.	Page 25 - Ensuring that there is a public affairs specialist in each region may be important but a better alternative would be to put this money into science programs.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
71.	The relationship between councils and NMFS/NOAA is not articulated in this plan.  Is NMFS a leader or arbitrator for councils?(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
72.	Agency needs good comprehensive observer programs in fisheries.(0 red, 7 green)
<P>
73.	NMFS should investigate concern about transboundary impacts (international - Russians) on protected species such as birds.(0 red, 5 green)
<P>
74.	NMFS should foster management systems that make individual fishermen responsible for their own actions.(0 red, 3 green)
<P>
75.	Add to comment # 74 the need for NMFS to create incentives for fishermen to decrease bycatch, etc.(0 red, 7 green)
<P>
<HR>
<H4>ADDITIONAL WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM CONSTITUENTS</H4>
<P>
<H6>CONSTITUENT 1:</H6>
<P>
Page #13
1) Bycatch reduction, minimization of bycatch mortality, focus on use of clean gear to accomplish those goals should be set out as a separate objective.
<P>
2)Text in paragraph 2 suggests that economic efficiency, i.e., profit, is the primary objective of management. In fact, social considerations - particularly who gets access to the fish and what are the bycatch implications should and do predominate in management decision making. Magnuson Act amended to consider rather than promote economic efficiency.
<P>
3)What specifically is the NMFS/NOAA policy on ITQ\IFQ management now? Do not hide behind congressionally mandated moratorium and study - what is NMFS\NOAA policy now?
<P>
Page #19
Add marine birds - reduce conflicts/interactions with commercial fishing operations.
<P>
<H6>CONSTITUENT 2:</H6>
<P>
Objective:  Advance environmentally sound aquaculture.
Delete the line As discussed here, aquaculture is production etc.. (on page 15).
<P>
Discussion
In AK fin fish farming is illegal by state law - Restricting the definition to what is proposed in the draft effectively eliminates NMFS role in Alaska for this objective.
<P>
Page 15
Delete the third line starting with However, aquaculture... We have several cases in AK where the ocean ranching aquaculture technique has benefited the wild stocks by taking fishermen off certain wild stocks - spreading out the fleet, etc...
<P>
Page 15
Delete the first line - Not all research suggests we have approached the limits of the worlds oceans for production - why state this when we are only in the beginning stages of understanding the research and observations.
<P>
Page 25 
Add point. Add Internet connectivity - Information - Access to the databases, - Input to NMFS from the public - Electronic access to NMFS publications.
<P>
<H6>
CONSTITUENT 3:</H6>
<P>
1. NMFS should assist in the development of new product forms and markets for fish and shellfish harvested in the commercial fisheries.
<P>
<H6>CONSTITUENT 4:</H6>
<P>
Objective:  Increase economic,...benefits to the nation.
<P>
Comment
NMFS management decisions must recognize and incorporate interests of all established sectors of the seafood industry: fishermen, onshore processors, and fishing communities.

<title>Northwest Constituent Meeting - Portland</title>
</head>
<body><center><H4>Constituent Meeting</H4>
<H4>Portland, Oregon</H4>
<H4>November 7, 1996</H4></center>

<HR>
The meeting was attended by 16 people.  Comments received on the Strategic Plan are recorded below by Goal.  The agreement/disagreement with comments is the number of attendees that indicated strong agreement (green card) or strong disagreement (red card) with a comment made.
<HR>
<H4>Goal 1 - Sustainable Fisheries</H4>
<P>
1.	Objective 2, 2nd paragraph under objective - The language on the number of stocks is misleading, unclear, and confusing.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
2.	Objective 1, 2nd paragraph under Strategic approach, 4th sentence - What are the criteria under which benefits are measured.  How will NMFS deal with weak stocks and minor stocks in a fishery assemblage when determining benefits of doing stock assessments?  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
3.	Objective 1,  PM # 2 - How do you measure "reduced uncertainty"?  [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
4.	Objective 1 - What stocks?  How can it be done better when management failed in past?  [1 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
5.	Objective 1,  PM # 1 - This is a high priority.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
6.	Objective 1, PM #1 - Hurry up--we can't afford to wait longer to maintain healthy stocks.  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
7.	Objective 1 - Need to define "sustainable use levels" and historic levels.  Is it harvestable levels?  The terms mean different things to different groups.  [2 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
8.	Objective 1, PM #2 - This measure is achievable in next five years.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
9.	Objective 1 - Change wording on objective from "of" to "for" and change "species" to "fisheries".   This clarifies that the goal is for sustainable fisheries, otherwise it is unclear on intended outcome.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
10.	Objective 1 - Relationship of objective to the first performance measure is confusing.  The wording "known to be healthy" implies that stocks of an unknown status will not be addressed.  [3 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
11.	Objective 1 - Ensure good definitions of words (e.g., "healthy" is too simplistic).  [11 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
12.	Objective 1 - Can we have sustainable fisheries without knowing stock numbers?  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
13.	Objective 1, 3rd paragraph under Strategic Approaches - How can NMFS forecast future trends when we can barely figure out current stock status?
<P>
14.	Objective 1, Strategic Approaches - There is no discussion of management objectives, what management goal is implied in the objective (i.e., full utilization vs. maintaining healthy stocks).  Does the objective mean to provide utilization or just healthy stocks without full utilization on top of healthy?  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
15.	Objective 1 - There is too much emphasis in strategic approaches on fishing activities as opposed to other activities that impact stocks. Other factors affecting productivity are not addressed.  There may be uncertainty, but some factors may have greater impacts (e.g., adequate habitat).   [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
16.	Objective 1 - Add "value to" to objective between "of" and "commercial"...fisheries (quantitative and qualitative value).  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
17.	All objectives are mixing oranges and apples in "healthy stocks".  Unhealthy stocks are not always caused by fisheries, there are other reasons.  The objectives do not adequately address what will be done for unhealthy stocks. [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
18.	Objective 1 - There is a big difference between using species vs. fisheries in the objective (value to harvest or to stock).  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
19.	Objective 2 - Focusing too much on overfishing.  Other factors impacting stocks such as hydroelectric system are not included.  There is a need to broaden the focus.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
20.	Objective 1 - Emphasis should be on "species" rather than "fisheries."  One follows the other.  [3 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
21.	Objective 1 - There is more to recovery than controlling harvest.  If there was no fishing and no management how would fish recover?  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
22.	Objective 1, 2nd paragraph under objective - The language should be changed to state "important to maintain healthy levels", should not assume they are healthy.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
23.	Objective 1 - Do not use the word "species" in the objective, emphasize healthy stocks.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
24.	Objective 2 - Support elimination of overfishing, but objective should go further and include other factors impacting stocks (i.e., the rest of the 4H's - hydro, hatcheries, habitat and harvest).  [3 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
25.	Objective 2 - This is not a complete objective.  It should be changed to ..."rebuild unhealthy stocks"...  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
26.	Objective 2,  PM #2 - The law requires certain things.  NMFS should take into account other environmental conditions affecting the fisheries when going through the 10-year schedule.  [9 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
27.	Objective 2 - What level are stocks to be rebuilt to?  Define the level and criteria to set the level.  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
28.	Objective 2 - What fisheries does this refer to?  Some fisheries have different impacts on stocks.  Are species or stocks the target of this objective?  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
29.	Objective 2 - Don't use unhealthy -- use "rebuild depleted" (rather than overfished) and substitute "fisheries" for "species."  [1 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
30.	Objective 2 - Previous historical harvest rates should be included when considering overfished and different impacts of fisheries.  [1 of 16 AGREE and 2 DISAGREE]
<P>
31.	Objective 2 - Objective 2 is an impossible goal within five years.  [11 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
32.	Objective 2 - Natural cycles should be included when considering overfished and different impacts of fisheries.  
<P>
33.	Objective 2 - As long as we continue to allow depletion of stocks, all harvest will be overfishing.  [2 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
34.	Objective 2 - Not explicit what NMFS is managing for in multispecies assemblages.  Does overfished/overfishing apply to the elements of an assemblage (i.e., weak stocks) or the overall assemblage. [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
35.	Objective 2 - Harvest methods in some fisheries, but not all, could be changed to improve stock health.
<P>
36.	Objective 2, 1st paragraph under Strategic Approach - Add a sentence "overfished stocks could be the result of environmental conditions or other non-human induced causes".  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
37.	Objective 2, 1st paragraph under Strategic Approach, last sentence - Need to clarify how NMFS will revise the existing schedules?  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
38.	Objective 3 - Not a clear objective.  It implies you may be dealing with economic value and has internally contradictory intent.  Legal requirements should be part of the objective.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
39.	Objective 3, 2nd paragraph under objective - Need to quantify benefits more precisely, particularly as it relates to different fisheries.  [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
40.	Objective 3,  PM #2 - This needs clarification since most recreational fisheries are overcapitalized.  Is it intended to apply to recreational fisheries or does it mean just commercial fisheries when it says "overcapitalized"?  [4 of 16 AGREE and 3 DISAGREE]
<P>
41.	Objective 3, second paragraph under objective - The issue of level of investment is a matter of personal choice, not something the government should be involved in.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
42.	Objective 3 - There is a conflict between PM #2 and 4.  How can NMFS reduce overcapitalization and encourage recreational fishing?  [8 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
43.	Objective 3 - Need to clarify the intent of this objective.  Is it to manage fish for people who fish, or for society at large.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
44.	Objective 3, PM #4 (and 5th paragraph under Strategic Approaches) - The imposition of a recreational emphasis is improper, as this is an allocative decision.  Is it not the role of the Councils to determine appropriate allocations?  [6 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
45.	Objective 3,  PM #2 - Need higher priority in budget for lease-back or buyback programs.  [2 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
46.	Objective 3, PM #2 - Overcapitalization of fisheries could be due to reduction in sustainable stocks.  NMFS should rebuild the fisheries so industry can rebuild..."don't kill the industry while rebuilding the stocks."  [2 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
47.	Objective 3,  PM #2 - Unclear how NMFS can mitigate impacts.  This measure is vague, fuzzy.  What is the NMFS authority and scope for mitigating impacts of reductions in fisheries.  A more specific approach needed.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
48.	Objective 3,  PM #2 - What is a meaningful, quantifiable reduction?  How can NMFS measure it?  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
49.	Objective 3 - What about international impacts (treaties, etc.).  Although the objective addresses benefits to the nation, it needs to have language that speaks to international.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
50.	Objective 3,  PM #3 - Need to clarify that "to maximum extent practicable" applies to minimizing bycatch and minimizing mortality.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
52.	Objective 3,  PM #2 - Mitigation of impacts should be expanded beyond commercial fisheries to recreational and sport fishing industry.  [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
53.	Objective 3 - The Federal role in mitigation should not be to guarantee compensation for losses.  NMFS should let the free enterprise system operate.  [2 of 16 DISAGREE]
<P>
54.	Objective 3 - There should be governmental mitigation for losses that are not the fault of industry.  [2 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
55.	Objective 3,  PM #5 - The wording needs clarification...change "maintain" to "observe."  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
56.	Objective 3, 1st paragraph under Strategic Approaches, second line - Change to read "...building on existing partnerships with academia and fishing communities."  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
57.	Objective 3, 1st paragraph under objective, last sentence - The relationship of this sentence to the objective is unclear.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
58.	Objective 3, 1st paragraph under the objective, last line - The statement "protect resources for intrinsic value"...social and health benefits" is more appropriately addressed under Goal 2 (i.e., under ESA).  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
59.	Objective 4 - NMFS is putting too much emphasis on aquaculture.  This should not be a separate objective.  [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
60.	Objective 4 - This objective is not a good one.  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
61.	Objective 4,  PM #3 - Cost effectiveness is not NMFS responsibility.  Wording should be changed to "prompt and timely."  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
62.	Objective 4 - Challenge underlying assumption that oceans are overtapped as justification for supporting activity that competes with fishermen.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
63.	Objective 4,  PM #1 - The phrase "increased proportion of total production" is unclear.  What does it refer to?  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
64.	Objective 4 - What is the definition of "environmentally sound."  There are no criteria with which to measure it.  [2 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
65.	Objective 4 - Promotion of aquaculture (fish for market) may be contradictory to maintaining sustainable fisheries.  NMFS should not promote aquaculture if it undercuts fishing communities.  In situations where aquaculture competes with fisheries, NMFS should not be involved in advancing aquaculture.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
66.	Objective 4 - This objective needs clarification on the types of aquaculture.  It should clearly distinguish those that compete with fisheries.  Some types of aquaculture, such as oyster production, are unlikely to compete.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
67.	Objective 4 - NMFS should not support salmon or sturgeon aquaculture at all.   It has destroyed markets and contradicts economic objectives for fisheries.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
68.	Objective 4 - Without sustainable fisheries, aquaculture takes over the fisheries.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
69.	Objective 4,  PM #1 - This is unrealistic in five years as currently phrased.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
70.	Objective 4 - Need to address ecosystem aspects ("pasture") of competition between aquaculture and fisheries.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
71.	Objective 4 - Ensure that aquaculture is not a "silver bullet" to replace doing necessary habitat work.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
72.	Objective 4 - Need to coordinate with other responsible agencies such as Western Regional Aquaculture Consortium to avoid duplication of efforts.  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
73.	Objective 4 - Aquaculture should not access salmonid eggs while salmonid stocks are being rebuilt.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
74.	Objective 4,  PM #2 - This is not measurable (quantifiable) in five years.  [6 of 16 AGREE]

<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - Protected Resources</H4>
<P>
75.	Goals 1 and 2 may conflict--plan does not address resolution of conflict  (e.g., endangered salmon harvest may conflict with other).  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
76.	Need to address management of a species once it is "recovered."  What is measure of recovery?  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
77.	Objective  1, PM #3 - Most of this measure could be assumed under performance measures 1 and 2.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
78.	Objective 1, PM #1 - Will NMFS maintain healthy marine mammal populations where they conflict with declining populations of protected species?  Maintaining some current marine mammal populations (such as California sea lions and seals) may conflict with the recovery of some listed species.  In this context it conflicts with the overall goal and objective.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
79.	Objective 1 - PM #1 is not mutually exclusive of PM #2 and they are in direct conflict.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
80.	Objective 2,  PM #1 - This underestimates the social and economic complexities and is completely unachievable and naive.  The social and economic implications of this measure need to be addressed.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
82.	Overall goal is too narrow.  What is the recovery goal?  Restoration of healthy fisheries should be the goal.  [9 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
84.	Objective 1 - Add a performance measure:  Within five years have protected stocks where they can sustain incidental harvest.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
85.	Objective 1, 2nd paragraph under Strategic Approach - Delete the paragraph (minimize human action etc...") because it is impossible.  NMFS does not have the authority or ability to do this, the approach is flawed.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
86.	Consider forage fish in ocean in objectives 1 and 2, and their role/impacts on predator/prey relationships.  Increased forage fish (better ocean habitat) is needed to keep predators off protected species.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
87.	Objective 1, PM #3 - The term "depleted" does not fit under ESA definition.  (Note: After it was clarified that depleted applies to marine mammals, there was increased concern regarding mixing marine mammals and listed species in the objectives)
<P>
88.	Objective 1,  PM #3 - Prioritize impacts causing the greatest conservation burden.  NMFS should prioritize addressing the worst things first.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
89.	Objective 1, 2nd paragraph under Strategic Approach, last sentence - The application of ESA recovery standards to marine mammals is a greater burden than necessary and is not appropriate.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
128.	Goals 2 and 3 overlap.  Healthy coasts are necessary for the recovery of protected species.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Goal 3 - Healthy Coasts</H4>
<P>
90.	Objective 1 - "No net loss" should be at regional level (trade-offs are regional).  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
91.	Objective 1 - Rewrite to "Protect, create, and restore marine habitat," and delete second objective.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
92.	Objective 2 - There is a built-in conflict between this and Goal 1.  Objective 2 is almost impossible to achieve.  [1 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
93.	Objective 2:  Ecosystem management--although important, lack scientific understanding, no scientific means and not measurable.  [3 of 16 AGREE and 3 DISAGREE]
<P>
94.	Maintaining biodiversity is essential to having fisheries.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
95.	Objective 1, PM #1 and PM #2 - Clarify if this applies to marine/freshwater environments, human activities, species.  What does this measure address?  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
96.	Science and technology for influencing marine habitat is far more complex than described.  There needs to be delineation between marine and freshwater habitats.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
97.	NMFS should undertake a gravel-to-gravel approach in salmon recovery.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
98.	The current application of ESA forces single species action rather than multispecies regimes.   The ESA implementation should be directed at multispecies approach.  [11 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
99.	Objective 1 - PM #1 and PM #2 are in conflict with each other.  Doesn't work to do both.  [7 of 16 AGREE and 2 DISAGREE]
<P>
100.	Objective 2, 1st paragraph under Strategic approaches, last sentence - Define "low impact ecosystem safe fishing technologies."  NMFS should not be involved in gear allocation and bans on type of gear.  [4 of 16 AGREE and 5 DISAGREE]
<P>
101.	It is appropriate for NMFS to be involved in low-impact ecosystem safe fishing technologies, research and investigation.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
102.	Objective 2, 1st paragraph under Strategic approaches, last sentence - Add "research" and remove "implementation".  [9 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
103.	Objective 2, 1st paragraph under Strategic approaches - Do not believe that NMFS has a full scientific understanding of ecosystem in order to manage it.  [3 of 16 AGREE and 4 DISAGREE]
<P>
104.	NMFS should be able to tell the industry what the better methods are for gear, etc., to save species given its authority.

<HR>
<H4>Foundations for Sterwardship</H4>
<P>
106.	Objectives 1, 2, & 4 are generally good with two additions:  For discussions of research and science emphasize the need to work with the industry and other constituents in developing science and in developing the overarching national vision.  Do not ignore the differences among regions.  [7 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
107.	Take offense to increased compliance--implies there are offenders that need to be prosecuted.  Should say "ensure compliance" rather than "increase." [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
108.	Objective 1:  How much science is enough?  Studying issues to death.  [1 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]
<P>
109.	Agree with Objective 1, need to make better management decisions.  Don't assume fish will do okay.  Require regional management decision process.  Need to have agreement on what is best for fish.  [2 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
110.	The emphasis of NMFS fisheries science expertise and focus seems to be mainly on the marine environment and the animal itself, and there is inadequate focus and science on freshwater habitat (necessary for anadromous fish).  [4 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
111.	Objective 2 - Add a performance measure, "Improve external communication by improving time response and usefulness of General Counsel input".  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
112.	Objective 1, PM #7 - Reflect management needs of Regional Councils in monitoring data collection of biological, social, and economic data.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
113.	Objectives 2 and 4 do not belong in Plan.  These are administrative details which cloud this document.  [4 of 16 AGREE and 5 DISAGREE]
<P>
114.	Clarify utilization of high quality science in face of need to address social, political, and economic issues.  It appears inconsistent with high quality biological science.  [2 of 16 AGREE and 3 DISAGREE]
<P>
115.	Objective 3, PM #6 - Enforceability is important but it should not be the driving force in developing regulations. [1 of 16 AGREE and 2 DISAGREE]
<P>
116.	Engagement of constituency plan is appropriate here--and consistent with Magnuson Act.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
117.	NMFS is understaffed to deal with fundamental habitat issues required within the context of the ESA.  More resources need to be applied to freshwater issues. [6 of 16 AGREE and 2 DISAGREE]
<P>
118.	Objective 4, PM #1 - There is a need for greater delegation to regions/field offices from HDQs.  Increase coordination/communication among HDQS and the field.  [9 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
119.	There are more important places for NMFS resources than public affairs and open houses.  [5 of 16 AGREE and 1 DISAGREE]

<HR>
<H4>Other Comments</H4>
<P>
51.	The Plan must reflect the essential role of co-managers in achieving sustainable fisheries.  If NMFS is going to achieve the goal of sustainable fisheries, it has to recognize the whole fishery management machinery's role. [9 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
81.	Performance measures are not achievable in measurable way in five years.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
83.	Does this Plan express what agency should/ought to do or is it in response to other Federal laws?  Does it reflect legal mandates or agency views on stewardship.  [5 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
105.	The Plan uses phrases which are not definable nor measurable (e.g., ecologically sound, low impact) and they need to be defined.  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
120.	How does the agency reconcile conflicts between or among goals and objectives?  [6 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
121.	There is value in setting timeframes, but are they indeed achievable.  Critically evaluate how achievable the goals are in five years.  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
122.	Want to see system of prioritization within the Plan amongst the goals and objectives (would liked to have seen before being asked for comment).  [10 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
123.	Regions may have different priorities than those set nationally.  Plan should reflect this in prioritization process.  [8 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
124.	The Plan should also focus on applying biological information through regulation and through voluntary actions, cooperation, etc.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
125.	Document is a wonderful start and this is a good process.  [3 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
126.	There should be an absolute water right for fish.  [1 of 16 AGREE]
<P>
127.	If the fish could speak and make political contributions, we would have no problems.

<HR>
<center>Comments Received from Participants:</center>
<H4>Mission/vision</H4>
<P>
1.  Mission starts with resources--vision leaps to the American people--missing is comment about fishermen in between. [Neither the mission nor the vision recognizes the role of fishermen in converting the resources into benefits.  This assumes that most Americans consider seafood the primary benefit of living marine resources.]
<P>
2.  "Benefit"--vague term--aesthetic, ethereal--needs to be fleshed out.
<P>
3.  Mission--consumptive uses--ignores existence value of fisheries--resource is consumption oriented [By using the term resource, the mission implicitly favors consumptive uses over non-consumptive uses, especially the value of knowing that the resource exists.]
<P>
4.  "Their" unnessary--crisper [The removal of the word their from the mission statement would make it crisper.]
<P>
5.  No mention of restoration
<P>
6. Terminology--stewardship, conservation implies natural; economic/industry piece needs to be in there [Opposite of #3: use of the terms stewardship and conservation in the mission implicitly favors an environmental rather than an economic agenda.]
<P>
7.  Work together well--people need commercial/recreational folks [This person assumed that the word "people"in the mission statement referred to the user groups.]
<P>
8.  What does marine mean--begin and end [To which areas does the term marine refer, and what are their boundaries?]
<P>
9.  Stewardship needs to be better defined
<P>
10. Cooperation instead of just communication
<P>
11.  Benefits useful word--emphasizes resources
<P>
12.  What is a subsistence fishery?
<P>
13.  Ability of American people to enjoy the fishery---access to fishery--recognition of benefit to public as food source (main) [For most Americans, the main benefit to be derived from living marine resources is seafood.]
<P>
14.  Diverse-good...include in mission statement, too [The term diverse in the mission statement, in reference to living marine resources, should also be in the mission.]
<P>
15.  Aquaculture..public or does it include private?
<P>
16.  Self-sustaining...substitute sustainable since most species are not self-sustaining  [refers to vision]
<P>
17.  Pretty blurred...don't know benefits of self-sustaining  [refers to visioin]
<HR>
<H4>Goal #1 - Sustainable Fisheries</H4> 
<P>
18.  Missing--participation. Needs something about process of involvement of states, etc.
<P>
19.  Long term average catch  vs  yield--too limiting to see things just in terms of catch
<P>
20.  "Working with industry" as part of environmentally sound aquaculture  [Add this phrase to the end of the title of the aquaculture objective.]
<P>
21.  Concerned with using advance  vs  ensure [Reference to title of aquaculture objective]
<P>
22.  I agree with "advance" instead of ensure
<P>
23.  Uncertain how aquaculture is included in the definition of fisheries [Does aquaculture constitute a fishery to be regulated by NMFS just because it involves salt water and fish?]
<P>
24.  Interdisciplinary linkages are not clear in the document
<P>
25.  Aquaculture-add economically sustainable 
<P>
26.  Adopt risk-averse management policy
<P>
27.  Risk-averse measures, pre-cautionary approach not mentioned anywhere
<P>
28.  "Commercial, recreation and subsistence" (in objective 1-2) offensive--implies all fisheries belong to one of these
<P>
29.  Sustainable fisheries--recognition that fish are food for birds and mammals [The sustainable fisheries section should acknowledge non-human needs for fish as food.]
<P>
30. Bycatch law--minimizing first new Magnuson law--then mortality needs this in the plan [The new Magnuson-Stevens Act stipulates that the first priority is to reduce bycatch and the second priority is to reduce the mortality of bycatch--the plan needs to reflect this language.]
<P>
31.  NMFS has no business in the aquaculture business
<P>
32.  Clarify -- "subsistence species"
<P>
33.  New standard--safety of life at sea promoted--not reflected here [The plan needs to reflect the provisions of the new Magnuson-Stevens Act regarding the promotion of safety of life at sea.]
<P>
34. NMFS--no federal agency has responsibility to assure living.  Just provide environmentally sound management [Promotion of the commercial success of aquaculture is outside the purview of NMFS; NMFS should focus on the environmental effects of aquaculture.]
 <P>
35. Detrimental effects of aquaculture on the genetic integrity on stocks--should be included
<P>
36. Reference #31..depends physically where aquaculture is located
<P>
37. Increase economics--insert long term somewhere [The section on increasing economic benefits should explicitly recognize that long-term benefits are favored over short-term.]
<P>
38. Reference #31.. disagree--coastal aquaculture has impact on habitat...definitely nmfs business
<P>
39. Aquaculture--part of nmfs business--address issues on environmental soundness and impacts on stocks--important to look at economic impacts-- connected to growth potential
<P>
40. Re: "stocks"(1st objective)-- clarify marine vs. fresh, stocks of state responsibility vs. federal...unclear whether NMFS plan for NMFS or for nation (beyond NMFS)? [Is this an organizational plan for NMFS alone, or is it a plan for the United States for the management of its fisheries?]
<P>
41. If national plan--need to qualify stocks [The plan should contain a list of the stocks to which it pertains.]
<P>
42. Concerned about advancing aquaculture in areas with already  marketable fish. (Surplus of salmon in Alaska, etc.)
<P>
43. Clarification of what you plan to do on overcapitalization on new law [In light of the new moratorium on ITQs, how does NMFS plan to achieve the performance measure on reducing overcapitalization?]
<P>
44. Interdepencies, impacts, etc. also applies to ecosystem not just species by species....should be in sustainable fish section
<P>
45. Concern with increase economic/social--living marine resources--should rather be maintain [The objective regarding economic and social benefits should be to maintain them rather than increase them, because increasing them could lead to already overtaxed resources being further stressed.  We have reached the outer limits of such benefits.]
<P>
46. State fish and game people not here
<P>
47. Some vision of cooperation among federal agencies with responsibility (e.g. fws, epa, etc.) [Plan needs this vision, which it now lacks.]
<P>
48. Fish don't know boundaries between state and federal waters; NMFS must coordinate with states
<P>
49. State/federal thing--reality that NMFS has to live within bounds of authorities
<P>
50. If use "sustainable"-must face challenge of jurisdictions and need to work together
<P>
51. Encourage international and state cooperation--add another bullet
<P>
52. Reference #51...stress "partnership with
<P>
53. Overfishing--make language consistent with magnuson act language on overfishing
<P>
54.  Replace "stocks" with population
<P>
55.  Opening up data collection to more fisherman--should be reflected in the plan [NMFS should use fishing boats for data collection.]
<P>
56.  Reference aquaculture..."reduce degradation"..I dont like this phase..replace with "ensure integrity of environment and minimize adverse impacts from other species". [The plan focuses too much on the negative aspects/impacts of aquaculture.]
<P>
57.  Agree with catch vs. yield
<P>
58. Broader public involvement.  Education...building political will for these [NMFS needs to build support among user groups and the public for its regulations and management measures.]
<P>
59.  Be responsive to public involvement
<P>
60.  Page 13..objectives...promoting efficiency....now new law  says consider efficiency..
<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - Protected Resources</H4>
<P>
61.  Recover/maintain protect populations...question the first performance measure
<P>
62.   Providing mechanism for evaluating endangered species in aquaculture (short-nose sturgeon). Being able to use protected species for aquaculture [NMFS should allow aquaculturists to raise endangered species for commercial sale.]
<P>
63.  Reduce conflicts--MMPA--why not just say it in the performance measure? [If the objective regarding reducing conflicts refers to MMPA, then its title should refer to the MMPA.]
<P>
64.  Item #2..performance measures--use "and" not  "or; ultimately trying to recover the species  [The performance measure which calls for NMFS to slow or reverse the decline of protected species should demand that NMFS slow and reverse the decline, since reversing the decline is the ultimate goal.]
<P>
65. 1st bullet--add "at levels appropriate to the conditions of relative ecosystems" [This is in reference to the performance measure "maintain health of currently healthy marine mammal populations."]
<P>
66.  Recover and maintain species population....no mention of  habitat..protecting ecosystem will help protect species [The objectives under the Recovered Protected Species goal should make explicit reference to habitat protection and the decisive role it plays in protecting and rebuilding species.]
<P>
67.  Reduce human impacts on major population-- emphasize government activity--falls into this category (e.g. DoD)
<P>
68.  "Reduce takes"....sea turtles..strandings are takes that are not human-induced.....example---rancho nuevo habitat---(add) practical means of reducing human takes
<P>
69. Take into account indigenous knowledge to prevent the decline of protected species
<P>
70.  Clearly  define"take"--may be impact of declining food source from fishing for a protected species. (Pollock--primary food source for stellar sea lions) [The diminution of a protected species food source due to fishing should be defined as a take.]
<P>
71.  Should be some responsibility for consideration of sea birds for protection of species
<P>
72. How deal with complex interactions between protected species with each other [What will NMFS do to address the problem of a protected species being preyed on by another?]
<P>
73.  No specific reference to pollution-related problems; would like to see it
<P>
74.  Re: pollution...."human caused threats" [Pollution should be recognized as a human-caused threat for the purposes of the plan.]
<P>
75.  Performance measure #2--strike words slow or ["Slow or reverse the decline" should be changed to "reverse the decline."]
<P>
76.  Re: #75..how can reverse decline for all species in 5 years
<P>
77.  If don't adopt #75--reverse decline as primary objective is desirable [The plan should explicitly recognize that reversing rather than slowing the decline of protected species is the ultimate goal.]
<P>
78.  Special obligations with respect to Native Americans who depend on species for food...special recognition of subsistence needs for nutrition [The plan should recognize the special treaty obligations of the United States to Native Americans regarding fishery resources.]
<P>
79.  Slowing or reversing--stop or reverse is clearer [NMFS should pledge to stop or reverse the decline of protected species rather than just to slow or reverse.
<P>
80.  "Conflicts"-broad...include language that references role of federal agencies
<P>
81.  Performance measure #2--explain a way this can be done [Reference is to reducing negative impacts of marine mammals on protected species and human activities.]
<P>
82.  Performance measure #1....which species are currently healthy? [This person questioned whether any marine mammal populations are currently healthy.]
<P>
83.  Recovering ...performance measures--none to address recovering species [The plan should have a performance measure to address recovering species; currently performance measures only address healthy and declining species.]
<HR>
<H4>Goal #3 Habitat</H4>
<P>
84.  Need for partnership....NMFS..unique..you represent marine environment constituents....here partnerships would be with folks who want to do bad things..dont recommend partnerships
<P>
85.  Healthy coasts--limiting--what about international--healthy habitats better [The goal title "Healthy Coasts" is too limiting: what about open ocean or riverine areas?  "Healthy Habitats" would be a better title.]
<P>
86. No net loss concept...rise in defense...good concept..ignored by some jurisdictions...(corps of engineers) maintain this concept. 
<P>
87.  No net loss--national aspect--establish priorities of what habitats need--high priority vs low [Forget no net loss; instead, determine which habitats are important for key fisheries and species, and focus on them.]
<P>
88. Add objective...restoration goals, values for those goals, how we evaluate..performance measure...NMFS needs to step up to plate on. [Plan should have separate goals for restoration and protection of habitat, and the restoration goal should have specific, measurable performance measures.]
<P>
89.  Objectives...gobblety gook award--why? Whats difference between the 2 objectives?? [The habitat objectives are poorly defined, intentionally use vague, unmeasurable terms, and the difference between the two objectives is unclear.]
<P>
90.  Strike unavoidable...instead offset human caused loss
<P>
91.  Question ability to create habitat in setting a performance measure--protecting habitat with no loss on a national level
<P>
92.  Performance measures--sound too lofty...no net loss--goal.. moved up.  Then set clear measures for 5 year timeframe [The goal of no net loss should appear only in the objectives; the performance measures should contain specific, measurable goals for protection and restoration rather than generalized principles.]
<P>
93.  No net loss--either eliminate it, define it or say what we are driving for? What does it (national) do for regional or local levels? [Since there are no units of habitat, the no net loss goal is inherently unachievable because it is unmeasurable; either get rid of it, or define a unit so you will know whether it has been achieved.  And in any case, no net loss on a national level is fairly meaningless because it will still allow the destruction of wetlands in a particular area or of the habitat of a particular species.]
<P>
94. Emphasis in objective #1...at regional level...national level-broader public interest [The goal of no net loss should be at a regional rather than a national level.]
<P>
95.  Applaud ecosystem-based regime--are fisheries resources going to be looked at relative to biodiversity and habitat? [This person approves of ecosystem management and wants to know whether biodiversity and habitat concerns will really drive fisheries management.]
<P>
96.  Re: creation of habitats--need to evaluate cumulative effect of creating habitat and interaction with resources on LMRs [Is created habitat really a substitute for the real thing?  Will it preserve the interactions among species in their natural habitat or will it cause changes?]
<P>
97.  Agree with definition of gobblety gook--(sport fishing folks)
<P>
98. Create habitat...nmfs should not be involved in creating habitat....no redefinition of wetlands....disagree with nmfs being involved in creating habitat
<P>
99. No redefinition of wetlands (no net loss) [Dont achieve no net loss through redefinition rather than protection of habitat.]
<P>
100.  Recognize other unavoidable causes beyond human (text page 19)
<P>
101. 2nd objective...don't see how performance measures even address the objectives
<P>
102.  Establish new performance measure...increase percentage of nmfs assets allocated to habitat protection
<P>
103.  Performance standard to track and publish the status to maintain/restore/enhance marine habitat
<P>
104.  Clarify protecting habitat in mandatory sense of Magnuson Act (not in old advisory sense) [The plan should make it clear that NMFS now has a legal mandate in the habitat area beyond the old advisory role.]
<P>
105. Commitment to working with states and others
<P>
106.  Reference to essential habitat...define     
<P>
107.  Maybe the whole thing can be rewritten! We are in charge message of stewardship--make simpler, clearer [Rewrite the entire habitat section to make it more forceful, less vague, and more measurable.]
<P>
108.  Start with in cooperation with others
<P>
109.  NMFS responsibility for habitat extends beyond essential habitat--should we be restricted to that definition?
<P>
110.  Where is NMFS going to get the resources and authority to do  #109...(going beyond limited interpretation)
<P>
111.  Statistics from Our Living Oceans--are different in different parts of the plan

<H4>Goal #4 - Foundations for Stewardship</H4> 
<P>
112.  1st objective...(science) is essential-but may not have answers for decades...but some mention of pre-cautionary measures needed [More and better scientific data is a good goal, but in the meantime we need risk-averse management, and the plan should recognize this explicitly.]
<P>
113.  Quality of science--look at proper peer review of the science
<P>
114.  In stewardship role--move to recommitment to biological and natural sciences.  Move away from economic and social engineering.  (Focus on base biological science) 
<P>
115.  Improve the science of decision-making (input of decision making process)
<P>
116.  Compliance and regulatory effectiveness...nmfs--take lead in harmonizing reg's (often conflicting among states, international, other agencies)
<P>
117.  Lets not forget to coordinate research within commerce and other institutions. (Leverage other funding agencies funds)
<P>
118.  For comments. Scientific basis re: permitting, etc..more consistency in review between hq, regions, etc. [NMFS needs to speak with one voice; often the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, or each hand is actively working against the other.]
<P>
119. Good science--need recognition of competing/conflicting versions of good science 
<P>
120.  For good/effective management, you need up-to-date reporting system for effective enforcement
<P>
121. Within scientific context--increasing predictability....increase our understanding and ability to predict.
<P>
122.  Conflicting opinions about what results means..not really conflicting science [Response to 119: problem is not different definitions of good science but different interpretations of the same data.]
<P>
123.  Reference to constituents...incorporate in plan/policy.  This is a public resource and every person is a constituent---not just  those who use the resources [American public rather than user groups should be the focus of the plan.]
<P>
124.  Important to include stakeholders in process (public opening) before reg's are finalized
<P>
125.  Increase effectiveness of communication--via videos, tapes, education--other aspect involves inviting participation. Should encourage communication [NMFS not only needs better outreach, but it needs to involved constituents more in actual management through various types of participation.  Communication needs to be two-way.]
<P>
126.  Involve the public in decision making process closer relations with public
<P>
127.  If serious about aquaculture needs to be a statement about commitment of resources
<P>
128.  Regulatory effectiveness...nothing here about nmfs enforcing its regulations...nmfs needs to improve its enforcement performance (some things known and unenforced)
<P>
129.  Advocacy incorporated in communication--focus on advocacy for resource vs advocacy for agency
<P>
130.  Enforcement important (rumor)...2 fish bag limit in gulf..but nothing will be done for up to 5 over
<P>
131.  Fairness and equity needed in enforcement and compliance by the agency and management actions...apply the rules the same across the industry
<P>
132. Things applied to fisheries apply to Department itself. (Aquaculture..things done for restoration, etc. applied the same) [NMFS needs to practice as it preaches.]
<P>
133.  Making regulations more comprehensible for everybody..this is an important thing to do
<P>
134. Nmfs program--faxed networks--timely--very valuable to folks..someone always available. Extend to e-mail
<P>
135.  Does this section apply to trade data, also?? better  delineate aquaculture products within the available data
<P>
136.  Reference #137...already covered by lacey act
<P>
137.  Page 26...compliance broaden--should read--curtail violation including illegal sale or shipment of seafood in commerce
<HR>
<H4>Other Comments</H4>
<P>
138.  In last section of infrastructure..getting field people to play attention to central themes...keep your RD's from adopting their own agendas....we need feedback mechanism for when games are played and RD's/field doing what they have been told not to
<P>
139.  Needs to be recognition that at regional/local levels is where some of the best ideas are developed.  Should encourage initiative in regional/local staff in right way
<P>
140.  Local initiatives need to be in line with national policies
<P>
141. Need attention to interjurisdicial boundaries between federal/state beyond what you have provided for (e.g. lobster) need for coordination between federal/state
<P>
142.  Role in aquaculture for everybody...meetings with Commerce...also at Dept. of Agriculture..define fisheries and aquaculture in way that they work together....roles are clear
<P>
143.  Reference #141--recognize that states/federal have areas of jurisdiction and they need to be emphasized for having their own area [NMFS should focus on its purview, the EEZ.]
<P>
144.  Working with NGOs. States...(add) promote cooperation among other federal agencies.
<P>
145.  Some of the goals are jumping back and forth between 5 year goal too grandiose....revise to be very specific and achievable in 5 years
<P>
146. If NMFS recognizes satisfaction from resources that are not directly accessible (fishing etc)...should place priority on user groups...(actively involved) this is agencys focus
<P>
147.  Strongly disagree with #146...these are public resources--they deserve a balanced consideration with users.  Put a greater balance of voices on fishery management councils.
<P>
148.  Participation in policy development should mean something and not trumped by interaction between senior executives and isolated interaction with constituent
<P>
149.  Process--would like more operational elements (how you will get there) would be more meaningful. Make part of this document.
<P>
150.  Vision.....does this include "American people should have satisfaction which is derived from having diverse... [Value of knowing that resources exist.]
<P>
151.  Close collaboration with coastal program on non-pt. pollution, wetlands,etc.--needs to be included (expertise/advocacy) needs closer work.  Need muscle/advocacy for stewardship.
<P>
152.  Right approach....re: aquaculture...NMFS--stewardship role (but this conflicts with promotional role..page 15) tone sounds like aquaculture is bad, but sometimes useful in stewardship...NMFS focus environment sound, but not deciding which species to support, etc.
<P>
153.  Coordination with states, reg councils, local governments..is key

<H4>Goal 1 - SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES</H4>
<H5>Objective 1 - Maintain Currently Healthy Stocks</H5>
<P>
1.  How do we arrive at decision on what is a healthy or non-healthy population?  It seems arbitrary - all watersheds are different.  Need clarification on the process. Red=0 Green= 20	
<P>
2.  Big knowledge gap.  How do we know what is healthy? Before stock declines we need to have clear indication of the problem. R=0 G=11	 
<P>
3.  There needs to be more fishermen's input into stock assessment.  And they should have credibility because they are fishermen. R=0 G=21	
<P>
4.  What about other species that are not commercial, recreational, or subsistence species? R=1 G=20	
<P>
5.  Who are these healthy stocks conserved for in order to maximize economic, social, and cultural values? R=0 G=21

 <P>
9. "Sustainable"- is this minimal or optimal? R=0 G=2	
<P>
10. Against any "rush" into international management in pelagics.  Difficult to assess in international areas.  Need to stress good science and data in those areas. R=0 G=20

<P>
15. Regional Plan 1A - Need Clarification on international agreements - scope - existing agreements or new agreements? agreements? R=0 G=9	
<P>
16.  Fail to see how you can have wise biological use when the State Department is involved in decision making. R=2 G=13	
<P>
17. "Maintain currently healthy stocks" should include all healthy stocks -  pelagics, groundfish, salmon in regional plan. R=0 G=22	
<P>
18.  Add invertebrates (crabs, sea cucumber, shrimp to item #17). R=0 G=9	
<P>
19.  At regional level, who is going to define stock health, and on what basis? Don't react to stock decline, but be proactive. R=0 G=17

<P>
24.  Change "Eliminate over fishing" to something else. R=0 G=13	
<P>
25.  Overfishing definition should be based on habitat capacity, and not an arbitrary numbers - i.e. for salmon, habitat is the problem. R=0 G=21	
<P>
26.  Statement should include "rebuild overfished stock" [consistent with overhead transparency] R=0 G= 9	
<P>
27 National goal National objective - change language to "rebuild depleted stocks" instead of "Eliminate factors contributing to stock depletion and rebuild depleted stocks." R=0 G=23	
<P>
28.  Aware of mixed stock harvests we need to address depletion of minor components to insure they are not overfished. R=1 G=16	
<P>
29.  We do not want to manage mixed stocks by weak stock management.  Don't want to close Eureka area Salmon fisheries due to weak stock management.  Manage on mixed stock basis. R=4 G=5	
<P>
30.  Promote selective harvest capabilities to avoid weak-link management. R=4 G=9	

<HR>
<H5>Objective 3 - Increase Economic, Social, and Health benefits</H5>
<P>
31.  National objective should specifically state use LMR for human food. R=1 G=15

<P>
36. Involve fishing community in development of ITQs, and devote significant staff resources to that issue. R=0 G=16	
<P>
37. [Strong comment "If you put mitigation do you mean mitigation, or take it off the list"]  Need real mitigation for impacts to communities, or else strike it from the National objective. R=1 G= 17
<P>
38.  Add "recreational" to the National objective. R=1 G=13	
<P>
39.  ITQ's  - p6 The issue is property right transfer - replace ITQ with PRT. R=1 G=11

<P>
85.  Add bullet - Prohibit new salmon commercial aquaculture where it conflicts with wild stocks. R=0 G=12	
<P>
86.  Aquaculture permits should include provisions for taxing profits for direct restoration of habitats that support the related natural communities being farmed. R=1 G=12	
<P>
87.  Allow only environmentally sound aquaculture in national objective. R=1 G=5	
<P>
88.  Support aquatic management of salmonids that does not reduce effect population size of wild and hatchery populations. R=0 G=12	
<P>
89.  Aquaculture should not displace current fisheries or substitute for habitat restoration.  R=0 G=11	
<P>
90. Separate aquaculture from mariculture. R=1 G=6	
<P>
91.  Prohibit the import of aquaculture products where use of unsustainable or env. damaging practices i.e., salmon, shrimp, this would be consistent with other laws preventing foreign imports. R=1 G=12
<P>
92.  Aquaculture should not be high on NMFS priority list - until problems are addressed (i.e., deceases, habitat, etc. [should be the last on the list or do not do it at all]) environmentally sound aquaculture is an oxymoron. R=1 G=8	
<P>
93.  Who governs inland aquaculture such as Ohioan Coho? R=0 G=5	
<P>
94.  Need More controls over what aquaculture ventures are allowed to do. R=0 G=13

<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - PROTECTED RESOURCES </H4>
<H5>Objective 5 - Recover and Maintain Protected Species Populations</H5> 
  <P>
44. Expand 2nd bullet  5A "Implement habitat restoration and other actions" R=0 G=12	
<P>
45.  Actions to recover listed species shouldn't be done to detriment of unlisted stocks. R=1 G=16
<P>
46.  Native American Fishing rights should be addressed more thoroughly in attempting to decrease known human caused threats to listed species. R=2 G=6	
<P>
47.  Concerned about rules and regulations that would result in "taking" of private property need local involvement before implementation. community involvement before implementation. R=11 G=4	
<P>
48.  Should be defined effort in review of management plans for recovery that encourages public/private/nonprofit cooperation. R=0 G=15	
<P>
49.  Definition of and quantification of "recover and maintain" is needed. NMFS needs to make sure implementation of state salmon plan happens. Plenty of plans and regulations - need implementation/enforcement. enforcement. R=1 G=24	
<P>
50.  Performance measure, 2nd bullet, National Objective -  delete "slow or" R=1 G=18	
<P>
51.  Add bullet - (5A) "Implement recovery plan of natural populations of salmonids, other anadromous fish (such a striped bass), and marine mammals, with an ecosystem approach so that one species doesn't suffer at the expense of another. R=1 G=17	
<P>
52.  3rd bullet PM National Objective,  Be creative in devising ways of decreasing threats.  Need to acknowledge environmental variability affecting fluctuations in abundance. R=8 G=3	
<P>
53.  5Aa, Bullet 1, pg8 -  500 winter run is limited number - we were at 2,000 spawners at time of listing - this goal is too low, will set a low ceiling. In other words 500 should be a floor not ceiling. a ceiling. R=1 G=22	
<P>
54.  PM Bullet #1 add definition of what a healthy population of marine mammals is and harvest the excess when appropriate. marine mammals when appropriate. R=2 G=15	
<P>
55.  Central Valley salmon - never was mitigation for spring run, winter run when Shasta was build.  Need extensive mitigation that was originally required but not done.  Need hatchery and habitat actions. R=2 G=20	
<P>
56.  5A 2nd bullet - modify item #44 performance measure -  "Implement restoration and protection actions to restore..... Central Valley to levels comparable...." R=1 G=19	
<P>
57.  Bullet 2 p8 inconsistent with national performance measure -  goal of decreasing threat below 96 impact levels is insufficient - should go further.  Would rather say, "return to 1967 - 1991 levels. R=1 G=10	
<P>
58.  Add to #49 - NMFS should insure Central Valley Improvement Act implementation. R=1 G=16	
<P>
59.  Place sardines within the Protected Resources recover group. R=0 G=14	
<P>
60.  Any implementation of recovery actions should not transfer cost from federal to local level. R=8 G=5

66.  5A add another bullet - "To support action to restore flow to San Joquin mainstream, San Joquin below Friant Dam for purpose of supporting viable San Joquin fall run chinook" R=0 G=20	

<HR>
<H5>Objective 6 - Reduce Conflicts That Involve Protected Species</H5>
<P>
67.  6C, p12, - All the bullets are good, but add another - Protect/Indemnify NMFS from threat of environmental lawsuit while working towards achieving these goals. R=10 G=13	
<P>
68.  Add bullet under 6C.  In order to reduce conflicts NMFS should facilitate research and discussion towards amending  MMPA to consider the harvest of pinnipeds that are at or exceed opt. populations. optimum population. R=1 G=16	
<P>
69.  Make it illegal to feed or attract pinnipeds. R=0 G=9	
<P>
70.  If pinnipeds reach optimum popular recovery may have gone to far.  Change #68 optimum to sustainable. R=1 G=15	

<HR>
<H4>Goal 3 -  HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS</H4>
<H5>Objective 7 - Protect, Restore and Create Essential LMR Habitat to Realize No Net Loss</H5>
<P>
71.  Where/When is baseline for "no net loss"? (PM2) R=0 G=17	
<P>
72.  2000 acre goal is too small!  Clarify 2000 acres of what?  Need more inland restoration. R=0 G=21

<HR>
	COMMENTS

<H4>Mission</H4>

1.	GOOD MISSION.
	Full agreement
<P>
2.	DOES NOAA HAVE THE POWER TO ADDRESS MANAGEMENT ISSUES AT THE STATE LEVEL, E.G., FLUKE REGULATIONS?
	All agreed that this was an important comment and were interested to know how much influence NOAA really has over the states in this regard (Page 5, paragraph 2).
	<P>
3.	DO WE HAVE APPROPRIATE STEWARDSHIP OVER LOCAL/REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT AFFECT HABITAT?
	Can we really do anything about the things that we know affect the habitat.
	Noted was concern over logging impacts on and anadromous species as well as effects of industrialization on other resources.
 <P>
4.	(Page 5, last paragraph.)  DOES NOAAs AUTHORITY EXTEND TO LAND BASE POLLUTION THREATS TO HABITAT AND WATER QUALITY?

	<HR>
<H4>Vision</H4>
<P>
5.	BULLETS ON PAGE 6 ARE WELL-DELINEATED.
<P>	
6.	PLAN IS ONLY AS EFFECTIVE AS THE AGENCYS AUTHORITY REACHES THE LAND-BASED POLLUTERS, ETC.  
	If it can not reach the industries (polluters) than the plan is only as good as this meeting. If we cannot deal with land based industries the mission and vision may not be effective.
<P>
7.	CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH GROUP OF AMERICAN PEOPLE (RECREATIONAL OR COMMERCIAL) WILL ENJOY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS.
	Economical benefits trade off between recreational/commercial interests.
<P>	
8.	MANY AMERICANS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A STAKE IN LIVING MARINE RESOURCES.
	And would like greater involvement regarding living resources and their use (those not involved in marine industries per se).
	More people must be aware that limiting fishing will guarantee that they will be able to continue to eat fish.
<P>
9a.	MISSION SHOULD INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT.  CURRENTLY, THERE IS NOT GOOD DIALOGUE BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS.  AVERAGE AMERICAN NEEDS TO KNOW MORE TO CAST HIS/HER VOTE ON ISSUES.
	Average American has a right to this information.
	Educating mid-west, for example, is important.  Although they also have a right to marine resources, their reaction may be negative due to lack of information.  Dialogue between and with commercial, recreational environmental, and regulatory aspects should be encouraged.
<P>
9b.	Presidential directive to develop a National Marine Recreational Fisheries Plan is under development by NMFS.
<P>
10.	DO NOT AGREE WITH DEFINITION OF AQUACULTURE.  SHOULD INCLUDE ENHANCEMENT.
	Example, releasing to wild.
<P>
11.	AQUACULTURE OBJECTIVE SHOULD NOT BE UNDER THE BSF GOAL--SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN GOAL.   
	Management etc. regimes not appropriate under BSF.
<P>
12.	KEEP AQUACULTURE OBJECTIVE IN SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES.
<P>
13.	(Page 15, bottom paragraph)  THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO CREATE STATUTES LEADING TO EXCLUSIVE USE WITHIN THE EEZ RE:  SIMPLIFIED PERMITTING AND REGULATORY PROCEDURES.
<P>
14.	TENOR OF ENTIRE SECTION IS NOT APPROPRIATE.  OVERPLAYS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND WHICH IMPLIES THAT PRESENT IS UNSOUND. 
	All agreed that we are hard pressed to find damaging aquaculture in the U.S.  Everything is environmentally sound.
<P>
15.	AQUACULTURE SHOULD BE REFERRED TO AS MARICULTURE.
	Creates regulatory ambiguity.   
<P>
16.	NEED OBJECTIVE FOR NOAA TO WORK WITH OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES TO PROMOTE AQUACULTURE.
	Now there are territorial arguments and the question as to who leads. 
	There is no cooperation.
<P>
17.	WORK WITH FED AND STATE AGENCIES.  RE #16.
<P>
18.	MAKE U.S. AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON INTERNATIONALLY IN MARICULTURE.  
	NOAA is not going to do it alone and should utilize expertise available in private industry.  
<P>
19.	NMFS SHOULD WORK WITH NATIONAL AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
	Full agreement among participants.
<P>
20.	(P15, #3) ON WHOSE BEHALF IS COST EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY?
<P>	
21.	NOAA SHOULD DESIGNATE NATIONAL AND/OR REGIONAL INDIVIDUAL(S) TO AQUACULTURE COORDINATION.
<P>
22.	AQUACULTURE SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A WAY TO MITIGATE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP RE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES. 
	Fishing regulations create economic hardship for commercial fishermen.  Commercial fishers should be first in line for aquaculture permits.
<P>
23.	PERFORMANCE MEASURES CANT BE MEASURED.
	All three are ridiculous.
<P>
24.	PERFORMANCE MEASURES PROMOTE MORE REGULATION FAVORING BIG BUSINESS--WOULD BE BETTER IN REVERSE. 
	Should be promoting small business.
	Need to structure so that small business can get involved.  
	The way it is stated, only big business can get involved. 
<P>
25.	(Performance Measure #2)  EMPHASIZE POSITIVE ACTIONS TO ADVANCE THE OBJECTIVE (RATHER THAN NEGATIVE).
	Performance measure should be stated positively rather than implying the negative.
<P>
26.	(Re #25) NOAA SHOULD DETERMINE IF MARICULTURE IMPLEMENTATION HAS DOWN SIDES ENVIRONMENTALLY AND WORK WITH INDUSTRY (LARGE AND SMALL) TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGIES TO AVOID THEM.
	As there is a great deal of suspicion that mariculture is affecting habitat, NOAA should do what it can to find out if American mariculture is affecting habitat quality.  NOAA should work with industry large and small, e.g. area recovery, to develop processes which avoid negative aspects.
<P>
27.	RE #22 THERE  SHOULD BE A SOCIAL/ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY ON MARICULTURE AND MARICULTURE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF IN THE YEAR 2000.
	Minerals Management Service (MMS) will open development rights on the OCS by year 2000.
<P>
28.	THERE SHOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE TO LOOK AT AQUACULTURE FOR STOCK ENHANCEMENT.
<P>
29.	#28 CANT BE DONE UNLESS YOU INCLUDE #10, ENHANCEMENT.
<P>
30.	DEFINE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND.
<P>
31.	EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF MARICULTURE.
<P>
32.	ADD TO #31 AND COORDINATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WITH OTHER AGENCIES.
<P>
33.	RE SECOND PERFORMANCE MEASURE, IMPACTS FROM AQUACULTURE ACTIVITIES SHOULD REMAIN ENVIRONMENTALLY NEUTRAL.
<P>
34.	ISSUE OF SUBSISTENCE SPECIES IS NOT MEASURABLE.
	Re tribal fishermen on the west coast.
<P>
35.	(Paragraph 2, last sentence)  ADD STOCK ENHANCEMENT THROUGH AQUACULTURE.
<P>
36.	NEED STATEMENT TO SAY:  REGULATIONS TO LIMIT OVERFISHING OF ONE SPECIES MAY INADVERTENTLY PROMOTE OVERFISHING ON BYCATCH OR OF ANOTHER SPECIES.
	Overfishing and bycatch are directly related to federal and state regulations.  Is that stated in the plan?  If so, it should be stated more directly here.
<P>
37.	DISAGREE WITH #36.  DONT THINK THERE IS A DIRECT, ONE-TO-ONE, RELATIONSHIP.
	Overfishing and bycatch could be hidden.
	There are situations where there is not a one-to-one relationship between overfishing and regulations.  For example, Native Americans catching anadromous species are not regulated by the states or NOAA.
<P>
38.	REGULATIONS SHOULD IMPROVE MECHANISM FOR LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN STATES.
<P>
39.	RE PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1 PAGE 15, IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE OVERFISHING IN 5 YEARS.
<P>
40.	ADD PROTECT FISHERIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT OVERFISHED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE OVERFISHING.
<P>
41.	(Page 11, paragraph 1, last sentence)  SAY RECRUITMENT INSTEAD OF BIOLOGY. BIOLOGY IS TOO AMBIGUOUS.
	Needs clarification.  [Based on language in MFCMA to rebuild overfished stocks within 10 years where biologically possible.]
<P>
42.	ELIMINATION OF OVERFISHING WILL TURN INTO 0 TOLERANCE FOR OTHER FISHERIES NOT CURRENTLY OVERFISHED--USE DECREASE.  
	Elimination of overfishing is a managerial nightmare which will turn to 0 tolerance for bycatch and underutilized species into cessation of commercial fishing.  Word eliminate opens that door.  Use decrease or curtail instead.
<P>
43.	IN STRATEGIC APPROACH INCLUDE:  EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND AWARENESS DIRECTED TO SUBSISTENCE FISHERS.
	Do this in the languages of the fishers.
<P>
44.	CANNOT MEASURE OR IDENTIFY WHAT SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES ARE.  
	Mixed reaction.
<P>
45.	(Page 9, last full paragraph)  BUILD IN PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH.
	Underutilized species not mentioned here.  Is this in the objective?  Regional issue only. Should be supported.
<P>
46.	(RO #2, first bullet)  UNDERUTILIZED SPECIES SHOULD BE REFERENCED IN THE NATIONAL PLAN, AS A WAY TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF OTHER STOCKS.
<P>
47.	MUST DEFINE SUSTAINABLE USE. 
<P>
48.	IN ADDITION TO #46, UNDERUTILIZED SPECIES ARE OF ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE.  
	There are instances where underutilized species may be an important component of the ecosystem.  This needs to be highlighted in the national plan.  In addition to #46 there are ecological implications.
<P>
49.	(Page 9, first paragraph, strategic approaches)  ADD REGULATORY RIGHT AFTER NATURAL.
<P>
50.	(Page 13, 2nd para ½ down)  ADD AND/OR UTILIZED AFTER BYCATCH REDUCED.
<P>
51.	(Page 14, 2nd paragraph and first perf measure)  ADD AQUACULTURE TO STRATEGIC APPROACHES BECAUSE IT CAN INCREASE YIELD AND HAS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS.
<P>
52.	CONCERN THAT THE REGIONAL OBJECTIVE TO REDUCE COST TO CONSUMER WILL CAUSE ECONOMIC STRESS FOR COMMERCIAL HARVESTERS WHICH COULD INCREASE EFFORT.  
	May increase fresh fish prices and increase effort (backfire).
	Economic and social benefits which are directly related to economic stress to commercial harvesters need to be addressed.
<P>
53.	WOULD LIKE TO SEE BETTER DEFINITION OF WHAT IS HIGHEST ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE RESOURCE.
	Commercial fishing industry would like to know exactly what the tradeoffs are between user groups in achieving highest economic value of the resource.
<P>
54.	(Page 14, paragraph 2)  REDUCE OVERCAPITALIZATION SHOULD BE CHANGED TO SHIFT CAPITAL WITHIN THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY.  LOANS GRANTS INTO INDUSTRY.  
	Money should be made available for the long-term.  Money for loans and grants.  Instead of leaking out.
<P>
55.	(Re #54)  DONT WANT TO SHIFT CAPITAL AND SHIFT THE PROBLEM AT THE SAME TIME.  
	Reduce capitalization as shifting capital will move problem from one area to another. Shift capital, shift problem.
<P>
56.	EFFORTS TO REDUCE OVERCAPITALIZATION THAT ARTIFICIALLY SUPPORT VESSEL PRICES ARE A DISINCENTIVE TO NEW INDUSTRY.

<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - Protected Resources</H4>
<P>
Clarification: All marine mammals are protected under ESA, even those with exploding populations? Explained Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act.
<P>
57.	(Page 16, first line) WHAT IS MEANT BY MARINE SPECIES?  MAMMALS, FINFISH?
	Reference to marine species is ambiguous.
<P>  
58.	CHANGE PUBLIC SUPPORT TO PUBLIC DEMAND.
	DEMAND IS THE DRIVER. 
<P>
59.	INVESTIGATE MEANS TO MANAGE NON-THREATENED MARINE MAMMALS. 	Can currently healthy marine mammals be managed?  What is a healthy population?
	We should investigate means (ways) to manage non-threatened marine mammal populations, or it will get back to haunt us.  Non-threatened marine mammals can cause economic damage to human endeavors.
<P>
60.	EDUCATIONAL EFFORT IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE RE NEED FOR MANAGEMENT.  ILLUSTRATE IMPACTS OF INTERACTIONS WITH NON- THREATENED POPULATIONS.  EDUCATE PUBLIC RE CONSEQUENCES OF LACK OF MANAGEMENT OF HEALTHY POPULATIONS.
<P>
61.	DEFINE CURRENTLY HEALTHY POPULATIONS.
	Optimum sustainable population (OSP) size as defined in the MMPA is the floor and not the ceiling for defining a "healthy population" [Mike Sissenwine explanation].
<P>
62.	CONFLICTS SHOULD BE MINIMIZED WHERE THERE ARE ENDANGERED MARINE MAMMALS.   
<P>
63.	EVALUATE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INTERACTIONS--PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT IMPACT THEY HAVE.
	American public needs to know what seals, etc., are doing to fishermen and aquaculturists.
<P>
64.	(Page 18, last paragraph Re #62)  NEED BALANCED PUBLIC AWARENESS OF CONFLICT.  
	Negative impacts of marine mammals to fish or humans.
<P>
65.	CLARIFY PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2 TO MAKE CLEAR THAT INTENT IS TO REDUCE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MARINE MAMMALS ON HUMAN ACTIVITIES, NOT THE OTHER WAY.
<P>
66.	ECOLOGICALLY SOUND RESEARCH--SYNTAX IS POOR.
	The section needs to be reworked.
<P>
67.	(Page 18, paragraph 1, line 1)  INCLUDE GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES E.G. NAVY BEFORE FISHING.
<P>
68.	(Page 18 paragraph 1, line 4)  ADD AQUACULTURE AND FISHING.
<P>
69.	IF NMFS WANTS TO BE LEAD AGENCY ON AQUACULTURE IN EEZ FEDERAL WATERS, THEN ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN THE PLAN.
	Add aquaculture to fishing.
<P>
70.	(Page 18)  PERFORM. MEASURE #1 SHOULD REFER TO ENDANGERED SPECIES.
	Wording directly out of law--then should not have #2 which is not possible with one in place.
<P>
71.	PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2 IS NOT POSSIBLE IF ONE IS IN PLACE.

<HR>
<H4>Goal 3 - Healthy Coasts</H4>
<P>
Habitat goals were supported in general.
<P>
72.	GOAL IS UNREALISTIC GIVEN LIKELY POPULATION GROWTH.
	And given current attitudes to planning, development and conservation in coastal zones.
<P>
73.	HOW MUCH CAN NOAA REALISTICALLY DO CONSIDERING THE LAND BASED ORIGIN OF THE PROBLEM.  
	Problems originate on the land and atmospheric inputs from hundreds of miles away and manifest themselves from riverine imports etc.
<P>
74.	ADD TO #72, GIVEN CURRENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION IN THE COASTAL ZONE. 
	There should be a differentiation between onshore habitat affects and offshore--habitat degradation effects on wetlands and on offshore areas.  --differentiate between on-shore and offshore threats and how they work together.
<P>
75.	PROBLEMS ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY (AIR POLLUTION, RIVERINE EXPORT).  ADD TO #73.
<P>
76.	DIFFERENTIATE COASTAL VS. OFFSHORE HABITAT THREATS AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER.  Offshore habitat threats (dragging) differ in kind/space from inshore habitat threats (pollution).
<P>
77.	REGARDING THE PROTECT AND RESTORE OBJECTIVE, HEALTH SHOULD BE IN QUOTES.
<P>
78.	(Page 19, line 1)  ADD ABSOLUTELY TO DEPENDENT........
	Additional editorial changes will be provided.
<P>
79.	ADD HUMAN IMPACT CAN ALSO ENHANCE HABITAT NOT JUST DEGRADE.
<P>
80.	NO NET LOSS IS UNREALISTIC [within a 5-year time frame].
	Goal should be to restore and create habitat.
<P>
81.	ON THE NATIONAL BASIS NO NET LOSS IS REALISTIC.
<P>
82.	ALL HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE ECOSYSTEM MUST BE EVALUATED.
<P>
83.	MARICULTURE MUST BE USED MORE OFTEN AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE TOTAL PRODUCTIVITY.
<P>
84.	UNREALISTIC TO ASSESS ECOSYSTEM IN FIVE YEARS.
	Doubt if science is accurate re mackerel abundance estimates.  How can we assess ecosystem if we cant assess mackerel.
<P>
85.	ADD TO #84 THAT LONGER THAN 5 YEARS IS MORE REALISTIC.
<P>
86.	WHERE WILL MONEY COME FROM TO DO ALL THIS?
	If unrealistic in 5 years, must look back at sampling techniques etc.  Need more science--need more support.  Where is money to do all this?
<P>
87.	HABITAT STRATEGY APPROACHES ARE ALL GEARED TOWARD CHANGING FISHING HABITS WHICH IS A SMALL PART.    
<P>
88.	ADD TO #87:  APPROACHES ARE PUTTING MORE STRESS ON COMMERCIAL FISHERIES.  
	Plan seems to be putting a lot more restrictions on the fishing community, and approaches are putting a lot more stress on commercial fishers of wild harvest.
<P>
89.	NEED TO MANAGE WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH--FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON SINGLE SPECIES.  MOST IMPORTANT (NON-MANAGEMENT OF HARBOR SEALS) NON-MANAGED SPECIES HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT.
	Unchecked population is indication of unhealthy ecosystem, e.g., shark.  Cant just manage certain species.  A holistic approach to management is required, one that considers all species, including negative impacts of species currently not managed, i.e., non-management of harbor seals.  Nature unchecked is not necessarily good.

<HR>
<H4>Foundations of Stewardship</H4>
<P>
90.	MORE OF A SALES PITCH RATHER THAN PLAN.
	Refers to vessel objective.
<P>
91.	QUALITY OF SCIENCE WAS COMPROMISED WHEN NMFS STARTED TO USE VOLUNTARY DATA FOR ENFORCEMENT.
	Voluntary data refers to log books.
<P>
92.	LOGBOOKS DO NOT REFLECT CATCH--MISSING DISCARDS AND WHY.
	If science is based on logbooks it is not based on what is caught but only landed. --Big difference.  Logbooks do not reflect what is being caught, including discards and reasons for discards.
<P>
93.	STEWARDSHIP ON A REGIONAL BASIS IS COMPROMISED BY POLITICAL PRESSURE.
<P>
94.	MANDATORY COLLECTION OF SEA SAMPLING INFORMATION RESULTS IN LOSS OF COMMUNICATION. 
	Because collection of scientific information is no longer voluntary, external communication with commercial fishers is being lost.
<P>
95.	REGARDING ENFORCEMENT, COST TO DO THIS EFFECTIVELY IS PROHIBITIVE.
<P>
96.	ARE UNIFORM AGENTS, JUST FOR FISHING RELATED ISSUES?  COMMERCIAL FISHERIES?  SEEMS HEAVY HANDED TOWARDS COMMERCIAL FRONTLINE HARVESTERS.
<P>
97.	NMFS ENFORCEMENT WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE WHEN APPROACHED AS A MULTI-AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.  INCORPORATE ALL IMPACTS:  ZONING, COASTAL POLLUTION, ETC.
<P>
98.	MAKING REGULATIONS COMPREHENSIBLE IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE.
	Almost impossible not to be in violation.  NMFS language is problematic.  

<HR>
<H4>Wrap up/What is missing?</H4>
<P>
99.	AS READER PROGRESSES THROUGH DOCUMENT, FOCUS SHIFTS FROM AN APPROPRIATE GLOBAL BASIS WITH IDENTIFIED USER GROUPS TO COMMERCIAL FISHERIES AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENT.  LAST PART OF THE DOCUMENT IS NARROW IN FOCUS.
	Enforcement should be from an ecosystem perspective not only commercial fisheries.
<P>
100.	ECONOMIC/SOCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON SMALL COMMERCIAL
       FISHERMEN NOT AN ELEMENT IN THE PLAN.  
	Small fishermen are having to spend more money just to keep in compliance--economic and social costs, regulations and compliance, are stresses to small businessman.  It is not an element in this plan.  Not accounted for.  Must be explicitly expressed.
<P>
101.	PLAN IS GREAT BUT MONEY WILL BE A BIG ISSUE.  ESPECIALLY SINCE GOVERNMENT IS SHRINKING.  
	This will be major roadblock.
<P>
102.	WHILE REDUCING OVERCAPITALIZATION, ACTION WILL HAVE TO HAVE EMPHASIS ON COMPENSATORY GROUPS FORCED OUT.
	An effective plan must have an emphasis on reducing financial impact.  Effort reduction will have a cost.  There should be more emphasis for compensating user groups.  There has to be some thought on how to help people who will be displaced (financial compensation). 
<P>
103.	COMPENSATION PACKAGE, IF DESIGNED, MUST BE DESIGNED WITH FISHERMEN IN MIND.
	Designed for the fishing industry.  For example, commercial fishers don't pay unemployment insurance and thus aren't eligible for government-sponsored retraining.
<P>
104.	EVERY FISHERY SHOULD BE LIMITED ACCESS.
	Every fishery within the U.S. EEZ should be limited by permit.
<P>
105.	IF #104 IS IMPLEMENTED COULD FORCE OVERFISHING.
	Refers to a potential outcome of limited access.
<P>
106.	MARINE MAMMAL ISSUE WILL IMPACT EVERY GOAL.
	Marine mammal protection will impact all other goals.
<P>
107.	WOULD LIKE TO GET A COPY OF A SUMMARY OF MAJOR POINTS ACROSS THE NATION.
<P>
Before the meeting was adjourned, Dr. Sissenwine summarized the comments offered during this session.

<HR>
<H4>Goal 1 - Sustainable Fisheries</H4>

<H5>Objective 1:Maintain Healthy Stocks of Commercial, Recreational and Subsistence Species</H5>
<P>
1. Who can argue with maintaining healthy stocks.
<P>
2. Key to objective is consensus definition of healthy stocks.
<P>
3. Original benchmark clearly defines need to establish stock size.
<P>
4. Emphasize a shifting in management of multi-species.
<P>
5. Keep changing historical fish data over time. (e.g. 70s and 80s), need to stop this.
<P>
6. There are problems with scientific data used for allocations.
<P>
7. Need to improve public's understanding of fisheries models used to determine ABC.
<P>
8. Councils and state agencies - need to include Universities systems in stock assessments, (universities want piece of action) etc.
<P>
9. Increased  reliability and validity of data based on improved use of technology and sound research.
<P>
10. What is our track record on maintaining healthy stocks.
<P>
11. Needs to be more emphasis on ecosystems versus stock by stock assessment (prey species)
<P>
12. What are the values used to define: healthy stocks; numbers of fish; biomass; need to look to at alternative methods.
<P>
13. Need to look at objective measures of what stock sizes that will yield  optimal utilization
<P>
14. Best way is to have boats going out looking for certain species; they  provide best  data.
<P>
15. Need better data and better methods to communicate to users.
<P>
16. NMFS needs to establish understandable, credible marine resource data system to be used in the decision making process for councils and state agencies.
<P>
17. We are being unrealistic. - overly optimistic.(losing staff and fleet).

<HR>
<H5>Objective 2: Eliminate Overfishing and Rebuild Stocks of Commercial, Recreational, and Subsistence Species</H5>
<P>
1. Protection of resource is moving in wrong direction.
<P>
2. Rebuild stocks within 10 years is unrealistic; due to length of life of species.
<P>
3. Recovery of highly migratory species should take precedence over provisions of international treaties.
<P>
4. Don't have control over recreational fishing effort given the situation.
<P>
5. In some cases, a 10 year closure on some species puts a socio-economic burden on some user groups.
<P>		
6. Certain amount of predictability doesn't allow us to make choices.
<P>
7. It is somewhat unrealistic to believe that international fisheries will be equal to US standards.
<P>
8. To achieve this objective, knowledge must be based on best  science, data and forecast models.
<P>
9. Limits or attempts to eliminate overfishing must not affect one user group over needs of another. Try to be user neutral.
<P>
10.  Like 10 year goal; but should be within 10 years or less.
<P>
11. Not being able to get scientific data; still not getting it.
<P>
12. Change view of users to accept fact that overfishing does exist.
<P>
13. Apply understandable and acceptable standard methods with advance technology in the stock assessment process.
<P>
14. Communicate, utilize, and coordinate with state partners in doing more; not just to NMFS advantage.
<P>
15.  NMFS should re-evaluate definition of overfishing based on biological principles.
<P>
16.  Area that is not touched on is dynamics within the user groups,  i.e., - must better understand dynamics.
<P>
17.  Shrimp data needs to be more complete, particularly the landings and analysis of data.
 <P>
18.  I have difficulty of time frame required re overfishing, as long as stocks are improving - why do we need 2 years, 5 years, etc. 
<P>
19.  Have problems with everything being based on science alone; we need to be sure we are using best science.(only science doesn't necessarily equal best science).
<P>
20.  Strongly re-emphasize 2.5 - emphasis to be on social and economic aspect. Should be emphasized at least as well as the biological aspect.
<P>


<H5>Objective 3: Increase Economic, Social and Health Benefits to the Nation from Living Marine Resources</H5>
<P>
1.  Improve methods of determining contaminants, toxins and pathogens to ensure this information is put on a network system where people can use it.
<P>
2. Develop effective decision process for social, economic, environmental model based on knowledge, good science, good data.
<P>
3. Change bullet on slide to enhance to "recreational opportunity".
<P>
4. Need more of global view other than doing within.
<P>
5. Needs to be commitment funds to support socio-economic research to support allocation decisions.
<P>
6. Need to recognize that socio-economic value far exceeds dockside value of catch.
<P>
7. Improve the understanding of potential of socio-economic impacts in decision making.
<P>
8. Healthy seafood - habitat related.
<P>
9. What is a social benefit.
<P>
10. Need a consensus definition of socio-economic benefit.
<P>
11. 50% is a goal, improve on that, eliminate shrimp loss,  make gear user friendly.
<P>
12. Nothing is directed to the commercial fisherman; need to have a goal so that the commercial fishermen has shared access to fisheries.
<P>
13. Improve understanding of heavy metal;  for example mercury, as a risk to human health.
  <P>
14.  Controlled access in effort reduction management measures should have specific objectives rather than proceeding under general euphoria.
<P>
15. Fishermen need to be become vested in a specific fishery.


<H5>Objective 4: Advance Environmentally Sound Aquaculture</H5>
<P>
1. Support research to greatly improve aquaculture technology in the US.
<P>
2. Provide better oversight in fishery controls that are occurring in some states.
<P>
3. Provide world class technology and pilot test methods and best management operations for aquaculture operations.
<P>
4. Use extreme caution with exotics.
<P>
5. Not sure NMFS is the best agency for advancing aquaculture production - USDA?
<P>
6. Do not advance aquaculture to the level of an objective within NMFS.
<P>
7. Do not make aquaculture an objective to replace lost fisheries access to commercials.
<P>
8. Encourage any additional jobs or profitability for the US.
<P>
9.  Develop non lethal techniques to reduce the bird predation associated with aquaculture.
<P>
10. Specific stringent guidelines to separate wild fishery stocks from aquaculture fisheries.
<P>
11. Should work in close partnership with states and locals on aquaculture issues.
<P>
12. NMFS should not use funds for "how to" aquaculture technology, but rather focus on monitoring stock enhancement actions:  don't spend money on "how to" grow purposes.
<P>
13. No NMFS encouragement to EEZ aquaculture.
<P>
14. The ocean environment has to be taken into account in engineering these sea farms - (disasters such as hurricanes).
<P>
15. Reduce or eliminate adverse biological impacts. (add this to bullet #2). 
<P>
16. NMFS should not be the promoter, but should be the regulators, to prevent any adverse environmental impacts.


<HR>
<H4>Goal 2 - Protected Resources</H4>

<H5>Objective 5: Recover and Sustain Protected Species Populations</H5>
<P>
1. Go to Rancho Nuevo and stop Mexicans from killing turtles..
<P>
2. Continue to promote, advance greater understanding and awareness of the importance of the protected species
<P>
3. Communicate status to public; let us know what's going on.
<P>
4.  Hire more federal agents.
<P>
5.  Improve coordination with Fish and Wildlife Service on protected species.
<P>
6.  Ensure significant penalties are adjudicated for violations.
<P>
7.  Improve the scientific population models and estimates of population of protected species.
<P>
8.  Improve public awareness through education and communications (i.e. through networking, the information super-highway and public television) 
<P>
9.  Don't see a mechanism to move protected species to unprotected species for socio-economic use (sea-turtle soup).
<P>
10.  Further inter-action with MMS re: their offshore oil and gas activity.
<P>
11.  1996 levels should not be used as the sole judge for decreases in human caused threats. (rewrite Pg 15 - bullet 3)
<P>
12.  Improve coordination and support for marine mammal stranding network so that research and response to die-offs can be improved.
<P>
13.  Re: Kemps Ridley, NMFS should emphasize more of the nesting and current stock assessment, rather than amount of strandings.

<HR>
<H5>Objective 6: Reduce Conflicts that Involve Protected Species</H5>
<P>
1. Determine whether economic incentives, versus proliferating regulations, can be used to reduce conflict.
<P>
2.  Look at predation of shrimp by red drum; considering that red drum are protected in the general term, how does the increase in stocks affect the predation on shrimp.
<P>
3. Continue to investigate problems with oil platform removal as they apply to red snapper and other endangered species.
<P>
4. Add evaluation of area and seasonal closures as measures to reduce conflicts with protected species - all appears to be gear oriented, needs to be broadened.
<P>
5. Involve fishermen in decision making from initial phases of considerations.
<P>
6. (refers to second bullet)  Include resultant regulations that adversely impact human activity.
<P>
7.  Reduction of negative impact of marine mammal should not affect termination of the offending species.
<P>
8.  Promote and publish success and failures stories on protected species.
<P>
9.  Implement gear modifications only as needed and only in areas where needed.
		

<HR>
<H4>Goal 3 - Healthy Coasts</H4>
<H5>Objective 7: Protect, Restore and Create Vital Living Marine Resource Habitat to Realize No Net Loss</H5>
 <P>
1. Include considerations of fresh water inputs into estuarine habitats.
<P>
2. Utilize updated technology to identify habitats and loss of habitats.
<P>
3. We need to think  globally rather than locally (entire ecosystem for example -  airshed, watershed) - we have only looked at the coast (locally).
<P>
4. In speaking of "no loss" and "no-net loss" it should mean loss of marine resource productivity as well as geographic volume area.
<P>
5. Realistically,  "no net loss"  is too low an objective.  If you seek to achieve "no net loss",  there will be  a loss.
<P>
6. Restore Florida Keys ecosystem to pre 1970 conditions where possible.
<P>
7.  Identify and quantify impacts of fishing gears upon habitat.
<P>
8.  Worst enemy of shrimp habitat is pollution .
<P>
9.  Improve public's understanding of habitat and marine resources.
<P>
10. Communicate better with public on importance of habitat.
<P>
11. Current domestic demand for fisheries product far exceeds the capacity of the existing habitat.
<P>
12.  Rather than the national basis, the concept of no-net loss should be applied to  a more defined geographic area.
<P>
13.  (Want to reiterate 7.3) - NMFS should increase attention to non-coastal land use decisions.
<P>
14.  NMFS should attempt to answer the question: "Do artificial reefs increase resources or aggregate resources?"
<HR>

<H5>Objective 8: Restore, Enhance and Sustain the Health and Biodiversity of Marine </H5>                            Ecosystems
<P>
1. Improve communications and foster positive actions with other countries (north and south), and promote partnerships with local, state, and other federal agencies.
<P>
2. In defining marine ecosystems, think globally.
<P>
3. In defining marine ecosystems, include all input that affects biological productivity and health.
<P>
4. Reiterate number 7.6.
<P>
5. Coordinate ecosystem studies,  data bases,  planning, with other resource agencies.
<P>
6. Pool resources with other agencies.
<P>
7. Insure coordination with other state/federal agencies, defining ecosystem boundaries.

<HR>
<H4>Foundations for Stewardship</H4>

<H5>Ensure NOAA Fisheries Science is Highest Quality</H5>
<P>
1.  Acquire, implement, and use state of the art technology  to develop data systems.
<P>
2. Support good science in fisheries and ensure results are transferred to NOAA fisheries.
<P>
3. Make data gathering, science and results understandable and credible to all involved.
<P>
4. Increase and enhance partnerships between NOAA scientists and other scientific institutions.
<P>
5. Seek and select successful stories/methods from other scientific and technological agencies and industries.
<P>
6. Increase review of quality of fishery dependent data that is used in developing peer review models.
<P>
7. Remember data collection and analysis is not science; science is the process of seeking the truth.
<P>
8. Improve scientific data base - it should include all shrimp landings data of all states and by sizes and made available to industry.
<P>
9.Insure scientists have ample time to fully analyze data before performing stock assessments.
<P>
10.  NMFS should have to account for computer models that we know are not true;  models have to be updated and modified.
<P>
11. Remember what models are:  Small imitations of the real world.
<P>
12.  Improve near term forecast capabilities of NMFS scientists particularly with respect to recreational participation and harvest.
<P>
13.  Regarding the SEAMAP program, consider adding comparison data (historical average) to SEAMAP reports.



<H5>Increase Compliance and Improve Regulatory Effectiveness</H5>
<P>
1. Do away with the FIN system  
<P>
2. We need more personnel out in the field, and in regulations.
<P>
3. I'd like to see amount of fish poached show up in computer models.
<P>
4. Appropriate more money to the states for fisheries law enforcement.
<P>
5. More stringent punishment for violations.
<P>
6. Improve public awareness of value of resources so they appreciate the need for better enforcement.
<P>
7. Increase personnel and budget.
<P>
8. Keep all NMFS personnel up to date on regulations.
<P>
9. Enforcement must be an equal priority - regulations without enforcement is useless.


<H5>Increase Effectiveness of External Communications</H5>


<H5>Improve Agency Infrastructure and Workforce</H5>

<P>
Andy briefly outlined Objectives 11 & 12; due to running out of time, he suggested any comments for those two objectives be covered in Item 13 below.


<HR>
<H4>Other Comments? What's Missing ?</H4>
<P>
Make fish as popular as dinosaurs.
<P>
Very few people fully appreciate how valuable these resources are; something has to be done in the next decade.  
<P>

<STRONG><CENTER>NOTE TO READERS</CENTER></STRONG><P>

We are pleased to approve this plan to strengthen the National Marine Fisheries Service's National Habitat Program.  This occasion culminates 22 months of effort beginning in October 1994 when we requested a plan to chart future directions for this important program.   Our extensive public dialog with more than 200 constituent groups and government partners contributed significantly to the recommendations and actions in this Plan.  Our National Habitat Program now becomes an integral component of the NMFS' commitment as trustee for living marine resources.  <P>

This National Habitat Program is one of our highest priorities.  After 25 years of solid effort in the shadows of more visible programs, we will now witness major increases related to this vital mission.  Habitat research and management programs now are equals to fishery and protected resource programs.<P>  

This document is a testament to the successes of our National Habitat Program.  The Plan builds on the strengths of our long-standing commitment to habitat research and management, and sets the stage for continued success as we address new challenges.  Now our attentions must shift to implementation.  We will reaffirm our habitat priorities in the NMFS Strategic Plan, expand our partnerships, shift toward more holistic ecosystem approaches, increase our scientific understanding, and pursue the authorities and resources to succeed.  Each of us shares the burden of this challenge.  We look forward to working with you as we strengthen the National Marine Fisheries Service's commitment to sound habitat research and management.<P>

Our special appreciation is several key individuals.  First, the NMFS Habitat Steering Committee members who contributed their time and effort to this National Habitat Plan -- Gordon Thayer, Jim Slawson, Steve Morris, Steve Zimmerman, Mike Ludwig, Jim Meehan, Margaret Lorenz, Paul Perra, and Mike Jahncke.  I also thank several other major contributors -- Andy Mager, Chris Mantzaris, Bud Cross, Jane Hannuksela, Jim Bybee, Bob Hoffman, John Naughton, John Stein, John Boreman, Tracy Collier, Tamra Faris, David Rackley, Stan Gorski, K Koski, and Laurie Sullivan.  The Office of Habitat Conservation coordinated this planning effort, and their leadership was essential -- Steve Waste, Ralph Lopez, Garry Mayer, Dail Brown, Jim Thomas, and Bess Gillelan.  Thanks to each for their vision and dedication.  We particularly thank Tom Bigford for his steadfast and significant efforts. <P>

We look forward to continued success!<P>

Mission<P>


To protect, conserve, restore, and create habitats and ecosystems vital to self-sustaining populations of living marine resources under NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service stewardship.<P>


Vision <P>

Healthy resources require viable habitat.  The NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service envisions healthy, self sustaining habitat for living marine resources.  The National Habitat Program will strive to focus staff, budget, and priorities to make the greatest possible difference in sustaining living marine resources and their habitats.  This vision will require new efforts to protect, conserve, restore, and create habitats and associated ecosystems.  Success will increase habitat quality and quantity, with benefits to resources and constituents.  This vision parallels priority elements in the NOAA Strategic Plan to rebuild sustainable fisheries, recover protected species, and sustain healthy coasts, integrated appropriately with other NOAA offices.  Program priorities will also reflect NMFS priorities related to riverine, estuarine, coastal, and oceanic habitats that are essential for anadromous and marine species.<P>
<P>


Strategic Outcomes<P>
<P>


	(1)	Protect and conserve habitats from human-induced degradation;<P>

	(2)	Restore degraded habitats; and<P>

	(3)	Create habitats with greater value than at present.<P>

NMFS' Habitat Responsibilities for Living Marine Resources<P>

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) manages living marine resources from the inland reach of anadromous fish seaward through the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.  In cooperation with other NMFS programs and colleagues elsewhere, the NMFS National Habitat Program supports this mandate by protecting, conserving, restoring, and creating habitats necessary to build sustainable fisheries, recover protected species, and maintain the ecosystems that support those populations.  Our leadership role has improved marine environmental quality and contributed to resource management.  Still, habitat degradation and loss continue to threaten living marine resources and to impose significant ecological and economic losses.  This Plan is an activity-based blueprint for improving the research and management programs that can reduce habitat losses.  Our audience is largely those NOAA and NMFS programs with a direct role in implementation.  An executive summary for non-NOAA partners will be prepared with less emphasis on specific action, more background on habitat issues, and specific examples of partnership opportunities.
<P>
<P>
The Agency's Historical Habitat Program<P>

NOAA/NMFS has supported an active habitat program since the agency was created in 1970.  While the rate of habitat loss has declined, continued erosion of ecological function and total acreage confirms that the agency must reaffirm its research and management priorities.  Human population growth, burgeoning  development, and associated degradation continue to overwhelm NMFS efforts to protect, conserve, restore, and create habitats.  Cumulative impacts and fiscal constraints complicate our mission.  NMFS will address these new challenges by expanding its most successful programs and by embarking on new initiatives, as warranted.<P>
<P>

Directions for the Next Decade<P>

Planning and strong leadership are essential for the NMFS National Habitat Program to pursue its vision and achieve its goals.  The extent of our success hinges on the agency's ability to acquire new resources, strengthen legislative authorities, and shift internal priorities.  While this Plan provides the basic directions for the National Habitat Program, our specific plans and goals will evolve as implementation plans are prepared by each regional and headquarters office.  Individually, those implementation plans will provide geographic and topical specificity.  In combination, the plans will emphasize the values, threats, and challenges that are common to several regions or are crucial to the NMFS.  <P>

This National Habitat Plan and the resulting implementation plans will form the basis for a strengthened National Habitat Program.  Our intent is to build from the recommendations contained in a series of Program reviews conducted since 1990 (Appendix 1).  Those recommendations have been supplemented by input from NMFS offices in headquarters and the regions plus public meetings involving hundreds of constituent groups.  We have reviewed our enabling legislation and compared those mandates (Appendix 2) to our expectations, available resources, and the prospects of additional staff, increased budgets, or strengthened mandates.  This Plan identifies those activities that emerged as most important for a successful program, beginning with immediate actions that can be accomplished with existing resources and expanding as new resources become available (see page 3 for further explanation of phased implementation).<P>

Schedule<P>
<P>

An earlier draft Plan was circulated for public review on September 28, 1995.  NMFS leadership reviewed comments from more than a dozen outside groups and selected this preferred course of action.  This Plan identifies the recommendations and actions that must be initiated in FY 1996 and accomplished beginning in FY 1997.  Office-by-office "implementation plans" will be prepared in early FY 1997, as explained in Appendix 3.  Overall implementation will be tracked regularly by the Office of Habitat Conservation based on status reports from each NMFS office.  The National Habitat Plan and the implementation plans will be revised as warranted.<P>

<P>
  
	<STRONG><CENTER>INTRODUCTION</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>


This National Habitat Plan (the "Plan") implements the new vision for the National Marine Fisheries Service's Office of Habitat Conservation.  The following recommendations and actions are closely integrated with NMFS priorities, the new NMFS organization, and new office roles.  <P>

The Plan is based on a renewed NMFS commitment to:<P>

	o the habitats of living marine resources;<P>

	o expanded partnerships within NOAA; and,<P>

	o improved communications and collaboration with our colleagues and constituents outside NOAA.  <P>

The Plan will remain strongly based in the NMFS regions, with vital headquarters contributions.  Headquarters will provide national leadership and oversight.  This network of regional and headquarters offices involved in research, management, and communications represents the National Habitat Program (the "Program").<P>

One of our early implementation steps will be to incorporate the Plan's recommendations and actions into the developing NOAA and NMFS Strategic Plans, as appropriate.  That long-term commitment is well underway with the NOAA Strategic Plan through the budget process and will be expanded to the NMFS Strategic Plan as that document is developed.<P>

This National Habitat Plan addresses four major themes:<P>

 	<STRONG>Protection and Conservation </STRONG>-- Assess human-induced impacts at levels ranging from site-specific to ecosystems, provide scientifically-based advice to reduce or eliminate those impacts, and form partnerships to protect and conserve habitats of living marine resources;<P>

 	<STRONG>Restoration and Creation</STRONG> -- Restore and create habitat, thereby reversing the net loss occurring from continued growth and development or resulting from natural events;<P>


 	<STRONG>Understanding</STRONG> -- Obtain and interpret scientific information needed to manage important habitats, increase awareness of habitat values, and enhance the NMFS role in habitat protection, conservation, restoration, and creation activities; and
<P>
 	<STRONG>Operations</STRONG> -- Augment program actions by improving policy, budget, staffing, and other key components of the National Habitat Program.

Each theme is addressed in a separate chapter with a "Background and Findings" section and a series of "Recommendations" with specific actions.  This Plan includes 22 recommendations and 74 actions.  As NMFS acts to fulfill its vision, each will be weighed against regional and national priorities, available resources, and the prospects of new staff and budget as we develop implementation plans.  <P>

This Plan commits the Program to:<P>

	o	Implement a common agency vision of the National Habitat Program's role in achieving national living marine resource management objectives, and translate that vision into agency resource allocations.<P>

	o	Coordinate environmental research and management to address key habitat issues more effectively, with an emphasis on riverine, estuarine, coastal, and oceanic areas.<P>

	o	Emphasize proactive approaches with benefits to living marine resources and their habitat, including an increased connection with fishery and protected species management.<P>

	o	Pursue interagency and public-private partnerships to leverage technical capabilities and fiscal resources, resulting in increased effectiveness.<P>

	o	Develop scientific and management capabilities to expand permit and license considerations to include cumulative, secondary, and indirect impacts within an ecosystem (or watershed/drainage basin) context.<P>

	o	Establish effective lines of communication with constituents concerning NMFS National Habitat Program to share our mission, vision, strategic goals, priorities, and progress. <P>
Each recommendation includes specific actions to be implemented during a general timeframe based on staff, budgets, and priorities:<P>

	<STRONG>N</STRONG> = near term; initiated shortly after Plan approval and completed within one year<P>

	<STRONG>M</STRONG> = mid term; initiated within the first year but continuing on a phase dictated by resources and priorities<P>

	<STRONG>L </STRONG>= long term; initiated when feasible and completed when possible<P>

Specific priorities for all recommendations and actions will be developed as part of the implementation plans to be developed by each region and headquarters office.  NMFS does not expect to accomplish all tasks nationwide in the first year but to provide a framework with flexibility so each office may focus effort according to its priorities.  This phased approach reveals our long-term Program direction, ranks near-term priorities, and reiterates the need for increased staff and budget.<P>

The agency's vision is healthy habitat for living marine resources.  For the purposes of this Plan, habitat is defined as the physical, chemical, geological, and biological surroundings that support healthy, self-sustaining populations of living marine resources.  Habitat includes both the physical component of the environment which attracts living marine resources (e.g., salt marshes, seagrass beds, coral reefs) and the chemical and biological characteristics that are necessary to support living marine resources.  <P>

Habitat needs may vary seasonally and according to life stage.  The National Habitat Program will place its highest priorities on vulnerable and valuable life stages (e.g., molting crabs, reproducing adults), places of natural concentration (e.g., migratory routes, spawning sites), key habitats (e.g., submerged aquatic vegetation beds, shellfish reefs, coral reefs), or major habitat impacts (e.g., chemical spills, blocked anadromous fish streams, dredged shellfish beds, shaded marshes).<P><BR>


	<STRONG><CENTER>THEMES FOR IMPROVEMENT</CENTER></STRONG><BR>

I. PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION<P>

<STRONG>Background and Findings:</STRONG><P>

Protecting and conserving existing habitat is significantly less costly than restoring or creating habitat.  Several NMFS regions devote a majority of their staff time to Federal actions such as private and public water development proposals, civil works projects, and water resource plans that presage habitat alterations.  This Plan and the specific implementation plans to follow will retain sufficient regional and national flexibility to select the best mix of individual permits or projects, general permits and other sweeping programmatic efforts, public works projects, ecosystem approaches such as watershed management, and other opportunities.  The National Habitat Program must consider every option to strengthen mandates, set priorities, focus research, and improve its ability to influence Federal actions affecting habitat.  <P>

NMFS derives its habitat authorities from dozens of statutes and executive orders, especially those in Appendix 2.  Our most powerful statutes are the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Federal Power Act, Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and Endangered Species Act.  Many of those mandates are shared with other agencies or are advisory, thereby restricting the agency's ability to act unilaterally to conserve or protect habitat.  That distinction separates the National Habitat Program from most protected species or fishery management programs which operate under specific mandates that ascribe regulatory powers.<P>

While traditional approaches and current priorities have been successful, habitat losses are mounting and living marine  resources continue to decline.  New initiatives are necessary to complement existing strengths and to support agency efforts in fishery and protected species management.  Specific priorities will vary regionally but could include: national and regional policies on recurring issues like dredged material disposal; stronger legislative mandates such as those proposed in the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act; improved use of long-term, large-scale controls such as hydropower licenses and conservation plans; and greater focus on stubborn issues such as cumulative/secondary/indirect effects.<P>

This Program theme should be expanded from human-related issues to encompass assessments of natural changes in habitat quantity and quality.  That broader mission will offer many new partnership opportunities and will relate closely to our ecosystem/watershed approach.<P>

<STRONG>Recommendations for Action:</STRONG><P>

I.1. <STRONG>Expand role of NHP in fishery management.</STRONG><P>


Through legislative proposals and new agency priorities, the National Habitat Program has been challenged to become a more active partner in fishery management.  Healthy habitats for harvested species form the basis for long-term economic return.  National Habitat Program staff will work with fishery managers to strengthen the relationship between harvest control and habitat protection/conservation, and to ensure that restoration and creation activities are fully considered.  Those efforts should encompass the special circumstances related to aquaculture, which often transects habitat, fishery, and protected species management.  This will involve efforts to integrate fishery management and habitat protection and conservation activities.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.1.a	Identify key interstate and federal fishery management plans that require improved identification of habitat issues.<STRONG> (N)</STRONG><P>

	I.1.b	Identify and implement actions required in regions and headquarters to identify habitat issues. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.1.c	Improve habitat coordination efforts with habitat committees of councils and commissions. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.1.d	Ensure that National Habitat Program contributions are timely and accepted.<STRONG> (M)
</STRONG><P>
	I.1.e	Develop operational agreements to effect these changes, as necessary. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

I.2.<STRONG> Expand role of NHP in protected resource management.</STRONG><P>

The National Habitat Program has also been challenged to become a more active partner in protected resources programs.  Candidate and listed species often occupy habitats that are affected by human development or natural perturbations, and are thus of special concern to the National Habitat Program.  Examples include river systems that support anadromous fish and beach/marsh systems that support sea turtles.  National Habitat Program staff in headquarters and the regions will collaborate with protected species staff to strengthen the relationship between habitat and protected species programs.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:

	I.2.a	Clarify the roles of regional and headquarters habitat staff in protected species programs.  Distinguish lead and support roles. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.2.b	With headquarters and regional staff, identify those protected species and habitat activities requiring collaboration. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.2.c	As necessary in I.2.b, provide substantive comments on pending actions such as biological opinions and habitat conservation plans,  participate in briefings, etc. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.2.d	Develop operational agreements, as necessary. <STRONG>(M)
</STRONG><P>
I.3. <STRONG>Strengthen legislative mandates.
</STRONG><P>


Previous National Habitat Program evaluations have urged NMFS to strengthen its legislative authority to protect and conserve habitat.  NMFS recognizes that its habitat mandates are based in many laws and that new legislation could strengthen this Program.<P>


New legislation offers many opportunities.  During the past decade NMFS has tracked amendments to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Clean Water Act, Food Security Act of 1985 (Farm Bill), Water Resources Development Act, and other key statutes.  More recent efforts have expanded to the Coastal Zone Management Act, Endangered Species Act, Superfund, Oil Pollution Act, and the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA).  The agency's needs are best represented by proposed improvements in the 1996 MFCMA reauthorization language that will clarify NMFS' role and connect habitat activities to other agency priorities:<P>

 o	Define "essential fish habitat."<P>

 o	Use the expertise and resources of the NMFS National Habitat Program to assist the regional fishery management councils in their efforts to identify and conserve fish habitat and to improve the habitat provisions of fishery management plans (FMPs).<P>

 o	Enhance the role of councils by developing FMP amendments that identify essential fish habitats, describe major threats, and recommend conservation measures.<P>

 o	Coordinate with NOAA programs to ensure support for fish habitat conservation.<P>

 o	Increase intra-agency and interagency cooperation and consultation on essential fish habitat issues.<P>

While the Magnuson Act amendments would clarify the NMFS role in habitat conservation for species managed pursuant to the MFCMA, it is vital that the National Habitat Program take maximum advantage of existing opportunities to achieve other improvements.  In some instances new priorities are warranted, not new legislative authorities. <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.3.a	Continue to support the Magnuson Act consistent with the above improvements.<STRONG> (N)</STRONG><P>

	I.3.b	Convene a national workshop to implement essential fish habitat provisions. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.3.c	Seek full implementation of existing legislative mandates and new legislative improvements to improve the habitat program. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.3.d	Pursue partnerships with other NOAA programs that could support habitat conservation. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

1.4.<STRONG> Establish national and regional policies and guidance.</STRONG><P>

Written policies and guidance will increase efficiency and effectiveness.  National and regional policies will strengthen comment letters, add consistency, and encourage decision makers to adopt NMFS positions.  This proactive approach will increase the likelihood that NMFS' recommendations are accommodated in development decisions and ease collaborations in protected resource and fishery management arenas.<P>

The 1983 NMFS Habitat Conservation Policy has provided a framework for the National Habitat Program.  That policy could provide a solid basis for new policies and guidance.  Many of the priorities identified in the Policy remain valid, and reflect NMFS' heightened interests in habitat activities.  For example, NMFS policy statements could: strengthen and streamline NMFS' participation in elevations conducted under Clean Water Act §404(q); clarify our position on state assumptions and state programmatic general permits under the CWA; establish Federal Power Act §18 guidelines for fishways; or provide guidelines for aquaculture facility siting and operation. <P>

  Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.4.a	Inventory existing national and regional NMFS policies. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.4.b	Identify regional and national policy development priorities.  (See Section IV. Operations) <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.4.c	Establish a schedule for preparing and issuing policies. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.4.d	Adopt agency policies in accordance with the standards for review and dissemination.<STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>


I.5. <STRONG>Review existing interagency memoranda and seek improvements.</STRONG><P>

NMFS often supplements its legislative mandates and programmatic initiatives with interagency agreements.  Few agreements have been evaluated for overall effectiveness and possible revision.
    
For example, NMFS has several agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) which should be reviewed.  The Clean Water Act §404(q) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) establishes procedures to resolve disputes related the discharge of dredged or fill materials.  NMFS should pursue new standards and procedures for interagency review, especially by delegating decision authority involving elevation matters to the Assistant Administrator of Fisheries.  Changes should be negotiated at the headquarters level and through improved local operating procedures with each COE District.  Interagency agreements on personnel transfers or joint efforts to create habitat should also be revisited. <P> 

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.5.a	Evaluate all existing interagency memoranda for effectiveness, identify priorities, and establish an implementation schedule, and negotiate improvements. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.5.b	Where appropriate, request delegation of authority to the action level. <STRONG>(M)
</STRONG><P>

I.6. <STRONG>Seek institutional partnerships to leverage funds and increase success.</STRONG><P>

NMFS habitat protection and conservation efforts are generally performed in close cooperation with our partners.  As agency roles change in response to legislative and  policy actions, NMFS must ensure that its mission is not compromised.  For example, agencies often re-assess their advisory roles in Federal water development activities, with implications to NMFS.  The appropriate response will vary on a case-by-case basis, and could involve major shifts in Program priorities and resource allocations.  <P>

These considerations extend beyond Federal agencies.  The state coastal zone management programs and interstate fishery commissions complement NMFS habitat conservation activities.  Tribes play a major role in coastal development and anadromous fish issues.  And the private sector is now a frequent partner. Accordingly, NMFS should systematically review activities at the national and regional levels and identify opportunities for improved coordination.  Where feasible, these efforts should include local governments and non-governmental organizations to improve our success at the local level.  Special efforts must also be fostered with regional fishery management councils, especially if the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to strengthen the habitat provisions (see Sections I.1 and 1.3 above).<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.6.a	Evaluate partnerships with Federal, state, regional, local, and tribal governmental organizations to further NMFS' habitat mission, either directly or indirectly. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.6.b	Adjust program priorities to emphasize those partnerships capable of supporting NMFS' habitat mission, e.g., with NOAA's NOS/OCRM and OAR/Sea Grant on ecosystem management and research. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.6.c	Where feasible, increase working relationships with non-governmental groups.<STRONG> (M)</STRONG><P>

I.7. <STRONG>Improve NMFS participation in ecosystem management partnerships.  </STRONG><P>

Ecosystem management efforts provide a logical extension of the agency's successful efforts at the site-specific level that prevails in individual permit decisions.  The Chesapeake Bay Program and Florida Bay Program offer solid extensions into the ecosystem, watershed, drainage basin, or similarly broad ecological context.  <P>

This approach is based on agency priorities and our existing mandates.  NMFS will document its current level of participation in these efforts and then determine whether to pursue new opportunities.  Available staff and budget will continue to affect the level of future participation. <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.7.a	Inventory NMFS involvement in ecosystem partnerships.<STRONG> (N)</STRONG><P>

	I.7.b	Establish criteria based on national and regional needs to determine appropriate NMFS role in watershed, ecosystem, or other special partnerships. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.7.c	Set priorities and select opportunities to develop partnerships with Federal, state, and non-governmental groups. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

I.8. <STRONG>Develop and use Habitat Evaluation Teams.</STRONG><P>

Routine efforts and special situations require that management operations and scientific programs be thoroughly coordinated.  General approaches to improve coordination are presented in Section IV on Operations.  In certain situations, NMFS staff must be augmented with special teams of management and science personnel.  Sample situations for a Habitat Evaluation Team could include complex Federal projects like a mining project near anadromous fish waters, highly technical situations involving mixed contaminants, and projects requiring field visits or testing. <P>

To meet these needs, NMFS will:<P>

	I.8.a	Establish a pilot Habitat Evaluation Team (HET) to test this approach and address an issue of mutual concern. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.8.b	Evaluate the trial use of a HET and develop recommendations for adoption nationally, including budgets. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>


	I.8.c	Implement recommendations.<STRONG> (L)</STRONG><P>


I.9. <STRONG>Become more proactive in individual project evaluations. </STRONG><P>

Habitat protection and conservation for individual permits, federal water development projects, and hydropower licenses is largely reactive.  Many of the preceding recommendations would shift some additional resources to preapplication work and preventative actions that should be more efficient and effective.  Those changes will require that NMFS participate more vigorously in inter-agency coordinating teams and that the agency develop policies and other supportive mechanisms to improve efficiency.  These improvements are a logical application of existing mandates, and they must be supported by state-of-the-art information from NMFS science centers and elsewhere. <P>



Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	I.9.a	Participate, where possible, in preapplication planning and other proactive efforts. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.9.b	Use NMFS national and regional policies to provide advance notice of acceptable development practices.<STRONG> (L)</STRONG><P>

I.10. <STRONG>Identify program benefits of increased staff and funds and opportunities to leverage elsewhere.</STRONG><P>

The agency's habitat protection and conservation activities, including the scientific research efforts upon which they depend, should be expanded and improved with increased funding and staff.  Our success will be heightened by using those funds to leverage cooperation from our partners.  One long-standing opportunity relates to advisory services.  Our traditional permit review activities could be improved by better information (see Section III.1), greater consideration of cumulative impacts (see Section III.3), and computer technology (see Sections III.3 and IV.6).  Proactive activities would benefit from watershed planning and other large-scale assessment programs.  Some benefits are available with existing staff but significant improvements will require new resources.<P>

Water quality assessments offer one example of how these efforts could be leveraged with our partners.  Traditionally, NMFS has focused its habitat conservation efforts on acreage rather than chemical integrity.  This priority is logical as quality provides few benefits without quantity, but quality is becoming more important as agencies improve their efforts to stem the net loss of habitat acres.  The prospects of fulfilling our broader mandates are daunting.  Compared to our traditional roles, habitat staff are less prepared to address water quality issues such as: water quality standards; contaminants in dredged materials; wastewater discharge permits; and non-point source pollution.  Some of these opportunities may be addressed through policy review or watershed planning efforts, plus permit reviews.  NMFS must work with the Environmental Protection Agency and others to advance its interests in the ecological impacts of diminished water quality.<P>

NMFS participates in many watershed planning efforts, but participation is limited by existing Program resources.  A thorough review should reveal opportunities where NMFS National Habitat Program objectives can be furthered.  NMFS places a high priority on seeking additional resources, and will consider using new staff or funds to improve traditional advisory services and watershed planning efforts and water quality assessments.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>
      
	I.10.a	Develop specific plans to seek new funds, leverage funds with partners, or otherwise support implementation. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	I.10.b	Place a high priority on these activities in NMFS' budget initiatives. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	I.10.c	Provide funding, training, and logistical support for NMFS participation in these new or expanded program activities. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

II. RESTORATION AND CREATION<P>

<STRONG>Background and Findings:</STRONG><P>

Habitat restoration and creation complements protection and conservation in our efforts to retain habitat function and value.  While protection and conservation are more cost effective,  restoration is evolving as a valid technique to reverse habitat loss.  NMFS' leadership role in restoration and creation projects offers the opportunity to promote this important component of the National Habitat Program and lead our partners.  Creation is a closely related challenge, often complicated by the absence of similar habitat in the area.  Instead of restoring a habitat degraded by pollution or previous human activity the mission becomes converting a low-valued yet functional area into one with higher values.  Management decisions associated with creation can be more difficult than for restoration, where improvements are related to habitat degradation rather than weighing societal preferences for one habitat versus another.<P>

The socio-economic and ecological challenges of restoration and creation are immense.  Many developed areas offer numerous opportunities to restore degraded habitats, and unavoidable habitat losses will continue to push restoration and creation to the forefront.  The increasing use of mitigation banking is one example of these trends.<P>

Restoration and creation will become more readily accepted as demonstration projects are completed and standardized methods and protocols are adopted.  NMFS will play a leadership role in  documenting expected outcomes, setting performance monitoring criteria, and measuring success.  <P>

<STRONG>Recommendations for Action:</STRONG><P>

II.1.<STRONG> Establish habitat restoration and creation as integral strategy/tools in resource and ecosystem management.</STRONG><P>

Living marine resource management has historically focussed on mortality/take controls to maintain resource populations and productivity.  Healthy habitat supports natural productivity and is now considered an essential component of successful resource management.  <P>

Habitat degradation may reduce productivity and overall ecosystem health.  As acknowledged by the President's Council on Sustainable Development, these losses are major factors contributing to poor harvests, depleted stocks, and listed species.  Restoration and creation must be integrated with traditional management efforts.<P>

Opportunities abound to implement this recommendation.  However, coastal habitat restoration and creation can be costly.  That limitation requires NMFS to seek partnerships where funds may be leveraged with resources from the public and private sectors.  For example, NMFS could participate more directly in Coastal America, where restoration projects at Department of Defense base closure sites could improve large expanses of coastal shallows.  The agency could also pursue restoration initiatives on forest lands to benefit Pacific coast salmon or along migratory routes to riverine spawning grounds for Atlantic shad and river herrings.  One specific task under II.1.b will be to improve the existing Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to allow use of federal funds to enhance environmental outcomes of federal projects.  NMFS should work with DOC/NOAA and our federal partners to clarify administrative procedures so managers can adopt or revise interagency agreements to improve restoration partnerships and leverage funds, including those related to mitigation banking.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

 	II.1.a	Pursue opportunities to use restoration and creation to benefit habitats, especially on an ecosystem basis; including mitigation banking agreements. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	II.1.b	Identify and develop creative funding mechanisms to support restoration and creation activities.<STRONG> (N)</STRONG><P>

	II.1.c	Evaluate and improve existing agreements and seek new agreements that will increase effectiveness. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	II.1.d	Initiate discussions with resource managers to incorporate restoration and creation goals into specific plans, e.g., fishery management plans and recovery plans, and individual decisions. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>
 
II.2. <STRONG>Focus the natural resource damage assessment process on habitat restoration.</STRONG><P>

Natural resource damage assessments (NRDA) provide the economic, ecological, and legal basis to restore public benefits lost when trust resources are degraded or lost.  These NRDAs are a vital component of NOAA's Damage Assessment and Restoration Program, which implements the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund).  The proposed emphasis on restoration requires a shift from a monetary value basis in damage claims to a system that also includes ecological improvements needed to restore affected resources and services.  This transition has been proposed in the OPA regulations but needs to be adopted throughout NOAA's NRDA activities.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	II.2.a	Develop NRDA case selection criteria to ensure decisions are based on full consideration of resource restoration feasibility, ecological/economic value, and cost factors. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	II.2.b	Increase participation by NMFS regional office and science center laboratory staff in NRDA activities. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	II.2.c	Conduct pilot projects to evaluate alternative restoration and creation options, as appropriate. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

II.3. <STRONG>Use NRDA actions to enhance state restoration expertise.
</STRONG><P>
OPA and CERCLA encourage state/Federal cooperation to integrate natural resource damage claims.  These co-trustee relationships provide an opportunity to share the technical and administrative obligations of restoration.  NMFS often accepts a leadership role and now seeks to delegate a portion of its caseload to its co-trustees.  These partnerships will improve overall program effectiveness and enable NMFS to pursue other cases.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:  <P>
       
	II.3.a	Develop guidance documents and criteria to facilitate habitat restoration. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	II.3.b	Facilitate information and technology transfer among co-trustees through support of regional workshops and demonstration projects. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	II.3.c	Support increased state participation for restoration project development, management oversight, and/or implementation. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

III. UNDERSTANDING<P>

The NMFS National Habitat Program represents a renewed commitment to understand habitat functions and values and to communicate that knowledge to others.  Habitat research is a high priority that will be pursued through the NOAA/NMFS science hierarchy and in full cooperation with all NMFS programs.<P>

Habitat degradation and loss are among the greatest long-term threats to living marine resources.  To address those threats new research and syntheses of available information must form the basis of ecologically-based, defensible management decisions.  The agency's strong scientific program can contribute to that effort, and can help the agency pursue partnerships with colleagues in NOAA and elsewhere.  The best scientific information must be communicated to partners in the public and private sectors so NOAA/NMFS can pursue its habitat management and research objectives.  <P>

<STRONG>Research Background and Findings:</STRONG><P>

NMFS has always had a strong research program, recognized both nationally and internationally.  However, habitat research has never been a high priority, been adequately funded, or been organized as a national program.  The result has been scientifically-sound investigations that do not always address all NMFS priorities, such as habitat issues.  The habitat research component of that program needs to be accorded a higher priority and supported with adequate funding.  This Plan provides the basis for a complete NMFS habitat research program, coupled with partners in NOAA and elsewhere.
A national structure for a habitat research program now exists in the National Habitat Program's research plan, which was approved in 1995 (Appendix 4).  The plan encompasses five areas of research needs, and represents our commitment to communicate our knowledge to others:<P>

 o 	Understand the structure and function of natural ecosystems, their linkages, and their role in supporting and sustaining the abundance, distribution, and health of living marine resources.<P>

 o	Quantify the response of habitats and living marine resources to natural and anthropogenic alterations.<P>

 o	Develop and evaluate new techniques to restore or create productive habitats of living marine resources.<P>

 o	Develop indicators to simplify determinations of habitat impacts to or recovery.<P>

 o 	Synthesize research and communicate findings to managers.<P>


<STRONG>Research Recommendations for Action:</STRONG><P>

III.1. <STRONG>Implement the NMFS Habitat Research Plan.
</STRONG><P>
The NMFS National Habitat Program has developed a Habitat Research Plan that provides the framework for research that will meet the changing needs of management.  The Office of Habitat Conservation will work with NMFS regions and headquarters offices to coordinate implementation.  Success will hinge on an appropriate reallocation of existing NMFS resources and acquisition of new funds, either directly within NOAA or indirectly through partnerships and leverage.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	III.1.a 	Designate a habitat research contact within each region. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	III.1.b	Adopt the NMFS Habitat Research Plan as a national framework for NMFS research. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.1.c	Extend the intent of the NMFS Habitat Research Plan to other NOAA elements (e.g., OAR, NOS, COP) and others (e.g., DOI/NBS, states). <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

III.2.<STRONG> Evaluate research programs and set management priorities.</STRONG><P>

The NMFS Science Center laboratories currently conduct research that meets some National Habitat Program priorities but other needs remain unfulfilled.  NMFS regional operations and science staffs will lead an effort involving headquarters to identify NMFS habitat research needs and to help meet those needs through NMFS research or externally through partnerships with other NOAA elements, academia, etc. <P>

Habitat management and research needs differ regionally.  Coordination must begin with a regional process designed to communicate habitat information needs and concerns among regional managers and researchers, to present research summaries, and to review funding sources (base and non-base).  The NMFS Southeast Region has developed a useful template for other regions or entire coasts.  Meeting results should be reviewed regularly.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	III.2.a	Inventory current habitat research activities in NMFS and elsewhere (especially NOAA). <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>
 
	III.2.b	Develop a process to set regional priorities for NMFS' habitat research funding. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.2.c	Pursue research and pursue partnerships to meet priority needs identified in III.2.b.  <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.2.d	Develop budget initiatives based on priority needs. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.2.e	Develop protocols for protection, conservation, restoration, and creation techniques designed for species and habitats. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.2.f	Develop guidelines to measure project performance and establish monitoring programs. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

III.3. <STRONG>Share research results, technology, and information with NMFS offices, partners, and constituents.</STRONG><P>

The research results and information developed through the actions in Section III.2 must be transferred to habitat managers.  This action step should also include lessons learned during demonstration projects.  The primary recipients should be NMFS program personnel but the information should prove useful to others.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	III.3.a	Establish a system to track technical and procedural findings and lessons learned; share data and publish results. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	III.3.b	Identify best management practices in agriculture, forestry, mining, etc. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

	III.3.c	Develop Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for the purpose of evaluating essential fish habitat, cumulative impacts, restoration initiatives, etc.; coordinate with Section IV.6.<STRONG> (M)</STRONG><P>
  
	III.3.d	Develop electronic means to transmit important research findings and data. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Outreach Background and Findings:</STRONG><P>


In cooperation with NMFS and NOAA efforts, the National Habitat Program plans a new outreach and communication program.  Our efforts will explain National Habitat Program intentions, share research results, and maintain regular communication with  partners, among other applications.  These efforts will support the entire National Habitat Program.  Activities which are directly related to the Understanding theme are included in this section.  Refer to Recommendation IV.5 for related actions.<P>

<STRONG>Outreach Recommendations for Action:</STRONG><P>
	
III.4. <STRONG>Develop synthesis documents.</STRONG><P>

Much of the information needed by NMFS habitat managers is available yet not packaged for decision makers.  Vital information has oftentimes not been analyzed for relevancy or evaluated for accuracy.  NMFS scientists can play a vital role in filling this void, either directly or in collaboration with partners.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:

	III.4.a	Identify information needs that could be met with a synthesis document. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	III.4.b	Convey those needs to the NMFS Office of Science and Technology and other partners. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

IV. OPERATIONS<P>

<STRONG>Background and Findings:</STRONG><P>

This section addresses the basic tools for program success.  Specific improvements are identified in Sections I, II, and III of this Plan; those that apply broadly are listed here. <P>

<STRONG>Recommendations for Action:</STRONG><P>

IV.1. <STRONG>Identify priority issues.</STRONG><P>

The condition of, and threats to, living marine resources and their habitats vary regionally.  NMFS has established a strategic planning process to set priorities for regional and headquarters activities.  The National Habitat Program will participate fully in this process.  <P>


This task will involve frequent contact with our constituents and partners.  Priorities will be revisited periodically as they will form the basis for budget and management decisions.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	IV.1.a	Set Program priorities in regional and headquarters implementation plans.<STRONG> (N) </STRONG><P>

	IV.1.b	Review priorities regularly, with annual checks to determine minor adjustments. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

IV.2.<STRONG> Develop a methodology to monitor program accomplishments.</STRONG><P>

The NMFS National Habitat Program contributes significantly to habitat efforts nationwide.  To document those contributions, NMFS is seeking the funds and technical assistance to develop measures of program performance and habitat health.  Once adopted, the tracking systems or reports will provide quantitative and qualitative measures of Program success and will help set priorities, allocate resources, and influence decisions.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	IV.2.a	Evaluate the effectiveness of NMFS National Habitat Program.  <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	IV.2.b	Select a monitoring methodology that provides quantitative and qualitative measures of program activity and success. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	IV.2.c	Implement the new performance measure in 
				FY 97. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	IV.2.d	Monitor implementation and adjust as necessary. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	IV.2.e	Report findings annually, beginning with FY 97 report in FY 98. <STRONG>(L)</STRONG><P>

IV.3.<STRONG> Seek necessary budget and staff.</STRONG><P>

Full implementation of all recommendations and each action will require additional budget and staff.  Program priorities will be established, but many mid- (M) and long-term (L) needs will require increased support or reordered NMFS priorities.  Those facts must be highlighted in NOAA's and NMFS' Strategic Plans and reflected in budget initiatives.  Some actions can proceed immediately but many must await new staff or increased budgets.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	IV.3.a	Identify unfunded, high-priority activities, and rank them at the regional and national level.<STRONG> (N)</STRONG><P>

	IV.3.b	Quantify the resources needed to support each activity, and whether resources exist that may be reallocated or whether new resources must be obtained. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	IV.3.c	Evaluate all activities and establish a long-term implementation schedule; incorporate results into budget allocation processes and NOAA and NMFS Strategic Plan elements. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

IV.4. <STRONG>Develop an outreach/communication plan</STRONG><P>

The agency's information exchange efforts include sharing research results, explaining National Habitat Program intentions and the importance to habitat, and maintaining regular communication with partners.  This dialogue is essential to establish priorities, encourage partnerships, and announce successes.  The Program will emphasize opportunities offering the greatest benefits.  Limited resources will require a very focussed outreach effort, e.g., sharing program priorities with potential partners or ensuring that basic ecological research results are provided to Councils and Commissions working with NMFS to identify essential fish habitats.  Our objectives include building support, inspiring partnerships, leveraging resources, and using those rewards to strengthen the Program.  It is imperative that a cohesive, aggressive communication effort be established as an important vehicle for implementing this Plan.<P>

This effort supports the NMFS Customer Service and Public Outreach Policy.  By coordinating with the NMFS campaign we will strengthen our effort and improve the prospects of success.<P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>

	IV.4.a	Designate a coordinator in the Office of Habitat Conservation and a liaison in each NMFS' regional office. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

	IV.4.b	Identify priority needs and opportunities. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

	IV.4.c	Review successful outreach strategies to select a NMFS' strategy to promote habitat awareness. <STRONG>(N) </STRONG><P>

	IV.4.d	Develop an Outreach Plan with partnerships, funding sources, milestones, educational and informational products, and a mechanism for periodic reviews. <STRONG>(N)</STRONG><P>

IV.5.<STRONG> Evaluate opportunities to employ new technologies.</STRONG><P>

With opportunities exceeding our staff and fiscal capabilities, the NMFS National Habitat Program must consider computer systems, emerging technologies, and other tools that will increase overall efficiency and success.  This need is affirmed in Section III.3 above with respect to research, but the need extends throughout the National Habitat Program.  One potential tool might be data manipulation software such as geographic information systems that could provide visual displays of the relationship among human activities, habitat health, and trust resources.  Other opportunities could include modeling to link changes in land cover to water quality and effects on living marine resources, using National Weather Service hydrographic data to influence water allocations affecting anadromous fish, and using bibliographic search programs to supplement our information collection and synthesis activities.  <P>

Accordingly, NMFS will:<P>


	IV.5.a	Survey opportunities to improve our overall effectiveness and efficiency. <STRONG>(M) </STRONG><P>

	IV.5.b	Develop priorities and seek partnerships or funding. <STRONG>(M)</STRONG><P>

<CENTER>	ABSTRACT</CENTER><P>

A responsibility of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is to develop the necessary understanding, using basic and applied research and literature syntheses, to help conserve, protect, and restore habitats of living marine resources.  The NMFS National Habitat Program has developed a Habitat Research Plan to direct and conduct research and transfer results to management components within NMFS involved in permit reviews, development of the habitat sections of Fishery Management Plans and protected species Recovery Plans, and development of restoration options and plans as part of the Natural Resources Damage Assessment claims.  The plan also is designed to develop the necessary expertise to accomplish or oversee the restoration, creation, or acquisition of habitat to benefit living marine resources.   This plan provides guidance in four areas -- ecosystem structure and function, effects of alterations, development of restoration methods, and development of indicators of impact and recovery.  The plan emphasizes a fifth area -- the need for syntheses and timely scientific information to managers.  The plan is designed not only as an umbrella document under which to organize habitat research within NMFS but also as a guide that can and will be modified as habitat issues and/or responsibilities change.<P>

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is the principal steward of living marine resources (LMRs) in the U.S.  Resource viability depends in part on habitat protection, maintenance, and restoration.   Habitat loss to pollution and development is among the greatest long-term threats to the future viability of U.S. Fisheries (Burns, 1991; Brouha, 1993; Waste, 1996).   NMFS has established a National Habitat Program whose goal is to conserve, protect, and restore the valuable habitats needed to sustain marine and anadromous communities.  In the past, the conservation, protection, and restoration of habitat has been accomplished by reviewing licensing, permitting, and legislative and administrative activities that affect LMR and habitats; coordinating with Regional Fishery Management Councils on Fishery Management Plans; and conducting habitat-related research.  In the context of this plan, we are using habitat to include not only the physical, chemical, and biological environment of an organism but also the processes that are going on within that environment.<P>

NMFS is restructuring the National Habitat Program to meet current and evolving demands and responsibilities relative to managing habitats and fisheries and protecting threatened and endangered species in coastal and estuarine areas.  NMFS has created a coordinated research guidance plan and approach to support its habitat-related mandates as part of the program.  The Habitat Research Plan (HRP) was developed with input from scientific and management personnel at both headquarters and field levels. The plan (1) provides a framework to conduct coastal and estuarine research and transfer results to those management components involved in permit reviews, development of the habitat sections of Fishery Management Plans and protected species Recovery Plans, and development of restoration options and plans as part of the Natural Resources Damage Claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Oil Pollution Act; and the Clean Water Act; and (2) will lead to development of the necessary expertise within NMFS to identify habitat impacts and accomplish and oversee the restoration, creation, or acquisition of habitat to benefit LMRs.  This paper briefly describes the agency's HRP. <P>

	<CENTER>BACKGROUND</CENTER><P>

Numerous statutes and international conventions and treaties authorize the NMFS mission related to the conservation and restoration of marine habitat.  These include but are not limited to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( Superfund"), and Oil Pollution Act (Waste, 1996)).  These laws and policies foster conservation of LMRs and their habitats to benefit society without jeopardizing options for the future.<P>

NMFS is highly cognizant of the delicate balance between conservation, protection and utilization of living marine resources for the benefit of society.  Indeed, one principal goal of the  NMFS Strategic Plan is to "protect LMR habitat" using the following four objectives:<P>

		(1)  Use legal authority to implement a cohesive strategy to protect and restore habitat.<P>
		(2)  Assess effects of habitat modifications and contaminants on populations of LMRs.<P>
		(3)  Determine if artificial or restored habitats fulfill essential needs of LMRs. <P>
		(4)  Restore depleted stocks affected by habitat modifications.<P>

Living marine resources contribute substantially to the U.S. economy.  More than 70% of the commercial fish (by weight) harvested in the United States -- worth $19.8 billion (in value added) to Gross National Product in 1993 (U.S. Department of Commerce 1994) -- depend on coastal, estuarine, and riverine habitat for food, shelter, spawning, and migration (NMFS 1994; Waste 1996).  Even in the mid-60s the value of estuarine dependent fishes to our commercial landings was recognized as important, representing nearly two-thirds the value of landings nationally (McHugh, 1966).  These habitats also support two-thirds of U.S. recreational fishing which generated approximately $13.5 billion (NMFS 1995). In addition, aquaculture of marine species in coastal waters is expanding rapidly and totalled $242 million in 1992 (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1994).  LMRs also contribute significantly to the subsistence of many individuals and families.  The potential contribution of LMRs in the future is even greater as overfished stocks are rebuilt, habitats restored, and threatened and endangered species recover.<P>

Habitat loss from pollution and development threatens the future viability of fisheries in the United States (Burns, 1991; Brouha, 1993) and poses a major national challenge.  As human populations in coastal regions grow, LMRs are exposed to increasing pressure from toxic contaminants, excess nutrients, altered freshwater flow, and loss of habitat structure and biological diversity (Thomas, 1995).  Toxic compounds in agricultural runoff and industrial effluents contaminate habitats and cause pathologies in fish and shellfish.  Excess nutrients in runoff cause eutrophication, and turbidity from erosion and development suppresses production of phytoplankton and submerged vegetation.  Even boating can result in long-lasting damage to critical habitats as a result of propeller scour in submerged aquatic vegetation (Sargent et al. 1995) and anchoring on coral reefs.  Alteration of freshwater flow regimes by withdrawals, diversions, or poor land-use practices reduces or degrades riverine habitat and increases salt intrusions into estuaries (Thayer, 1992).<P>

The continental United States has lost half of its original coastal wetlands by water diversions, draining, and filling (Dahl, 1990) and estimates of these losses has been published by Dahl and Johnson (1991), Tiner (1991), and Frayer et al. (1983).  Habitat loss and degradation, along with overharvesting and climate change, are the principal causes for declining resources (e.g., Boreman, J. Personal communication, NOAA Cooperative Marine Education and Research Program, Univ. MA, Amherst).  Because pre-recruitment stages (eggs, larvae, and juveniles) and estuarine-derived forage species are dependent on the coastal zone, both nearshore and resident offshore species can be harmed by degraded shallow coastal and estuarine habitats (Hoss and Thayer, 1993).  Population declines include marine and aquatic mammals (e.g., Gulf of California harbor porpoise and manatee), turtles (e.g., loggerhead, Kemp's ridley and green), anadromous fish (e.g., salmon, striped bass, sturgeon, river herring and American shad), and estuarine shellfish (e.g., oysters).  While these declines are due to a combination of effects, clearly the impact of habitat degradation is greatest in the coastal region where dramatic increases in human population and attendant activities have and are taking place.  As pointed out by Thomas (1995), it is likely that many of the changes in upland land use and cover have initiated or exacerbated estuarine and coastal habitat degradation.  More than half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of the coast, and nationally coastal communities have the highest rates of growth (U. S. Department of Commerce 1991).  Current projections for U. S. population in the coastal zone suggest that even greater losses of critical habitat and LMRs are likely to occur as competition for limited space and resources increases. <P>

	<CENTER>THE APPROACH</CENTER><P>

To protect, conserve, and restore aquatic habitats, NMFS has developed a Habitat Research Plan (HRP) that will systematically guide its research on ecosystem function and linkages to improve scientific understanding and decision-making capability.  NMFS emphasizes the collecting and synthesizing of the type of information that will increase its ability to develop and implement management policies.  To fully implement the plan requires: (1) a more complete description of the structural and functional aspects of ecosystems; (2) a more integrative approach to understanding the relationship among natural, impacted, restored, or created habitats and LMR;  and (3) greater knowledge of the responses of habitats and LMR to natural and anthropogenic impacts.<P>

The Habitat Research Plan provides an overarching research structure that combines basic and applied research with information syntheses on which to base landscape-level habitat management decisions.  The concept of landscape ecology includes consideration of fluxes of organisms, materials, and energy within the spatial heterogeneity of the surrounding area (Pickett and Cadenasso, 1995).  As pointed out by Pickett and Cadenasso (1995; p. 334) "...the spatial heterogeneity in ecological systems at various scales often influences important functions, ranging from population structure through composition to ecosystem processes...."  To ensure that the HRP is broad-based and is responsive to national and regional issues, the plan includes recommendations from NMFS scientists and managers, as well as recommendations from other federal and state agencies and private industries given during a series of NMFS-sponsored habitat workshops held in 1995.<P>

The HRP outlines a systematic approach in five areas (Figure 1).  The approach provides a coordinated research program with a foundation in basic ecological research and an agenda of applied research that is responsive to the changing needs of management.  Syntheses of research findings and information transfer are key elements of this plan.  NMFS research program staff will work closely with other NOAA programs, including the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, Coastal Ocean Program, Coastal Services Center (Charleston, SC), and National Sea Grant Program, to meet NOAA's goals, particularly with respect to the NOAA Strategic Plan element on Healthy Coastal Ecosystems (NOAA, 1995).  NMFS will work closely with other federal agencies to increase cooperation and partnerships, maximize research information, and reduce potential duplication of research efforts.  Funds for this research program will come from a combination of base funds and extramural support.<P>

Research Areas
<P>
Area (1): Ecosystem Structure and Function<P>

Understanding the structure and function of natural ecosystems, their linkages to one another, and the role they play in supporting and sustaining LMRs -- their abundance, distribution, and health--is critical.  Knowing when and how systems are affected, assessing the cause and degree of impact, and providing the basis for restoring and maintaining these systems are integral to this research area, and must be evaluated in terms of landscape ecology.  Research on ecosystem structure and function will provide the necessary foundation for linking all areas of the HRP (Figure 1) and will provide the basis for making fundamentally sound management decisions.  Thus, assessing habitat impacts, developing restoration methods and evaluating restoration effectiveness, developing indicators of impact and recovery, and synthesizing and transferring information for the development of management policy and regulations all are dependent on a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning.<P>

Research in this area will include studies on the relationship between habitat and yield of LMR including seasonality and annual variabilities and the influence of chemical and physical fluxes on these relationships.  These research efforts will be dependent upon knowledge of basic life histories, habitat structural integrity and limiting factors, and must be evaluated within the context of habitat mosaics or habitat heterogeneity.  Therefore, data on habitat location are integral to this research area.  Information generated in this research area provides a foundation upon which to make predictions regarding responses of organisms and habitats to perturbations and also predictions of trajectories of recovery or success of restoration, for example.<P>

Area (2): Effects of Habitat Alterations	<P>

Knowledge of the causes of observed harm to ecosystems is critical to restoring past losses and preventing future degradation and loss of habitats essential for maintaining and enhancing LMRs.  Therefore, quantifying of the response of habitats and LMRs to natural and anthropogenic alterations is not only a prerequisite to determining the degree of impact, predicting the rate of recovery, and recommending the most effective restoration procedures, but it also is a requisite to establishing effective protective measures.<P>

The basis for determining causal relationships depends on an understanding of the natural structure and function of an ecosystem and individual LMR requirements and population characteristics.  While NMFS is primarily interested in the maintaining and restoring LMR populations, relating impacts observed at the individual level to effects at the population level has proved difficult.  Thus, there is a need to link habitat impacts ultimately to LMR populations.<P>

Studies emphasized will include cause and effect research designed to evaluate responses of LMR and habitats to physical and chemical modifications of coastal and estuarine systems.  Research will be encouraged that considers downstream responses to upland modification and role of buffers zones, as well as LMR and habitat responses to physical and waterflow alterations and water quality modifications.  Because information will be generated on responses to both individual and cumulative impacts, these studies will provide the basis for guidelines and regulations to protect habitats and develop remedial cleanup standards.  These cause and effect databases will furnish information pertinent not only to permit-related activities, but also to NMFS mandated responsibilities in restoration planning and implementation.  <P>


Area (3): Habitat Restoration Methods<P>

While methods for restoring certain habitats (e.g., salt marshes and seagrass meadows) exist, most have not been rigorously tested under experimental conditions throughout wide geographic areas and at different scales (see Kusler and Kentula 1989,  Cairns 1990, Thayer 1992).  Additionally, for other habitats (e.g., coral reefs, intertidal and subtidal substrates, riparian habitat) only limited methodology exists and little emphasis has been placed on rapidly restoring biodiversity and monitoring for success and persistence.  Consequently, scientists have viewed a significant proportion of restoration actions with skepticism regarding their success and rates of habitat recovery or development.   Current methods to cleanup, restore, or create productive LMR habitats must be improved, and new, innovative techniques must be developed and evaluated using statistically rigorous approaches.  <P>

Research topics and areas of concern include analyses of the success of contaminant sequestration; assessment of bioremediation techniques; development and evaluation of new habitat restoration techniques; experiments on transplant species culture techniques; and evaluation of the role and size of buffers and the importance of habitat heterogeneity in the restoration process.  Research on restoration will lead to scientific information on trajectories of recovery and stability of created and restored systems including physical, chemical and biological components and processes.  Assessments of new techniques and evaluation of current techniques over geographic regions and scales will provide bases for success evaluation.  Most importantly, guidelines for improved best management practices and improved restoration planning will be generated. <P>

Area (4): Indicators of Habitat/LMR Impacts and Recovery<P>

Increasing and extensive exploitation of coastal resources demands that indicators be used to simplify the process of determining whether an ecosystem, habitat, or LMR is affected, or is recovering.  Developing indicators of impacts and recovery is critical for managers judging the "health" status of a habitat or LMR and the need for corrective actions.  Such development must be based on information from comparative research on the structure and function of disturbed, natural, and/or restored habitats.  Ideally, habitats of differing ages and geographic locations should be evaluated for a suite of biological, chemical, and physical parameters.  Time-dependent biotic population analyses and contaminant-level follow-up evaluations for sediment, biota, and water will be encouraged.  This type of research will help managers identify habitat status or "health"; standardize indicators for specific habitats through comparisons across geographic gradients and scales; and develop recommendations on the temporal efficacy of chemical cleanup techniques and most appropriate measures to assess success.  NMFS will utilize such guideposts to develop and improve best management practice approaches.<P>

Area (5): Synthesis and Information Transfer<P>

The synthesis and timely transfer of information derived from research findings and the existing literature is a key element of NMFS's National Habitat Program and this HRP.  Decisions on permitting, regulation, enforcement, redirection of research efforts, and development and implementation of restoration plans must be made with the best available information.  Scientists must step back from their research long enough to provide timely information syntheses to habitat managers.  Likewise, NMFS habitat managers must recognize that generic information generated by the scientific community does have powerful application to their site-specific problems. <P>

Technology and information transfer will be expedited through the use of all available information sources and the application of user-friendly information bases.  Geographical Information Systems (GIST) provide the opportunity to amass and array large quantities of complex data, thereby, providing potential for relational observations by decision-makers; such use is strongly encouraged.  Many areas of synthesis and transfer have been indicated in our brief presentations of the earlier four research areas and will not be repeated here.  Additional examples include information syntheses on critical fishery habitats and modes of protection and restoration, development and testing of economic valuation approaches for ecological systems, and synthesis of available information on landscape approaches to basinwide management including permitting and restoration.  Such collations of current and evolving information bases are important to Fishery Management Councils and those charged with the protection and recovery of certain species as well as to habitat managers concerned about developing and implementing policy.  These syntheses could be done within NMFS, through partnerships with other agencies, and by contract.  However, it is important that syntheses be provided in a useable format and even published in outlets available to both scientific and management communities.  The scientific community must participate in the synthesis and transfer process.<P>

<CENTER>	IMPLEMENTATION</CENTER><P>

The HRP is divided into five interlinked areas and several elements (Figure 1) that provide a framework for the type of research and continuity needed to effectively manage LMR habitat.  In some instances this linkage between research areas may be hierarchical.  As we discussed earlier in this paper, research on ecosystem structure and function (Area 1) provides the foundation for linking all areas.  For example, knowledge of the structure and function of the ecosystem must be known before one can actually determine the effects of habitat alterations (Area 2), develop restoration methods (Area 3), or develop indicators of impact and recovery (Area 4).  There are feedbacks among these areas.  As pointed out by Root and Schneider (1995:337) research "... across scales of the interactions within and between the biotic and abiotic effects of disturbances are ... required for system-level understanding and impact assessments."  Elements shown for each research area in Figure 1 may vary by region, but they depict the stages and continuity of information required to develop a comprehensive database for making important resource decisions.  Research founded on this approach will provide NMFS with a broad information base that is scientifically and ecologically credible, national in scope, and responsive to management needs.<P>

The NMFS has not had a definitive habitat research guidance document under which to organize its habitat research activities and to use in developing mutually beneficial partnerships with state and other federal habitat management entities.  However, the agency has funded habitat research, and during the 1995 fiscal year the NMFS budget for habitat research was $7.9 million (FY 1995 Appropriations); funding requested for FY 1996 was $8.4 million (FY 1996 Conference Report level) and funding requested for FY 1997 is $11,9 million (President's FY 1997 budget request).  The habitat research projects being carried out have and continue to address management information needs and researchers have received national and international recognition.  A goal of the NMFS, in addition to forming increased partnerships with federal and state agencies and academia, is to at least double the habitat research funding requested for FY 1997 over the next 5 years.<P>

The HRP described herein is now being used to form underpinnings to organize ongoing and future habitat research within the agency, to identify research gaps relative to management needs, and as a basis for organizing budget funding initiatives and partnerships to address habitat issues.  These issues are increasing, not decreasing, as the coasts continue to develop, and habitat issues are receiving national attention from the press, the recreational and commercial fishing communities and the general public.  By the end of 1996 the ongoing and newly proposed habitat research within the agency will be collated by the NMFS Habitat Conservation Office among the five focal areas of the HRP.  As we point out above, aspects of the research plan already are underway and a synthesis will be available this calendar year.  Specific new research activities and directions will be stages as new funding initiatives occur, but a goal is to have integrated programs within and across the focal areas.  As noted by Waste (1996:29) for the NMFS National Habitat Program of which this Habitat Research Plan is a Part: "...many factors beyond the control of NMFS will influence program implementation: budget constraints, personnel limitations, and redirections in policy by the Clinton administration or Congress.  Nevertheless, the new NMFS National Habitat Program [and likewise this Habitat Research Plan] is striving to focus staff, budget, and priorities to make the greatest positive difference in sustaining living marine resources and their habitats."  A holistic and integrated research effort is critical to this achievement, and will produce information that can be used to address a variety of needs to fisheries, protected resources, and habitat issues.<P>

Magnuson Act Provisions; Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments.<P>
<P>

SUMMARY: NMFS is in the process of developing guidelines, by regulation, to implement the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), as mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act. These guidelines would assist Fishery Management Councils (Councils) in the description and identification of essential fish habitat (EFH), including adverse impacts on EFH, in fishery management plans (FMPs) and in the consideration of actions to conserve and enhance EFH. NMFS invites interested persons to submit written comments, information, and suggestions on all aspects of the EFH mandate. Comments from Councils, interstate fishery management commissions, state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing interests, environmental groups, and other interested parties are of particular interest.<P>
<P>
DATES: Written comments must be received on or before December 9, 1996.<p>
ADDRESS: Comments should be sent to the Director, Office of Habitat Conservation, Attention: EFH, National Marine Fisheries
Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD  20910-3282.<p>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee R. Crockett, 410-267-5672.<p>
<p>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS invites comments and information that will assist with the implementation of the new Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 <U>et seq</U>.)  mandates to: (1) Develop guidelines to assist Councils in the description and identification of EFH (including adverse impacts, and conservation and enhancement actions) for fisheries managed by any Council; (2) develop and provide information and recommendations to the Councils to assist in the identification of EFH in FMPs, adverse impacts to EFH (including adverse impacts from fishing), and actions to ensure the conservation and enhancement of EFH; and (3) recommend conservation and management measures for actions undertaken by any state or Federal agency that would adversely affect any EFH. NMFS is soliciting information on the habitat requirements, including the EFH, of fish species managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the distribution of those habitats. NMFS is also soliciting information on the threats to EFH (including threats from fishing activities), the distribution of those threats, ways to prevent or mitigate the adverse impacts of those threats, and ways to conserve and enhance EFH.<P>
<P>
Background<P>

     The Sustainable Fisheries Act, among other mandates, requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), acting through NMFS, to carry out a number of activities to describe, identify, conserve, and enhance EFH. Below is a summary of the new EFH mandates of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.<P>
<P>
<U><STRONG>Definition of EFH</STRONG></U><P>

     EFH is defined as "those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity."<P>
<P>
<U><STRONG>Contents of FMPs</STRONG></U><P>

     Several provisions were added to section (16 U.S.C. 1853(a)(7)) requiring that FMPs describe and identify EFH for the fishery based on guidelines established by the Secretary under section (16 U.S.C. 1855(b)(1)(A)). FMPs are also required to minimize the adverse effects on EFH caused by fishing, to the extent practicable. Finally, FMPs should identify other actions that encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH.  <P>
<P>

<U><STRONG>Actions by the Secretary</STRONG>
</U><P>






o  Develop guidelines, by regulation, to assist the Councils in the description and identification of EFH (including adverse impacts) in FMPs, and conservation and enhancement measures of such habitat, within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.<P>
<P>

     



o  Provide each Council, after consulting with the fishing industry, with recommendations and information regarding each fishery under that Council's authority to assist in the identification of EFH, adverse impacts to EFH, and actions to ensure conservation and enhancement of that habitat. <P>
<P>


   


o  Review programs administered by NMFS and ensure that any relevant programs further the conservation and enhancement of EFH.<P>
<P>




o  Provide information to other Federal agencies to further the conservation and enhancement of EFH.<P>
<P>


o  Recommend conservation measures for any action undertaken by any state or Federal agency that would adversely affect any EFH.<P>
<P>
<U><STRONG>Actions by the Councils</STRONG></U><P>

o  The Councils are required to submit FMP amendments to the Secretary to implement the EFH and other new FMP requirements not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.<P>
<P>

o  Councils may comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary and any Federal or state agency concerning any activity, or proposed activity, authorized, funded, or undertaken by any Federal or state agency that may affect the habitat, including EFH, of a fishery under its authority.<P>
<P>

o  The Councils must comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary and any Federal or state agency concerning an activity that is likely to substantially affect the habitat, including EFH, of an anadromous fishery resource.<P>
<P>
<U><STRONG>Actions Required of Other Federal Agencies</STRONG></U><P>

o  Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary with respect to any activity, or proposed activity, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency that may adversely impact EFH.<P>
<P>

o  Within 30 days of receipt of a recommendation, Federal agencies are required to provide the Secretary and any Council that comments on an activity, or proposed activity, with a written description of the measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting the
 impact of the activity on EFH. If this response is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Secretary, the agency must explain that inconsistency.<P>

<title>Northwest Constituent Meeting - Seattle, WA</title>
</head><center><H4>Northwest Constituent Meeting</H4>
<H4>Seattle, Washington </H4>
<H4>November 8, 1996</H4></center>

<HR>
The meeting was attended by 9 people.  Comments received on the Strategic Plan are recorded below by Goal.  The agreement/disagreement with comments is the number of attendees that indicated strong agreement (green card) or strong disagreement (red card) with a comment made.
<HR>

<H4>GOAL 1: SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES</H4>
<P>
1.	Support Objective 2 particularly because it also protects habitat. [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
2.	The objectives are wonderful, but how are they going to be achieved - where is the funding coming from?.
<P>
3.	1.2 - This measure is confusing/obscure.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
4.	Sustainable to whom? (Human vs. Non-human).  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
5.	4. 1 - Does NMFS understand species interactions sufficiently to achieve this objective.  Does the measure take into account competition with other species?  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
6.	4.2 - This needs to stated stronger in terms of adverse impacts to other species (e.g., ecological competition with other species, biodiversity, etc.).  How will adverse impacts be prevented (e.g., disease, genetics, habitat competition).  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
7.	Change Objective 3  - add after marine resources "without ignoring all other native species" (both wildlife and fish).  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
8.	2.1 - The measure should be to eliminate overfishing (put period after overfishing), not just on overfished stocks.  Current wording could allow fishing to occur until a stock is overfished before action is taken.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
9.	2.1 - Does NMFS have the science to define threshold?  Does science exist to determine when a stock is approaching overfishing, rather than reacting after a stock is overfished?
<P>
10.	Objective 4 - Where is the hatchery production discussion?  Needs to be somewhere especially regarding the need to prevent hatchery fish from impacting native fish.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
11.	Objective 4 - It is unclear how advancing aquaculture fits in with sustainable fisheries production.  [3 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
12.	3.1 - OY inclusive of MSY is not viable for sustainable fisheries.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
13.	3.4 - Is this limited to the EEZ (NMFS jurisdiction) or does it apply to any recreational fishery (e.g., inland freshwater systems)?
<P>
14.	Under strategic approaches to Objective 4 - What is NMFS role in state waters (relative to its role in EEZ)?  Does this objective only apply to EEZ, or does NMFS have authority regarding aquaculture in non-federal jurisdiction (i.e., inside waters where most aquaculture occurs)?
<P>
15.	3.5 - Need to recognize that there may be other legal obligations that also apply.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
16.	3.3 - Ensure stewardship goes along with the research (e.g., there has been new gear research that led to increased fishing effort on a resource).  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
17.	4.1 - Change "ensure" to "support".  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
18.	1.2 - Wording is poor - need to clarify what is being reduced.  Is it the assessment uncertainty that is reduced? 
<P>
19.	4.2 - The measure should be modified to include a requirement that remediation be considered for adverse impacts (i.e., getting rid of non-indigenous species that escape into the ecosystem, such as the Atlantic salmon that escaped into Puget Sound).
<P>
20.	3.2 - Constituents need more information on the results of prior buyback programs in order to comment effectively on recommended measures to reduce fishing effort.  Did buybacks have an impact - were they effective?

<HR>
<H4>GOAL 2:  RECOVERED PROTECTED SPECIES</H4>
<P>
21.	At what point do you allow take?  At what point do you allow a species to go extinct?  These aspects need to be addressed in the objectives and performance measures.  [1 of 9 DISAGREE]
<P>
22.	NMFS should not attempt to establish minimal guidelines or minimal levels for undertaking the recovery of protected species (e.g., even though there may have been only one Redfish Lake sockeye remaining, the stock needed to be recovered and not allowed to go extinct).  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
23.	1.2 - This measure should be stated more strongly, NMFS should reverse the decline of all protected species (avoid mediocrity).  Don't strive only for slowing.  (Note: when it was pointed-out that some marine mammal populations, which are protected species, are not declining, the commenter clarified that the comment applied to listed species and asked why marine mammals were included in this since it confused the issue)  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
24.	Need to differentiate between marine mammals and ESA listed species; having protected species apply to both is confusing and misleading.  [3 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
25.	1.3 - Need stronger discussion of partnerships with other federal agencies, states, tribes, etc.  This is especially important in development and implementation of recovery plans.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
26.	1.1 - Need to recognize that some marine mammal populations have had an unnatural extension of their range and "maintaining" should be directed at their natural/normal range.  Maintaining marine mammal populations beyond their historic abundance and range will impact anadromous fish.
<P>
27.	Page 12 paragraph 1 last sentence - Reference should not be to "sustainable take" but to "sustainable populations".  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
28.	1.3 - Add ... "and identify other human caused threats to recovery"...  NMFS should strive to reduce all threats, not just those that are known.
<P>
29.	1.3  - Change "decrease over" to "decrease from" 1996 levels.
<P>
30.	Objective 2 - Add a performance measure that addresses the impacts of attempting to recover one species at the expense of other species.  Need to acknowledge that there are negative impacts of protecting one species over another (e.g., protecting anadromous fish to the detriment of resident fish).
<P>
31.	Objective 2 - What are the conflicts; are they social conflicts associated with ESA implementation or conflicts between species.  Social and biological conflicts should be separate objectives.  [1 of 9 AGREE]

<HR>
<H4>GOAL 3:  HEALTHY COASTS</H4>
<P>
32.	Change the wording of Objective 1 - Protect restore ... habitat and ecosystem processes to realize no net loss of these on a regional basis.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
33.	Objective 1 - What is "vital living"?
<P>
34.	The agency should strive for this goal in all of its activities.  Goal 3 should be incorporated in the other goals.
<P>
35.	Even though habitat overlays the other goals, it should be retained as a separate goal to emphasize its importance.  Habitat is part of the "why" not just the "how".
<P>
36.	Make habitat Goal 1 in order of priority.  Habitat goal should be a higher priority than the other goals.
<P>
58.	Add another performance measure to Objective 1 - Participate in all FERC licensing activities where living marine resources or their habitat are affected.
<P>
37.	More emphasis should be placed on linking habitat research with models on climate, atmosphere and oceans.  Need to improve linkages within NOAA sciences.
<P>
54.	Add another performance measure under Objective 1 - "NMFS will shift all recovery plans and biological opinions to an ecosystem based approach".
<P>
62.	Change Objective 1 to read - "Protect, restore and create vital habitat supporting living marine resources to ...."

<HR>
<H4>FOUNDATIONS FOR STEWARDSHIP</H4>
<P>
38.	Add a performance measure to Objective 2 - Improve communications with other federal and state agencies. 
<P>
66.	Objective 2 - Need to clarify if it is external to government or external to NMFS.
<P>
39.	Add a performance measure to Objective 2 - Improve consultations with other sovereigns.
<P>
40.	Objectives 2 and 3 - NMFS should disseminate information on successful programs (e.g., ban on drift nets), not just individual incidents.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
41.	1.7 - What does this mean?
<P>
42.	Add a performance measure to Objective 3 - Synergistic coordination of at-sea and shoreside enforcement.  Closer coordination is needed by shoreside and at-sea enforcement because these efforts should be complimentary.
<P>
43.	3.4 - Strongly support the use of vessel monitoring system as a resource for enhancing enforcement. 
<P>
44.	1.3 - Avoid institutional conflicts of interest.  Ensure agency is on the same page. 
<P>
45.	1.1 and 1.8 - Should be done as interdisciplinary approach.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
46.	Objective 2 lists activities not outcomes.  It is inconsistent with the rest of the Plan. 
<P>
47.	Add another performance measure to Objective 1 - "Ensure that NOAA Fisheries Science furthers the goals of strategic plan".  Research should address priority needs, it should not be just research for the purpose of research.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
48.	3.5 - End the performance measure at "prosecutions".  The rest of the measure is a list of activities.
<P>
49.	3.6 - More comprehensible and simplified regulations will automatically improve compliance.  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
50.	3.6 - More comprehensible and simple regulations along with a WHY statement (why necessary/important) will facilitate compliance.
<P>
51.	1.6  - NMFS should use fishing vessels (working with industry) to supplement its capability for fisheries research.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
52.	4.3 - Strongly support delegating authority and uniform/consistent policies (1st two sentences in description of this measure).
<P>
53.	Add another performance measure to Objective 1 - "Provide a forum for open discussion of what will contribute to improved fisheries science and its linkages to other science and habitat".  [1 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
66.	4.2 - Need to emphasize partnerships in achieving improved information systems with States, tribes and other federal agencies.

<HR>
<H4>Other Comments</H4>
<P>
55.	Look to other agencies for what's been done.  Use outreach to avoid re-inventing the wheel (i.e., re-doing research already done by other agencies).  An interdisciplinary approach with other agencies should be a goal.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
56.	In the 6th paragraph under the Mission Statement -  add "consultations" to discussion on line 5.
<P>
57.	The Plan needs to address strategies to get the necessary resources.  Need to add an element to the Plan on the strategic approaches on reducing barriers to getting job done, getting needed funding, and getting authority to undertake all of the objectives.  [2 of 9 AGREE]
<P>
59.	What is the difference between NOAA Fisheries and NMFS?  The terms are used in different places - is there some implied difference?
<P>
60.	What is NMFS jurisdiction - is it only the EEZ?  The introduction to the Strategic Plan should clarify what/where is NMFS jurisdiction geographically.
<P>
61.	Partnering with other federal agencies and the States and tribes to achieve the objectives needs to be stated and emphasized throughout the Plan.
<P>
63.	The Plan needs to clearly state how it relates to NMFS budget.  How will the Plan be used to allocate/prioritize funding?  The absence of discussion on relationship to budget raises concerns and suspicions on the use of the Plan.
<P>
64.	How will the Plan be used to influence/leverage the budgets of other federal agencies that conduct/authorize activities that affect fishery resources (e.g., Army Corps of Engineers,  Bonneville Power Administration, Forest Service, etc.).
<P>
65.	The Plan lacks recognition that more effort in the habitat arena moves NMFS into the jurisdictions of many other entities, thus requiring more coordination, partnering, cooperation with States, tribes and other entities.

<P>
The La Jolla facility is located on 2.48 acres 220 feet above sea
level on a sandstone cliff in La Jolla, CA.  Originally part of
the adjacent Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the University
of California deeded the land of the federal government for as
long as the property of Scripps.  In addition to excellent
research facilities, the La Jolla lab houses a 9,300 sq. ft.
seawater aquarium.  Running seawater, which can be temperature
regulated, is available for the aquarium and selected labs.<P>
<P>
The La Jolla lab conducts an integrated, multidisciplinary
research program in biology, mathematics, oceanography, economics
and computer sciences.  Program activities are divided into the
Pelagic Fisheries Resources Division, the Fishery-Marine Mammal
Interactions Division, the Coastal Fisheries Resources Division,
and the recently organized Antarctic Ecosystem Research Group.<P>
<P>
The Pelagic Fisheries Resources Division: (1) collects,
processes, and disseminates tuna/large pelagics data from various
sources and tuna-dolphin observer data; (2) analyzes data and
provides biological advice on tuna/large pelagics in oceanic and
evaluates and simulates stock assessment models and techniques to
improve application for large pelagic resources; and (4) monitors
tropical tuna trade on a global scale to interpret and evaluate
statistics used to analyze stock condition.<P>
<P>
The Fishery-Marine Mammal Interactions Division: (1) conducts
fishery independent surveys to assess the biological impacts on
eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) dolphin resources resulting from
management actions taken by NMFS; (2) monitors trends in various
dolphin life history parameters, primarily ETP dolphin, to
determine stock status and trends; (3) analyzes tuna vessel
observer data to describe and quantify dolphin habitat to
establish indices of abundances; and (4) investigates changes in
coastal marine mammal populations associated with human
activities to determine status of stocks.<P>
<P>
The Coastal Fisheries Resources Division: (1) collects
information, develops methodologies, and evaluates techniques for
fishery independent assessments of coastal pelagics and
groundfish; (2) conducts studies on the distribution,
availability, and migration patterns of North Pacific albacore
and associated environmental influences; (3) investigates
fluctuations in abundance of fish stocks of the California
Current in relation to oceanographic flux and predator-prey
interactions; (4) collects ichthyoplankton samples to provide
basic information for annual stock assessments for California
coastal fisheries; (5) develops quantitative species and
environmental data related to California Current ecosystem; and
(6) assembles and analyzes biological and economics information
to support fishery management under the Magnuson Act.<P>
<P>
The Antarctic Ecosystem Research Group provides information to
formulate U.S. policy on the conservation and international of
resources living in the oceans surrounding Antarctica.  The
program was established by PL 98-623 to provide advice to the
U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources.<P>

The National Marine Fisheries Service's Restoration Center is the focal point for coastal and estuarine habitat restoration within NOAA. Its missions are to:<P>

	  Restore fish habitat and other living and non-living natural resources that have been injured by human activities;<P> 
	   Advance the science and technology of coastal habitat restoration; and<P>
	  Transfer restoration technology to the public, the private sector, and other governmental agencies.<P>

	
	The Restoration Center is a part of NOAA's Damage Assessment and Restoration Program (DARP).  Through DARP, NOAA claims damages for injuries to marine resources resulting from oil spills, hazardous releases, or other human-induced environmental disturbances.  Monetary awards from polluters and other responsible parties are used to "restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of" the injured resources. To date, this program has initiated restoration activities at over 25 sites around the country.<P>

	The Restoration Center also is working to stem the tide of wetland loss in the area where the nation is losing wetlands at the highest rate--coastal Louisiana. Under the Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act, NOAA and the State of Louisiana are engaged in a partnership to restore salt marshes lost to erosion, subsidence and hydrological alterations. As part of this program, the Restoration Center has been awarded ten projects to be carried out over a period of twenty years. When completed, these restorations will benefit over 40,000 acres of coastal wetlands.<P>    

The Restoration Center works with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve fisheries habitat at Corps project sites. Over the past four years, approximately six such  projects have been undertaken.<P>




The Restoration Center has demonstrated the effectiveness of habitat restoration for countering human impacts on the marine environment.  As with any emerging technology, much remains to be done. The Center is committed to continued development of the science and technology of coastal environmental restoration. For further information, please contact:<P>

<P>
ACTION:  Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; notice of availability of framework to describe and identify essential fish habitat; request for comments.<P>
<P>
SUMMARY:  NMFS has developed a framework for guidelines to implement the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), as mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act.  This framework will be expanded into guidelines, by regulation, that will assist Fishery Management Councils (Councils) in the description and identification of essential fish habitat (EFH), including adverse impacts on EFH, in fishery management plans (FMPs) and in the consideration of actions to conserve and enhance EFH.   An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published on November 8, 1996, soliciting comments to assist NMFS in developing this framework and eventually the guidelines by regulation.  NMFS now announces the availability of this framework and invites interested persons to submit written comments, information, and suggestions. <P>
<P> 
DATES:  Written comments must be received on or before February 12, 1997.<P>
<P>
ADDRESS:  Comments should be sent to the Director, Office of Habitat Conservation, Attention:  EFH, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD  20910-3282.  <P>

<P>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  NMFS invites comments and information to support efforts to implement the Magnuson-Stevens Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) mandate to develop guidelines by regulation to describe and identify EFH, including adverse impacts and conservation and enhancement actions, for fisheries managed by any Council or NMFS.  Specifically, NMFS is interested in receiving comments and information on:  (1) the proposed tiered approach to the description and identification of EFH; (2) the proposed approach to the identification of adverse impacts to EFH; (3) the use of geographic information systems to display EFH; (4) potential impacts of fishing on EFH and conservation and management measures to minimize or mitigate those impacts; (5) the proposed process for NMFS to provide EFH recommendations to the Councils; (6) the proposed process for Federal and state agencies to consult with NMFS on activities that may adversely impact EFH; (7) the proposed procedures for NMFS to provide EFH conservation recommendations to Federal and state agencies; (8) the proposed process for Councils to comment on Federal and state activities that may adversely affect EFH; and (9) the proposed process for NMFS and the Councils to coordinate consultations and recommendations.  NMFS also invites comments on which portions of the framework should be adopted by regulation.<P>
<P>
	Background and rationale were provided in the previous advance notice of proposed rulemaking (61 FR 57843,  November 8, 1996) and are not repeated here.

<STRONG>V.  Future Directions</STRONG><p>

Although there has been much progress from 1991 through 1993,
much remains to be done.  The loss of near shore ocean and
estuarine fishery habitat is one of the greatest long-term
threats to the productivity of U.S. marine fisheries.  These
losses and degradation of the remaining habitat are major factors
contributing to poor harvests, depletion, endangerment, and
extinction of living marine resources.  Managing the stocks and
promoting the recovery of endangered or depleted stocks is no
longer sufficient.  We must find additional ways to protect the
habitat of these marine resources more aggressively if they are
to survive.<P>

Based on the findings of recent reports from the Department of
Commerce's Office of the Inspector General (OIG), William
Chandler Associates, and the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation, OHP has undertaken the following actions.<P>

	o  Articulation of a new national direction for both the
     headquarters and field office,<P>

     o  Development of budget initiatives to obtain necessary
     resources for implementation of NMFS' mandated habitat
     authorities,<P>

     o  Pursuit of stronger legislative authority through
     amendments to existing statutes, improvement of existing
     memoranda of agreement by which issues are elevated from the
     field to Washington, D.C., and<P>

     o  Development of a national performance tracking system to
     document program accomplishments.<P>


     <STRONG>A.  Programmatic Alignment</STRONG><P>

In October 1992, NMFS created OHP.  This office will achieve
program recognition by filling the Director's position at the
Senior Executive Service level.  The Director will exercise
greater authority over the development of national habitat
protection policy and setting priorities over NMFS' headquarters
and regional program management activities.  The NMFS Restoration
Center will be transferred into OHP to ensure full integration of
habitat protection and restoration activities.  In addition, a
new Anadromous Fish Habitat Division has been created.  The
purpose of this Division is to position NMFS as a lead Federal
agency for protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Nation's
anadromous fish habitat.  The Division staff is also involved in
rulemaking, developing an NMFS anadromous fish habitat policy,
interacting with officials of the Departments of Agriculture and
Interior, and activities with Treaty tribes, states and private
interest groups.<P>

Efforts are underway to improve OHP's interaction with FERC. 
Meetings in 1993 have signaled the beginning of a new, improved
relationship with this agency.  FERC Commissioners have supported
increasing public and resource management agencies' involvement
in their activities.  FERC also has solicited public comment on
decommissioning old projects and the mitigation of cumulative
adverse impacts.  OHP and NMFS field offices will actively work
with FERC on these issues.<P>

Another important program area will be increased application of
habitat management by ecosystem (watershed).  The health of
coastal wetlands and oceans, as well as their biota, depends on
the water quality of the watersheds that feed them.  The entire
water system surrounding the site of possible or actual damage
must be considered because the cause of damage may be located
some distance away.  In coming years Habitat Protection field
staff and OHP will continue the development of protocols and fine
tune procedures to improve the techniques of ecosystem
management.  The Chesapeake Bay Program is essentially an ongoing
experiment in ecosystem management.  The Chesapeake Bay Office
successfully integrates NOAA's capabilities in a manner that
efforts can be transferred elsewhere.<P>


     <STRONG>B.  New National Direction</STRONG><P>

To establish a new national direction to the field offices, the
1983 Habitat Conservation Policy is being revised.  Development
of the new policy will involve NMFS headquarters, field offices,
other NOAA offices, MAFAC and other constituents.  Elements of
the policy will include: strong mandates to protect habitats of
living marine resources through active and effective fishery
habitat consultation; coordination between NMFS habitat research
and management activities; alliances with NMFS and the Regional
Fishery Management Councils; and encouragement for NMFS to meet
with permit applicants before they submit Federal license or
permit applications.  When completed, the policy will be
published in the Federal Register.<P>


     <STRONG>C.  Habitat Protection Legislative Initiatives</STRONG><P>

While the above-mentioned actions planned in the administrative,
policy and budget areas will greatly improve OHP activities
related to our ongoing mission and responsibilities, over the
long term a stronger NMFS habitat program will require changes in
our statutory mandates.  OHP has become involved in several
Administration initiatives seeking to improve existing
legislative authorities to address current and future
environmental issues.  OHP will build upon the following
activities to strengthen the legal basis for protecting living
marine resource habitats.<P>

<STRONG>Increase Habitat Protection Responsibilities and Authorities in
NMFS-Specific Legislation:</STRONG><P>
Under the reauthorization of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act, OHP is seeking changes to emphasize the importance
of marine, estuarine and aquatic habitats to commercial and
recreational fisheries.  This includes proposed amendments
requiring the formal identification of marine and estuarine fish
habitats that are essential to obtaining optimum fishery yields. 
OHP will continue to seek amendments to the Fish and Wildlife
Coordination Act that will augment the NMFS' existing consultative
role in the review of Federal actions.<P>


<STRONG>Broaden Habitat Protection Provisions in Other Key Environmental
Laws:</STRONG><P>
OHP will continue direct involvement with the reauthorization of
the Clean Water Act (CWA) through its Chesapeake Bay Office, which
represents NMFS on the Interagency CWA Working Group.  OHP's
headquarter's Habitat Policy and Management Division represents the
Department of Commerce on the White House's Interagency Working
Group on Federal Wetlands Policy and NMFS on the Interagency
Working Group on the Dredging Process.  This latter group will also
examine the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the
River and Harbor Act, and the Water Resources Development Act in
terms of enhancing its habitat protection provisions.<P>


<STRONG>Seek Greater Habitat Protection Emphasis in NOAA-Specific
Legislation:</STRONG><P>
OHP will continue to work with other NOAA elements in the creation
of legislation to protect coral reefs and associated ecosystems, in
both this country and internationally, under the Department of
State's U.S.  Coral Reef Initiative.  The l995 reauthorization of
the Coastal Zone Management Act will also provide opportunities to
expand Federal/state partnerships and improve the national mandates
in a number of areas including preserving important coastal
habitats and developing non-point source pollution control plans.<P>


    <STRONG> D.  Habitat Protection Budget Initiative</STRONG><P>

A multi-year budget plan for the Habitat Protection Program has
been developed in direct response to the OIG January 1994 Report on
the Office of Habitat Protection.  This budget initiative is
designed to meet the Administration's "no net loss" of wetlands
policy and mandated NMFS mission to provide more protection for
living marine resources.  This plan is being fully integrated into
NOAA's Strategic Plan.  The plan identifies five specific areas
that require enhancement of funding for NMFS to address the
declines in living marine resource habitats.<P>
<P>

<STRONG>Basic Habitat Protection Program:</STRONG><P>
Resources are being sought to augment Habitat Protection Program
activities aimed at an integrated approach to managing and
protecting the marine resources, watershed management and human
impacts.  NMFS will work to secure resources to support four
essential Habitat Protection Program activities.  Funds will be
provided for increases in quantity and quality of consultations on
Federal projects, permits and licenses with significant detrimental
effects on coastal ecosystems and biodiversity.  Increased
identification of habitat in Magnuson Act Fishery Management Plans
will be strongly encouraged.  Proactive participation in Coastal
America, the National Estuary Program and any new Clean Water Act
watershed planning will be considered part of the base program
rather than added responsibilities.  NMFS will significantly
increase technical-scientific support for regional habitat staff in
developing sound agency positions on critically important projects.<P>

<STRONG>Magnuson Act Amendment Requiring Identification of Essential
Habitat:</STRONG><P>
Passage of proposed fishery habitat amendments to the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act under the 1994
re-authorization will require additional resources.  Upon passage
of these amendments, there will be an urgent need to identify
essential fish habitats in the fishery management plans. 
Designation of essential habitats will identify key geographic
areas of concern for Federal and state agencies and the public. 
Support will be needed to assist the eight Fisheries Management
Councils to identify essential habitats and incorporate them as
amendments to their plans.<P>

<STRONG>Anadromous Fishery Habitat Improvements:</STRONG><P>
Anadromous fish stocks are imperiled in all regions of the United
States, primarily due to loss of habitat and impacts of hydropower
dams.  Because licenses for dams are issued for a period of up to
50 years, NMFS fishery consultations with FERC represent a major
opportunity to overcome adverse effects caused by past and future
licensing.  Over 200 major hydroelectric
dams are to be licensed or re-licensed during the next 10 years. 
This offers NMFS a major challenge to recommend and participate in
improvements in anadromous fishery resources.  Priority will be
placed on activities designed to protect anadromous fishery
habitats both as part of license consultation and participation in
development of new national policies or processes such as
developing regulations for fishway design.<P>

<STRONG>Activities to Avoid Endangered Species Act Listings:</STRONG><P>
Funds will be requested to improve existing programs aimed at
reducing the need for listings of endangered species (i.e.,
pre-listing processes associated with the identification of
essential habitats for candidate species, participation in the
assessment and determination of essential habitats and ecosystem
health for candidate species, collection of information regarding
potential threats and impacts in designated areas, and advance
planning and permit reviews to avoid irrecoverable losses of
habitats and ecosystem health).  Habitat Protection Program
activities which link closely to NMFS' Protected Resources
initiatives outlined in the NOAA Strategic Plan to take a proactive
approach to species and habitat protection will receive special
emphasis.<P>

<STRONG>Habitat Restoration & Mitigation Technology Development:</STRONG><P>
Restoration has not been attempted for many NOAA trust habitats
because of a lack of appropriate methodologies and funding.  Most
of the methods for restoring habitats that have been adversely
affected or altered have not been rigorously tested under
controlled conditions or in a range of geographic areas.  As a
consequence, a significant proportion of restoration actions have
been viewed with skepticism relative to their success.  New funds
will be sought for watershed restoration plans developed by
Federal, state, and nongovernmental partners and program
development plans for Habitat Restoration Research Programs are
emphasized.  The improvements of science in the mitigation of
developmental activities to avoid the need for later restoration of
degraded resources are to be given the highest priority.  Research
on innovative techniques developed for restoration and clean-up
approaches will have special preference.  Plans to provide
databases for protocols will be essential.  In addition, mitigation
techniques research dealing with such continually controversial
issues such as beach nourishment, marsh management and use of
contaminated dredged material will receive strong encouragement. 
Funds will be set aside for the creation of habitat evaluation
teams which will serve to increase the access of NMFS regulatory
staff to scientific and technical support.<P>

<STRONG>E.  New National Tracking System</STRONG><P>

The current lack of an adequate performance tracking system is a
major obstacle in evaluating program effectiveness and
communicating program accomplishments.  To correct this problem,
OHP will fund a contract to create a tracking system.  It will use
regionally-generated data fed into an integrated national database
to generate information on permits and construction programs and
project accomplishments.  When in place, the system should provide
consistent, accurate and timely data on the status of all national
and regional OHP habitat projects.<P>

<H3><B>FOREWORD</B></H3><P>
<P>
It is a particular pleasure to introduce the first activity report of the Office of Habitat Protection. Although habitat protection activities have been carried out by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) personnel for many years, concern for the increasing loss and degradation of habitat critical to fisheries resources has called for increased effort.  This concern prompted the organizational elevation of habitat protection efforts to Office level. In October, 1992, the Office of Habitat Protection was created.<P>
<P>
	This report will introduce the reader to habitat protection and conservation activities currently being carried out around the nation by NMFS field staff. Although the report does not include all field activities, the examples selected are representative of the many important types of projects underway. These cover a wide range of activities including the authorization of dam construction and operation, assessing of environmental damage from oil spills, protecting coastal wetlands, restoring access of fishery resource populations to ecosystems critical to their life cycles, designating disposal sites for dredge materials and restoring damaged ecosystems.<P>

<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an agency of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce (DOC), is responsible for the conservation of living marine resources, the protection of marine mammals and endangered marine species and the habitats on which they depend. The purpose of NMFS' Habitat Protection Program is to
conserve and protect the valuable habitats necessary to sustain marine biological communities.  This is accomplished primarily through review of licensing, permitting, legislative, and administrative activities that affect living marine resources and habitats; coordinating with Regional Fishery Management
Councils on Fishery Management Plans (FMPs); and conducting habitat-related research. As trustees of the habitats of living marine resources, the Program offers supervision and guidance for activities in land-use and wetland planning so that proper attention is given to their welfare.<P>
<P>
This report describes important marine habitat issues, and gives examples of the accomplishments and activities of the Agency's Habitat Protection Program for 1991, 1992 and 1993.  This report is available from the Office of Habitat Protection, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910.</code><P>

<STRONG>I.       Background</STRONG><P>

The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act of 1990 (CWPPRA) required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to establish a Task Force composed of members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce (actively represented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service), the Department of the Interior (actively represented by the Fish and Wildlife Service), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (represented by the Soil Conservation Service), and the State of Louisiana. Under CWPPRA, the Task Force must prepare and submit to Congress a priority list of wetland restoration projects in the State of Louisiana on an annual basis. The site selection process is based on technical (scientific) merit, cost effectiveness, and wetland quality of a proposed project. The Task Force must also prepare a comprehensive coastal Restoration Plan for the State of Louisiana by the end of 1993, which will provide the basis for selecting future restoration projects.  <P>

Each CWPPRA project requires the sponsorship of a federal agency Task Force member for implementation. The Act created a trust fund, which is supported by revenues from tax receipts on small engines and other equipment and managed by the Army Corps of Engineers on behalf of the Task Force. Of the amount appropriated in this Fund, 70% (an amount not to exceed $70 million annually) is available for wetland restoration projects and associated activities in the state of Louisiana. CWPPRA mandates a cost-share agreement of 75% federal funds to 25% state funds for all Louisiana projects.  The State complies with this mandate through use of the money in the state Coastal Restoration Trust Fund, created in 1989.  <P>

<STRONG>II.   NMFS Funding and Major Accomplishments</STRONG> <P>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was provided $484,000 from the federal Trust Fund for expenditure on CWPPRA activities in FY 1992. The monies were used to support the CWPPRA planning activities of NMFS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, the NMFS offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and St. Petersburg, Florida, and the Southeast Science Center laboratories in Galveston, Texas and Beaufort, North Carolina. A reimbursable account was created by the NMFS Budget Office in order to account for all program expenditures.<P>

The NMFS FY 1992 Planning Program accomplished the following:<P>

<EM>*New coordination between field, laboratory and headquarters offices.</EM> The NMFS Restoration Center (RC), Southeast Regional Office (SERO), and Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) developed a CWPPRA Program Development Plan which defined the role and involvement of the three offices. The active participation of each organization resulted in NMFS establishing itself as a leader among the CWPPRA Task Force members  in the development of priority projects and the quality and timeliness of analysis. Documentation that NMFS supplied to the Task Force assisted greatly in overall program decision making. This has led to SERO management identifying the CWPPRA program as a model for all future programs that involve the participation of regional, science center, and headquarters staff.<P>

<EM>*Procurement of computers and network equipment for NMFS SERO, SEFSC, and RC.</EM>    CWPPRA funds were used to provide the local field offices and laboratories with computer support to conduct the detailed analysis necessary to select restoration projects for the Project Priority List based upon cost effectiveness. Additionally, the hardware has facilitated communication with NMFS headquarters and other regional offices and has significantly improved both the field office's and laboratory's communications and analysis capabilities.<P>

<EM>*Development of Task Force monitoring protocols for CWPPRA restoration projects. </EM>  NMFS was an early advocate in the development of comprehensive monitoring protocols for  all CWPPRA-funded restoration projects. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center's Galveston Laboratory, along with other CWPPRA member agencies,  was instrumental in developing  a comprehensive fisheries monitoring guidance document. This document was approved for implementation by the Task Force in October, 1992. The RC and SEFSC will be involved in the monitoring of all NMFS sponsored restoration projects, and other projects with a significant impact upon wetland dependent fisheries.<P>

<U>*Provided contractual support to the RC and SERO for restoration planning and project development.</U> CWPPRA funds were expended to allow NOAA's Special Engineering Project Office in Kansas City to hire Woodward-Clyde Inc. to serve as contractual support to the RC and SERO.  Woodward-Clyde provided NMFS with support in obtaining project site information, analyzing the information, and preparing site reports on projects assigned to the agency for evaluation. With their assistance, NMFS developed site-specific information on numerous potential restoration projects.  Indeed, NMFS was recognized by the CWPPRA Task Force for meeting every deadline with analysis and documentation, thereby serving as a model for other participating agencies.<P>

<EM>*Initial development of the comprehensive coastal Restoration Plan. </EM> The final draft of the Restoration Plan and the accompanying environmental impact statement mandated by CWPPRA are due to Congress on November 28, 1993. NMFS assisted in conducting numerous public meetings to facilitate development of basin-wide restoration strategies and to identify potential wetland restoration projects.  Strategies identified at these meetings were then integrated into a state (coast)-wide restoration strategy and lynch-pin projects for each basin were identified. NMFS also participated in team planning efforts to expand these strategies into restoration action items and to evaluate the potential benefits of the proposed projects. Furthermore, NMFS assisted in the preparation of portions of the draft restoration plan.  <P>

<EM>*Proposal and review by the Task Force of three NMFS-sponsored restoration projects to be implemented in FY 1993.</EM> During the planning process for the second priority list, NMFS identified and presented 18 projects, seven of which were included as potential projects for additional screening.  Of the 15 projects selected by the Task Force for the Second Priority List, three were sponsored by NMFS.  Funding for the three projects, likely to be awarded by the Task Force in FY 93, is approximately $6.2 million. Descriptions of the projects are included in this report.<P> 

<STRONG>III.	Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration Projects in FY 1992</STRONG><P>

NMFS is currently working with the State of Louisiana to begin restoration activities at two of the 1992 Priority List sites compiled by the CWPPRA Task Force. CWPPRA mandates that the federal government fund 75% of the total cost of the restoration project, while the State will provide the remaining 25%. A cooperative agreement between NMFS and the State of Louisiana will serve to implement the projects to ensure that the proper cost sharing contributions are made.<P>


<EM>A.   LOWER  BAYOU  LACACHE HYDROLOGIC
 RESTORATION   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> Since 1932, twelve mineral access canals have been dredged into or across the project area from Bayou Terrebonne (to the east) to Bayou Petit Caillou (to the west). This has resulted in the intrusion of salt water into the low-salinity marshes in the interior of the project site.  Additionally, the banks of Bush Canal, at the north border of the area, have largely disappeared, resulting in the conversion of about 70% of the northern third of the project area to open water. Tidal exchange rate in the area appears to have changed from north/south flow at restricted velocities to a rapid flow-through pattern throughout most of the area. Tidal scouring appears to have contributed to significant marsh erosion.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The intent of this project is to restore natural north-south tidal exchanges and salinity gradients, and to reduce flow through the dredged canals by constructing shell-reinforced levees at the mouths of each of nine canals along Bayou Petit Caillou and six canal plugs along Bayou Terrebonne. This should reduce saltwater intrusion and eliminate tidal scouring occurring throughout the series of access canals. The project will enhance 4500 acres of wetlands and slow the loss of an estimated 256 acres over the next 20 years.<P>

<EM>Current Status  </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the Department of Commerce  in November, 1992. Implementation of Phase I of the project will begin following State signature of the cooperative agreement.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is  approximately $1.1 million dollars, with the federal contribution being approximately $825,000.<P>


<EM>B.   FOURCHON RESTORATION
 PROJECT   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description  </EM> The project area, a 2500 acre impoundment created from dredge spoil, has become a large brackish water pond with minimal exchange with the adjacent Bayou LaFourche. Due to the high water level inside the impoundment and the absence of further sediment deposition, conversion to open water continues. Furthermore, due to the lack of water exchange with adjacent water bodies, the area contributes only minimally as habitat for wildlife and fish populations.  Migratory fish species, especially juveniles of commercially important species, are largely excluded.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The intent of the restoration project is to reestablish fisheries access and restore saline marsh habitat within the shallowest portion of the impoundment.  This will be accomplished by placing culverts beneath a shell road at the north perimeter of the area, thereby allowing regular tidal exchange and more increased natural drainage, and providing for ingress and egress of marine organisms. Lowering the mean water level will produce an additional 145 acres of emergent marsh.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> This project had been delayed due to concerns voiced by one of two land-owners. However, it appears that this problem will be  resolved in the near future, and commencement of restoration activities is expected to begin sometime during FY 1993.<P>

Projected Cost  The total estimated cost for this project is $250,000, with a federal contribution of $187,500.<P>


<STRONG>IV.   Selection of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration Projects for FY 1993</STRONG><P>

Three projects were selected from the Task Force priority list for NMFS sponsorship during FY 1993.  These projects are likely to be funded through cooperative agreements between the State of Louisiana and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75%:25% cost sharing plan mandated by CWPPRA. <P>


<EM>A.   POINT Au FER   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description </EM> Point Au Fer is located near the delta of the Atchafalaya River.  Saltwater wetlands dominate the Gulf coast of the island, while northern area is primarily intermediate marshes. Two pipeline canals from Mosquito Bayou to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the canal linking Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, dredged around 1960, have allowed for rapid salt water intrusion into the brackish and/or intermediate marshes. At a second site on the western side of the island,  approximately 600 yards of beach separating the Gulf of Mexico from an oil canal near Locust Bayou, is also experiencing overwash and salt water intrusion. The effects of Hurricane Andrew exacerbated the problems. The north-south canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico was blown open by the hurricane, allowing salt water intrusion into the marshes. Additionally, the beach area located in the second project site was breached. Therefore, it is important that restoration activities commence immediately. This project is targeted to be the first of the three to be implemented.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> Four canal plugs will be constructed in the pipeline canal between Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, and similarly, three plugs will be constructed in the north-south pipeline canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. The existing plug at the seaward end of the north-south canal will be strengthened and the portion of the canal two hundred feet behind the plug will be backfilled. Approximately 3500 acres of wetlands along the eastern canals will be enhanced. At the second site, 600 yards of the eroding western shoreline of the island will be enhanced through spoil deposition and shell reinforcement, thereby protecting 1900 acres of wetlands.<P>  

<EM>Projected Cost  </EM> The total cost for this project is estimated at $1,100,000, with the 75% federal share equalling $825,000.<P>


<EM><CENTER>B.  BIG ISLAND  </CENTER> </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM> Big Island, located at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, was created with dredge spoil from the Atchafalaya River navigational channel. Although no spoil has been deposited on the island since the mid-1980s, the location of the island prevents the river delta from prograding and creating new wetlands along the western side of the river's main channel. Due to navigational dredging and other alterations, the Atchafalaya River delta complex has ceased to grow despite enormous sediment inputs from the river. Combined with the erosional problems in the area, an estimated 2034 acres could be lost over 20 years.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  A channel with a bottom width of 500 feet and a depth of 6 feet is to be dredged at a 45 degree angle through Big Island. This will allow water and sediment to flow around a series of delta lobes, to be created with the material from dredging the channel, thereby allowing the delta to prograde. It is expected that 300 acres of wetlands will be created during construction as a result of dredged material deposition, and 1200 acres are expected to accrete naturally over the life of the project.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The total cost for this project is approximately $4,100,000 with the federal portion being $3,075,000.<P>


<EM><CENTER>C.   ATCHAFALAYA DELTA NATURAL
 SEDIMENT DELIVERY</CENTER> </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began placing dredged material at the heads of delta lobes of the eastern (natural) half of the Atchafalaya Delta, assuming that this would stabilize existing deltaic islands and river channel locations. Unfortunately natural sediment transport processes and erosion processes sealed the Natal Channel in the delta in 1988. With the gradual closing of another major delta channel, Radcliffe Pass, the loss of sediment delivery will reduce the eastward growth of the delta complex and increase the impacts of winter storm erosion on existing wetlands. Total loss over a twenty year period is estimated at 1932 acres. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  Dredging both Radcliffe Pass and Natal Channel will allow the natural sediment delivery process to continue. As a result of dredged material disposal, 300 acres of new marsh will be created. Natural marsh accretion over twenty years could total 1800 acres.  This would represent a major increase of new marsh created in the Atchafalaya delta.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $907,800, with the federal share being $680,900.<P>


<STRONG>V.   Conclusion</STRONG><P>

NMFS participation in CWPPRA activities resulted in a successful merging of the technical and management resources of the SERO, RC and SEFSC in order to meet the requirements of the Act as dictated by the working committees of the interagency Task Force. NMFS has been an advocate of a comprehensive monitoring program and has won funding for five restoration projects important for wetland dependent fisheries. Future activities will include the development of an overall restoration plan for Louisiana, and the annual selection of priority projects.<P>

<STRONG>I.  Background</STRONG><P>
The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act of 1990 (CWPPRA) required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to establish a Task Force composed of members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Department of Commerce (DOC), represented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); the Department of the Interior, represented by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minerals Management Service; the U.S. Department of Agriculture, represented by the Natural Resources Conservation Service; and the State of Louisiana, represented by the Office of the Governor. The Task Force must annually prepare and submit to Congress a project priority list (PPL) of wetland restoration projects in the State of Louisiana. The site selection process is based on the proposed project's technical (scientific) merit, cost effectiveness, and predicted wetland quantity and quality. The Task Force was responsible for the preparation of a comprehensive coastal Restoration Plan for the State of Louisiana which was completed at the end of 1993. The Plan provides much of the basis for selecting future restoration projects.  <P>

Each CWPPRA project requires the sponsorship of a federal agency Task Force member for implementation. The Act utilizes a trust fund, which is supported by revenues from tax receipts on small engines and other equipment.  Of the amount appropriated from this Fund, 70% (an amount not to exceed $70 million annually) is available for wetland restoration projects and associated activities in the State of Louisiana. CWPPRA mandates a cost-share agreement of 75% federal funds to 25% State funds for all Louisiana projects. The State complies with this mandate by using the money in the State Coastal Restoration Trust Fund created in 1989.  <P>

<STRONG>II.  NMFS Funding and Major Accomplishments </STRONG><P>
The NMFS was provided approximately $420K from the federal Trust Fund for expenditure on CWPPRA planning activities in FY 1995.  The monies were used to support the CWPPRA planning activities of the NMFS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, the NMFS offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and St. Petersburg, Florida, and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) laboratories in Lafayette, Louisiana, Galveston, Texas and Beaufort, North Carolina. A reimbursable account was created by the NMFS to account for all program expenditures.<P>

The NMFS FY 1995 Planning Program accomplished the following:<P>

<EM><STRONG>* Signature of Five Cooperative Agreements between NOAA and State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources</STRONG> </EM>  In a space of just five months, NOAA/NMFS put into place five cooperative agreements with the State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  Agreements for the Lake Salvador, Lake Chapeau, Bayou Perot/Rigolettes and East Timbalier Island Phase I projects were all effective on 1 March 1995. The cooperative agreement for East Timbalier Island Phase II project was effective on 1 May 1995. This rapid implementation was the result of the efforts of the NOAA Grants Office and the State of Louisiana. All NMFS-sponsored projects are now under cooperative agreement.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* Construction Begins on Point Au Fer Island Plugs</EM></STRONG>   On 18 September 1995, the CWPPRA Task Force voted to approve construction of Phase I of the Point Au Fer Hydrologic Restoration project. Construction of 7 shell and shell-reinforced wooden plugs in canals on the eastern end of the island began in early October and was completed by mid-December. This is the first NMFS-sponsored project to go to construction.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* Several NMFS-Sponsored Projects Move Toward Construction</STRONG></EM>   Of the eight projects currently sponsored by NMFS, four (Lake Chapeau, Lake Salvador, East Timbalier Island Phase I and East Timbalier Island Phase II) have entered the preliminary engineering and design phase and two (Big Island Mining and Atchafalaya Sediment Delivery) have entered the final engineering and design phase. It is expected that at least 3 of these projects will reach the construction stage before the end of fiscal year 1996.<P>

<STRONG><EM>* NMFS Supports Task Force Position of Moving Towards Larger-Scale Projects</EM> </STRONG>  NMFS voted in favor of a resolution adopted by the CWPPRA Task Force to dedicate a major portion of the annual construction budgets for larger-scale restoration efforts.  The Task Force voted to allocate approximately 70 percent of the annual project implementation budgets to larger projects which have basin-wide effects. These efforts may include barrier island restoration and Mississippi River diversions. The remaining 30 percent of the budgets will be used for projects affecting more localized areas.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* NMFS Will Be a Lead Agency-Sponsor for an EIS to Evaluate Large-Scale Barrier-Island Restoration</STRONG></EM>  NMFS will be a co-lead agency  along with the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and Louisiana DNR as a cooperating agency in developing an environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate the feasibility of restoring the barrier island chains in the Barataria and Terrebonne basins. Barrier island restoration is a high-profile issue in Louisiana. The state government and the general public support a large-scale effort to protect the eroding chains of islands. The proposed EIS will be coupled with a Barrier Island Restoration Feasibility Study initiated by the CWPPRA Task Force to consider various ways to protect/restore the State's barrier islands.  Included in the options to be evaluated in the EIS is mining sand from a large off-shore deposit known as Ship Shoal and placing it on the islands. State officials have requested that MMS and NMFS co-sponsor these projects for implementation should the EIS support an action alternative as MMS is the federal agency responsible for managing the off-shore sand resource and as NMFS currently sponsors two priority project list projects on one of the barrier islands to be studied in the EIS.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* Development of Project Monitoring Plans Continues</STRONG> </EM>  The NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center Laboratory continues to lead the NMFS effort on monitoring plans for each of the CWPPRA projects.  To date, plans for four of the NMFS projects have been developed and are in various stages of the acceptance process. The Point Au Fer final monitoring plan was approved by the Planning and Evaluation (P&E) subcommittee of the CWPPRA Task Force in April 1995.  Monitoring plans for the Big Island Mining and Atchafalaya Sediment Delivery projects were submitted to the P&E subcommittee for approval in October 1995. The plan for the Lake Chapeau project has been delayed pending availability of final engineering and design plans. Monitoring plans for the remaining projects are scheduled for consideration at future meetings of the P&E subcommittee's Technical Advisory Group.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* NMFS Participates in the Mississippi River Sediment, Nutrient, Freshwater Redistribution Feasibility Study</STRONG></EM>   With the Corps of Engineers as the lead federal agency, NMFS and other Task Force agencies are participating as cooperating agencies in the feasibility study to investigate the redistribution of Mississippi River sediment, nutrient, and freshwater resources. The goal of the study is to identify opportunities for, and wetland enhancement benefits of, diverting water from the Mississippi River to the marshes of Breton Sound, Barataria, and Terrebonne basins.  NMFS is assisting in overall planning, development of alternatives, and preparation of portions of the document relating to marine fishery resources and their habitats. The three year study is intended to optimize diversion opportunities and identify potential funding sources for project implementation.<P>

<EM><STRONG>* NMFS CWPPRA Team Awarded the Department of Commerce Bronze Medal</STRONG></EM>   In recognition of the outstanding effort put forth over the past 4 years, ten members of the NMFS CWPPRA team were awarded the Department of Commerce Bronze Medal.  Tim Osborn and Erik Zobrist of the NMFS Restoration Center, Rimas Liogys of the NOAA Grants Office, Ric Ruebsamen, Richard Hartman and Jan Koellen of the NMFS Baton Rouge field office, Tom Minello and Terry McTigue of the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center Galveston Laboratory, Beverly Eggeman of the NMFS Southeast Regional Office, and Gordon Thayer of the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center Beaufort Laboratory were all recognized by the Department for their contributions to this highly successful program.<P>


<STRONG>III.  Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration Projects for FY 1993</STRONG><P>
Three projects were selected from the Task Force PPL2 for NMFS sponsorship during FY 1993. These projects are funded through cooperative agreements between the State of Louisiana and the NMFS.  The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75:25 percent cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA. <P>


A.  POINT Au FER <P>  
<EM>Site Description</EM>  Point Au Fer is located near the delta of the Atchafalaya River in Terrebonne Parish. Saltwater wetlands dominate the seaward parts of the island, while the northern area consists primarily of intermediate marshes. Two pipeline canals, one dredged around 1960 from the Gulf of Mexico through Mosquito Bay which intersects another older canal linking Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, have allowed for rapid salt water intrusion into the brackish and/or intermediate marshes.  At a second site on the western side of the island, approximately 600 yards of beach separating the Gulf of Mexico from an oil access canal near Locust Bayou, is experiencing overwash and salt water intrusion.  The effects of Hurricane Andrew exacerbated the problems at both locations. The beach area located at the second project site was opened by the hurricane, allowing increased erosion of and saltwater intrusion into the marshes. The beach area located at the second project site was also breached.  Therefore, it is important that restoration activities start immediately. This project is targeted to be the first of three to be implemented in the Atchafalaya delta region.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  Four canal plugs will be constructed in the pipeline canal between Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier. Similarly, three plugs will be constructed in the north-south pipeline canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. The existing plug at the seaward end of the north-south canal will be strengthened and a portion of the canal 200 feet behind the plug will be backfilled. About 3500 acres of wetlands along the eastern canals will be enhanced. At the second site, 600 yards of the eroding shoreline along the western part of the island will be enhanced by use of dredged material and shell reinforcement, thereby protecting 1900 acres of wetlands.  <P>

Current Status  The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in January 1994.  Construction for this project will be accomplished in two phases.  Phase I construction on shell-reinforced wooden plugs in the oil and gas access canals in Area 1 of the island was completed in mid-December 1995. Phase II construction in Area 2 has been delayed until suitable materials can be found to backfill the canal fronting the Gulf of Mexico. Phase II construction is slated for completion in May 1996.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The total cost for this project is estimated at $1.1 million with the 75% federal share equalling about $0.8 million.<P>


<EM>B.  BIG ISLAND </EM><P>  
<EM>Site Description </EM> Big Island, located at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, was created with dredged material from the Atchafalaya River navigation channel. Although no spoil has been deposited on the island since the mid-1980s, the location and height of the island prevents the river delta from expanding and creating new wetlands along the western side of the river's main channel.  Dredging and other alterations have prevented the Atchafalaya River delta complex from growing despite enormous sediment inputs. Combined with erosion, an estimated 2034 acres could be lost within 20 years.<P>

Proposed Restoration Activities  A 500-foot wide, 10-foot deep channel will be dredged just north of Big Island at a 45-degree angle to the navigation channel of the Atchafalaya River. The project's main channel will graduate into several smaller channels designed to allow water and sediment to once again reach the western side of the Atchafalaya River delta. Sediment dredged directly from the project will be placed in a series of delta lobes creating approximately 300 acres of wetlands. Over 1200 acres of march are expected to form naturally over the life of the project.<P>

Current Status The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in August 1994. This project is in the final engineering and design phase. A draft environmental assessment (EA) has been circulated to various state and federal government agencies for review and comments. Construction is scheduled to begin in June of 1996.<P>
 
Projected Cost  The total cost for this project is approximately $4.2 million.  The federal contribution to the project will be approximately $3.1M.<P>


C.  ATCHAFALAYA DELTA NATURAL<P>
     SEDIMENT DELIVERY <P>
<EM>Site Description</EM>  The COE began placing dredged material at the heads of delta lobes of the eastern (natural) half of the Atchafalaya Delta in association with their maintenance dredging operations. They assumed that this would stabilize existing deltaic islands and the river channel.  Unfortunately, in 1988, natural sediment transport processes and erosion sealed the delta's Natal Channel.  With the gradual closing of Radcliffe Pass, another major delta channel, sediment delivery loss will reduce the eastward growth of the delta complex and increase the impacts of winter storm erosion on existing wetlands. Total loss over a 20-year period is estimated at 1932 acres. <P>

Proposed Restoration Activities  Dredging both Radcliffe Pass and Natal Channel will allow the natural sediment delivery process to continue. Beneficial use of dredged material will allow creation of 300 acres of new marsh. Natural marsh accretion over 20 years could total 1800 acres. This would represent a major increase of new marsh in the Atchafalaya delta.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in August 1994, and this project has moved  into the final engineering and design phase.  A draft environmental assessment (EA) has been circulated to various state and federal government agencies for review and comments. Construction is scheduled to begin in June of 1996.<P>

Projected Cost The total cost of this project is approximately $0.9 million.The federal share is $0.7 million.<P>


<STRONG>IV.  Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration Projects in FY 1994</STRONG><P>
Four NMFS-sponsored wetland restoration projects (one deferred) and one shoreline protection demonstration project were selected by the Task Force for PPL3. In addition, a NMFS-sponsored project heads the list of three deferred projects. The funded projects are likely to be constructed through cooperative agreements between the State and the NMFS. The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75:25 percent cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA. <P>


<EM>A.  BAYOU PEROT/RIGOLETTES PROJECT   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description</EM>  The project area is the 4,255-acre peninsula between Bayou Rigolettes  and Bayou Perot in Jefferson Parish which lies in an area of maximum subsidence between the Mississippi River and Bayou LaFourche channel systems. The sediments which make up the peninsula are very fine grained and organic with little structural strength. Since the late 1920s, when the present levees along the Mississippi River were constructed, sediment input into this area has been substantially reduced. As a consequence, the bulk density of the marsh soils has fallen, causing increased marsh loss. In addition to the general marsh loss, shoreline erosion rates are very high.  Unless this peninsula is given a substantial injection of sediments, it will soon be lost.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The object is to mine 600,000 cubic yards of sediments from Bayous Rigolettes and Perot and to place these sediments along the shoreline of the peninsula. A shallow-draft barge fitted with a spray nozzle will spread the sediments into a 250-foot wide strip along the shoreline raising it by about one foot. This shoreline elevation will increase its stability. As the shoreline erodes over time, much of the dredged material would be moved inward, significantly increasing the life of the peninsula. The project will enhance 190 acres, create 100 acres and protect about 1,065 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM>  The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in March 1995. A feasibility study conducted by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) indicated that because of recent erosion and marsh loss, possible wetlands benefits from construction of this project are questionable. DNR has indicated a willingness to deauthorize the project.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is approximately $1.8 million with the federal share being $1.4 million.<P>


<EM>B.  LAKE CHAPEAU SEDIMENT INPUT AND   
     HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> The project area, located in Terrebonne Parish, includes 13,000 acres of Point au Fer Island. Point au Fer has lost about 30 percent of its land area since the 1930s due to subsidence, erosion and construction of oil and gas canals. While the rate of wetland loss on the island as a whole is decreasing due to sediment input from the Atchafalaya River, the Lake Chapeau area is losing marsh as a result of altered tidal circulation through the northern portion of the island. This circulation is made possible by the many natural and manmade waterways in this area, as well as large areas of open water and broken marsh. Major marsh loss has occurred in the area surrounding Lake Chapeau and continues at a rate of nearly 15 acres per year. <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The project will include mining 500,000 cubic yards of sediment from the Atchafalaya Bay bottom, spray-jetting  the sediment over an 1,800-acre area along Lake Chapeau's shorelines and installing numerous plugs in abandoned oil and gas access canals. The project will restore marshes west of Lake Chapeau, reestablish the hydrologic separation of the Locust Bayou and Alligator Bayou watersheds, and reestablish natural drainage patterns of the Lake Chapeau area. Over 260 acres of open water will be converted to marsh. Reducing open water areas and filling shallow breaks in the marsh will protect 2,500 acres from wind-wave erosion and an additional 1,000 acres from tidal scour. Plugging man-made canals and gapping spoil banks will restore natural sediment pathways enhancing 12,000 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM>  The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in March 1995. This project is entering the initial engineering and design phase. Construction is scheduled tentatively to begin in July of 1996.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is approximately $4.2 million. The federal contribution to this project will be approximately $3.1 million.<P>


<EM>C.  EAST TIMBALIER ISLAND SEDIMENT
      RESTORATION PROJECT (PHASE I) </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM>  The 400-acre island in LaFourche Parish is part of an island chain that fronts Terrebonne/Timbalier Bay. Louisiana's barrier islands play an important role in protecting the Terrebonne, Barataria, and St. Bernard barrier-built estuaries and their surrounding wetlands from the destructive forces of high wave energy, storm surges and salt water intrusion. All of Louisiana's barrier islands are experiencing landward migration, island narrowing and land loss as a consequence of a complex interaction among global sea level rise, subsidence, wave and storm processes, inadequate sediment supply and intense human disturbance. The loss of these barrier islands could result in the accelerated deterioration of the estuaries and the wetlands they protect, thus severely reducing coastal fisheries habitat.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM>  The project calls for mining 890,000 cubic yards of sediment and placing it in three embayments along the landward shoreline of East Timbalier Island.  This will double the width of the island making it less vulnerable to hurricane and winter storm damage, thus increasing the island's life expectancy.  The project will create at least 86 acres of vegetated land on the island and give additional protection to about 1,900 acres of mainland marshes.<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM>  The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in March 1995.  This project has been teamed with the East Timbalier Island Sediment Restoration Project (Phase II) from PPL4.  Both have entered the initial engineering and design phase and construction is scheduled tentatively to begin in September of 1996.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project (Phase I) is approximately $2.1 million with the federal share being $1.5 million.<P>


<EM>D.  LAKE SALVADOR SHORELINE
 PROTECTION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT  </EM><P>

<EM> Site Description  </EM> The project area is located on the north shore of Lake Salvador near Bayou Des Allemands in St. Charles Parish, adjacent to a State Wildlife Management area.  Lake Salvador has suffered from high rates of land loss caused by shoreline erosion. The lake rim  is breached at several locations, allowing tidal and wave energy to erode the highly organic marsh surface, resulting in large shallow ponds in the interior of the marsh. Since 1956, the project area has lost more than 1,000 acres of marsh, equating to a loss of about 25 percent of the land in the project area.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM>  This project is designed to test the effectiveness of two separate types of segmented timber breakwaters in highly organic, unconsolidated sediments with poor load bearing capacity. Approximately 11,100 feet of segmented breakwaters, in various configurations, will be constructed and their effectiveness analyzed. The project is expected to enhance about 1,003 acres of marsh and shallow water habitat, protect about 166 acres of brackish marsh and restore about 10 acres of marsh along the Lake Salvador shoreline. <P>

<EM>Current Status  </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in March 1995.  This project is well into the engineering and design phase. Construction is scheduled to begin in June 1996.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is approximately $1.5 million with the federal share being $1.1 million.<P>


<STRONG>V.  Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration Projects in FY 1995</STRONG><P>

<EM>A.  EAST TIMBALIER ISLAND SEDIMENT   
      RESTORATION (PHASE II)</EM><P>

<EM>Site Description  </EM> The 400 acre East Timbalier Island in Lafourche Parish is part of an island chain that front Timbalier Bay. Louisiana's barrier islands play an important role in protecting the Terrebonne, Barataria and St. Bernard barrier-built estuaries and their surrounding wetlands from the destructive forces of high wave energy, storm surges and salt water intrusion. All of Louisiana's barrier islands are experiencing landward migration, narrowing and land loss as a result of a complex interaction among global sea level rise, subsidence, wave and storm processes, inadequate sediment supply and intense human disturbance. The loss of these barrier islands will result in the accelerated deterioration of these estuaries and the wetlands they protect, thus severely reducing coastal fisheries habitat.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> The National Marine Fisheries Service will supervise the mining of approximately 1,875,000 cubic yards of sediment from bay areas near East Timbalier Island which will be placed onto the island at marsh elevations. In addition to the sediment, a low levee may be constructed in order to contain the mined sediment during construction. The project will increase the life expectancy of the island by creating approximately 129 acres of new salt marsh, protecting approximately 24 acres of existing marsh on the island, and protecting an additional 1,900 acres of mainland marsh.<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in May 1995. This project has been teamed with the East Timbalier Island Sediment Restoration Project (Phase I) from PPL3. Both have entered the initial engineering and design phase and construction is scheduled tentatively to begin in September of 1996.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The total cost of the project is approximately $5.7 million.  The federal contribution to this project is approximately $4.3 million.<P>


<STRONG>VI.  Conclusion</STRONG><P>

NMFS participation in the CWPPRA program demonstrates a successful use and integration of management and scientific skills within the agency. Within the framework of these projects, in excess of 25,000 acres of fragile wetlands will be protected, restored or enhanced. New projects are currently being considered which will increase this acreage significantly. Our success has  proven to be a model for other CWPPRA Task Force member agencies. The NOAA Bronze Medal awarded to members involved in this effort recognizes the organizational and personal contributions made by the agency to the CWPPRA program.<P>

This year has seen the construction of the Point Au Fer Island project, the engineering and design of several other projects and the overall cooperative effort of NMFS and NOAA to restore and conserve tens of thousands of acres of wetlands in Louisiana. This past year will also serve as a model for future efforts by NMFS. The lessons learned in the Point Au Fer Island construction effort and within the engineering and design of the other NMFS-sponsored restoration projects will help to make future project implementation both more efficient and more effective.<P>

<P>
    <STRONG>A. The Magnitude of the Problem<P></STRONG>
<P>
          <STRONG>THE DECLINE OF LIVING MARINE RESOURCES</STRONG><p>
	Coastal habitat and wetland loss have significantly affected declines in the U.S. fishery stocks.  In 1992, the U.S. commercial fishing industry caught over 9.6 billion pounds of seafood valued at $3.7 billion.  However, estuarine dependent fishery landings are down, and the shell fishing industry is operating at historic low levels.  Since 1982, commercial landings of fish and shellfish in the Southeast Atlantic states and the Gulf of Mexico have decreased 42%.  Oyster landings at 90% below historic levels in the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound are attributable to habitat loss and degradation in those estuaries. Colombia River Basin salmon and steel head runs have declined 75-84% from historic levels, due largely to impedance by dams of sea-bound smolts and returning adults.  California's natural salmon runs have been reduced by 65% in only 20 years.<P>
<P>
                     <STRONG>IMPACT ON ECONOMY</STRONG><p>
	The losses of these fisheries resources mean fewer jobs for the fishers, processors, and vendors.  Commercial fishing in 1988 employed over 274,000 fishers and 90,000 shore workers.  The income of fishing gear manufacturers and fisheries product transporters are also reduced.  In 1989, over $17 billion was spent on fishing-related products and services such as boats, motors, equipment, fuel, insurance, and docking fees. The absence of these revenues and their multiplier effects on the
U.S. economy is significant. In addition, the loss of the natural fisheries resources results in the reduction of the domestic food supply. This reduction will result in higher prices to the consumer or increased imports to meet demand or both.
<P>
	Recreational marine fisheries in 1985 contributed over $4.9 billion to coastal economies in trip expenditures alone.  In 1990, 65,000 tons of fish were caught recreationally in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico; 13,000 tons were taken from the Pacific in 1989.  More than 13,709,000 people participated in the sport. Aggregate expenditures for saltwater fin fishing in 1985 were estimated at greater than $7.2 billion.  Losses in recreational fisheries stocks affect charter boat operators, bait shops, boat rentals, boat manufacturers, fishing gear manufacturers, and the motel and hotel industry.<P>

                     <STRONG>IMPACT ON HEALTH</STRONG><p>
	The impacts of habitat degradation stretch beyond economics to human health and even the way of life for a significant portion of the Nation's population. Bivalve molluscs are relatively immobile filter feeders unable to move from polluted waters which they pump through their systems in large quantities.  Enteric diseases, Vibrio bacteria, and marine biotoxins can be carried by shellfish to human consumers. Shell fishing restriction is an indicator of coastal water quality conditions relative to pollution from human activity.  In 1974, about one-fourth of the shellfish beds in the United States were closed to harvesting due to sewage contamination in the beds.  Shellfish contamination, environmental impacts from mosquito control, and beach closures all are associated with the health of the marine resources. Unhealthy waters pose a threat to bathers; recent attention has focused on medical wastes and raw sewage which have closed popular beaches. Tracking the extent and duration of beach closings is an indicator of how the nation monitors coastal water quality and the severity of coastal water pollution.<P>

                  <STRONG>IMPACT ON WAY OF LIFE</STRONG><p>
	Fishing as a livelihood and a sport represents one of the most important uses of this resource. The commercial industry employs over 345,000 people, many of which come from generations of fishermen and women.  Commercial fishers increased in number almost 15% from 1985 to 1988.  This work force has a significant stake in the future of fisheries resources.  As marine resources decline, a significant portion of the population may find its historical livelihood at risk.<P>

	Recreational marine fisheries are also affected.  For example, 70% of recreationally important fishery resources in the Southeast utilize estuaries and near shore marine habitats at some
point in their life cycle. Loss of habitat reduces stocks and has negative effects on the opportunities available to recreational fishers.<P>

     <STRONG>B.  Causes</STRONG><P>
<P>
                       <STRONG>OVER FISHING</STRONG><p>
	Fishing effort remains greater than many commercial and recreational species can withstand.  While total U.S. fish landings continue to grow, a substantial portion of the stocks are over utilized, due in part to overcapitalization and technological improvements. By weight, estuarine-dependent fish make up 77% of the Nation' s commercial harvest, and these species are the most vulnerable to habitat and water quality impacts. Many species, such as salmon, striped bass, and mackerel, have declined in abundance.  Shellfish also show a steady decline in abundance as well, though they vary by region
and species. Protection of fishery habitats is critical to ensure propagation for future stocks.<P>

                      <STRONG>PHYSICAL HABITAT LOSS</STRONG><p>
	Decades of widespread habitat destruction is evident throughout the country. Habitats critical to the life cycles of fishery resources are being lost due to both human and natural factors. Estimates indicate
that coastal wetlands are being lost at the rate of 20,000 acres per year. About half of the original 11.7 million acres of coastal wetlands in the lower 48 states were lost during the period of 1780 to 1978. From 1953 to 1977, over 372,000 acres of estuarine wetlands disappeared. Of these, 55% were lost to coastal erosion and 45% to urban development.  Regionally, certain areas have exceptional problems. Texas has estimated that over one-third of its approximately one million acres of coastal marshes may have been lost between the mid-1950's and the mid-1970's. In areas like Louisiana's mar shes, land loss rates approaching 60 square miles per year have been observed, due
primarily to a gradual rise in sea level, extensive canal dredging, and upland flood control levees on the Mississippi River which prevent the normal flow of sediments to the coastal mar shes. Other aquatic systems show similar trends in wetland losses. <P>


                    <STRONG>  HABITAT QUALITY LOSS</STRONG><p>
	Discharges from wastewater plants and industries or oil and other hazardous chemical spills contribute to the degradation of critical habitat. Many bays and coastal waters have been contaminated with heavy metals, petroleum compounds, and other chemical wastes. Upland activities such as logging, mining, agricultural conversion and runoff, and hydroelectric power development have also seriously affected the quality and quantity of habitat for living marine resources. <P>

	The presence of pollutants and the effects of pollution in U.S. waters are of great national concern.  There has been strong public response to widely publicized incidents of medical waste along beaches, dolphin deaths, and beach closings in the past 5 years.  Only 56% of U.S assessed estuarine waters fully support their designated uses such as swimming and fishing; the Great Lakes waters fare far worse.  Specific water bodies suffer from specialized problems such as fish kills and shellfish bed closings tied to particular pollution sources (agriculture, toxic chemicals, thermal plumes, etc.).<P>

	Coastal and estuarine habitats are important to maintaining healthy fish stocks. Tidal mar shes, from salt to freshwater, provide valuable nursery and foraging habitats for a variety of marine life. The plants
found in tidal marshes provide nutrients to the surrounding ecosystem. Recent studies have shown a direct connection between the amount of marsh vegetation and shrimp abundance in the Gulf of Mexico. Other studies show greater use of marsh areas by subadult shrimp and fish than the open water environment.  Without such areas, commercially important species such as shrimp, oysters, fish, and crab would not be available. This also holds for recreationally important fish including red drum, red snapper, grouper, sea trout, mackerel, salmon, and others.<P>

    <H3><STRONG>A. Habitat's Importance To Living Marine Resources</H3></STRONG><P>

	Estuaries and wetlands are important to many species of fin fish and shellfish because these habitats provide areas for spawning, nurseries, protection from predators, and food supplies. These areas are where the complex food web begins (see Figure 5). More than two-thirds of the commercially-important fish species on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts depend on wetlands as critical habitat at some time during their life.  In addition, these habitats serve as efficient filters for contaminants from upland
discharges and urban runoff. Wetlands help to maintain water quality and in many estuaries, retard erosion, retain flood waters, and afford many recreational opportunities. Such areas are especially important because they are so productive and so close to shore. About one-half of all U.S.-caught fish are caught in coastal waters within 3 miles of shore.<P>
<P>
	Rivers are also important for salmon and other anadromous fish that migrate from the ocean to spawn in the rivers where they were hatched. Thus, habitats used for migration require protection from disruption by construction, damming, or logging activities which may restrict this crucial transit to spawning areas. In addition, river borne discharges from numerous upland sources have adversely affected the quality of many remaining coastal and estuarine habitats.<P>
<P>
<P>
                <STRONG>   <H3><B>NMFS RESPONSIBILITIES</H3></STRONG>

                             <STRONG>GENERAL</B><P></STRONG>

	Despite the destruction of coastal wetlands, and considerable advances in our understanding of their enormous importance, they still remain at risk. NMFS is responsible for protecting living marine resources and their habitats from the inland reach of anadromous fish to the outer limits of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.<P>
<P>
<P>
                     <STRONG>   <H3><B>LEGAL AUTHORITIES</B></H3><P></STRONG>

	NMFS carries out its charge under many laws and mandates from Congress. These statutes and implementing regulations require that licenses, permits, and construction projects regulated or undertaken by other Federal agencies in waters of the United States must include consultation with Federal resource agencies (e.g. NMFS). Most of NMFS' responsibilities emanate from the following statutes:<P>
<P>
     o    Clean Water Act, which has the goal of restoring and
          maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological
          integrity of the nation's waters (lakes, wetlands,
          streams, and other aquatic habitats);<P>
<P>
     o    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
          Liability Act (CERCLA), which gives NOAA authority, as
          a natural resources trustee, to assess injury,
          destruction, or loss of natural resources in the marine
          environment caused by releases of hazardous
          substances;<P>
<P>
     o    Endangered Species Act, which protects species
          determined to be threatened or endangered;<P>
<P>
     o    Federal Power Act provides, among other things, NMFS
          authority to prescribe fish ways;<P>
<P>
     o    Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, which authorizes
          NMFS to collect fisheries data and to advise other
          governmental agencies on environmental decisions that
          affect living marine resources;<P>
<P>
     o    Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of
          1976, which regulates fisheries within the EEZ;<P>
<P>
     o    Marine Mammal Protection Act, which regulates taking or
          importing marine mammals;<P>
<P>
     o    Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of
          1972 (MPRSA), under Title II, gives NOAA broad research
          authority on the effects of pollution on the marine
          environment, including coastal and marine habitats.<P>
<P>
     o    National Environmental Policy Act, which requires
          disclosure of environmental consequences associated
          with Federal or Federally-authorized rules or projects
          with the potential to significantly affect the quality
          of the human environment and the alternatives to these
          actions;<P>
<P>
     o    Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which combines various oil
          spill response mechanisms, and addresses all oil
          discharges to navigable waters and shorelines.  It
          raises liability limits for vessels, expands cleanup
          and economic damage collections, provides for emergency
          response planning, and creates a $1 billion Oil Spill
          Liability Trust Fund;<P>
<P>
     o    Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which controls the
          placement of structures in navigable waterways so that
          commerce and marine, anadromous, and estuarine
          resources are not adversely impacted.<P>
<P>
<p>
     <H3><B><STRONG>B.  NMFS Habitat Protection Program</B></H3><P>
<P></STRONG>
	NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Habitat Protection Program activities are carried out nationwide as part of the overall NMFS fisheries research and management program. Facilities involved in these activities include NMFS regional office Science Centers and Laboratories (responsible for fisheries research), Regional Headquarters (which manage the Regional field activities), and field stations (responsible for on-site inspections and analysis of proposed actions). The NMFS
Office of Habitat Protection central office in Silver Spring, MD provides policy guidance for the NMFS Regional and Center programs. Habitat programs are organized and administered in each area to respond effectively to unique regional issues.<P>
<P>
	All regional habitat conservation programs are a reflection of three important considerations: the pressures on the living marine resource habitats in the region, the size of the area managed, and the commercial and recreational importance of the species. The NMFS Habitat Protection Program is directed by several Federal laws and its National Habitat Conservation Policy, which was published in 1983: Implementation of this policy is facilitated by 12 strategies targeting: coordinating research and management; habitat research; interacting with the eight Regional Fishery Management Councils and specific Fishery Management Plans; strengthening NMFS involvement under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; assisting states with marine habitat issues; initiating and strengthening interagency agreements; protecting anadromous fish; increasing pre application planning; integrating habitat consideration across NMFS programs; increasing intra-NOAA cooperation; providing necessary and
appropriate regulatory relief; and communicating of habitat information to NMFS constituents. <P>
<P>
<P>
           <H3><STRONG><B>OFFICE OF HABITAT PROTECTION PROGRAM</B></H3></STRONG>

	As a result of an intensive study of the Habitat Protection Program between 1990 and 1991, several recommendations were submitted to the Assistant Administrator.  The overwhelming theme of these recommendations was the need for reorganization within NMFS, and the effective placement of the habitat protection function within that structure.  Consequently, in October 1992, the Office of Habitat Protection (OHP) was formally created as a separate office on a par with the other NMFS offices.<P>
<P>
	The Headquarters Office in Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., is responsible for policy development and technical guidance.  Staff at Headquarters provide day to-day guidance to NMFS regions and fishery science centers on implementing the NMFS Habitat Conservation Policy including any necessary revisions, updating, and interpretation. The Office's primary objective is to favorably influence the decisions of other Federal agencies to protect and manage habitats of importance to NMFS' trust resources. Office staff provide key support to the Assistant Administrator, the Director of the Office of Habitat Protection, and NOAA and DOC on living marine resource habitat and environmental matters; draft new policy, agreements, and Federal legislation; and evaluate the same. The Office provides Headquarters leadership for the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) referrals, Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404(q) Memorandum of Agreement elevations, and
national office interaction with other Federal Departments and Agencies where living marine resource habitat policy issues are involved.<P>
<P>
	The Office is a source of funding for NMFS habitat conservation research activities. Of special interest is research and information sharing activities undertaken by NOAA's National Ocean Service's (NOS); Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM); Office for Atmospheric Research (OAR); Coastal Ocean Program (COP); Sanctuaries and Reserves Division for research funding of marine sanctuary and estuarine research efforts; Office of Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment
(ORCA); Coastal Monitoring and Bioeffects Assessment Division; and Strategic Environmental Assessment Division (SEAD) for mapping, benthic surveillance, and other synoptic and diagnostic
efforts that characterize marine, estuarine, and anadromous fish habitats.<P>
<P>
	National habitat outreach and educational activities including development and dissemination of the Habitat Conservation Biennial Report, and other products required by law (e.g., the National Plastics Pollution Report) are developed within the Program. The Office also has the lead for all briefings on
matters regarding NMFS habitat research, and works closely with the NMFS Senior Scientist and the National Academy of Sciences.</code><P>

<STRONG>I.  Background</STRONG><P>
The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act of 1990 (CWPPRA) required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to establish a Task Force composed of members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Department of Commerce (DOC), represented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); the Department of the Interior, represented by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the U.S. Department of Agriculture, represented by the Soil Conservation Service; and the State of Louisiana. The Task Force must annually prepare and submit to Congress a project priority list (PPL) of wetland restoration projects in the State of Louisiana. The site selection process is based on the proposed project's technical (scientific) merit, cost effectiveness, and predicted wetland quantity and quality. The Task Force was responsible for the preparation of a comprehensive coastal Restoration Plan for the State of Louisiana which was completed at the end of 1993. The Plan will provide much of the basis for selecting future restoration projects.  <P>

Each CWPPRA project requires the sponsorship of a federal agency Task Force member for implementation. The Act utilizes a trust fund, which is supported by revenues from tax receipts on small engines and other equipment and managed by the COE. Of the amount appropriated from this Fund, 70% (an amount not to exceed $70 million annually) is available for wetland restoration projects and associated activities in the State of Louisiana. CWPPRA mandates a cost-share agreement of 75% federal funds to 25% State funds for all Louisiana projects. The State complies with this mandate by using the money in the State Coastal Restoration Trust Fund created in 1989.  <P>


<STRONG>II.  NMFS Funding and Major Accomplishments </STRONG><P>
The NMFS was provided approximately $0.5 million from the federal Trust Fund for expenditure on CWPPRA activities in FY 1993. The monies were used to support the CWPPRA planning activities of the NMFS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, the NMFS offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and St. Petersburg, Florida, and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) laboratories in Lafayette, Louisiana, Galveston, Texas and Beaufort, North Carolina. A reimbursable account was created by the NMFS to account for all program expenditures.<P>

The NMFS FY 1993 Planning Program accomplished the following:<P>

<EM>*Continued coordination between field, laboratory and headquarters offices. </EM> The NMFS Restoration Center (RC), Southeast Regional Office (SERO), and SEFSC continued to implement a CWPPRA Program Development Plan which defined the role and involvement of the three offices. The active participation of each organization resulted in the NMFS establishing itself as a leader in the development of priority projects and the quality and timeliness of analyses. Documentation that the NMFS supplied to the Task Force assisted greatly in overall program decision making. Particularly important was the role of SERO Baton Rouge staff in developing and editing the Restoration Plan.  This has led to SERO management identifying the CWPPRA program as a model for future interactions that involve regional and headquarters staff.<P>

<EM>*Procurement of computers, network equipment, and boat for NMFS SERO, SEFSC, and RC.</EM> CWPPRA funds were used to provide the local field offices and laboratories with computer support to conduct the detailed analyses necessary to select restoration projects for the PPL based upon cost effectiveness. Additionally, the hardware has eased communication with NMFS headquarters and other regional offices and has significantly improved both the field office's and laboratory's communications and analysis capabilities. FY93 also saw the delivery of vessel to the SERO Baton Rouge office. This acquisition has greatly enhanced NMFS capability to evaluate CWPPRA sites for possible funding and to oversee restoration project implementation.  <P>

<EM>*Development of Task Force monitoring protocols for CWPPRA restoration projects.  </EM> NMFS was an early advocate in the development of comprehensive monitoring protocols for all CWPPRA-funded restoration projects. The SEFSC's Galveston Laboratory, along with other CWPPRA member agencies, was instrumental in developing a comprehensive fisheries monitoring guidance document. This document was approved for implementation by the Task Force in October 1992.  SERO and SEFSC staff have since worked with other Federal and State agencies to oversee the creation of a formal Monitoring Work Group and the standardization of the review and approval of all monitoring plans for CWPPRA funded restoration projects.<P>

<EM>*Provided contractual support to the RC and SERO for restoration planning and project development.  </EM> CWPPRA funds enabled the NMFS to acquire the services of Dr. Ivor van Heerden, of Louisiana State University, to work with the RC, SERO, and SEFSC in obtaining project site information, analyzing the information, and preparing site reports on projects assigned to the agency for evaluation.  With his assistance, NMFS developed site-specific information on numerous potential restoration projects. Indeed, NMFS was recognized by the CWPPRA Task Force for meeting every deadline for analyses and documentation, thereby serving as a model for other participating agencies.  In addition to Dr. van Heerden's support, the RC also negotiated a task-order based support services contract with GOTECH, Inc., of Baton Rouge, to provide engineering and scientific support to NMFS.  <P>

<EM>*Development of the comprehensive CWPPRA Restoration Plan.</EM> The Restoration Plan and the accompanying final environmental impact statement mandated by CWPPRA was produced in December 1993. NMFS assisted in conducting numerous public meetings to help develop nine basin-wide restoration strategies and identifing potential wetland restoration projects. Information from these meetings was then integrated into Louisiana's coast-wide restoration strategy and key projects for each basin were identified. NMFS also participated in team planning efforts to expand these strategies into restoration action items and to evaluate the potential benefits of the proposed projects. Furthermore, NMFS SERO staff made significant contributions in the preparation of the draft and final restoration plan.  <P>

<EM>*Proposal and funding by the Task Force of four NMFS-sponsored restoration projects to be implemented from the third PPL.</EM> During the planning process for the third PPL, the NMFS identified and presented 7 restoration and 5 demonstration projects for possible funding by the Task Force.  Of the 14 restoration and 3 demonstration projects selected by the Task Force, 3 restoration and 1 demonstration project were sponsored by NMFS. Funding for the four projects, likely to be implemented by NMFS via a cooperative agreement with the State in FY94 and subsequent years, is about $9.5 million. Descriptions of the projects are included in this report.<P>


<STRONG>III.  Implementation of NMFS-Sponsored
         Restoration Projects in FY 1992</STRONG><P>

NMFS is now working with the State of Louisiana to begin restoration of two of the 1992 PPL1 sites compiled by the CWPPRA Task Force. CWPPRA mandates that the Federal government fund 75% of the total cost of the restoration project, while the State will provide the remaining 25%. A cooperative agreement between NMFS and the State of Louisiana will implement the projects and the cost-sharing arrangements.<P>


<EM>A.  LOWER  BAYOU  LACACHE HYDROLOGIC
       RESTORATION   </EM><P>

Site Description  Since 1932, 15 mineral access canals have been dredged into or across the project area from Bayou Terrebonne (to the east) to Bayou Petit Caillou (to the west). This has allowed the intrusion of salt water into the low-salinity marshes in the interior of the project site. Additionally, the banks of Bush Canal, at the northern border of the area, have largely disappeared. This has converted about 70% of the northern third of the project area to open water. Water flow appears to have significantly increased in most of the area and the subsequent tidal scouring appears to have contributed to significant marsh loss. <P>

Proposed Restoration Activities  The intent of this project is to restore natural north-south tidal exchanges and salinity gradients, and to reduce water flow through the dredged canals. This would be accomplished by constructing shell-reinforced levees at the mouths of each of the nine canals along Bayou Petit Caillou and the six canal plugs along Bayou Terrebonne. This should reduce saltwater intrusion and eliminate the tidal scouring in the canals. The project, over the next 20 years, is expected to enhance 4500 acres of wetlands and slow the loss of an estimated 256 acres of marsh .<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in November 1992. A successful feasibility study and preliminary engineering/design report was completed in April 1994. Final engineering plans will commence Fall, 1994 with construction expected in Fall, 1995.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM><P> This project will cost about $1.6 million dollars. The federal contribution is about $1.2 million.<P>


<EM>B.  FOURCHON RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description  </EM> The project area comprises a 2500-acre impoundment created from dredged material.  It has become a large brackish-water pond with minimal tidal exchange with the adjacent Bayou LaFourche. High water levels inside the impoundment and the absence of further sediment deposition are converting marsh to open water. Furthermore, due to the lack of water exchange with adjacent water bodies, the area provides only minimal habitat for fish and wildlife.  Migratory fish, especially juveniles of commercially important species, are largely excluded.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> The restoration project would reestablish fisheries access and restore saline marsh habitat within the shallowest portion of the impoundment. This objective would be accomplished by placing culverts beneath a shell road at the north perimeter of the area, thereby allowing regular tidal exchange, increased drainage, and ingress and egress of marine organisms. Lowering the mean water level will produce an additional 145 acres of emergent marsh.<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> Emergency construction in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew has partially addressed the proposed restoration of this site. Accordingly, the State is no longer willing to share the cost for additional work.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> It is anticipated that federal funds will not be expended for this project.<P>


<STRONG>IV.  Selection of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration
         Projects for FY 1993</STRONG><P>

Three projects were selected from the Task Force PPL2 for NMFS sponsorship during FY 1993. These projects are likely to be funded through cooperative agreements between the State of Louisiana and the NMFS.  The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75%:25% cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA. <P>


<EM>A.  POINT Au FER   </EM><P>
<EM>Site Description </EM> Point Au Fer is located near the delta of the Atchafalaya River in Terrebone Parish.  Saltwater wetlands dominate the seaward parts of the island, while the northern area consists primarily of intermediate marshes. Two pipeline canals, one dredged around 1960 from Mosquito Bayou to the Gulf of Mexico which intersects another older canal linking Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier, have allowed for rapid salt water intrusion into the brackish and/or intermediate marshes. At a second site on the western side of the island, approximately 600 yards of beach separating the Gulf of Mexico from an oil access canal near Locust Bayou, is experiencing overwash and salt water intrusion. The effects of Hurricane Andrew exacerbated the problems at both locations.  The north-south canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico was opened by the hurricane, allowing salt water intrusion into the marshes. The beach area located at the second project site was also breached. Therefore, it is important that restoration activities start immediately. This project is targeted to be the first of three to be implemented in the Atchafalaya delta region.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> Four canal plugs will be constructed in the pipeline canal between Mosquito Bay and Bay Castagnier. Similarly, three plugs will be constructed in the north-south pipeline canal between Mosquito Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. The existing plug at the seaward end of the north-south canal will be strengthened and a portion of the canal 200 feet behind the plug will be backfilled. About 3500 acres of wetlands along the eastern canals will be enhanced.  At the second site, 600 yards of the eroding shoreline along the western part of the island will be enhanced by use of dredged material and shell reinforcement, thereby protecting 1900 acres of wetlands.  <P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> The completed cooperative agreement was approved by the DOC in January 1994.  Final engineering plans are currently undferway with completion by early Fall, 1994.  Construction is expected to commence in Fall, 1994.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The total cost for this project is estimated at $1.1 million with the 75% federal share equalling about $0.8 million.<P>


<EM>B.  BIG ISLAND   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description  </EM> Big Island, located at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, was created with dredged material from the Atchafalaya River navigation channel. Although no spoil has been deposited on the island since the mid-1980s, the location and height of the island prevents the river delta from expanding and creating new wetlands along the western side of the river's main channel. Dredging and other alterations have prevented the Atchafalaya River delta complex from growing despite enormous sediment inputs. Combined with erosion, an estimated 2034 acres could be lost within 20 years.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> A channel with a bottom width of 500 feet and a depth of 6 feet is to be dredged at a 45 degree angle through Big Island. This will allow water and sediment to flow around a series of delta lobes, to be created with the sediment removed from the channel, thereby allowing the delta to grow. It is expected that 300 acres of wetlands will be created using dredged material and 1200 acres of marsh are expected to form naturally over the life of the project.<P>

<EM>Current Status </EM> A final draft cooperative agreement was received by the DOC in late June, 1994 and is currently being reviewed by NOAA Grants.<P>
 

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> The total cost for this project is approximately $4.2 million with the federal portion being $3.1 million.<P>


<EM>C.  ATCHAFALAYA DELTA NATURAL
       SEDIMENT DELIVERY </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description </EM> The COE began placing dredged material at the heads of delta lobes of the eastern (natural) half of the Atchafalaya Delta.  They assumed that this would stabilize existing deltaic islands and the river channel. Unfortunately, in 1988, natural sediment transport processes and erosion sealed the delta's Natal Channel. With the gradual closing of another major delta channel (Radcliffe Pass), the loss of sediment delivery will reduce the eastward growth of the delta complex and increase the impacts of winter storm erosion on existing wetlands. Total loss over a 20-year period is estimated at 1932 acres. <P>

Proposed Restoration Activities  Dredging both Radcliffe Pass and Natal Channel will allow the natural sediment delivery process to continue. Beneficial use of dredged material will allow creation of 300 acres of new marsh. Natural marsh accretion over 20 years could total 1800 acres. This would represent a major increase of new marsh in the Atchafalaya delta.<P>

<EM>Current Status</EM> A final draft cooperative agreement was received by the DOC in late June, 1994 and is currently being reviewed by NOAA Grants.<P> 

<EM>Projected Cost</EM> This project would cost approximately $0.9 million. The federal share is $0.7 million.<P>



<STRONG>V.  Selection of NMFS-Sponsored Restoration
       Projects in FY 1994</STRONG><BR><P>

Four NMFS-sponsored wetland restoration projects (one deferred) and one shoreline protection demonstration project were selected by the Task Force for PPL3. In addition, a NMFS-sponsored project heads the list of three deferred projects. The funded projects are likely to be constructed through cooperative agreements between the State and the NMFS. The cooperative agreements will reflect the 75:25 percent cost sharing plan mandated by the CWPPRA.<P> 


<EM>A.  BAYOU PEROT/RIGOLETTES PROJECT   </EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM> The project area is the 4,255-acre peninsula between Bayou Rigolettes  and Bayou Perot in Jefferson Parish which lies in an area of maximum subsidence between the Mississippi River and Bayou LaFourche channel systems. The sediments which make up the peninsula are very fine grained and organic with little structural strength. Since the late 1920s, when the present levees along the Mississippi River were constructed, sediment input into this area has been substantially reduced. As a consequence, the bulk density of the marsh soils has fallen, causing increased marsh loss. In addition to the general marsh loss, shoreline erosion rates are very high.  Unless this peninsula is given a substantial injection of sediments, it will soon be lost.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The object is to mine 600,000 cubic yards of sediments from Bayous Rigolettes and Perot and to place these sediments along the shoreline of the peninsula. A shallow-draft barge fitted with a spray nozzle will spread the sediments into a 250-foot wide strip along the shoreline raising it by about one foot. This shoreline elevation will increase its stability. As the shoreline erodes over time, much of the dredged material would be moved inward, significantly increasing the life of the peninsula. The project will enhance 190 acres, create 100 acres and protect about 1,065 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost</EM>  The cost of this project is approximately $1.8 million with the federal share being $1.4 million.<P>


<EM>B.  LAKE CHAPEAU SEDIMENT INPUT AND HYDROLOGIC RESTORATION PROJECT  </EM><P> 

<EM>Site Description</EM> The project area, located in Terrebonne Parish, includes 13,000 acres of Point au Fer Island. Point au Fer has lost about 30 percent of its land area since the 1930s due to subsidence, erosion and construction of oil and gas canals. While the rate of wetland loss on the island as a whole is decreasing due to sediment input from the Atchafalaya River, the Lake Chapeau area is losing marsh as a result of tidal circulation through the northern portion of the island. This circulation is made possible by the many natural and manmade waterways in this area, as well as large areas of open water and broken marsh. Major marsh loss has occurred in the area surrounding Lake Chapeau and continues at a rate of nearly 15 acres per year.<P> 

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The project will include mining 500,000 cubic yards of sediment from the Atchafalaya Bay bottom, spray-jetting  the sediment over an 1,800-acre area along Lake Chapeau's shorelines and installing numerous plugs in abandoned oil and gas access canals. The project will restore marshes west of Lake Chapeau, reestablish the hydrologic separation of the Locust Bayou and Alligator Bayou watersheds, and reestablish natural drainage patterns of the Lake Chapeau area. Over 260 acres of open water will be converted to marsh. Reducing open water areas and filling shallow breaks in the marsh will protect 2,500 acres from wind-wave erosion and an additional 1,000 acres from tidal scour.  Plugging man-made canals and gapping spoil banks will restore natural sediment pathways enhancing 12,000 acres of wetlands.<P>

<EM>Current Status: </EM> A first draft cooperative agreement was received in July, 1994 and is currently under review by the Restoration Center.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $4.2 million with the federal share being about $3.1 million.<P>


<EM>C.  EAST TIMBALIER ISLAND SEDIMENT
       RESTORATION PROJECT   </EM>

<EM>Site Description </EM> The 400-acre island in LaFourche Parish is part of an island chain that fronts Terrebonne/Timbalier Bay. Louisiana's barrier islands play an important role in protecting the Terrebonne, Barataria, and St. Bernard barrier-built estuaries and their surrounding wetlands from the destructive forces of high wave energy, storm surges and salt water intrusion. All of Louisiana's barrier islands are experiencing landward migration, island narrowing and land loss as a consequence of a complex interaction among global sea level rise, subsidence, wave and storm processes, inadequate sediment supply and intense human disturbance. The loss of these barrier islands will result in the accelerated deterioration of the estuaries and the wetlands they protect, thus severely reducing coastal fisheries habitat.  <P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities</EM> The project calls for mining 890,000 cubic yards of sediment and placing it in three embayments along the landward shoreline of East Timbalier Island.  This will double the width of the island making it less vulnerable to hurricane and winter storm damage, thus increasing the island's life expectancy. The project will create at least 86 acres of vegetated land on the island and give additional protection to about 1,900 acres of mainland marshes.<P>

<EM>Current Status: </EM> A first draft cooperative agreement was received in July, 1994 and is currently under review by the Restoration Center.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $2.1 million with the federal share being $1.5 million.<P>


<EM>D.  LAKE SALVADOR SHORELINE
       PROTECTION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT</EM><P>
<EM>Site Description</EM> The project area is located on the southwest end of Lake Salvadore near Bayou Des Allemands in St. Charles Parish. This area has suffered from high rates of land loss caused by shoreline erosion. The lake rim  is breached at several locations, allowing tidal and wave energy to erode the highly organic marsh surface, resulting in large shallow ponds in the interior of the marsh. Since 1956, the project area has lost more than 1,000 acres of marsh, equating to a loss of about 25 percent of the land in the project area.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities </EM> This project is designed to test the effectiveness of two separate types of segmented timber breakwaters in highly organic, unconsolidated sediments with poor load bearing capacity. Approximately 11,100 feet of segmented breakwaters, in various configurations, will be constructed and their effectiveness analyzed. In addition, one mile of shell armored berm will be placed at existing blowouts. The project is expected to enhance about 1,003 acres of marsh and shallow water habitat, protect about 166 acres of brackish marsh and restore about 10 acres of marsh along the Lake Salvador shoreline.<P> 

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> The cost of this project is approximately $1.5 million with the federal share being $1.1 million.<P>


<EM>E.  LITTLE VERMILION BAY SEDIMENTATION
      PROJECT (DEFERRED)</EM><P>

<EM>Site Description</EM> The project area covers about 900 acres in Little Vermilion Bay, a shallow arm on the western end of Vermilion Bay in Vermilion Parish. The most important hydrologic change for this area was the dredging of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW). This channel is a conduit for sediment-rich waters from the Wax Lake Outlet to Little Vermilion Bay. Since the early 1970s about 3 feet of sedimentation has occurred in the study site. Presently, there are two man-made channels that cross the project site from the GIWW.<P>

<EM>Proposed Restoration Activities  </EM> By constructing a system of distributary channels off the two man-made channels in the project site, it is expected that increased sedimentation will be induced in shallow areas away from the main channels to eventually create emergent marsh and protect the existing shoreline from wind-wave erosion. To diminish the effects of wind-wave erosion and enhance the development of emergent marsh, a series of dredged terraces will be placed along the landward flank of each dredged distributary channel. Smooth cordgrass and bullwhip will be planted along terraces and the shoreline to reduce erosion and enhance sedimentation.<P>

<EM>Projected Cost </EM> This project is on the deferred list for PPL3 which means it may be funded if one or more of the priority projects cannot be constructed. The cost of this project is approximately $1.5 million with the federal share being about $1.1 million.<P>

<STRONG>VI.  Conclusion</STRONG><P>

NMFS participation in CWPPRA activities resulted in a successful merging of the technical and management resources of the SERO, RC and SEFSC to meet the requirements of the Act, as requested by the working committees of the interagency Task Force. NMFS has been an advocate of a comprehensive monitoring program. NMFS also proposed and nominated projects for priority lists which were important for wetland-dependent fisheries, and is the lead agency for a total of nine restoration projects from the first three PPLs. Lastly, NMFS contributed to the planning and composition of drafts and the final Restoration Plan.<P>
  
Future activities will include the revision to the Restoration Plan for Louisiana; the annual selection of priority projects; participation in monitoring and preparation of the monitoring report; and the implementation of NMFS-sponsored priority projects. <P>

		<CENTER><STRONG>	NMFS Responds to AFS Editorial on Habitat Protection Program</STRONG>
</CENTER><P>
	<CENTER>		By Rolland Schmitten
</CENTER>
	
The February fisheries editorial by AFS Executive Director Paul Brouha cites three recent assessments documenting that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Habitat Protection Program has too few resources to meet its mandated and other task. Through this response, I want to make clear that we in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) agree fully with the need to build a strong and effective NMFS Habitat Protection Program for the 1990s and beyond.

	 The loss of nearshore ocean and estuarine fishery habitat is probably the greatest long-term threat to U.S. marine fisheries productivity. Habitat loss and degradation are among the major factors contributing to poor harvests, depletion, endangerment, and extinction of living marine resources. Thus, managing stocks for long-term yield and promoting the recovery of depleted stocks is no longer sufficient. Nor is it enough to focus our greatest energies on maintaining the existence of endangered, threatened, and otherwise protected species. Conservation of living marine resources must start with habitat protection. For NMFS to fulfill the mission to conserve living marine resources, we must have an effective program for protecting the habitats that nurture and support these valuable resources.

	The assessment by the Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG), published in January, accurately portrays the major problems with our habitat program. The findings of this report are basically the same as those in the 1990 NMFS Needs Assessment by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. That all three assessments have the same major finding and conclusions is not coincidental: habitat protection receives inadequate attention in management planning, interagency decision making, and research.

	NMFS and NOAA have already taken several corrective actions, and I intend to continue these efforts to rebuild our habitat program. Activities we have recently started or soon include the following:

 	The Office of Habitat Protection will be provided with the resources and authority within NMFS to form and articulate national direction to the field offices. This will counteract the long-term, permanent attrition and redirection of staff and funding that the program has undergone .
 	NMFS will develop a multi year budget initiative to obtain adequate resources to conduct a successful national habitat protection program When completed, the initiative will be incorporated into NOAA's Strategic Plan and associated budget initiatives.

 	The extent to which NMFS habitat protection resources are redirected to carry out other NOAA/NMFS programs will be assessed. These resources will be recommitted to mandated habitat protection responsibilities.

 	NMFS will work to improve the current Clean Water Act Section 404(q) Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. departments of the Army and Commerce.  

 	A national performance tracking system to evaluate and document program accomplishments will be developed, funded, and implemented.

	Recently, NOAA Administrator James Baker said NOAA would support our efforts to have the NMFS Office of Habitat Protection directed by a senior executive. Also to enhance the chances of budgetary success for the multi year NOAA habitat initiative, I will propose transferring the habitat program into the Rebuilding U.S. Fisheries and Restoring Protection Species categories of NOAA's Strategic Plan.

	NOAA's response to the OIG report states an intention to make the NMFS habitat program needs a high NOAA priority. We will work closely with appropriate NOAA officials to ensure this program achieves equal status with our fisheries and protected species program. Fortunately, recommendations in the three program assessments provide us with an excellent blueprint for program building; we just need to roll up our sleeves and have at it.

	But NOAA cannot accomplish the job alone. AFS editorial support is an indication of concern and is appreciated. To get the job done, we must have greater public and professional involvement in strengthening the habitat component of fishery management and, in particular, NMFS's habitat protection and restoration activities.

<STRONG><BODY>C. Southeast Region<P></STRONG>
<P>

	The Southeast Region with its office in St. Petersburg, Florida (see figure 10) has large areas of productive and commercially valuable marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats that are under severe pressure from urban and industrial development. Accordingly, this region concentrates its programs on the review of the more than 4,000 individual and public projects each year that propose to alter  wetlands. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) in Miami, Florida studies the effects of habitat degradation and loss on the estuarine and coastal ecology and food chains of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Significant research projects are under way to determine habitat use by species, habitat values, and restoration and creation of fish habitat.<P>

<P>

	Research on Created Marsh and Seagrass UtilizationTo increase understanding of the role of created marsh and seagrass meadows as habitat to living marine resources and in the stabilization of sediment, NMFS and the COE modified three eroding dredged material disposal sites in North Carolina. This effort was initiated in 1987 and was conducted under a joint memorandum of agreement to restore and create fish habitat. The original research design of these three sites incorporated examination of animal linkages between marsh habitat composed of smooth cordgrass and adjacent seagrass habitat.<P>
<P>

	Marsh was created and seagrass planted using an experimental design that would allow various planting methods and designs to be independently tested and compared. As a consequence of the research efforts, marsh and seagrass habitats have been established. As of spring 1992, the smooth cordgrass plantings had colonized the unplanted portions of the study sites, forming continuous marsh and the surviving seagrass plantings have merged into solid beds. A 3-foot-wide strip of oyster culch was placed along some of the marsh edges. The effect of culch on increasing stabilization of the sediments and on increasing habitat diversity will be examined. NMFS believes that living marine resources will begin using the culch and that this area and the adjacent marsh will support more animals than those marsh areas without culch.<P>
<P>

	The data on use of created marsh and seagrass habitat by living marine resources during the initial 3 years of the study will be used for study development during year 6 (1993) and year 7 (1994) of the experiments. Information on plant colonization and animal use of these habitats for the 3-year study period are currently being analyzed. Preliminary data on the culch phase of the study is also under analysis.<P>

   <STRONG>  Seagrass Restoration On Treasure Hunting Excavations<P></STRONG>

	At the request of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the Beaufort Laboratory of NMFS' Southeast Fisheries Science Center initiated a seagrass restoration project within the boundaries of the sanctuary. During 1992, underwater excavation occurred in connection with treasure hunting activities. The excavations varied in size and occurred in turtle grass dominated seagrass meadows. The excavation resulted in direct habitat losses and associated mounds of excavation debris are being eroded onto surrounding seagrass beds.<P>
<P>

	Beginning in May 1993, staff from the Beaufort Laboratory conducted a cooperative effort with Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary staff torestore bottom topography at some locations. Once recontoured, seagrasses will be transplanted at the sites. To compensate for the exceptionally slow growth and  colonization rate of turtle grass, faster growing species of seagrasses will be transplanted to the sites and evaluated for performance. The recolonization effort is expected to require several years and periodic monitoring is planned.<P>

  <STRONG>Coastal America Restoration Project At Cockroach Bay</STRONG><P>


	A $300,000 grant to the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program (NEP) was one of the first announced under the Coastal America initiative. The Tampa Bay NEP grant launched an ambitious habitat restoration project expected to extend over the next 10 to 20 years.  NMFS is a project sponsor and part of the group that helped to obtain approval for the grant.<P>
<P>

	Planned work will restore a 651-acre site acquired by the Hillsborough County Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program. A mosaic of wetlands and uplands will be created to improve water quality and restore estuarine and coastal habitats. This will restore significant habitat for fisheries within the Tampa Bay system, an estuary that has lost more than 11,000 acres of intertidal wetlands.<P>
<P>

	Much of the restoration started in the fall of 1992 occurred at Cockroach Bay which, despite its  name, is the crown jewel of the Tampa Bay estuary system. The restoration work at the Bay will be the largest ever in Florida and one of the largest restoration construction efforts in the country.<P>
<P>

	The project is coordinated by the Southwest Florida Water Management District.  The Cockroach Bay Restoration Alliance, an advisory committee whose members represent business and all levels of government including NMFS, is designing and implementing the plan. The conceptual plan for phase one's 200-acre area has been completed and approved for implementation at an estimated cost of $2.1 million. Survey work and detailed designs are complete. Volunteers have begun removing non-indigenous species and cleaning up the site. The first phase of the work will produce varied habitats in a series of interconnected water basins with differing salinity levels. New ponds to provide biological pretreatment of stormwater before it enters the bay are also included in phase one.<P>
<P>

	In addition to funding from Coastal America and the State of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation and the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission have pledged $200,000 each to the restoration effort. The Southwest Florida Water Management District's Surface Water Improvement and Management program has committed an additional $650,000 to the restoration. Hillsborough County's purchase of the site for $2.04 million made the program possible.  The Florida Department of Natural Resources, the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, NMFS, EPA, USFWS, USGS, and COE also are part of the sponsoring coalition.<P>
<P>
<P>
   <STRONG> Restoration Of Fish Access To Wetlands Impounded For Mosquito Control<P></STRONG>


	NMFS is a member of Florida's Subcommittee on Managed Marshes, a component of the  Coordinating Council on Mosquito Control. The Subcommittee is restoring fisheries habitat in wetlands that have been impounded for mosquito control. The positive effects of this restoration are naturally reducing salt marsh mosquito production (e.g., fish predation of mosquito larvae); reducing the use of insecticides that harm fish and crustaceans; and increasing fish production by restoring access and tidal exchange to wetlands that have been isolated for many years.<P>
<P>

	The actions of this Subcommittee over the years have returned thousands of acres of wetlands to production. Recent examples include the rehabilitation of disturbed wetlands at Canaveral National Seashore in Volusia County near the Indian River and Merritt Island.<P>
<P>

	At Cape Canaveral, over 14 miles of new water courses will be established using a rotary ditcher.  This technology creates shallow water areas with minimal environmental impact from disposal of dredged material. Several dikes also would be breached to allow tidal exchange and access by living marine resources. When completed, the total work will restore productivity to about 1,600 acres of coastal wetlands.<P>
<P>

	About 595 acres of coastal impoundments near the Indian River have been beneficially modified by adding culverts with water control structures and electric pumps. Through the Subcommittee's actions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in Brevard County also is restoring approximately 1,042 acres of marsh that was impounded in the 1960's
for mosquito control.<P>

        <STRONG> Coastal Wetland Planning Protection And Restoration Act Activities<P></STRONG>


	This Act of 1990 establishes a Task Force composed of representatives of the EPA, DOC (NOAA), DOI, USDA, and the State of Louisiana. The Task Force prepared and transmitted to Congress an annual priority list of wetland restoration projects for the State of Louisiana. It also required a comprehensive Coastal Restoration Plan for Louisiana by the end of 1993 which would provide the basis for selecting future priority projects lists.<P>
<P>

	The State of Louisiana is required by the Act to prepare a Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan which specifies how the State will develop and implement the Coastal Restoration Plan, achieving no-net-loss of wetlands from future development.<P>
<P>

	Project planning and implementation is supported by a tax on small engines and equipment. The Act requires the State of Louisiana to provide 25% of the cost of restoration projects. Louisiana has established a Restoration Fund to meet this requirement which is administered by the COE. Of the amount appropriated, 70% (not to exceed $70 million annually) is to be available for wetland restoration projects and associated activities (about $35 million was available in 1992).<P>
<P>

	The Act also created a 50%-matching-fund grants program administered by the USFWS to encourage other coastal states to implement coastal wetland conservation projects. The process of selecting wetland restoration project proposals has begun. The Task Force selected 14 projects for its Priority List for 1992 and 15 were selected for 1993. Public input was sought during this selection process. Proposals were evaluated on the basis of the technical (scientific) merit, cost effectiveness, and wetland quality.  Implementation of additional projects will be considered annually.<P>
<P>

	Federal agencies on the Task Force can serve as sponsors for restoration projects. NMFS sponsored five of the projects selected for 1992 and 1993. The cost of these combined projects is about $7 million. These projects will be cooperatively  implemented with the State.<P>

<P>
         <STRONG>Coastal Marsh Management Projects Affecting Fishery
                            Resources<P></STRONG>

	Since the mid 1980s, NMFS has recommended that an environmental impact statement be prepared by the COE to address individual and cumulative impacts of marsh management in coastal Louisiana.  NMFS believes that a comprehensive environmental analysis was needed because of substantial public controversy surrounding this issue, the known adverse impacts to living marine resources, and the
uncertainty of impacts to coastal wetland habitats.<P>
<P>

	Marsh management basically involves the alteration of marsh hydrology and impounding or semi-impounding wetlands to enhance waterfowl and furbearer production and to maintain marshes that are subsiding, eroding, or otherwise deteriorating. Fisheries resources are often adversely impacted by  access restrictions and commercial and recreational fisheries may be further stressed. The economic consequences related to losses of fishery resources are not known but are expected to be considerable. For example, fisheries losses associated with one recently proposed 3,160-acre impoundment were estimated to exceed $673,900 in annual fisheries benefits.<P>
<P>

	Over the last decade, the COE has authorized the impounding and hydrological manipulation of more than 380,000 acres of marshlands in Louisiana. NMFS estimates that 71 marsh management projects impacting over 500,000 acres of coastal marsh and shallow waterbottoms have been advertised for public comment from 1982 through 1992. Of this area, permits authorizing various forms of structural marsh management activities impacting over 400,000 acres of estuarine fishery habitat have been issued.  Notwithstanding the potential environmental impacts, the cumulative effects of these actions have not been adequately addressed nor has the need of this activity been established.<P>
<P>

	NMFS is concerned that many more marsh management projects will be proposed and implemented in the future. For instance, the Louisiana Coastal Wetland Conservation and Restoration Plan for 1990-92 contains at least 26 projects that could be categorized as marsh management. These would affect about 200,000 acres of wetlands. The Soil Conservation Service's Calcasieu-Sabine River Basin Study recommends construction of dozens of water control structures that, if implemented, would result in the active or passive management of all wetlands between Calcasieu and Sabine Lakes.<P>
<P>

	NMFS is pursuing a moratorium on marsh management projects pending completion of a  comprehensive assessment of this category of wetland alteration. This issue has been raised to the Department of the Army under procedures established under the Clean Water Act. Efforts geared to resolving NMFS' concerns are expected to continue for many years.<P>
<P>
<P>

              <STRONG> Wetland Impoundment To Enhance Waterfowl<P></STRONG>

     <STRONG>     And Furbearer Production in Terrebonne Parish<P></STRONG>


	NMFS' efforts successfully prevented the impoundment of more than 3,160 acres of wetlands in Louisiana when an applicant withdrew a COE permit request because of the opposition. NMFS estimated that about $250,000 in annual fisheries benefits would have been lost had the project been authorized and built.<P>
<P>

	The project site was on the southwestern portion of Point au Fer, a coastal barrier island  approximately 28 miles southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish. The applicant planned to place 3,160 acres of predominately brackish marsh under levee management-- for the purpose of reducing wetland erosion and enhancing waterfowl use at the site. Plans included refurbishing existing natural and man-made levee segments with dredged material; constructing new levees; installing and maintaining 12 fixed and variable-crest water control structures and two earthen plugs; repairing five existing fixed-crest weirs and one earthen plug; and regulating surface water  exchanges within and into the impounded areas.<P>
<P>

	The project sponsors issued claims that the desired action would enable improved "management" of the marsh, abatement of erosion and improved waterfowl and furbearer production. NMFS' concerns centered on the proposal's adverse consequences to fishery resources (e.g., severe restriction of access). Additional NMFS concerns were raised due to the experimental nature of the project. Marsh management has not been demonstrated to prevent wetland deterioration. Further, there is evidence that the marsh is being maintained or augmented. The project site lies within the Atchafalaya River System, one of the few areas in Louisiana with a suitable sediment source for marsh building and maintenance.<P>
<P>

	Additional issues focused on cumulative effects on fisheries resources that use the Point au Fer area. These include Atlantic croaker, red drum, sand seatrout, spotted seatrout, southern flounder, gulf menhaden, spot, striped mullet, brown shrimp, white shrimp, and blue crab.  It is also believed that the endangered Kemps ridley sea turtle uses watercourses in the project area and feeds on blue crabs that are produced there.<P>

                       <STRONG>Coastal Marsh Created On<P></STRONG>

               <STRONG> Artificial Island In Roanoke Sound<P></STRONG>

	NMFS cooperated with the COE to create regularly and irregularly flooded coastal marsh in Roanoke Sound, Dare County, North Carolina. The work was accomplished under a memorandum of agreement to restore and create fish habitat. Fringing wetlands comprised of smooth cordgrass and black needlerush were planted along the edges of an artificial island created by disposal of material dredged during maintenance of an adjacent navigation channel.<P>
<P>

	The project, which is expected to extend over a 5-year period, utilizes NMFS biologists as technical advisors for the marsh planting. NMFS also assisted in logistical support and in the collection of plant materials used in the planting effort. The newly created marsh is monitored by NMFS biologists and the information obtained is used to establish priorities for subsequent plantings.<P>
<P>

	The project's benefits are numerous. The newly created marsh stabilized the island's shoreline and reduced the amount of dredged material that might otherwise reenter the navigation channel. With growth, the newly created wetlands are expected to produce plant materials for estuarine food chains and provide cover and feeding sites for fish and invertebrates. This should result in an increase of the production of local fisheries species such as summer flounder, bluefish, Atlantic croaker, spot, shrimp, and blue crab.<P>
<P>

	The project has also provided a convenient training site for students and instructors taking the Wetland Development and Restoration Training Course at the nearby Corps Coastal Research Facility located at Duck. In 1992, students and instructors planted approximately 300 linear feet of fringing marsh.<P>

     <STRONG>            Oregon Inlet Jetties Project<P></STRONG>


	Oregon Inlet, located near Cape Hatteras on North Carolina's Outer Banks, is one of three tidal passes connecting Pamlico Sound to the Atlantic Ocean. Stabilization of the inlet, using parallel jetties extending approximately 4,500 feet into the Atlantic Ocean, has been approved by Congress. Project construction, however, cannot proceed until environmental issues involving jetty-related effects have been resolved. NMFS is active in efforts to ensure that adverse impacts to living marine resources are understood and avoided.<P>
<P>

	Pamlico Sound is the Nation's third largest estuary and supports productive commercial and recreational fisheries. Over 90% of the commercially important marine fish landed in North Carolina are dependent on estuarine waters during some stage of their life history. Of these species, a large portion spawn offshore and then, as larvae and juveniles, must negotiate coastal inlets to reach estuarine sites where growth and development occurs. Recent findings by NMFS' Southeast Fisheries Center and North Carolina State University researchers indicate that the jetties could hamper sub-adult fish ingress into the sound by modifying local currents. Since recruitment reductions of as much as 60% may be possible, NMFS has informed the COE, the lead Federal agency for constructing the project, of this potential impact and of the need for further evaluation in connection with the Federal environmental review process.<P>

         Restoration Of Anadromous Fish Habitat In The Savannah River
<P>
	In 1977, COE initiated work to improve navigation in Savannah Harbor. A key project feature was the construction of a tide gate across the Back River, an arm of the Savannah River. The purpose of this feature was to reduce shoaling in navigable portions of the Savannah River. This would be accomplished by diverting water flows from the Back River through a newly dredged channel called New Cut to the Harbor area of the Savannah River.  It was believed that the subsequent increased water flows in the area of Savannah Harbor would decrease the need for maintenance dredging.<P>
<P>
	The tide gate was subsequently built and the water diversion features were implemented. After project implementation, it became clear that the tide gate had severely modified environmental conditions in the Back River as well as the areas influenced by its waters. For example, freshwater habitats became saltier and water velocity subsided. These changes produced many adverse environmental consequences of which two are notable. First, water quality and habitat conditions were modified, which resulted in adverse effects on anadromous fish under NMFS purview. Waters became too salty to be used as spawning habitat and dissolved oxygen levels were too low for survival of striped bass eggs and young. The reduced flows also caused fish eggs to drop from the water column to the river's floor where they died. The second major adverse project effect was severe damage to wetlands at the Savannah River National Wildlife Refuge. Saltier water was causing freshwater marshes to die or to be replaced by more salt-tolerant plants. These changes were damaging waterfowl and other species that the refuge was originally established to protect.<P>
<P>

	A coalition of resource agencies including NMFS, USFWS, and the States of Georgia and South Carolina apprised COE of the severe adverse impact of its project and recommended reversal of the environmental changes caused by the tide gate and the New Cut diversion. Many years of consultation and comprehensive studies eventually convinced COE of the need to modify its operations. This resulted in permanent deactivation of the Back River tide gate operation and blocking of New Cut. The completed project is expected to meet navigation needs and protect striped bass. It is
anticipated that the Savannah River National Wildlife Refuge will revert to conditions that existed before the tide gate operations began.<P>

              <STRONG>Galveston Bay Area Navigation Project</STRONG>
<P>

	This project, as originally proposed, entailed widening and deepening the Houston and Galveston Ship Channels for a total distance of more than 90 miles. The project purpose was to reduce delays in shipping, increase safety, and allow deeper draft and more efficient vessels to use the channel. The project's cost was expected to exceed $500 million and involve dredging and disposal of about 100 million cubic yards of silt and clay. NMFS' primary concerns related to that portion of Galveston Bay that would have been adversely affected by dredging (1,000 acres) and disposal (over 12,000 acres); potential effects of hydrological changes within the Bay; and modification of habitat used by fisheries resources such as oysters and shrimp.<P>
<P>

	By including Galveston Bay in the National Estuary Program, the U.S. Congress has recognized its national and local value as a habitat and harvest area for fish and shellfish. The Bay yields an abundance of fish and shellfish and is the most popular marine recreational fishing location in Texas.  Commercial fish and shellfish caught or nurtured in Galveston Bay were valued at over $26 million to fishermen in 1986. Recreational fishing expenditures in the vicinity of Galveston Bay during 1986 exceeded $171 million.<P>
<P>
	
	NMFS, in association with other agencies, requested COE to further review the environmental impacts of the proposed project. The process of seeking project authorization was subsequently suspended until all significant adverse effects have been minimized and studies that more adequately assess potential environmental impacts have been completed.<P>
<P>

	Following extensive negotiations, COE elected to perform seven supplemental investigations and the Port of Houston agreed to fund efforts that would ensure beneficial disposal of the dredged material.  NMFS is assisting in the development of plans for beneficial use of the dredged material in Galveston Bay ranging from marsh creation to construction of islands for bird use. Of these, five have been recommended for inclusion in the overall beneficial use plan.<P>
<P>

	In addition to identifying beneficial uses of dredged material, NMFS and NOAA are providing technical assistance on 3-D hydrodynamic/oyster and salinity models of the bay. The salinity models are being developed by COE's Waterways Experiment Station and the hydrodynamic/oyster model is being developed by Texas A&amp;M University. The models will be used in feasibility and impact assessment in conjunction with planned beneficial disposal techniques. NMFS efforts and involvement with this significant Federal project are projected to continue into the next century.<P>

            <STRONG> Protection Of Flower Garden Coral Banks</STRONG><P>


	The Flower Garden Coral Banks, located about 110 miles off the Texas coast, have been noted by the NOAA's Sanctuaries and Reserves Division as "unique among the banks of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in that they bear the northernmost tropical Atlantic coral reefs on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard-bank communities in the region. Additionally, the Flower Gardens have been designated under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act as Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern.  The site is also pending designation as a National Marine Sanctuary.<P>
<P>

	In June 1991, NMFS learned that a major oil company planned to place an oil pipeline between the East and West Flower Garden coral banks. The proposed pipeline route would have passed about a mile south of the East Flower Garden Bank,turn north between both banks, and traverse ten fault scarps.  NMFS was concerned with this proposal because of the ecological importance of the Flower Gardens and the potential for direct and indirect adverse impacts resulting from the pipeline. Physical disruption of habitat was possible with the proposed pipeline alignment as well as the potential for spills associated with pipeline failure. Geological fault lines were to be crossed. There was also considerable concern that the project would be precedent-setting and lead to a proliferation of similar activities.<P>
<P>

	Because of NMFS' involvement and coordination with the National Ocean Service and the Minerals Management Service (the permitting agency for the project), an acceptable alternative to proposed alignment was negotiated. This negotiated alignment routed the pipeline and all future pipelines to the north and west of the Flower Gardens. The pipeline was subsequently installed along the new alignment and was built with improved shutdown and monitoring provisions. The integrity of the Flower Gardens was preserved and potential future problems were avoided.<P>

	<STRONG>	Lake Gaston Freshwater Supply Project</STRONG>	<P>

 
	Since the 1970s, NMFS has been involved in a proposal by the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, for approval to withdraw 60 million gallons of water per day from Lake Gaston on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The lake is a reservoir and component of the Roanoke River System. The Roanoke River flows through an extensive floodplain of national significance and forms the major tributary of Albemarle Sound. Albemarle Sound was designated as one of the first national estuary programs by the EPA.  The Roanoke River's wetlands are considered to be the largest intact, and least disturbed, bottomland forest ecosystem remaining in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The diverse habitats of the system support a rich array of wildlife and fish species.  Surface waters of the river currently are used for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes and for maintaining habitats for wildlife and
fish species.<P>
<P>

	The City of Virginia Beach has proposed construction of an 85-mile-long pipeline that would supply its water needs from Lake Gaston.  The City has apparently exceeded current water supply capacities.  The State of North Carolina strongly objects to the consumptive use of its waters by the City of Virginia Beach. The City, on the other hand, has committed millions of dollars to the pipeline project and claims to face considerable economic hardship because insufficient water exists to support growth.<P>
<P>

	Because water is already severely partitioned within the Roanoke River system, NMFS has been concerned with the cumulative effect of continued water withdrawals on already stressed estuarine and anadromous fisheries resources such as striped bass. NMFS maintains that knowledge concerning relationships between river flow and fishery production, cumulative effects of continued water withdrawals, and effects of flow modifications on resources in the Albemarle Sound is insufficient.  Therefore, it cannot beguaranteed that continued individual and cumulative consumptive water withdrawals would not have adverse environmental consequences. NMFS has recommended to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal agency responsible for approving the permit modification, that additional studies and environmental documentation be done to help determine and describe the environmental impact of the City's proposal.<P>

<P>
	The Northeast Region with its Office in Gloucester, Massachusetts has critical estuarine and riverine habitats to protect and faces significant development pressures. The Region also manages long-established, economically-important offshore and coastal fisheries. The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts conducts research related to North- and Mid-Atlantic offshore, coastal, and estuarine species and their habitats. Its laboratories study the effects of ocean dumping, industrial and domestic contaminants, and urban and industrial expansion on fish, marine mammals, endangered species and all associated habitats.<P>

     <STRONG> <H1>Increased Involvement in Hydroelectric Project</H1>
</STRONG>
	In the past, due to limited staff and budget in the Northeast Region, NMFS has deferred review of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission applications to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Because of the large number of projects being relicensed in the region, the depleted status of migratory fish stocks, and the tremendous potential of these long term licenses to have significant adverse effects on resources for which NMFS is responsible, the Regional Office is increasing its participation
in the review of these applications.<P>
<P>

	The Habitat and Protected Resources Division requested technical assistance from the Northwest Region's Environmental and Technical Services Division. A hydraulic engineer from the Northwest visited the region for two weeks in 1993 to evaluate projects and to train fisheries engineers. This was the first component of a regional effort to develop in-house expertise to support NMFS evaluations and recommendations for fish passage, and to maintain high quality habitat for anadromous fish.<P>
<P>
<P>
              <STRONG>     <H1>Mapping River Basins</H1></STRONG>


	In an effort to view habitat concerns from a broader perspective, NMFS is generating data bases for individual river basins throughout the northeast. By keeping track of cumulative impacts to a particular river system rather than addressing each potential impact individually, NMFS will be better able to assess the health of the system and the stresses affecting it. Spawning and nursery habitat areas for anadromous fish, the location of dams with and without fish passage, and sites of point source pollution are just a few of the types of data being collected and compiled. The goal is to eventually incorporate this information into a geographic information system so that it may be readily accessed, modified, and displayed. <P>
<P>
<P>
                <STRONG><H1>Efforts to Protect Anadromous Fish</H1></STRONG>

	NMFS continues to work effectively through the Section 10/404 program to implement its mission relative to anadromous fish conservation, enhancement, and restoration. The Region was successful in having a stream barrier removed from Burch Branch in Prince Georges County, MD, to partially compensate for filling 3,000 linear feet of headwater stream. The removal will restore spawning river herring runs to approximately one-half mile of pristine upper perennial stream. <P>
<P>

	The regional staff was also successful in having its recommendations incorporated into the permit issued for Greensprings Plantation, a housing project near Williamsburg, VA. The plans included withdrawing and storing water from Powhatan Creek for irrigating two golf courses. The permit was
conditioned to prohibit removal of any water from Powhatan Creek between February 15 and June 1 when anadromous fish are migrating and spawning.<P>


	NMFS worked with the permit applicant for a sand and gravel mining operation on the Biles Island in the Delaware River, PA, to modify plans for a compensatory habitat enhancement proposal. The original plan would have resulted in hypoxic or even anoxic conditions that could adversely affect anadromous fish, including American shad and shortnose sturgeon. Because of NMFS efforts,
the plan was modified to eliminate the undesirable conditions.
<P>
<P>
<P>
     <H1>    <STRONG>   Water Supply Project</STRONG></H1>


	Water supply proposals still constitute a major area of activity for NMFS' Oxford, Maryland office.  Major effort has been expended on the Churchmans Marsh proposal located in New Castle County, DE.  This project would convert more than 90 acres of tidal freshwater marsh into a water supply reservoir. Our evaluation of the applicant's preliminary alternatives analysis suggested that it was biased toward the applicant's preferred alternative.  NMFS, in collaboration with the COE and EPA, was
successful in having the consultants prepare a detailed, objective analysis of potential alternatives. <P>
<P>
	Other significant water supply proposals include Spotsylvania and Henrico Counties, VA, projects.  One of the Spotsylvania alternatives includes a dam on the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg that will require fish passage facilities. The Henrico proposal is to withdraw water from the James River,  which has resulted in implementation of an Instream Flow Study to determine how much water can be allocated without adversely affecting aquatic resources.<P>
<p>

	NMFS has recommended that a similar flow study be performed for the Lehigh River, PA, where proposed withdrawals for water supply threaten efforts to restore anadromous fish to the watershed. 
Both the Pennsylvania State and USFWS have supported regional staff recommendations to the Corps. <P>

      <STRONG> <H1>Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council (MAFMC)</STRONG>
</H1>
	NMFS continued to work with Council staff to educate the COE on the Council's purpose and function, the interactions between MAFMC and NMFS, and the Corps' responsibilities under the Magnuson Act. The COE has begun to recognize the expertise and opinion of MAFMC. <P>
<P>

	MAFMC's interest in developing detailed habitat maps continues. The Council has recently funded MD Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to do a demonstration project to map critical habitat.  NMFS's Oxford Laboratory staff continues to advise the Council to proceed cautiously with respect to "critical" habitat mapping because when one area is identified as critical, the implication is that other habitat lacks value or importance. <P>
<P>

	Additionally, the Oxford Laboratory staff continued to brief the Council's Habitat Committee on issues of environmental significance. This interaction has resulted in the introduction of several motions to the full Council in support of NMFS' position on Assateague Point (MD), LaGuardia Airport (NY), and
several dredging proposals in Anne Arundel County (MD). Due to NMFS input, MAFMC also approved a motion to oppose ocean disposal of dioxin-laden dredged spoil at the Mud Dump Site in New York
Bight. <P>

	Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), in coordination with NMFS, is preparing an Artificial Reef Plan for Delaware Bay and Atlantic coastal waters. Of 16 candidate sites, approximately 6 will be selected for development. We have directed them away from scrap tires as a primary "material of opportunity". Large-scale use of tires gives the perception that the artificial reef program substitutes as a solid waste disposal operation. <P>

	As a result of modifications in the 309 program mandated by Coastal Zone Management Act reauthorization, Delaware CZM staff will review all state activities to ensure consistency with the
approved plan. It is anticipated that these changes should reduce or eliminate conflicts between NMFS and certain Delaware agencies in the future. Additionally, Delaware plans to develop
a Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) for northern Delaware and has requested NMFS participation. Improved working relations within DE is a result of NMFS' efforts to work more closely with Delaware and NOAA CZM personnel on National Estuarine Research
Reserve and other CZM initiatives. <P>

	NMFS is working with Delaware DNREC on developing a holistic approach to watershed management. The initiative complements plans to develop a SAMP for northern DE. The plan will outline a framework for managing aquatic resources (e.g., surface and groundwater, living resources, physical habitat, etc.) from a watershed perspective. The management plan will define goals and
objectives, provide criteria for identifying high priority watersheds, and present a flexible process for planning and implementing watershed protection measures. The plan will be comprehensive in its approach by addressing total ecological health, including water chemistry, nearshore coastal waters, and identifying linkages between terrestrial and aquatic systems. <P>

      <STRONG><H1>Seagrass Survey Documents and Saves Valuable Habitat</STRONG>
</H1>

	A 1992 exploratory seagrass survey recommended by NMFS identified extremely valuable eelgrass beds in an area proposed for industrial development in Penobscot Bay, Maine. An environmental analysis of a proposed new port development project had been conducted previously but failed to consider potential impacts to shallow subtidal habitats. Thus, during scoping efforts for a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement NMFS recommended that the state Department of Transportation conduct a diver survey of the project area. <P>
<P>

	NMFS' advice was based on a review of past records of observations made near the project area.  The survey, using a study protocol designed by NMFS, documented the presence of extensive eelgrass beds (over 20 acres) which support a variety of finfish and shellfish including menhaden, scallops, and
lobsters.  The discovery of these resources dramatically affected the project's environmental review, and ultimately lead the COE and Federal Highway Administration to support the analysis of alternative sites for the project.<P>
<P>
<P>
               <STRONG>    <H1><B>Net-Pen Aquaculture</B> </H1></STRONG>

	From 1990 through 1992, NMFS took a lead role in developing guidelines for net-pen aquaculture facilities in Maine. The guidelines were intended to promote responsible site selection, minimize environmental impacts of net-pen aquaculture and relieve applicants of unnecessary data collection burdens.<P>
<p>

	NMFS organized an attempt among the appropriate agencies to establish joint state and Federal guidelines for aquaculture projects. This landmark effort combined the permitting requirements under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act; EPA requirements for NPDES permits under the Clean Water Act; Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) requirements under Maine's water quality classification program and clean water law; and Department of Marine Resources (DMR) requirements under the Maine Aquaculture Leasing Act.  In addition, the guidelines accommodated the concerns of NMFS, USFWS, and the Maine Department of Inland Fish and Game. The result was a streamlined
regulatory process for the public, and better opportunities for protection of aquatic habitat.<P>
<P>

	In 1993, NMFS began using divers to determine first-hand the impacts on benthic habitats that result from fish farming. Participation in these dive investigations allows NMFS to work cooperatively with the state to address the concerns of both. The COE and state now rely on NMFS' evaluation of these sites before any decision is made. <P>

               <H1>Mitigation Banking Agreement</H1></STRONG>


	NMFS staff have been active participants on the Mitigation Task Force. This group, organized by the Baltimore District COE, is composed of state and Federal regulatory and resource agencies and charged with reaching consensus on a variety of topics relative to compensatory mitigation. The Mitigation Task Force has completed a series of issue papers that include replacement ratios, site selection and plan development methodologies, monitoring protocols, and performance standards. The papers provide guidance and result in consistency when reviewing and evaluating compensatory proposals. <P>
<P>

	The Task Force has also drafted a Mitigation Banking Agreement which provides guidance for constructing and operating one or more mitigation banks by the Maryland Department of Transportation. The agreement is near finalization and concurrence was anticipated in July 1993. <P>
<P>

	Several other mitigation banks, both with and without benefit of formal agreements, have been proposed in the past year. VA DOT has nearly exhausted the mitigation credits in their existing
bank and is seeking one or more replacement sites. Additionally, Prince Georges County, MD Department of Public Works; the City of Virginia Beach, VA; and Wetland Studies and Solutions, Inc., a
private company, are seeking approvals for wetland banks.<P>
<P>

	It has been difficult for the Mitigation Task Force to maintain consistency when reviewing these various proposals. Clearly, there are advantages to mitigation banking with state highway agencies when dealing with large numbers of relatively small impacts along a linear corridor. <P>
<P>

	However, when private, profit-motivated corporations enter the wetland banking arena, the results may be tantamount to buying and selling permits. The task force continues to proceed cautiously to preserve its ability to negotiate with the Corps and would-be bankers for the benefit of living marine resources.

    <STRONG>  <H1>Oyster Reef Restoration, Neale Sound and Bonum Creek</STRONG>
</H1>

	The Neale Sound and Bonum Creek projects were constructed according to the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the COE and the NMFS on the beneficial use of dredged material for fish
habitat restoration. Following the success of the pilot project in Slaughter Creek, MD, other sites were investigated for their potential for restoring oyster reefs in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. These two sites in the Potomac River were identified as having characteristics suitable for restoration of
oyster habitat.  At both places, sandy dredged material was deposited and covered with oyster shell to promote attachment of oyster spat. The result was the successful establishment of productive oyster habitat on approximately 5.3 acres at Neale Sound (1991) and 4.1 acres at Bonum Creek (1992).<P>
<P>
<P>
        <STRONG><H1>Patapsco River Anadromous Fish Restoration </H1></STRONG>

	One of the commitments of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement is to eliminate impediments to the migration of anadromous fish. Pursuant to that commitment, the State of Maryland identified the Patapsco River Basin with its four major and many minor blockages as a priority for restoration. <P>
<P>

	At the mouth of the Patapsco is Baltimore Harbor where development proposals requiring COE permits are required. The NMFS Northeast Region reviews such proposals and attempts to mitigate adverse impacts to living marine resources. Because of the highly-developed and frequently degraded nature of habitats in Baltimore Harbor, on-site mitigation is often not feasible or is undesirable. As an alternative, NMFS was instrumental in having mitigation requirements directed to habitat restoration
efforts in other parts of the Patapsco Basin.  As a result, more than $600,000 was channeled to the MD DNR for construction of fish ladders at Simpkins and Daniels Dams. With completion of the Patapsco restoration effort, more than 30 miles of the mainstem of the river will be reclaimed for migratory fish. <P>
<P>

	Additionally, NMFS was successful in having the Seagrams Dam removed from Deep Run, a  tributary to the Patapsco, as part of the mitigation for a highway (I-195) construction project. Removal of this blockage restored 5 to 6 miles of stream to fish migration. <P>

	NMFS, with strong support from the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), was successful in preventing construction of Assateague Point Marina, a proposed 250-slip marina in Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland.  Baltimore District COE has denied the proposal because of potential impacts to juvenile summer flounder. The marina was to be located in an important summer flounder nursery area.  Summer flounder stocks are extremely depressed, partially because of habitat  degradation, necessitating strict management measures. <P>

	Federal navigation projects implemented by the COE are routinely reviewed by the Habitat Program of the Northeast Region. In 1992, it became evident that sea turtle issues were becoming increasingly more frequent with proposals in lower Chesapeake Bay and coastal Virginia. Coordination of these proposals with NMFS has resulted in initiation of a joint Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation with Norfolk and Baltimore Districts and the Coast Guard. Joint consultation should afford a more comprehensive evaluation of the issues and greater protection of the resource. <P>

      <STRONG> <H1>Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site Designation </H1></STRONG>


	NMFS was heavily involved in the site designation process for the Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site for clean dredged material completed in 1993. The site is located near the interim site, the historic industrial waste disposal site, and the recently designated Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.  The new site was selected after a thorough analysis of the options, impacts and site management alternatives that could be used to mitigate adverse effects of dredged material disposal. <P>
<P>

	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recognized the biological value of the general area and Stellwagen Bank specifically. To accommodate the multiple services derived from the area, EPA used a public review process supplemented with joint research efforts and a collaboration of resource  managers and researchers. That process recognized the site limitations of water depth, protected and directed fishery use, the proximity of the industrial waste site, and many of the needs of the marine
transportation industry. The designated site and its management represent a new level of appreciation for the need to make dredged material disposal workable for all concerned interests.<P>

          <STRONG> <H1>Boston Central Artery/Tunnel Project </H1></STRONG>


	NMFS' application of a holistic approach to the protection of wetlands and waterways and mitigation of impacts for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project has greatly benefited the marine
environment.  Using this approach and working through the Water Resources Subcommittee, which was formed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of impacts to wetlands and waterways from the project and the proposed mitigation effort, NMFS has been able to protect living marine resources while avoiding unnecessary and costly time delays for the project.<P>
<P>

	Blasting for the Third Harbor Tunnel had the potential to affect marine mammals and anadromous fish.  NMFS and the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries suggested that by instituting measures such as using observers on vessels and acoustic devices to detect the presence of marine species,  blasting could be allowed to continue without adverse impacts to these resources. This resulted in considerable time and cost savings for the applicant.<P>
<P>

	Material dredged during the highway project will be used to cap the 9-acre Spectacle Island, an inactive former landfill that is currently leaching refuse into Boston Harbor. This will close the landfill and prepare it to be eventually turned into a public park. The closure of this landfill requires filling 11.5 acres of waterways. The Water Resources Subcommittee has designed a mitigation package with components both inside and outside Boston to mitigate for impacts involved with this project. Two sites within Boston, the Belle Isle Fishing Company and Calf Pasture, will be excavated to recreate intertidal and subtidal habitat. In addition, 13 acres of salt marsh will be restored at Rumney Marsh in Revere.  Especially noteworthy is an artificial reef in Boston Harbor which was included in response to NMFS' concerns over the permanent loss of fish habitat. <P>

     <STRONG><H1>Portsmouth Port Authority Reduces Loss of Fish Habitat
</H1></STRONG>

	
	NMFS' involvement through 1991 and 1992 in the environmental review of a port expansion project on the Piscataqua River in Portsmouth, New Hampshire helped to minimize habitat losses for fish and shellfish and gain substantial compensation for unavoidable impacts. <P>
<P>

	The project involved an area which has endured cumulative habitat losses associated with coastal development.  The habitats at the project site consist of a linked complex of salt marsh, intertidal flats, and eelgrass beds. These habitats provide valuable shelter, foraging, and nursery habitat for river herring, Atlantic silversides, winter flounder, American lobster, softshell clams, and other recreational and commercially important species. <p>


	NMFS' persistence, along with efforts by the EPA and USFWS, persuaded the applicant to modify the design of the port expansion, reducing direct losses of eelgrass beds and intertidal flats by over six acres. NMFS was also instrumental in developing a mitigation plan for the project which will compensate for unavoidable habitat losses and advance the knowledge base regarding seagrass restoration technology in New England. <P>

               Passaic River Flood Protection Project</STRONG>


	Congress authorized the New York District COE to conduct feasibility studies on a proposed $6 billion tunnel connecting the densely populated, flood prone upper watershed of the Passaic River Basin in northern New Jersey with Newark Bay. The tunnel is expected to be 20 miles long and 40 feet in diameter, and is expected to deliver flood stage waters to Newark Bay in an hour and a half as opposed to the two days it now takes. <P>
<P>

	As part of the feasibility studies, the COE agreed to sponsor a NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) proposal to conduct baseline studies in Newark Bay for approximately $340,000. 
Sampling includes trawling and gill-netting for fish, grab samples for benthic organisms, ichthyoplankton sampling and hydrography. To date, studies show evidence of a much more abundant fauna than previously expected.  Fish sampled include striped bass, white perch, winter flounder, river herrings, and tomcod. <P>
<P>

	The Regional Office supports the studies which provide insights into environmental impacts of the proposed project as well as vital information on a piece of the estuarine ecosystem not previously studied. The information is already proving its worth in determining future directions of the COE's dredged material management program. <P>
<P>
<P>

	Iroquois Gas Pipeline The design, environmental review, emplacement and right-of-way restoration for the 24-inch Iroquois Gas Pipeline from Canada to Long Island, New York was facilitated by close and continuous involvement by NMFS.  Endangered species, anadromous and nearshore finfish and shellfish resources were at risk. Through use of a coordinated mix of mitigation measures the project was designed to allow rapid and continuous placement over the entire 536 mile length. More than 27 miles of the alignment were subtidal, crossing Long Island Sound from Milford, CT to Northport, NY. This reach included over 2 miles of shellfish beds that were initially trenched for the armored pipe, backfilled to grade and productivity restored by placement of empty oyster shells. Almost one hundred
acres of commercially-harvested oyster beds were disrupted and along the remaining alignment, benthic migrations were insured by requiring that at least two thirds of the pipe be buried. More
than six years of coordination carried the project from conception to completion. <P>

   <STRONG> Coastal Wetland Restoration and Enhancement Activities Under a<P></STRONG>

           <STRONG> "Programmatic General Permit" Arrangement<P></STRONG>

	As part of its efforts under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, USFWS applied to the COE for a Programmatic General Permit to conduct a variety of wetland creation and restoration  projects at unspecified locations on Long Island's south shore. The benefits of the General Permit include eliminating the need to apply for individual permits, focusing State and Federal marsh restoration plans into a more coherent effort and improving interagency coordination. Potentially, hundreds of acres of tidal wetlands may be restored or enhanced under this interagency initiative. <P>
<P>
	Most of the activities proposed for Long Island's south shore will be conducted and funded as a joint venture among the USFWS and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Wetlands and Mosquito Control units.  Nearly 75 tidal wetlands are currently being contemplated for restoration and enhancement under this program. Together with the State and Federal partners, EPA, the COE, and NMFS negotiated the terms and conditions for the General Permit. Typical activities included in the General Permit are culvert installation, tide gate removal, appropriate intertidal
grades and sprigging restoration, and Open Marsh Water Management. Once project plans are prioritized and funding is allocated, the resource agencies will continue to cooperate by attending pre- and post-construction site reviews. <P>
<P>
<P>

  <STRONG>    Negotiations With Commercial/Residential Developers Reduce<P>

                     Aquatic Resource Impacts<P></STRONG>

	NMFS staff have been active in pre-application coordination with representatives of the Trump organization and other interested parties regarding the proposed Riverside South development adjacent
to the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side.  Upland portions of the project will include re-routing a highway as well as constructing mixed commercial, residential, and recreational space.
<P>
<P> 
	A unique aspect of the proposal is the applicant's stated desire to incorporate environmental enhancements such as a tidal salt marsh and freshwater pond into the park design. The marsh portion of this activity would require considerable discharge of fill and other site amendments to bring portions of the coastal zone to a suitable intertidal grade to support cordgrass. <P>
<P>

	The project would destroy or degrade at least 200 acres of critical overwintering habitat for juvenile striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). NMFS staff provided
early guidance that discouraged the applicant from pursuing the fill aspect of the project further.  However, regional staff will continue to cooperate with the applicant as project plans are refined and will encourage incorporation of all appropriate environmental amenities in the final design. <P>
<P>
<P>

     <STRONG>Coordination with the Navy on Stapleton Homeport Repairs<P></STRONG>

	New York Harbor is experiencing accelerated decay of wooden portions of its infrastructure due to a resurgence of local marine borer populations that may be linked to improved water quality. Due to reduced structural integrity, many applicants including the Navy, have applied for authorization for the necessary repairs. The situation is particularly severe at the Navy's StapletonHomeport on Staten Island where several acres of relieving platform and appurtenant structures are expected to collapse within the next several years. <P>
<P>

	The Navy's preferred alternative based on cost and logistics would destroy several acres of primarily subtidal rip rap that provides cover and habitat for a variety of marine finfish andinvertebrates. In  conjunction with the other Federal resource agencies and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, NMFS is negotiating with the Navy to build a moderate profile reef nearby as in-kind compensation. The structure would be designed to attract local and transient organisms such as American lobster (Homarus americanus), crabs (Cancer sp.), black sea bass (Centropristis striata) and other species that appear to be using habitat beneath the existing relieving platform. This
option would retain similar habitat functions and values and minimize disruption to Navy operations at the Homeport facilities.

   <STRONG>    Proposed Runway Safety Overrun at LaGuardia Airport<P></STRONG>

	LaGuardia Airport's Runway 13-31, which terminates on the East River and in Flushing Bay, has  virtually no safety overrun to accommodate aborted takeoffs and other emergencies. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standard for the existing aircraft using the airport is 1000 feet of standard width runway plus adjacent emergency vehicle access lanes.  Due to the presence of a Federal Navigation channel and other factors, the applicants can only extend the runway approximately 500 feet waterward into Flushing Bay. Regardless of whether the structure is solid fill or a platform, project construction will destroy approximately 22 acres of littoral habitat and an additional 3-4 acres of intertidal salt marsh. <P>
<P>

	NMFS has been negotiating with the applicant, COE, EPA, and USFWS regarding an acceptable compensation plan. There is concern that the preferred alternative, excavating an earthen berm lying to the south of the runway, will induce mud waves and cause erosion of an expansive mudflat that has accreted to the lee of the berm since it was constructed in the 1920's. In addition to accelerating local
dredging schedules, NMFS is concerned that contaminants held in the sediments will be resuspended. The Corps of Engineers has agreed to conduct a modelling study to determine the impacts associated
with berm removal, a topic which was not included in the Environmental Impact Statement for the project. <P>

<STRONG>             EXXON BAYWAY Habitat Restoration Efforts<P></STRONG>


	On January 1 and 2 of 1990, about 567,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil spilled out of EXXON's 6 mile long pipeline from the BAYWAY refinery under the Arthur Kill.<P>
<P>


	Under provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the Federal government and the States of New York and New Jersey filed suit against Exxon. The corporation agreed to an out-of-court settlement under provisions of the 1977 amendments to Section 311 of the FWPCA. The settlement included $15 million dollars to restore the damaged environment.<P>
<P>

	Part of the settlement called for the establishment of a Trustee Committee to oversee use of settlement funds for restoration. The Trustee Committee includes one representative each from DOI, NOAA (NMFS), NYS, NJ, NYC, and the City of Elizabeth, NJ.  The Trustee Committee has established a Technical Advisory Committee, comprised of one representative from each of the Trustee agencies. The Trustee Committee also works with a public advisory committee consisting of representatives of environmental groups. <P>
<P>

	To date, the Trustee Committee has entertained 15 resolutions to spend the settlement funds and has approved 11. Approved resolutions include land acquisition, salt marsh restoration, avian studies, and the hiring of an administrative assistant. Future work will include more acquisitions and the completion of a comprehensive restoration plan.<P>
<P>

	Through these two committees, NMFS uses its habitat management expertise to direct restoration efforts and direct funding toward goals that support NOAA habitat protection mandates.<P>

<P><code>F.  <STRONG>Alaska Region<P></STRONG>
<P>
	The Alaska Region, with its main office in Juneau and field office in Anchorage, manages large, valuable coastal and offshore fisheries. These fisheries are beginning to experience problems due to urban and industrial expansion typical in the other regions. The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Seattle, Washington investigates the effects of petroleum development, logging, and mining on habitats and resources. AFSC also examines the relationship between environmental contaminants and diseases of demersal fish.<P>
<P>

	AFSC also manages the Marine Entanglement Research Program (MERP) authorized by the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment and Control Act of 1987 to study the nature, extent, and effects of North Pacific high seas driftnet fisheries on marine resources of interest to the United States.<P>
<P>

	The National Marine Mammal Laboratory, a part of the AFSC, studies the habitats of marine mammals, especially whales and northern fur seals.<P>
<P>

    <STRONG>EPA and COE Propose Exempting Alaska from Clean Water Act Provisions Based on One Percent Rule</STRONG>
<P>
	Because an estimated less than 1% of the wetlands in the State of Alaska have been developed, EPA issued a proposed rule November 4, 1992, proposing that wetlands in Alaska receive less protection under the Clean Water Act. This proposal did not consider the importance of differentiation by wetland habitat type and geographic area and their significance to fisheries resources. NMFS pointed out that projects in coastal wetlands would have more critically significant effects on Alaska's fishery resources than would development in tundra wetlands. Almost all the coastal wetlands, and probably much of Alaska's fisheries resources, could be destroyed without reaching the 1% criteria. EPA decided to withdraw the proposed rule due to extensive negative comments.<P>

	City of Valdez Seeks Installation of Pipeline to Pump Petroleum to Barges at Valdez Container Terminal</B><P>


	In May 1992, the City of Valdez proposed to modify an existing COE permit issued in 1979 that stipulated no petroleum products were to be transferred at the Valdez Container Terminal (VCT), to authorize the installation of a pipeline at that site.<P>
<P>

	The pipeline would be used to deliver refined petroleum products from a new Petro Star refinery nearby to barges at the terminal. At risk of hydrocarbon pollution was nearby Duck Flats, a 1,000 acre salt marsh (which all parties agree is an Aquatic Resource of National Importance (ARNI)) with valuable habitat for five species of salmon, over 80 species of waterfowl, shorebirds, and other birds. The calculated value of only the salmon fisheries supported by the Duck Flats was $2.3 million annually.<P>
<P>

	NMFS objected to the proposed modification in May 1993, and recommended that the permit be denied due to the adverse impact of possible oil spills and chronic low-level pollution from hydrocarbons on Duck Flats. Further, the proposed permit did not
meet the alternative analysis requirements of the NEPA and the CWA. NMFS also believed that there were unresolved national policy and procedural issues that required further consultation.<P>
<P>

	In compliance with 404(q) guidelines, NMFS regional staff requested higher review of the permit modification by the Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere (ASOA). The issue was submitted to the ASOA who then requested higher review of the permit modification by the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Civil Works (ASA(CW)).<P>
<P>

	The permit modification review by the ASA(CW) concluded that substantial and unacceptable impacts to the resources might occur as a result of spills and determined that additional evaluation of the project and the practicability of alternative sites is
required. The permit modification request was denied pending further and more thorough analysis; thus, the COE acknowledged and met all of the NMFS requests.<P>
<P>
<P>
             <STRONG>    <B>Habitat Protection Working Group<P></STRONG>

	</B>A council of six Federal and State trustees was established to administer the $900,000,000 civil settlement to restore resources and services injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. NMFS habitat biologists, in cooperation with the Office of Oil Spill Damage Assessment and Restoration, participated in the Habitat Protection Working Group during the habitat evaluation process. NMFS coordinates with the other agencies for NOAA trust resources damaged by the oil spill.<P>
<P>
The Trustee Council takes "restoration actions" such as acquisition of habitat by purchase of private land or partial interest such as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights to prevent further injury to the resources. After an extensive ranking process including evaluation of development threats, the Council approved for acquisition 7,500 acres in the China Poot area near Kachemak Bay. Seal Bay, located on Afognak Island, was also ranked highly. Acquisition of Seal Bay was discussed at the Trustee Council meeting May 13, 1993. A property owner donated 2,500 acres
clearing the way for the acquisition of all 17,391 acres. The Trustee Council approved funding for this parcel contingent on appraisals, title search, etc.<P>


                 <STRONG> Copper River Highway Construction<P></STRONG>

</B>	The Alaska Department of Transportation (ADOT) started road construction in regulated habitats in the Copper River prior to obtaining all the proper permits and 
authorizations. If completed, the road would provide a connection between the city of Cordova and the rest of Alaska. The portion of the project completed without authorization entailed the construction of approximately 200 feet of roadbed along approximately 1.7 miles of riverbank. Several clearwater tributaries and drainages were crossed. The impacts of this project resulted in the loss of important riparian wetlands
along the banks of the Copper River and the discharge of fill into clear water streams, resulting in adverse impacts to important spawning and rearing habitat for salmonids.<P>
<P>

	NMFS made formal comment to the COE on the importance of the Copper River and its tributaries in providing migration, spawning and rearing habitat for salmonids. Facts on the importance of riparian wetlands in maintaining the resources of the Copper River drainage were also provided. In addition, NMFS commented on the significance of the habitat to commercial and recreational fisheries.<P>
<P>

	The COE has taken the case to the U.S. Attorney and is presently in the discovery phase.  No trial date has been set.  In the interim, the ADOT has begun work on an Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the project alternatives and other routes available to construct a road to Cordova. NMFS has provided comments on the
preliminary alternative analysis.<P>
<P>
<P>
 <STRONG>Seafood Processing Discharge into Nearshore Marine Waters Near Dutch Harbor on the Aleutian Chain, Alaska</B><P></STRONG>


	Captains Bay, the body of water receiving the effluent, is a deep fiord with a very shallow entrance that inhibits circulation within the water column. Past research has found naturally occurring oxygen depletion within the Bay during late summer. The addition of a high-volume oxygen demanding effluent threatened the health of the Bay's resources, including commercially important fish and
shellfish. This was the first major discharge authorized for Captains Bay.<P>
<P>

	NMFS staff expressed concern about the potential impacts to fisheries resources associated with the proposed discharge. During the public review period for the permit, NMFS coordinated extensively with EPA, recommending reductions or alterations to the discharge which would minimize water quality impacts. EPA, however, decided to issue a permit for the discharge. NMFS biologists travelled to the site before the proposed permit authorization date, intending to document local marine resources in
the vicinity of the outfall. Using SCUBA gear, NMFS biologists found the processing company had begun discharging wastes prior to the effective date of the EPA permit. Further, the material
discharged was not in compliance with the pending permit's conditions. NMFS documented the discharge on a videotape which was then provided to the EPA.<P>
<P>

	As a direct consequence of NMFS' actions, the EPA's Office of the Inspector General initiated a full review of the case culminating in the issuance of a Special Report in January 1992. The Report
found EPA was not justified in issuing this permit, that improper procedure had been followed, and that enforcement of the violations had been absent or inadequate. The EPA Inspector General found 17
separate violations of the discharge limitations for this permit and recommended civil penalties as well as revocation of the permit. The EPA did not, however, revoke the authorization but did levy fines on the permittee and order full compliance with permit limitations. As a result, wastes are screened prior to discharge and the applicant now is attempting to maximize by-product recovery of fishwaste for the manufacture of fishmeal.<P>
<P>

	In conducting follow-up site investigations the following year, NMFS research biologists discovered hundreds of red king crab, urchins, and octopus dead or dying in the immediate vicinity of this plant. Analysis of biological samples collected at the site suggested the animals died from oxygen depletion. NMFS also sampled water chemistry and found dissolved oxygen levels below two ppm--well below levels that could kill many fish and invertebrates. The conditions probably result from discharging condensate from the fishmeal plant and waste water from the processing plant (both effluents have extremely high biological oxygen demand). Captains Bay has since been identified as an "Impaired Water" under Section 303 (d) of the CWA. EPA is now proposing to modify the permit and NMFS will be involved in this process.<P>
<P>
<P>
               <STRONG>  Construction of a Commercial Boat Harbor in St. Hermans Harbor, Kodiak, Alaska<P></STRONG>

	The proposed harbor would place a rubblemound rock breakwater across an 1800 foot-wide, 60 foot-deep channel between two islands. This channel is one of several local areas which act as juvenile
rearing (nursery) habitat for the red king crab. The king crab population comprises one of the State's most valuable commercial fisheries. Past census data had indicated upwards of 10,000 crabs
utilizing this immediate area. This project would destroy several acres of crab habitat through filling and partially block a migration corridor between St. Hermans Harbor and the open ocean.<P>
<P>

	NMFS biologists and scientists worked with the local sponsor, the City of Kodiak, and the COE to construct replacement habitat for the red king crab. Through NMFS research, a strong correlation between juvenile crab and certain vertical structures, such as wood piling, was discovered.  From this research, a proposal was developed to utilize the Corps construction engineers and local materials to mitigate the loss of habitat. The Corps has dedicated $75,000 to the project. NMFS personnel are acting as consultants to the Corps of Engineers and will monitor the success of the mitigation after construction.<P>
<P>
<P>
			<STRONG>Bradley Lake and Terror Lake Hydroelectric Projects</STRONG>
<P>
	The Bradley Lake and Terror Lake hydroelectric projects, planned and constructed in the late 1980's, are the two largest hydroelectric developments in Alaska. Both projects were located on important anadromous fish streams with multiple populations of Pacific salmon.They were licensed with a special condition requiring the operator to release adequate water for fish since the migrating, spawning, and rearing waters for these fish populations would have been severely reduced by upstream storage for hydro-generation.<P>
<P>

	NMFS biologists were extensively involved in the early planning processes of these projects.  Through this coordination, NMFS was able to work with the developer prior to, as well as during, the
Federal license review process. NMFS advocated release of waters to maintain all downstream fishery habitat. After construction, NMFS has maintained contact with the operators and periodically reviews each project to insure the salmon and their habitat remain viable.<P>
<P>

	The salmon populations of both hydroelectric development sites have responded, remaining stable within the Bradley River. Salmon in the waters affected by the Terror Lake project have increased by
150,000 fish since operations began.<P>
<P>
<P>
                <STRONG>  The Trans Alaska Gas System (TAGS) Pipeline to be Built by the Yukon Pacific Corporation</STRONG><P>

	A project is being developed that will include a gas conditioning plant on the North Slope and an 800-mile long, 42-inch diameter, chilled and buried pipeline. The TAGS pipeline will transport natural gas along the same route as the existing Trans Alaska Pipeline (TAPS) which carries crude oil from the North Slope to Valdez. The new pipeline will terminate at Anderson Bay approximately three miles west of the TAPS crude oil terminal. Anderson Bay will be the site of the TAGS liquefaction plant and terminal where Alaska's North Slope natural gas reserves will be transformed into liquefied natural gas and shipped to customers in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.<P>
<P>

	NMFS staff actively participated on an interagency task force involved in reviewing and commenting on the proposed TAGS route and marine terminal project. NMFS participation raised concerns that
the original EIS did not fully address impacts to living marine resources and aquatic habitat at the proposed Anderson Bay Terminal Facility including the need for additional Section 7 consultation
under the Endangered Species Act.<P>
<p>

	As a result of NMFS intervention, FERC is in the process of completing a supplemental EIS. This document responds to NMFS comments in ways that result in project changes to reduce and avoid
impacts such as:<P>
<P>
     1.   developing timing constraints for discharging of fill
          into open water to reduce impacts on fish by minimizing
          siltation and turbidity during critical life stages,<P>
     2.   changing the location of the disposal site for overburden
          to reduce habitat loss of intertidal and wetland
          areas.<P>
<P>
<P>
                 <STRONG>  Tongass Timber Reform Act</STRONG>
<P>
	The anadromous fish populations in Alaska exist because of extensive freshwater habitat for spawning and rearing of fish. In 1988, the Alaska Region of NMFS established and promoted a policy
for riparian habitat protection in Alaska in order to maintain optimum production of anadromous salmonids. Research conducted by the NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center recommended a minimum buffer zone width of 30 meters (100 feet) be maintained on each side of anadromous fish streams during timber harvest operations.<P>
<P>

	Subsequent to publication of NMFS' recommendations, an extensive conservation movement was carried out in Alaska related to habitat protection of anadromous fish habitat on the Tongass National
Forest. It culminated on November 28, 1990, in the amendment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act with the Tongass Timber Reform Act (Public Law 101-626). Contained in the law is the requirement that the Secretary of Agriculture maintain a buffer zone within which commercial timber harvesting shall be prohibited, of no less than one hundred feet in width on each side of all Class I streams (anadromous fish streams) in the Tongass National Forest and on those Class II streams (tributaries to anadromous fish streams) which flow directly into a Class I stream. NMFS staff were active in many aspects of the legislative process, including public and Congressional hearings, and success of the legislation can be largely attributed to NMFS' participation and
influence on the process.<P>
<P>

	Plans to expand the Hoonah airport required the filling of 11.5 acres of tidal-influenced wetlands.  NMFS recommended mitigation for the project include several components: l) forming intertidal pools near two small coho salmon streams at the seaward end of the runway; 2) widening and contouring Gartina Creek for spawning habitat (chum and pink salmon used the area the first season after
construction, 1992); 3) enhancing a rearing area made by flooding an abandoned 1.2 acre borrow pit by adding boulder clusters and cable-anchored trees. Coho salmon and Dolly Varden char were
observed in this area the first season after construction (1992); 4) creating a spawning area and rearing pool while re-routing a 200-foot long section of Coho Creek; 5) creating four ponds for migrating salmon rearing and resting areas in upstream Coho Creek. The stream was diverted into the ponds and has been used for spawning by pink salmon; 6) installing two new culverts so Coho Creek could be used for rearing salmon; and 7) replacing a roadcrossing at Shotter Creek with an open arch culvert to preserve the spawning area. Before any work was done in that particular section of the creek, all fish were seined and placed elsewhere in the same system.</code><P>

<code><STRONG>E.  Northwest Region</STRONG><P>
<P>
The Northwest Region with its office in Seattle, Washington also
has critical estuarine and riverine habitats to protect and faces
significant development pressures.  Like the Northeast, this
Region manages long-established, economically important offshore
and coastal fisheries.  The Northwest Fisheries Science Center
(NWFSC) in Seattle, Washington investigates the effects of
hydroelectric power development, industrial development, and
urban pollution on habitats and resources.<P>

<B>  <H1>FERC Fishway Definition Out, New Definition Needed</B> </H1>
On May 8, 1991, FERC issued Order No. 533 which included a
revised definition of "fishways" as only incorporating upstream
passage facilities.  FERC indicated that the new definition would
not decrease their efforts to ensure safe downstream passage of
fish in the licensing of hydroelectric projects.  However, in all
cases where FERC assumed such responsibility, anadromous fish
runs have failed or been severely affected and the projects
themselves are the subject of litigation or are undergoing
extensive retrofitting to correct faulty or nonexistent fish
passage facilities.<P>
<P>
NMFS requested a rehearing on the order, pointing out the
substantial body of literature that discusses fishways as
providing both upstream and downstream passage, and suggesting
that the definition be expanded to include flows, temperature
regimes, project operation scenarios, and other measures designed
to enhance or promote fish passage.  Due to this request, FERC
reconsidered its definition of the term "fishway" and issued
Order 533A which contained a new definition including downstream
passage.  However, the new definition applied to flows within the
bypass only and required that passage at the project be necessary
for the life cycle of the fish.<P>
<P>
The fishway definition dispute with FERC was rendered moot when
Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and rescinded
FERC's fishway definition.  The conference report on the Act
suggested an opportunity existed to write a regulatory definition
for fishways, so NMFS initiated discussions with the DOI to
develop regulations for implementing authority to define fishways
and to specify the process for implementing the fishway
prescription provision of Section 18 of the Federal Power Act.<P>

<B>
                     Salmon River Basin Proposed <P>
                 Hydroelectric Projects Rejected</B><P>
Historically, the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, supported major runs
of chinook and sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout.  Today, due
largely to downstream hydropower development on the Snake and
Columbia Rivers, anadromous fish production is greatly diminished. 
Nevertheless, even with the present depressed runs, the Salmon
River is the mainstay of salmon and steelhead production in Idaho
and continues to provide spawning habitat for more spring and
summer chinook salmon than any other drainage in the Columbia River
system.<P>
<P>
In the early 1980's, this production potential was threatened by
unwarranted hydropower development when FERC was presented with an
unprecedented number of applications for small hydroelectric
project licenses.  At one point, up to 80 hydropower proposals were
before FERC.  Recognizing the potential risk these projects
represented both individually and cumulatively, NMFS became an
active participant in the consultation process for these
projects.<P>
<P>
In coordination with other Federal and State fish and wildlife and
land management agencies and Indian tribes, NMFS asserted that
project proponents were obligated to develop a complete and
adequate record of potential project impacts to fishery resources
and mitigation of such impacts; that potential cumulative impacts
arising from multiple project development must be a part of this
record; and that FERC's licensing actions must be consistent with
regional or state fishery enhancement programs.<P>
<P>
In 1991, based largely on the consultation record developed by NMFS
and other resource agencies, FERC began rejecting Salmon River
Basin license applications.  In 1992, the last three applications
before FERC for projects in the Salmon River Basin were rejected. 
Thus NMFS, in assuming a lead role in the licensing and
consultation process for these projects, was instrumental in
assuring protection of Salmon River Basin anadromous fishery
resources.<P>

          Development of Wetland Evaluation Methodology</B><P>
Recent Oregon State law provides for municipalities to develop
wetland conservation plans (WCP) to ensure preservation of
high-value wetlands while directing development activities,
consistent with section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act, to
wetland areas of lesser value.  NMFS has been involved in the
formulation of a number of WCPs.  However, these activities have
pointed out the need for uniform guidelines in determining wetland
functions and establishing values for wetlands serving those
functions.<P>
<p>
In light of this need, NMFS has joined with the EPA, COE, the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality, and the Oregon Division of State Lands to
develop a wetland valuation method that will establish values for
delineated wetlands.  When developed, implementation of this
methodology will ensure preservation of high-value wetland areas
and will allow reasonable streamlining of the section 404/10
permitting process while ensuring compliance with Federal Clean
Water Act requirements.<P>

     Restoration of Elwha River Ecosystem After Removing Dams</B><P>
The construction of Elwha Dam in 1911 and Glines Canyon Dam in 1926
blocked anadromous fish passage to over 60 miles of mainstream and
tributary habitat of the Elwha River in Clallam County, Washington. 
As a result, salmon and steelhead runs were decimated and the
ecosystem disrupted.<P>
<P>
FERC initiated licensing proceedings for the Elwha Project in 1968
and the Glines Canyon Project in 1975.  FERC analyzed the
alternatives of providing fish passage through the incorporation of
passage facilities (e.g., ladders, fish screens) at the dams or dam
removal.  However, as a result of the lengthy and contentious FERC
proceedings, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration
Act (Public Law 102-495) was enacted in October 1992.  This Act
required that the Secretary of the Interior provide a Report to
Congress by January 31, 1994, detailing a dam removal plan that
would result in the full restoration of the ecosystem and native
anadromous fisheries.  Although NMFS is in the Department of
Commerce, NMFS was selected to serve in the coordinating role for
the preparation of the Report because of its expertise and
leadership role in the FERC arena.<P>
<P>
Investigations to date indicate that dam removal is feasible and
would ultimately result in the restoration of the ecosystem and
anadromous fish runs totalling about 250,000 fish per year.<P>

             Downward Trend of Fish Returns Reversed at <P>
                Baker River Hydroelectric Project</B><P>
This project is a 111 mega-watt hydroelectric project owned and
operated by Puget Sound Power and Light Company.  It is located in
Skagit County, Washington, on the Baker River which is a tributary
to the Skagit River.  Although the license for this project does
not expire until the year 2006, for the last several years NMFS has
actively participated in an ad hoc project technical advisory
committee along with the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, the
Washington Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest
Service, and the National Park Service.  The committee was formed
in the mid-eighties in response to plummeting returns of coho and
sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout to the Baker River.  The task
of the committee is to obtain baseline information and develop and
implement measures to reverse the downward trend in fish returns
and, if possible, increase them to at least historic levels. 
Through a combination of improved downstream juvenile passage, pen
rearing, and construction of a new sockeye spawning area, adult
returns have increased dramatically. Coho salmon returns increased
from 294 in 1984 to 7,400 in 1992.  Sockeye salmon returns were at
a historical low of 99 in 1985.  In 1992, 2,443 returned and over
3,000 are expected back in 1993.  Steelhead returns increased from
a low of 38 in 1985 to over 900 for the 1992-1993 season.  These
restoration efforts and NMFS' participation and support will
continue.<P>
<P>
<P>
                  <B>Yelm Hydroelectric Project</B><P>
The diversion dam for this project creates a stretch of bypass of
about 12 miles.  When water is discharged back to the Nisqually
River, fish are attracted to the tailrace discharge.  Studies
conducted by NMFS and others have demonstrated that this "false
attraction" can result in significant delays for migrating adult
salmon and steelhead.  Also, fish can become injured as they try
and ascend the draft tubes.<P>
<P>
FERC determined that there was no problem at the Yelm powerhouse
tailrace because there was no evidence indicating there was a
problem.  NMFS argued that there was no evidence because the
operators, Centralia City Light, refused the request by NMFS and
others to conduct a study of the problem.  NMFS forced the issue to
be addressed through the Federal Power Act's Section 10(j) dispute
resolution process.  During the dispute, NMFS was the lead for the
various Federal and State agencies and with their help convinced
FERC that the issue must be studied.  FERC intends to make such a
study a part of the licensing for the project.<P>

             <B>Commencement Bay Restoration Planning</B><P>
	
Commencement Bay (Tacoma, Washington's Harbor) in Puget Sound is near the top of the EPA's National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, NOAA's Northwest Damage Assessment and Restoration Center (DARC) is actively engaged in a natural resources damage assessment (NRDA) effort.  As part of this interagency natural resources trustee responsibility,The NMFS Northwest's Restoration Center has participated in extensive restoration planning undertaken in conjunction with a group of businesses and local governments identified as potentially responsible parties (PRPs). The unique combination of parallel NRDA planning paths and trustee/PRP cooperation should significantly reduce the time required to establish an estimate of damages and to ultimately effect restoration projects in Commencement Bay.<P>
<P>

	NMFS staff serves on the trustee negotiation team and as the restoration specialist in concert with the DARC Northwest resource counsel.  In these roles, NMFS has participated in the finalization of plans for a pilot restoration project for the 1991 $0.6 million St. Paul (Simpson Tacoma Kraft) NRDA settlement.  In addition, NMFS has helped craft a tentative $12 million plus property NRDA settlement with the Port of Tacoma which will accelerate local restoration planning.<P>

	<STRONG>National Habitat Program Regional Workshops Reach Out to Constituents</STRONG><P>


	As a follow-up to the AFS - sponsored meeting on the NMFS Habitat Protection Program last October (see December 1994 Habitat Happenings) NMFS held seven regional workshops with major constituents and stakeholders to identify priority actions for a revitalized National Habitat Program.  The workshops were convened in Boston, Annapolis, Charleston, New Orleans, San Francisco, Seattle and Anchorage from  February to April. Total attendance was more than 250 people with representation that included the timber industry, fishing cooperatives, environmental groups, power industry, real estate developers, and other government officials. Common themes included the need to (1) identify regional priorities, (2) become more proactive, (3) form more cooperative partnerships with all stakeholders to leverage resources and expertise, (4) strengthen the scientific basis for management decisions, (5)  incorporate watershed and ecosystem management approaches in both science and management, and (6) enhance public education and outreach. Results of the workshops are being incorporated into a strategic planning process that will produce a National Habitat Plan, which should be available for public viewing by September of 1995.<STRONG> Tom Bigford (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>	Proposed Magnuson Act Amendments Strengthen Habitat Conservation
</STRONG><P>

	The first day of the 104th Congress saw both chambers introduce legislation to reauthorize the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  The House (H.R. 39) and Senate (S. 39) bills were similar to legislation pending at the close of the last Congress.  The House Committee on Resources, Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, held a hearing on H.R. 39 in Washington, D.C. on February 23rd.  A substitute amendment was drafted and subsequently marked-up before the full Committee on May 10th.  The strengthened habitat provisions have been lauded by the Administration, as well as conservation community and industry representatives. Additional improvements to the habitat language may be proposed in late-June, when the bill is expected to go to the House floor.<P>

	On the Senate side a series of field hearings on S. 39 are being conducted by the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.  Following the conclusion of the hearings in July a substitute bill will be developed with floor action possibly in August. The habitat provisions in S. 39 are only  slightly different from the Senate bill of the 103rd Congress. Like the House version, they call for increased consultation by both the regional fishery management councils and the Secretary of Commerce on activities that may have an adverse effect on essential fish habitats. <STRONG>Ralph Lopez (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


	<STRONG>Clean Water Act Amendments Would Significantly Weaken Habitat Protection</STRONG><P>

	The Department of Commerce sent two letters on H.R. 961, the House of Representatives bill to reauthorize the Clean Water Act, to House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bud Shuster.  The letters strongly objected to the reduction in protection of wetlands and the elimination of NOAA's non-point pollution control program, as well as the lack of consultation regarding the impacts of the proposed legislation.  In addition to the letters, the Environmental Protection Agency, Departments of the Interior and Justice and the Office of Management and Budget announced in a May 10 Statement of Administration Policy their intent to recommend a veto of H.R. 961 should that legislation come to the President for signature. Despite these actions, the House passed H.R. 961 with only minor changes.  Given the concern for the potential impact to fishery resources, the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee (a citizen group reporting to the Administrator of NOAA and the Secretary of Commerce) wrote on May 18 to Senator John Chaffee, Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which has jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act in the Senate, requesting that his Committee request NOAA to "analyze the potential cumulative impact on our fishery resources if H.R. 961 were to be enacted in its present form." <STRONG>Jim Burgess (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


	<STRONG>NOAA Strategic Plan Completely Revised</STRONG><P>

	In February 1995, Administrator D. James Baker reported NOAA's decisions regarding the Coastal Stewardship Task Force mission to review all of NOAA's coastal programs. These decisions made only minor adjustments to organization of these programs and set the stage for revising the Coastal Ecosystem Health (CEH) chapter of the NOAA Strategic Plan. The CEH Team met for the first time in March under the leadership of Jeff Benoit, Director of the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS) Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM). The Team has made major revisions to the chapter.  Instead of listing the objectives of the chapter around functional activities (e.g. research, assessment, management and outreach), the new objectives are; 1) Protect and restore coastal habitats 2) Promote clean coastal waters; 3)Foster well-planned and revitalized coastal communities.   The objectives are now much more connected with the desired improvements to the resources, rather than to the governmental processes that must be taken to obtain those improvements. The draft revised plan has been sent out for review. Release of the revised NOAA Strategic Plan is expected in mid-July. <STRONG>Jim Burgess (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

	
<STRONG>	NMFS Takes Action to Save New Jersey Shellfish Beds</STRONG><P>


	NMFS has repeatedly taken the position that permits for new docks in areas of moderate and high
concentrations of shellfish in New Jersey are contrary to the public interest under the Clean Water Act's wetland provisions. In the past, NMFS has been able to rely on the enforceable policies of the New Jersey Coastal Zone Management Program (CZM) to ensure that these habitats were protected.  Unfortunately, a recent New Jersey case held that the State failed to deny permits for several docks in these high-value areas within the standard 90-day time limit. Because of this decision, the State had to issue the permits even though they were clearly inconsistent with their own  policies. NMFS has tried to convince the Army Corps of Engineers' New York and Philadelphia Districts that the Corps is not held by the court decision finding procedural problems in New Jersey, and therefore they should deny the Federal permits for these projects. However, in the first such permit the New York District did not share that view. Because of the artificial constraints of the 404(q) MOA between the Corps and NOAA, elevation of individual permits under the Clean Water Act is very difficult. NMFS has however written to the Districts explaining that both NMFS and OCRM believe the permits are inconsistent with
federally approved CZM policies and therefore should be denied. <STRONG>Jim Burgess (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Mitigation Banking Guidance Released to the Public </STRONG><P>

	After many weeks of interagency negotiations, the draft Federal interagency guidance on mitigation banking was released for public comment on March 6.  By the close of the 45-day comment period on April 20, approximately 125 comments had been  received. The majority were submitted by state resource and regulatory agencies, state and local departments of transportation (often major users of mitigation banks), oil and gas utility companies, consultants, environmental organizations, and private mitigation bankers.<P>

	In general, many of the comments are supportive of the guidance.  Development interests raised
concerns such as the apparent limit on the amount of projected credits that can be withdrawn from a bank and that requiring the interagency bank oversight team to reach consensus on decisions could slow down the establishment of banks. The environmental community raised concerns regarding the use of creation, enhancement, and preservation to establish banks, public review and comment on the establishment of each individual bank, and fears that mitigation banking will lessen emphasis on the avoidance and minimization of impacts on wetlands.<P>

	The draft guidance will be revised based on an evaluation of the comments. Final guidance is planned for release this fall.<STRONG> Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>	Small Landowner Regulation Relief</STRONG><P>

	On March 23, 1995, the Army Corps of Engineers released for public comment a new draft Nationwide Permit (NWP).  This NWP is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on small landowners and allow the fill of up to ½ acre of non-tidal wetlands for the construction or expansion of a single family home and attendant features.  Restrictions limit the use of the NWP to only once per parcel, and to prohibit landowners from using the permit on each separate parcel of subdivisions created after a certain date. The restriction on the permit to non-tidal wetlands reduces the effects the NWP will have on habitat for marine resources, but NMFS is still concerned about the cumulative impact of the proposal on habitat for anadromous and marine fish.  We also are concerned that ½ acre is more fill than may be needed for a single home. The 45-day comment period ended May 8. NMFS will be working with the Corps to revise the NWP as needed to better protect fish habitat. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


	<STRONG>National Academy Wetlands Study Released</STRONG><P>

	On May 9 the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released their long-awaited report on wetlands delineation. The basic conclusion of the report was that current practices of delineating wetlands by the Federal government are scientifically sound. Of particular importance is the fact that the study does not support using a revised wetland definition, such as the one in the House Clean Water Act amendments of H.R. 961.  The report did acknowledge room for improvement, and provided approximately 40 specific recommendations. NMFS will be working with other Federal agencies to review the report and prepare a plan for implementing its recommendations. Any changes to the present system of wetland delineation will be thoroughly field-tested with public involvement. The report also considered whether riparian areas could be protected under a wetlands definition. This question is extremely important to NMFS efforts to protect habitat for anadromous fish. Although riparian areas were determined to be extremely valuable and contribute to achieving the goals of the Clean Water Act, the NAS found that no reasonable definition of wetlands could encompass all riparian areas. The NAS recommended that if the Federal government wants to protect riparian areas, that it be done under a separate program. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325
</STRONG><P>

	<STRONG>National Wetland Loss Update</STRONG><P>

	The Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) released early in 1995 a report on their study of wetland loss on non-Federal lands from 1982-1992.  It suggests that the rate of wetland loss in the contiguous United States has slowed during the last decade, due to a combination of factors that include implementation of the Clean Water Act and the 'Swampbuster' provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, as well as economic trends. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) data indicate that the rate of wetland loss during 1975-1985 averaged about 300,000 acres per year. The NRCS data indicate that wetland loss from 1982-1992 averaged 70,000 to 90,000 acres per year.<P>

	The NRCS data and the FWS data were collected using different methods, so there is some uncertainty when directly comparing the two studies.  Confirmation of a reduced rate of wetland loss will come when the next set of FWS data is released around 2000.  Another issue of particular importance to NMFS is the rate of wetland loss in coastal areas (as opposed to a national average).  FWS data from the 1975-1985 period indicate that the rate of wetland loss averaged 20,000 acres a year. Analysis of the NRCS data from 1982-1987 (a subset of the 1982-1992 data set) suggests that the rate of coastal wetland loss is still about 20,000 acres per year. Therefore, although wetland loss is slowing on a national basis, it is continuing at an alarming rate in coastal areas, due mainly to development pressures.<STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325.

	<STRONG>NMFS Works to Protect Duck Flats Resources in Alaska</STRONG><P>

	One and a half years after elevation to the Army Corps of Engineers, the PetroStar project nearly
received a 404(q) permit.  In February the Corps submitted a notice of its intent to approve permit modifications for the project in Port Valdez,  Alaska.  NMFS remains strongly concerned that marine resources are at risk, including four species of anadromous fish, king and tanner crab, and 1,000 acres of prime salt marsh.  NMFS regional and headquarters habitat staff responded to the potential threat to the resources, working closely with the EPA to reiterate the NOAA's concerns regarding the project and to support of the use of a 404(c) veto authority. NOAA's Deputy Assistant Secretary further expressed the agency's position in several conference calls to EPA. The Administration's support for this project reflectsNOAA's commitment to its trust resources. <STRONG>Ramona Schreiber (301) 713-2325.
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>	Alaska Anadromous Resources Receive Backing from Technical Report</STRONG><P>

	The protection of anadromous species that depend on Sheep Creek for spawning habitat is supported by the recent release of a technical report. The proposed project to reopen a gold mine would have resulted in significant harm to resources through impoundment of Sheep Creek Valley, near Juneau, Alaska.   This anadromous fish stream was scheduled to be impounded to create a disposal site for cyanide-treated tailings from the mine. Effluent from the impoundment would then be discharged into Gastineau Channel. EPA has now released a Technical Assistance Report (TAR) to assist in the permit review process.<P>

	The TAR found that the proposed project contained serious environmental problems requiring
substantial alteration if the project was to receive required federal permits. As a result of the report, the applicant plans to develop a new project which would remove several of the environmental hazards earlier proposed.  The revised project will require a new Corps permit, as well as a new or supplemental EIS.  This action will require NMFS' direct involvement in the review process should the project risk harm to living marine resources. <STRONG>Ramona Schreiber (301) 713-2325

<STRONG>National Dredging Team Stakeholder Meeting</STRONG><P>

	Establishment of national and regional dredging teams was recommended in "The Dredging Process in the United States: An Action Plan for Improvement," the December 1994 report to the Secretary of Transportation prepared by the Interagency Working Group on the Dredging Process. The goals of the teams are to facilitate communication, coordination, and resolution of dredging issues among the participating Federal agencies and to serve as a forum for implementing the report's other  recommendations.<P>

	The National Dredging Team, which is co-chaired by the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency and includes representatives from the Departments of Commerce, Transportation, and the Interior, has held a series of organizational meetings todevelop a charter and workplan and begin to identify priority issues. As part of this process key stakeholders representing port and shipping interests, the commercial and recreational fishing industries, conservation groups and other interested parties were invited to meet with the National Dredging Team on May 31st to provide their perspectives on actions, issues and concerns that should be addressed by the National Team.   Additional meetings with stakeholders are anticipated. <STRONG>Ralph Lopez (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

	<STRONG>Florida Keys Coral Restoration</STRONG><P>

	Efforts organized by the NOAA Restoration Center (RC) and the NOS/Sanctuaries and Reserves
Division (SRD) began to stabilize and repair physical injury resulting from two separate 1989 ship groundings in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary (see December 1994 Habitat Happenings). The grounding fractured the reef framework, created large craters in the coral, and produced  unstable coral rubble that, to this day, threatens the integrity of these areas. The grounding destroyed more than 3,200 square meters of coral reef habitat. The RC and the SRD developed detailed plans to remove loose coral rubble,  stabilize injured portions of the reef framework, and re-create much of the 3-dimensional relief destroyed by the vessel groundings. Physical restoration efforts at both grounding sites should be completed by early August 1995.<STRONG> Tim Osborn (301) 713-0174

	<STRONG>Louisiana Restoration Continues</STRONG><P>

	The NOAA Restoration Center, working with the Baton Rouge Office of the NMFS Southeast Region and the Lafayette Laboratory of the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center, is undertaking three habitat restoration projects under the aegis of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and  Restoration Act (CWPPRA). <P>  
  
 <STRONG>  Point au Fer Island Restoration Project  - </STRONG> The final engineering and design plans have been completed and a Corps of Engineers 404 permit is anticipated in late June. When completed in fall 1995, the project will reduce saltwater intrusion and restore the natural hydrological regime to the area.<P> 

 <STRONG> Big Island/Atchafalaya Sediment Delivery Projects -</STRONG> Final engineering/design for the project is underway. A draft Environmental Assessment has been prepared and is being reviewed. When completed, the Big Island and Atchafalaya projects will create more than 3,700 acres of newly emergent habitat in the Atchafalaya River delta.  <P>

 <STRONG> Lake Salvador Shoreline Demonstration Project -</STRONG> Engineering/design is being coordinated with State efforts to achieve landowner/leaseholder agreements needed for the project. The project will introduce a number of new or modified approaches to the CWPPRA program for stabilizing eroding shorelines.<STRONG> Erik Zobrist (301) 713-0174

	<STRONG>Section 18 Fishway Prescriptions</STRONG><P>


	More than 50 public comments were received by NMFS and the FWS in response to their Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on "Prescribing Fishways Under Section 18 of the Federal Power Act (FPA)."  The issues raised in the comments were discussed during a meeting of the Interagency Hydropower Working Group.  The Working Group is comprised of regional and headquarters staff from the agencies who specialize in hydropower issues. The agencies are presently formulating their responses to the issues raised in the public comments in preparation for issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.<STRONG> Stephen Waste (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>	NMFS Briefed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</STRONG><P> 

	Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) staff met with NMFS and FWS to brief them on FERC's position regarding proposed amendments to the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Although the amendments were defeated during the 103rd Congress, FERC staff anticipated that they would be proposed again.  One amendment to the FPA would exempt hydropower projects under 5,000 kilowatts from FERC licensing authority.  At present, the FERC process guarantees NMFS the opportunity to review small projects to ascertain the adequacy of fish passageways (section 18) and fish and wildlife protection (section 10(j)).<STRONG> Stephen Waste (301) 713-2325
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>	NMFS Reviews Alaska Power Administration Sale Authorization Act</STRONG><P>
  
	This bill would authorize the sale of two federally-licensed hydropower projects in Alaska, Eklutna and Snettisham, to the Alaska Power Authority.  NMFS supports this bill because it properly incorporates into law a 1991 memorandum of agreement entered into by NOAA regarding fish protection measures.  The bill also gives the United States District Court for Alaska jurisdiction to review decisions pursuant to the 1991 MOA, as well as giving the District Court authority to enforce the MOA.  Together, these provisions preserve the fisheries management capabilities we previously exercised under the Federal Power Act, despite the change in jurisdiction resulting from sale to a state entity. <STRONG>Stephen Waste (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

	
<STRONG>	New Bedford Harbor Restoration
</STRONG><P>

	Habitat restoration planning for New Bedford Harbor advanced with public meetings in February and March 1995 in New Bedford, Fairhaven,  Acushnet, and East Dartmouth.  Sponsored by the New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council, the meetings marked the start of formal efforts to develop an overall restoration plan from which individual restoration projects will be tiered. Restoration will be undertaken with funds from natural resource damage settlements reached in 1991 with polluters who discharged PCBs into the Acushnet Estuary.  In subsequent developments the Trustee Council also decided to identify a subset of short-term restoration projects to be initiated within the next six to eighteen months as the longer-term restoration plan is developed. <STRONG>Garry Mayer (301) 713-0174
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>World Prodigy  Oil Spill Restoration</STRONG><P>

	Plans for habitat restoration in Narragansett Bay supported by the natural resource damage award
for the 1989World Prodigy oil spill are nearing completion.  Among the elements likely to be included are marsh restoration (i.e., restoration of tidal flushing) in a portion of the Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge, seagrass restoration at selected sites within Narragansett Bay, and the creation of four patch reefs constructed of various sized cobbles to create juvenile lobster habitat, and a quahog transplantation project.  The proposed activities will involve cooperation among elements of NMFS, the Corps of Engineers, FWS, the State of Rhode Island, and the University of Rhode Island.<STRONG> John Catena (508) 281-9251</STRONG><P>

<H2><B>IV.  PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS</B></H2><P>
<P>
</B>Management and research activities are the responsibility of five
Regional Offices.  Regional programs reflect three important
considerations: the pressures on living marine resource habitats;
the size of the area managed; and the recreational, commercial,
and ecological values of the species involved.  The habitat
programs in each region respond to unique regional issues and
geographic constraints.  Each Region also has a Fisheries Science
Center, some with satellite laboratories, that carry out research
programs on important fishery resource issues.  All 5 regions
have programs dealing with the habitats of various marine mammals
and, in some cases, endangered marine species such as whales,
seals, sea lions, and turtles.<P>
<P>
<H3><B>  A.  Headquarters Accomplishments</B></H3><P>
<P>
        <H3><B>ELEVATION TO WASHINGTON, D.C.: POINT AUFER 
PERMIT</B></H3>
During March 1993, the NMFS Southeast Regional Director elevated
the Corps Point  aufer, Louisiana, permit application to
Washington, D.C. This permit application involved proposed
construction of a 3,160-acre impoundment on Point au Fer Island,
a brackish marsh complex about 28 miles southeast of Morgan City,
Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico.  The project purpose was to
undertake "marsh management" to benefit waterfowl and retard
marsh loss.  NMFS recommended against issuance of this permit
because it would have adverse impacts on living marine resources,
including those under Magnuson Act Fishery Management Plans. 
When the Corps' New Orleans District elected to issue the permit
over NMFS opposition, the issue was elevated.  The Deputy Under
Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere subsequently raised the NMFS
concerns to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. 
In the face of the NMFS objections and before a final decision,
the applicant chose to withdraw the application.<P>
<P>
<P>
           <H3><B>ELEVATION TO WASHINGTON, D.C.: PETROSTAR, INC.
PERMIT</B></H3><P>
Also in early 1993, the Corps' Alaska District announced its
intention to authorize modification of its permit to allow for
construction of a new oil pipeline at the Valdez Container
Terminal in Valdez, Alaska.  The pipeline would be used to
deliver refined petroleum products (e.g., diesel and jet fuels)
originating at a new refinery built nearby by Petrostar, Inc. to
barges.  Because of potential adverse effects of this permit,
NMFS, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the EPA issued
opinions opposing this permit.  On June 14, 1993, the NOAA
Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere objected in writing
to the Assistant Secretary of the Army For Civil Works.  In a
response of July 14, 1993, the Army Secretary agreed that
modification of the permit would result in substantial and
unacceptable impacts on aquatic resources of national importance. 
Based on this finding, it was concluded that additional
evaluation is required.  The Alaska District Engineer was
instructed to undertake additional studies, including the
practicability of alternatives to the proposed site.<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
                <H3><B>WETLAND DELINEATION MANUAL</B></H3>
In late 1991, NMFS, through the Department of Commerce, became
the only Federal resource agency to oppose proposed revisions to
the 1989 "Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating
Jurisdictional Wetlands".<P>
<P>
NMFS was concerned that the proposed revisions could affect its
ability to carry out responsibilities and programs under Federal
law (e.g., Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the
Coastal Zone Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act).  An analysis of the changes
was conducted.<P>
<P>
Based on its analysis, NMFS concluded that 2 of 3 wetland
identification tests in the proposed manual had sound scientific
basis (e.g., use of indicator soils and vegetation) and generally
appeared to be workable in the field but only by persons with
specialized training.  The third test, a proposed mandatory
hydrology criterion, appeared to have little or no scientific
basis.  Therefore, NMFS concluded that these tests were not
appropriate for inclusion in the final manual.  Additionally,
NOAA submitted a formal recommendation that EPA support an
independent and scientifically rigorous analysis of the proposed
revisions.  That suggestion was taken and the National Academy of
Science is presently conducting such an analysis.<P>
<P>
<P>
              <H3><B>WHITE HOUSE WETLANDS TASK FORCE</B></H3>
On August 24, 1993, the Administration issued a comprehensive
strategy entitled "Protecting America's Wetlands: A Fair,
Flexible, and Effective Approach" for improvement of Federal
wetlands programs.  During the preceding three months, the Office
provided the NOAA lead in preparation of this strategy.  Its
provisions are important to NMFS' habitat protection efforts. 
The initiative makes more than 40 changes to current wetlands
policy including a more effective process so that developers can
seek review of permit decisions without having to go to court. 
The plan closes a loophole in regulations that allowed certain
destructive activities, such as draining wetlands, to go
unregulated.  The policy of "No Net Loss of Wetlands" will impose
deadlines and provide guidance so that permitting decisions will
be made in a timely and more predictable fashion.<P>
<p>

               <H3><B>DOA/NOAA COOPERATIVE PROGRAM</B></H3>
In November 1990, John A. Knauss, Under Secretary for Oceans and
Atmosphere, U.S. Department of Commerce, and Dr. G. Edward
Dickey, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works),
announced an agreement to initiate a NOAA - U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps) fisheries habitat restoration and creation
program.  NOAA and the Corps implemented the Agreement during
fiscal year 1991.  A budget of $456K was provided for the first
year of this national effort.  The agencies combined their
authorities, resources, and expertise to mutually accomplish
respective missions.  This joint program supports the
Administration's goal to protect wetlands.<P>
<P>
The initiative is based on recommendations found in a 1990 study
entitled NOAA-Corps Pilot Study to Restore and Create Fisheries
Habitats.  The study involved 12 NMFS Offices, 15 Corps Divisions
and Districts, the Corps Waterways Experiment Station, 44 states
and other interested parties.<P>
<P>
The study involved construction and monitoring of an artificial
reef in California, an oyster bar in Chesapeake Bay, an eelgrass
nursery area in Maryland waters, grading and revegetating three
disposal areas to create nursery habitat in North Carolina, salt
marsh creation on dredged material deposit sites along with
channel construction to establish fish production areas in Texas,
and conversion of low elevation farmland to wetland fish-rearing
habitat in the Sacramento River Delta, California.<P>
<P>
Study results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating
fisheries habitat restoration features into Corps projects,
sometimes at no net increase in Corps project costs.  Combining
the construction capability of the Army Corps of Engineers and
the expertise of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service
produced a successful interagency program with the significant
potential to increase habitat for the Nation's fish and shellfish
and to improve scientific knowledge of habitat restoration
technology.<P>
<P>
<P>
              <H3><B>AMENDMENTS TO THE MAGNUSON ACT</B></H3>
The Office developed a habitat provision for inclusion in NOAA's
proposed amendments for Reauthorization of the Magnuson Fisheries
Conservation and Management Act.  If enacted, the resulting
habitat amendment would create an enhanced role for the Fishery
Management Councils in protection of fish habitats.  Under the
amendment, the Councils would be responsible for identifying and
designating "essential" fish habitats within U.S. marine and
estuarine coastal areas.  The resulting designated areas would
provide guidance for the Corps, Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC), and other Federal agencies in development
decisions which may affect fish and shellfish habitats.  The
proposed amendment is included in NOAA's 1995 legislative
package.<P>
<p>

        <H3><B>FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION INTERACTIONS</B></H3>
During 1991-1992, staff participated in developing a syllabus for
an interagency (Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), NMFS, FWS,
COE, and EPA) course in alternative dispute resolution.  The
syllabus is now being used in the Department of Transportation -

sponsored course, Practical Conflict Management--Skills to
Resolve Highway and Wetlands Issues being given nationwide to
state and Federal employees involved in environmental and
resource protection.<P>
<P>
<P>
                <H3><B>WATER QUALITY 2000 (WQ2000)</B></H3>
Staff participated in numerous WQ2000 Steering Committee meetings
preparing the WQ2000 Final Report.  The report, A National Water
Agenda for the 21st Century, provides a sound conceptual
framework from which to consider improvements to the CWA and
other environmental laws.  The contents of the report are being
used by many lobbyists and consultants to advise Congress on
changes to the CWA.  To further implement the use of the WQ2000
Final Report, the Environmental Energy Institute has been holding
Hill briefings on its recommendations.  In addition, the chairman
of the WQ2000 Steering Committee used the report for testimony
before the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee of the
House Public Works Committee hearings related to reauthorization
of the CWA.<P>
<P>
<P>
          <H3><B>INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT
(ISTEA)</B></H3>
ISTEA has $2.6 billion for enhancing/restoring environmental
integrity associated with highway construction/repair over the
next 5 years.  NMFS staff participates as a member of an
interagency team (FWHA, NMFS, FWS, COE, and EPA) whose mission is
to guide regional managers during preplanning stages on how to
successfully access these moneys by merging the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 404 permit processes. 
This proactive approach avoids lengthy delays and litigation due
to faulty project design.<P>
<P>
<P>
                      <H3><B>COASTAL AMERICA</B></H3>
Coastal America, is a project-oriented, problem-solving
partnership of Federal, State, and regional authority
participants.  Through its regionalized planning structure,
Coastal America enables multiagency response to specific
environmental problems that threaten coastal waters.  This
regionalized structure has enabled Coastal America to accomplish
projects across the country that no single agency or program
could have effectively done alone.<P>
<P>
During 1991-1992, regional habitat protection staff represented
NOAA and NMFS at meetings of the Coastal America Program's
National Implementation Team.  One of this team's important
functions is to provide guidance to Regional Implementation Teams
on how to identify and access agencies with funds earmarked for
environmental efforts.<P>
<P>
In addition, Habitat Protection's staff has participated in
revising Coastal America's progress report, "Building Alliances
to Restore Coastal Environments" and the reporters guide
"Covering the Coasts".  Both documents are now being distributed
nationally as educational outreach tools.<P>
<P>
<P>
             <H3><B>NATIONAL OCEAN POLLUTION PROGRAM</B></H3>
The Office coordinated the gathering and updating of information
on NMFS pollution research during Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 and
then compiled and prepared it for input to NOAA's National Ocean
Pollution Program Office (NOPPO) for its use in developing the FY
1990-1991 update of the "National Ocean Pollution Program Summary
of Federal Programs and Projects," required by the National Ocean
Pollution Planning Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-273, as amended).<P>
<P>
Funding for pollution-related research by all Fisheries Science
Centers nationwide was $9,443,012 in FY 1990 and $9,257,300 in FY
1991.  A total of 41 projects were pursued by the Northeast,
Southeast, Northwest, and Alaska Fishery Science Centers.<P>
<P>
Diversity among Regional research projects was high.  Studies
included broad multi-year, multi-disciplinary projects, generic
studies, and site-specific activities.  Examples are the
following: biological impact studies of chemical contaminants and
sewage sludge dumping on fisheries populations; impacts of waste
disposal and habitat modification on coastal fish populations;
characterization of the distribution and extent of coastal
wetlands and life history patterns of fishery organisms; larval
recruitment; effects of contaminated estuaries on juvenile
salmon; damage assessment of the impacts on Prince William Sound
habitat resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill, and marine
debris impacts on resources.<P>
<P>
<P>
               <H3><B>HABITAT CONSERVATION BROCHURE</B></H3>
In response to Strategy 12 of the NMFS Habitat Conservation
Policy that directs the NMFS to emphasize greater communication
of its habitat conservation activities to its constituency (i.e.,
commercial and marine recreational fishing interests, academia,
environmental groups, coastal residents, marine-oriented
industries, the general public, and Congress), the Office,
through a contract to the Center for Marine Conservation,
developed and produced a Habitat Conservation Brochure.  The
brochure is used extensively to inform the general public and
special interest groups about the NMFS habitat conservation
program.<P>
<P>
<P>
           <H3><B>CORPS OF ENGINEERS NATIONWIDE PERMITS</B></H3>
Every 5 years the Corps of Engineers reviews its Nationwide
Permits (NWP).  These permits are for minor wetland activities
which supposedly would have no individual or cumulative impact on
the environment.  The announcement contains detailed descriptions
of the permits and invites public comment and hearings before
final issuance of the permits.<P>
<P>
The 1991 review listed 40 permits.  Preliminary review by Habitat
Protection HQ staff identified numerous permits that would do
harm to habitat and could result in negative impacts on
fisheries.  Thanks to excellent cooperation from the Regions and
NOAA General Counsel, NMFS prepared and submitted extensive
comments on the Corps of Engineers proposed list.  In some
instances, Habitat Protection Staff attended public hearings on
the projects.  These combined efforts contributed to 4 of the
permits being dropped from the list and some reduction of habitat
damage from the 36 NWPs adopted.<P>
<P>
<P>
        <H3><B>HABITAT VIDEO TAPE TEACHING UNIT DEVELOPED</B></H3>
OHP staff, in cooperation with George Washington University's
(GWU) International Institute of Tourism Studies produced a
college-level teaching unit entitled "Agenda For Sustainable
Island Tourism Development".  The unit consists of a 28-minute
video cassette based on NMFS Southeast Region's guidelines for
proposed wetland alteration, an educational supplement in booklet
form, and a copy of National Marine Fisheries Service Guidelines
For Proposed Wetland Alteration in the Southeastern United
States.<P>
<P>
The video applies habitat protection principles to the
development of island ecotourism destinations.  It is designed
for training programs with government officials, economic
consultants, resource management consultants and college
students.  The educational supplement and the guidelines are for
the use of the instructor and/or the student.  The materials are
being promoted and distributed to foreign governments, academic
institutions, private tourism development organizations and
environmental preservation groups through GWU's International
Institute of Tourism Studies.<P>
<P>
This cooperative effort was funded by GWU.  The materials have
been well-received and are being widely distributed.  Additional
OHP guideline materials are being collected, reviewed and
evaluated for similar treatment.<P>
<P>
<P>
            <H3><B>NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAM ACTIVITIES</B></H3>
NMFS regional Habitat staff have played an active role in many of
the National Estuary Programs, serving on committees and working
groups to enhance attention to relevant habitat and resource
issues.  These groups address potential problems which may impact
resources and increase awareness toward the critical habitat and
resources involved in the project.  Committees also coordinate
involvement for participating organizations which have a role in
the program.<P>
<P>
The Southeast Region continues to be active in the National
Estuary Program.  Seven programs are located in the region, and
staff are actively involved, participating on most management and
technical committees, including the upcoming Corpus Christi
program.  The Southwest region is also active in regional
programs.  Regional staff participate on management and technical
committees, as well as research and monitoring studies for the
San Francisco Bay Project.  In the Santa Monica Bay Program, a
NMFS Habitat staff member served as co-chairperson of the Marine
Habitat Subcommittee (see Southwest Regional Accomplishments). 
Although the National Estuary Program currently resides within
NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program, increased involvement and
leadership from the NMFS Habitat Protection Headquarters level is
anticipated in the future.<P>
<P>
<P>
               <H3><B>CHESAPEAKE BAY OFFICE CREATED</B></H3>
In response to Congressional intent that NOAA become more
involved in the interstate, interagency Chesapeake Bay Program,
NMFS has established an office adjacent to EPA's Chesapeake Bay
Program Office in Annapolis, Maryland to facilitate coordination
with and input to the Bay cleanup effort.  The Division
coordinates NOAA participation in Bay Program expert
subcommittees, represents NOAA, administers certain research
grants, and maintains cognizance of all NOAA activities with
relevance to the Bay.<P>
<P>
<P>
              <H3><B>CLEAN WATER ACT REAUTHORIZATION</B></H3>
Staff of the Office of Habitat Protection have served as the lead
for NOAA participation in the interagency Clean Water Act (CWA)
reauthorization process chaired by the EPA and have participated
in the interagency work group chaired by the White House Office
on Environmental Policy to develop a consensus on wetlands policy
issues.  The Administration position on CWA was released in
January 1994 as "President Clinton's Clean Water Initiative,"
which articulates the five key policy issues: nonpoint source
pollution, watershed management, toxics/water quality criteria
and standards, funding, and enforcement.<P>

<STRONG>
   The NMFS Habitat Protection Program: Lost in the Bureaucracy</STRONG>


    <P> My October 1993 editorial emphasized that conserving, restoring, and developing fish
habitats must be accepted as equally important to rebuilding depressed fish stocks. The National
Fish and  Wildlife Foundation's 1990 Needs Assessment of the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) documented that NMFS is pitifully understaffed and funded, especially its Habitat
Protection Program. The state of this program was further detailed in a 1991 program assessment
by William Chandler Associates. Now yet another major assessment, this time by the Department
of Commerce's inspector general, confirms the previous findings: the program has too few
resources and too many diversions to meet its mandated task.<P>

    <P> On the surface this may not appear newsworthy. In this tight federal budget climate, many
important programs are short on staff and resources. However, field staff of this tiny program are
the federal front line in advocating conservation of marine and estuarine fish and shellfish habitats
in thousands of federal development projects, permits ,or licenses, e.g., those of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, etc. Bill Fox, past assistant
administrator for fisheries, has stated that in the long-term, the loss of nearshore ocean and
estuarine fishery habitat is probably the greatest threat to U.S. marine fishery productivity. If
ever a strong front line has been needed to focus the best scientific information to advocate for
productive fish habitats, it is now.<P>

    <P> The inspector general's report provides fast but unsettling reading. Highlights include
attrition rates that cut staff from 87 in 1988 to 63 in 1993; funding that dropped 16% between FY
1993; and a small (48) field staff that is hard-pressed to handle agency responsibilities that include
10,000 annual federal permits, license applications, and other proposals. A stepchild of the National
Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), program expertise is being diverted to meet
habitat-related priorities of other NOAA and NMFS elements. Particularly alarming is that the
program receives virtually no support from the agency's own science centers, and a regionalized
"two-track" NMFS administrative structure blurs responsibility (and accountability) between
national and regional offices. Field staff lack confidence that NOAA will effectively support their
controversial findings, recommendations, and decisions regarding habitat protection with the
Army Corps of Engineers and other. Further, NOAA has not supported requests for a
strengthened program mandate during current reauthorization of the Clean Water Act Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Even the request for a Senior Executive Service
position to the program was denied!<P>

    <P> A great diversion has been transfer of habitat protection staff to fulfill time-specific agency
requirements under the Endangered Species Act. Ironically, the endangered status of many
species is symptomatic of the cumulative, ongoing nature of broad-based habitat deterioration -the
very thing that a strong Habitat Protection Program would work to prevent. It is short-sighted to
focus our greatest energies only on maintaining the existence of endangered and threatened
species. Ultimately, future biological diversity will depend on the effectiveness of our collective
habitat protection programs.<P>

    <P> NMFS Deputy Assistant Administrator Nancy Foster, in her address at the 1993 North
American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference, stated the NMFS charge well: "I believe
the most effective habitat conservation role for agencies like ours is advocacy at local level. This
advocacy should be carried out by influencing the many individual federal permits, licenses, and
construction project, and conducting related habitat research and public education. Much
protection is possible under existing provisions of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the
Federal Power Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other. . . . Within NMFS we take
this responsibility seriously. It is the cornerstone of our Habitat Protection Program."<P>

    <P> The NOAA leadership must take dramatic steps to create an effective NMFS Habitat
Protection Program. Words alone will not stop the loss of, or damage to, essential marine fish
habitat, and results so far are only cosmetic. NOAA spends more than $100 million a year on
"habitat related" activities, of which less than 5% goes to this program. This must change. NMFS
should not be required to cannibalize its Habitat Protection Program to meet its other tasks.
Further, the agency's research programs should become a strong partner to the Habitat Protection
Program. Congress and marine fisheries constituents must move to the front line to keep this
program from being lost within NOAA's broader marine science orientation.<P>

<STRONG>Rollie Schmitten Ranks Habitat as One of NMFS' Highest Priorities During American Fisheries Society Sponsored Meeting</STRONG><P>

	Paul Brouha, Executive Director of the American Fisheries Society (AFS), organized a meeting of about two dozen constituents to elevate the importance of NMFS' Habitat Program. The constituents represented commercial and recreational fishing organizations, conservation organizations, states, fishery management councils and Federal agencies. Rollie Schmitten, NOAA's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, emphasized that habitat will be one of his two major priorities during his tenure.  <P>

	The AFS meeting focused on two agendas to enhance habitat. The first agenda was to increase legislative authority. Participants strongly endorsed habitat amendments in the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to create an overall framework for NOAA's habitat program. Compatible approaches were supported for the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Clean Water Act and other statutes. The second agenda was to review all administrative and policy improvements recommended by recent assessments of the program. This agenda covered topics ranging from a program mission statement to a long-term budget enhancement to a strategic plan for the program.<P>

	Additional meetings will be convened to address the legislative agenda and strategic plan. Those interested in this initiative or who wish to contribute to a new National Habitat Plan should contact NMFS' Office of Habitat Protection. <STRONG>Tom Bigford or Jim Burgess (301) 713-2325 </STRONG><P>

<STRONG>	Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Fishways Issued
</STRONG><P>

	Under Section 18 of the Federal Power Act, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) have joint authority to require fishways to be built to ensure safe passage of fish at hydropower projects licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Fishways are mechanisms that help fish travel upstream or downstream past a hydropower dam and may include fish ladders, lifts and screens, as well as operational measures.  Recently, DOC and DOI published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for "Prescription of Fishways Under Section 18 of the Federal Power Act." The notice appeared in the Federal Register on September 1, 1994, and the agencies collected public comment through October 31.  While respondents' comments have not been fully evaluated; in general, most supported a rulemaking. The notice represents a joint effort by NMFS and FWS to codify and clarify the process for prescribing fishway design and operations nationally.  The goal of the suggested proposal is to provide guidance to agency staff, increase consistency and predictability in the rules that require fishways and improve  coordination among Federal agencies, hydropower interests, and FERC. The clarified procedure would allow license applicants and agency employees to better understand the basis for needed studies and any subsequent fishway prescriptions, thereby improving the complex FERC licensing process.<STRONG> Stephen Waste (301)713-2325</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>	Nancy Foster Appointed to Coastal Stewardship Task Force</STRONG><P>

	Nancy Foster, NOAA's Deputy Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, was appointed to the Coastal Stewardship Task Force established by James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere. The Task Force was created under the leadership of Kate Kimball, Deputy Assistant Secretary, on June 21, 1994, to assess NOAA's programs in scientific research, resource protection and coastal zone and protected area management to (1) evaluate whether they are being utilized in the most effective and efficient manner, (2) evaluate whether statutory mandates are being properly implemented and (3) define NOAA's unique vision and mission for coastal resources.  The Task Force conducted constituent meetings in the Chesapeake Bay area, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, DC.  The Task Force will prepare a report to Under Secretary Baker by January, 1995 that will include recommended options on how the definition, utilization and implementation of NOAA's coastal stewardship programs can be improved. <STRONG>Jim Burgess (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

	<STRONG>NMFS Sought Highest Review of Proposal to Fill New Jersey Wetlands</STRONG><P>

	On October 6, Doug Hall, Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, signed a letter to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works requesting review of a decision by the Army Corps of Engineers (COE) New York District. The COE proposed to issue a permit to Hartz Mountain Corporation to fill 68 acres of wetlands for housing in the Hackensack Meadowlands of New Jersey. NMFS concluded that the project would adversely affect existing and future improved habitat values in the Meadowlands. Aquatic habitats in the area are used by striped bass, alewife, blueback herring, Atlantic tomcod, blue crabs and other commercial species. This area also supports a substantial population of mummichogs and killifish, an important prey species for other fish higher in the food chain. NMFS found that more than 12,000 of the original 20,000 acres of wetlands in the Meadowlands have been filled for development and further losses seemed entirely unnecessary.<P>

Headquarters, regional and field staff cooperated in arranging a site visit, preparing a report on the proposed project and NMFS' concerns, and conducting briefings for Rollie Schmitten and Doug Hall. As a result of cooperation and sharing of information, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) elevated the same permit decision. In response to the elevation request, the Department of the Army agreed that the meadowlands site qualified as an aquatic resource of national significance but that the project did not cause a substantial and unacceptable loss of habitat. NOAA is currently reviewing options for further action. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325

<STRONG>	NMFS Convenes National Habitat Coordinator's Meeting</STRONG><P>

	A three-day meeting of NMFS' Headquarters and Regional Habitat Coordinators was held in Silver Spring in September. Discussed topics included Magnuson Act habitat initiatives, anadromous fish, NMFS' Habitat Conservation Policy, state assumption, programmatic general permit policies, and an interim national tracking system. Nancy Foster stated that NMFS' vision is to elevate NMFS' habitat conservation mission to become an equal partner to fishery management and protected species missions.<P>

Noteworthy conclusions of the meeting participants included:<P>

·  The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries needs to convey to the Regional Directors that the Habitat Program is one of NMFS' top priorities. <P>

·  The habitat priorities from the 1993 meeting (consultative services, natural resource
management and planning, habitat restoration, outreach, legislation development and review, development of habitat policy and guidance, special studies and program evaluation information development) remain valid; but there is need to ensure that the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Magnuson Act, and partnerships have their appropriate place in the list.<P>

·  There is much promise in the legislative initiative for amendment of the Magnuson Act, including identification of essential habitat and increased consultation authority.<P>

·  Any revision of the Habitat Conservation Policy should focus on special issue policies.<P>

·  The potential assistance the Program stands to gain from the American Fisheries Society, Marine Fish Conservation Network and other organizations was considered encouraging.<P>

· The importance of gaining a firm financial footing for the National Habitat Program was recognized by all.<P>

·  The program managers need to pursue all types of creative staffing possibilities including cooperative education agreements.<STRONG> Jim Burgess or Tom Bigford (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

	<STRONG>Habitat Provisions in Magnuson Act Progress; Reauthorization Awaits Next Congress
</STRONG><P>
	
	The House and Senate have proposed separate amendments to the Magnuson Act.  These are in addition to the conservation-community bill introduced in the House by Representative Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD) on behalf of the Marine Fish Conservation Network and the Administration bills that were introduced in both chambers (see June 1994 Habitat Happenings).<P>


The proposed bills advanced in both chambers but neither was reported out of Committee prior to the pre-election recess. Consequently, reauthorization will not occur during the 103rd Congress although implementation of the existing statute will continue under NOAA's FY 1995 appropriations bill. Reauthorization has been identified as a high priority when the new Congress convenes next year. The Office of Habitat Protection has had discussions with fishing and conservation working groups to develop a consensus on legislation for the conservation of fishery habitats. <STRONG>Ralph Lopez (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


	<STRONG>Commitment to Chesapeake Bay Endorsed in Ecosystem Management Agreement
</STRONG><P>

	On July 14, 1994, James Baker, NOAA Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere; Carol Browner, EPA Administrator; Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of Interior; and 22 other Federal executives signed an Agreement for Ecosystem Management in the Chesapeake Bay. For the first time, the agencies committed themselves to managing the Bay's watershed as a cohesive ecosystem and achieving the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. NOAA was specifically given the lead in coordinating Federal research agendas and in restoring habitat through the opening of rivers to anadromous fish passage. <STRONG>Bess Gillelan (410) 267-5660</STRONG><P>

	<STRONG>NMFS Acts Quickly to Reduce Threats to 1,000 Acres of Estuarine Habitat</STRONG><P>

NMFS continued its involvement in the 1993 Clean Water Act Section 404 permit application for the Port Valdez Container Terminal (PetroStar). The Army Corps of Engineers (COE) permit was elevated by NMFS in June, 1993, for highest level review by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. This project proposed transfer of refined petroleum products at the Valdez Container Terminal in Port Valdez,  Alaska.  Issuance of the permit would place at risk 1,000 acres of vital salt marsh in the Valdez Duck Flats, an intertidal wetland utilized by numerous living resources including populations of 4 species of salmon.  In 1993, the Department of the Army agreed that the living resources of Duck Flats were Aquatic Resources of National Importance and remanded the permit to the COE's Alaska District for further alternative analysis.<P>

	Despite considerable effort on the part of NMFS over the past year, the living resources of Duck Flats were recently in danger of an adverse Corps decision prior to complete review o alternatives. NMFS became concerned that the permit might be issued coincident with the impending departure of the COE Alaska District Engineer. In quick response, the Office of Habitat Protection prepared letters from NOAA's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries to EPA's Assistant Administrator for Water and to the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.<P>

	As a result of these efforts, the COE decided to delay its final decision on the permit pending further review and coordination with all parties involved.  NMFS was pleased  with this decision.<P>

	A new District Engineer has arrived in Alaska. We will work closely with him to ensure that a decision on PetroStar is not made without full NMFS coordination.  <STRONG>Ramona Schreiber  (301) 713-2325

<STRONG>	Outreach Completed, Report On Dredging Process to Follow Soon 
</STRONG><P>

	An interagency Dredging Process Working Group was formed in the fall of 1993 by the Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) to address issues and concerns regarding dredging and dredged material disposal activities and the processes used to approve such activities. Staff from the Office of Habitat Protection serve as NMFS' representative on the working group.

Ten public outreach sessions to receive comments on the Options Paper were completed in June 1994. Based on comments received, the Group refined the options and developed recommended actions. MARAD planned to have completed the Working Group's final report by July, 1994. However, due to the large number of comments and the complex deliberations of the Working Group, the task has proven more difficult than originally envisioned.  MARAD now projects a formal public release of the final report by the end of the year, contingent on the interagency clearance process and OMB approval. <STRONG>Ralph Lopez (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>	Concern Continues for Maryland State Assumption Wetland Program</STRONG>

Recently, the Office of Habitat Protection represented NMFS at a public meeting held to discuss Maryland's proposal to assume responsibility for issuing Clean Water Act Section 404 permits. Critical to state assumption are the means and measures used to delineate waters that would fall under the State's new 404 purview. The Army Corps of Engineers (COE) is proposing to delineate these "assumable waters" in non-tidal areas based on its distinction between navigable and non-navigable waters. Because a detailed determination of navigability is time-consuming, COE Districts tend to underestimate the span of navigable waters. This matter is inconsequential when the COE is carrying out its Section 10 (navigable waters) and Section 404 (waters of the U.S.) responsibilities.  However, when the Section 404 Program is assumed by a state, underestimating the span of navigable waters could cause the COE to lose jurisdiction over waters that should remain under Federal jurisdiction.  NMFS' ability to influence decisions affecting its trust resources could also diminish concurrently. Accordingly, NMFS recommended that the COE use the definition of headwaters to delineate  "assumable waters" which would preserve involvement in the review of permits for a much greater range of fishery habitat than would be allowed under the current proposal. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>	NMFS Coordinates with Resource Agencies to Restore Oyster Reefs</STRONG><P>

The Chesapeake Bay Office joined with other NMFS Offices, the Restoration Center, state agencies and other Federal agencies and Maryland's Department of Natural Resources in proposing to the Chesapeake Bay Program an oyster reef restoration project. In conjunction with routine maintenance dredging, probably in the Eastern Shore's Wicomico River, the Army Corps of Engineers will pump the dredged material into porous fabric tubes (commercially called "Geotubes"). These tubes will be placed in different configurations on the bottom where they will be monitored by scientists for attachment of oysters and associated organisms. <STRONG>Bruce Norman (410) 267-5660

	<STRONG>NMFS Proceeds in Review of Threatened Seagrass
</STRONG><P>

As required by the Endangered Species Act, NMFS recently held a public hearing in Vero Beach, Florida. The hearing initiated (1) proposed listing of Johnson's seagrass (Halophila johnsonii) as a threatened species and (2) the designation of critical habitat for this species of seagrass. The hearing was well attended with representatives from marine industries associations, navigation districts, environmental organizations and state and local agencies. Opponents of the proposed listing focused on the economic impacts, scientific validity, and fear that there was a "hidden agenda" to control growth. Proponents supported protection of species and habitats at risk citing the vulnerability of this primary link in the coastal foodweb, the expanse of human impacts and the need for preventing further decreases in fisheries.  Site visits of the critical habitats within Sebastian Inlet documented the devastating impact of "prop scoring" caused by boat traffic through the seagrass beds. Heavy utilization of the beds by high numbers of living marine resources underscored the critical need to protect these special  habitats. <STRONG>Ramona Schreiber (301) 713-2325

<STRONG>	Mitigation Banking Guidance Readied for Public Review
</STRONG><P>

	For the past year, the Office of Habitat Protection has represented NMFS on a Federal interagency mitigation banking working group. This interagency effort produced a draft policy that was sent to agency field offices for comment in September. The working group is presently incorporating field comments into the draft policy, which should appear in the Federal Register for public comment in December.<P>

	The heart of the policy is a provision that every mitigation bank will have an interagency Mitigation Review Team (MRT) which will set up a banking agreement. The agreement will describe how the bank should be operated to ensure that it provides appropriate compensation for authorized wetland and aquatic habitat impacts and that it operates as smoothly as possible in terms of agency review and cooperation. Through participation in the MRT, NMFS intends to assure that fisheries impacts are given equal consideration in the operation and use of mitigation banks.<P>

Although many difficult and contentious issues were resolved during development of the draft guidance, the working group could not agree on when mitigation credits should be released from a bank. NMFS and some Federal agencies recommended that credits be released only after a bank's aquatic habitats are created and functioning.  However, other Federal agencies concluded that private mitigation banks would not be able to operate under those constraints and recommended withdrawal of some of the bank's credits before the bank's aquatic habitats are created. NMFS is concerned that withdrawal of credits before a bank's habitats are created will not provide the "in advance" compensation for habitat loss that is supposed to be a major attribute of mitigation banking. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325

	<STRONG>Wetland Creation on East Timbalier Island Off to a Successful Start</STRONG><P>


	The NMFS Restoration Center conducted field inspections and reviewed project reports of the Greenhill Petroleum Inc. (GPI) wetlands restoration site on East Timbalier Island, Louisiana. The 22-acre wetland creation project provides compensation for impacts of a 1992 oil spill.  The work is being done under the supervision of NOAA's Damage Assessment and Restoration Program, the Department of the Interior and the State of Louisiana.  Last summer, GPI suspended the salt marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) planting phase of the restoration project due to hot and
dry weather on the island.  The planting was finished in September when weather conditions
became more favorable.  An autumn site visit indicated the restoration efforts are progressing
successfully. Tim Osborn or Erik Zobrist (301) 713-0179  

NMFS Completing Final Designs to Restore Damaged Reef

The NMFS Restoration Center (RC), in conjunction with NOAA's National Ocean Service, is
coordinating the coral reef structural restoration of the M/V ELPIS and M/V MAITLAND
grounding sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.  The groundings occurred in 1989 off Key Largo resulting in total destruction of more than 6,500 square feet of reef. Restoration efforts include removing loose coral rubble and stabilizing the reef framework by placing a grid of concrete Reef Replicating Armor Units. An Interagency Agreement between NOAA and Army Corps of Engineers (Jacksonville District) is facilitating the project. Final engineering and design plans are being reviewed. The RC has also prepared environmental assessments and obtained all necessary environmental permits. <STRONG>Tim Osborn (301) 713-0179</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>	Chesapeake Bay Research On Line for FY 1994 Funding
</STRONG><P>

	Eighteen oyster disease research projects have been selected and are pending award for FY 1994 funding. In the form of cooperative agreements, these projects address the diagnosis of disease, fishery management in the face of disease and the genetic basis of disease resistance among other topics. Oyster disease research is receiving $1.5 million annually.  In addition, four grants have been awarded for stock assessment research covering blue crab survey design, data and analysis for a juvenile shad index and oyster survey design.  These grants and cooperative agreements are selected through a peer review process pursuant to a Federal Register solicitation. Stock
assessment research, a remote sensing project and a toxics research program conducted by Maryland and Virginia Sea Grant are included in a $1.89 million appropriation for Chesapeake Bay Studies. <STRONG>Anne Lange (410) 267-5660

<STRONG>	Habitat Program Tracking System Prepared for Implementation in 1995</STRONG><P>

	A proposal was developed for an interim tracking system that could be implemented within existing staffing and funding constraints. This system would not add materially to the existing Regional workload and would provide habitat program accomplishment information for use in developing plans, programs, and budget materials. Specific products of the system would be (a) gross quantitative statistics on categories of program activities and (b) a cross section of brief "case studies" selected to demonstrate each region's range of activities and accomplishments. The proposal was presented at the National Habitat Coordinator's Meeting along with an illustrative example of how the data might be collected and organized. The Office of Habitat Protection plans to implement the new system by early 1995. <STRONG> Ken Osborn (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>
