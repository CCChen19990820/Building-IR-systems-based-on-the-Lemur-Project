Last Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle article by Harre Demoro (summarized in
<A HREF="/Risks/9.41.html">RISKS-9.41</A>) concerning BART computer troubles was apparently based on a partial
simulation with only 10 trains and with intentional performance degradation
resulting from the presence of trace software being used during a
special-purpose test.  That data was extrapolated to give the cited numbers.
Also, the intended maxium number of trains was given incorrectly, and should
have been 74 instead of 108.  Thus, it appears that the article should be taken
with a grain of salt.  

The first real test to measure performance was conducted for eight hours,
ending last Saturday morning -- after the article appeared.  Dr. Norman
Zachary, President of Logica Data Architects Inc. (the Logica subsidiary
responsible for the BART software), said on 15 November that "The results of
the performance test conclusively show that Logica's system meets BART's
specifications, including the ability to operate 74 trains automatically.  We
currently estimate we are very close to delivery of the system."  (BART
currently operates no more than 45 trains, but intends to go to 74 as part of
its capacity expansion program.)

This update is based on several phone calls with BART and Logica people.
Stay tuned for any later developments.  Peter

Cricket is our equivalent of baseball in England.

Taken from ORACLE Teletext TV News Service, 2:00am, 16 NOV 89

"Yorkshire cricket fans were hit for six [ that's six runs... - OCL ] when they
were invited to take part in a Yorkshire TV phone-in and received sex advice
instead.  After a programme called `What's to do about Yorkshire Cricket',
viewers were invited to ring a special number to give their opinions.  But when
they dialled, they heard a recorded message from `Barbara' about sexual
problems.

British Telecom (BT) blamed a computer fault... "

No comment.

The Navy has an elaborate safety program that includes extensive concern for
safety in software-controlled systems.  Unfortunately there is an apparent gap
between the intent and the execution.  (It will be interesting to see how much
the Navy's two-day reorientation period designed to increase awareness actually
helps.)  For the record, here is a summary of the past weeks.  It may be worth
noting that none of this run of problems seems to have been blamed on computers
(as far as I know), but then most of our so-called "computer problems" are
people problems anyway, irrespective of where the blame is placed.

 29 Oct. Pilot's first-ever carrier landing kills 5 on carrier Lexington.
 30 Oct. FA-18 pilot drops 500-pound bomb on guided missile cruiser Reeves;
         5 injured.
 31 Oct. Wave washes 3 sailors overboard on carrier Eisenhower; 
         2 rescued; several dozen missiles lost.
 31 Oct. 12-foot swells on carrier Vinson, sailor swept overboard, lost.
  1 Nov. Boiler room fire on oiler Monongahela, 9 suffer smoke inhalation.
  9 Nov. A-7E Corsair 2 crashes into apartment complex in Smyrna GA.
         2 killed, 4 injured.
 11 Nov. Destroyer Kinkaid collides with merchant ship.  
         1 sailor killed, 5 injured.
 11 Nov. Two A-6 attack bombers dropped bombs near a capsite.  One injured.
 14 Nov. Amphibious assault ship Inchon catches fire in Norfolk, 31 injured.
 14 Nov. F-14 Tomcat fighter crashes at sea, FL training flight, no injuries.

Several months ago, an alcoholic relative applied for a credit card in his and
my name - without my authorization.  Eventually he began drinking and failed
to intercept the bill when it arrived at my home.  I immediately called the
800 number, cancelled the card and followed up with a registered letter.

Now the problems begin.

They sent me a follow up letter that indicated the balance had grown from
$1200 when I cancelled the letter to somewhat over $2000.  I called them and
was informed that their computer was unable to cancel credit cards and was not
programmed to refuse charges.

In the registered letter that followed, I informed them that I would pay the
original $1200 - even though both they and I agreed I was not responsible for
this money.  I declined to pay any further charges and told them there was no
chance to recover the money from by relative - he was in a rehab center with
no income.

They responded by encouraging him to declare bankruptcy - since that was the
only entry their computer would accept to cancel a credit card.  Amazed, I
tried to explain to them about fair credit laws and such (I am not a lawyer
but the concept isn't too difficult to understand).  Eventually they agreed
that neither he or I was responsible for the charges - but they still couldn't
cancel the credit card - only put it in a warning bulletin in case someone
bothered to look it up.

About the time the bill reached $3000, they sent him a supply of pre-
authorized checks to write against his credit limit.  Another phone call
prompted the response that neither he or I was responsible for any charges
incurred by writing these checks - but their computer has no way to stop
sending these out once we are entered into the database.

Eventually, the supervisor I spoke with began to understand the social
responsibility of not giving unlimited funds to a drunk - was very sorry - but
had no way to instruct the computer to stop sending out the credit cards
(presumably he will get a new one when the current one expires) and the checks.

I sent a registered letter to the president of the bank offering some
computing consulting to help fix their computer systems.

Any takers if he replies?  The letter was acknowledged by receipt - but has
caused no action from the bank.  /Stu Bell

According to a national newscast by the CBC at 7:00 EST, the Saskatchewan
provincial government has decided to abandon the project to translate its laws
into French using a computer system. This system was supplied by Guy Montpetit,
who was also involved in LOGO Systems here in Montreal. The NDP opposition
party had been criticizing the government for not checking into Mr. Montpetit's
track record.  (See "Gigatext Translation Services Inc. scandal" by Bhota San
in <A HREF="/Risks/8.84.html">RISKS-8.84</A> for a lengthy report on this project.)

Bill Gorman writes about "a treaty to detect and combat tax evasions on both
countries.  By means of this treaty both nations will have access to
information concerning the income of mexicans living in the States and of
northamericans living in Mexico."

It may be even worse than inter-governmental data sharing.  More and more
governmental functions are now being performed by contractors.  (By using
contractors, the US Government doesn't incur "entitlement" expenses such as
pensions, injury/accident compensation, unemployment insurance, etc.)  So, not
only would the Mexican government have your tax history, but so would some
contractor such as TRW or another "data basing" corporation that may already
have access to your medical and credit histories.  The possibilities are
boundless.

On a similar note (Jones, <A HREF="/Risks/9.43.html">RISKS-9.43</A>), a few years back I wrote a system to be
used by a bank to do electronic submission of 1099 forms (and some other
similar forms).  Shortly after submitting the forms, the bank received a letter
from the IRS stating that the submission contained errors, each of which was
fined, to a total of $65,000.  The bank was upset.

The error was that I left the "alpha" field, which is supposed to be the
taxpayer's last name, blank for businesses (it's kind of hard to determine the
last name of businesses).  This was exactly what the documentation said you
were supposed to do if you couldn't determine the correct field value.

Apparently they didn't tell their DP department that...

Actually, since the database showed that the subscriber was only supposed
to be receiving the Sunday edition, it is most probably the case that the
daily deliveries were the result of a "lazy" newspaper delivery person,
not the computers.

It is quite common for these folks, especially in metro areas where they
drive by and throw papers rapidly at many houses, to not want to bother
differentiating between people with different types of subscriptions.
So instead of paying attention to the computer generated lists of who
should get what, they just throw a paper at every house that EVER gets
a paper, regardless of the list.

Sometimes it's even worse than that.  For years we received our metro
paper every day, without fail, even though we didn't have ANY 
subscription to the paper and called numerous times to try stop it.
We weren't on any subscription lists.  Apparently the delivery folks
found it easier to just throw a paper at every house in the area instead
of keeping track of the lists.  One can assume relatively few people
ever complained.

We apologise for the unexpected system shutdown today (Thursday).  This was
caused by a bug in the MTS system that was a "time-bomb" in all senses of the
word. It was triggered by today's date, 16th November 1989.
 
This date is specially significant. Dates within the file system are stored as
half-word (16 bit) values which are the number of days since the 1st March
1900. The value of today's date is 32,768 decimal (X'8000' hexadecimal). This
number is exactly 1 more than the largest positive integer that can be stored
in a half-word (the left-most bit is the sign bit). As a result, various range
checks that are performed on these dates began to fail when the date reached
this value.
 
The problem has a particular interest because all the MTS sites world-wide are
similarly affected. Durham and Newcastle were the first to experience the bug
because of time zone differences and we were the first to fix it.  The American
and Canadian MTS installations are some 4 to 8 hours behind us so the
opportunity to be the first MTS site to fix such a serious problem has been
some consolation.  The work was done by our MTS specialist who struggled in
from his sick bed to have just that satisfaction!

                        [I presume the MTS folks did not read <A HREF="/Risks/9.28.html">RISKS-9.28</A>, 
                        "Hospital problems due to software bug", in which

I do not recall seeing anything in Risks about the incident described in the
following front page article in the Nov 16 issue of (UK) Computer Weekly.  It
is here in full, as an amusing example for US readers of British "journalism".

 UK FAULT TOLERANCE SHINES AFTER US BLACKOUT

 Jon Kaye

 A fault-tolerant team from the UK has scored a valuable away win in
 New York despite strong opposition from the local favourites.

 IMP, a manufacturer of fault-tolerant Unix machines based on
 Motorola's 68030 processors, beat top US firms Tandem and Sequoia
 during last month's Unix Expo.

 On the final day a power cut left the exhibition centre without
 electricity for half the day.

 Quick-thinking Dick Penny, IMP's marketing manager, weaved his way
 into Tandem and Sequoia territory, lobbing offers for a competition
 once the power returned.

 "I thought it would be a good idea to see which machine would be up
 and running first once the power was back on," says Penny.

 Tandem and Sequoia agreed, the latter "reluctantly", Penny says. The
 referee was provided by Unix International, the Unix standards group,
 setting the stage for an exciting kick-off.

 The plucky UK lads were first to the goal in 70 seconds, followed by
 Tandem in two minutes and Sequoia in four.

 Penny denies suggestions that IMP caused the blackout itself to get
 the competition staged. "Four city blocks went out', he says.
 "Organising that would have overstretched our marketing budget for the show."

I thought I would relate a couple of horror stories about a hotel reservation

...  A lady in Utah started getting anonymous phone calls in June, 1974.  She
would answer the phone and hear nothing. Sometimes, if she kept asking who was
there, she would hear a loud screech before the caller hung up. Calls would
come at all times of day and night, but were most frequent between 1 and 2:30
AM. The phone company tried to trace the calls, but they were of very short
duration. They did determine that the calls were coming from area codes all
over the US, with a random distribution. They were puzzled.

Meanwhile, a number of Ramada franchisees complained that they were getting
billed for long distance calls on the phone line they had installed for their
new reservation system computer.

We investigated and discovered that there was a phone number that was
one dial pulse (there were lots of pulse-dial only exchanges then)
away from the 800 number that the computers were supposed to call.
We called the number and discovered on very frustrated lady! Ramada
payed for her to get a new phone number, and the problem went away.

....  Also in June, 1974, there were long distance telephone outages occurring
in the middle of the night, every night, in the Omaha, Nebraska, area. It turns
out that our 700 computers were all calling in in a very short period of time
after 0100MST, jamming the circuits. At 0100, our system started a period
(called End of Day) during which the computers called in rapidly to unload
their message queues. I had guessed at the number of lines, put it in a
configuration file, and forgotten about it. I had guessed 20 lines. There were
in fact quite a few less (I think there were 7). Thus the calls were coming in
at a rate way to high to be serviced. To make it worse, a failed call was
retried three times! The problem was corrected by changing the constant in the
configuration file.

After reading all the recent slate about computer-controlled everything (cars,
planes, trains, etc.), I realized something interesting: a layperson generally
doesn't trust computers because he or she doesn't understand them (they are
"black boxes").  A computer professional, on the other hand, doesn't trust them
*because* he or she *does* understand them (and their limitations).  This also
lead me to realize that ours is one of the few fields where we wouldn't
necessarily trust our "product" with our lives.  That is, doctors generally
will trust other doctors to operate on them, auto designers probably drive cars
(8-)), etc.  Yet, a programmer probably wouldn't trust a computer-controlled
plane or car very much (for good reason, in my opinion).  I'm not sure exactly
what this says, except that it is still a very immature field.

	[The Wall Street Journal, Novemeber 17, 1989, p. A16]

	WASHINGTON -- The Social Security Administration announced
	proposed standards for employer's computerized filing of wage
	data and said it might establish a certification process
	for software programs that comply.
		The software standards are designed to reduce 
	discrepancies between Internal Revenue Service tax data and
	Social Security wage data by requiring software programs
	to check for inconsistencies.  This would help ensure full
	credit to 130 million American workers.  The Social Security
	Administration routinely cross-checks data with the IRS.
	Improperly reported wages often result in workers receiving
	less than their entitled Social Security benefits.
		Each year, in as many as a million cases information
	reported to the IRS fails to match that reported to Social
	Security, said Norman Goldstein, the administration's chief
	financial officer.  He estimated that computer software is
	used for filing the wage data of 70% to 80% of U.S. workers.
		The proposed standards are voluntary, but Social
	Security Commisioner Gwendolyn King said she would like to
	see the draft proposal become the official U.S. standard.
	The administration is seeking comments on the software standard
	from business groups and software writers.

	[AAAS Science, 10 November 1989, vol. 246, p. 753]
	[by M. Mitchell Waldrop]

	Dig into any of the government's chronically over-budget and
	behind-schedule development programs -- the Hubble Space
	Telescope of the B1-B Bomber, for example -- and you'll find
	that a good fraction of what gets labeled as "waste, fraud,
	and abuse" actually stems from crummy software.  Not only do
	the development agencies habitually spend millions of dollars
	on operations software that is buggy, inadequate, and late,
	they have to spend millions of dollars more to fix it.
		So says a just released report [nb. "Bugs in the system:
	Problems in federal govenment computer software development and
	regulation"(Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the
	House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Government
	Printing Office, Washington, D.C., September 1989).] from the
	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Subcommittee
	on Investigations and Oversight.  Written by subcommittee staffer
	James Paul, who spent 2 years working on it, the report also
	names a culprit: the government itself.  "Government policies
	on everything from budgeting to intellectual property rights
	have congealed over time in a manner almost perfectly designed
	to thwart the development of quality software," it says.
		Paul's brief, but strongly worded report echoes the
	complaints that computer scientists have been muttering for
	years.  "The [federal government's] procurement process is as
	much or more to blaim for poor software as any other single
	thing," says Peter Freeman of George Mason University, who just
	finished up a stinit as head of the computer research division
	at the National Science Foundation.  "There are huge numbers of
	people involved [in the agencies] who fundamentally don't have
	the knowledge or experience to make good decisions with respect
	to procurements."
		The report says that reform must begin on the conceptual
	level, becuase purchasers still regard software as an afterthought.
	Project managers, agency heads, and congressmen alike tend to
	focus on sexy hardware such as radars, airframes, and engines,
	assuming that the software to control all this gadgetry can be
	taken care of later.  Yet that assumption can be costly.  In 1979,
	the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut down five nuclear reactors
	for upgrading; a software flaw in the computer-aided system used
	to design them had left them vulnerable to earthquake damage.
	In the mid-1980s, a Canadian-built radiation therapy machine, the
	Therac-25, killed at least four people when a software error
	irradiated patients with massive overdoses.
		"Software," says the report, "is now the choke point in
	large systems."
		On the other hand, it will be difficult to make the
	software development process more flexible because the federal
	procurement system effectively demands that contractors write
	the software using bad methodology.  "Out on the technical
	frontiers," the report says, "the government requires a legally
	binding contract specifying in excruciating detail exactly how
	the system will look at delivery some years hence."  The tacit
	assumption is that programmers will then use the specifications
	to write, test, and debug the software.  In the programming
	community this approach is known as the waterfall model because
	the work supposedly cascades from one stage to the next in
	systematic progression.
		But modern programmers consider the waterfall approach
	an abysmal way of doing things.  Especially when it comes to
	high-tech systems such as the Space Telescope's scheduling
	software or the B1-B's defensive electronics countermeasures
	systems -- both of which were software fiascos (Science, 17
	March 1989, p. 1437) -- it is essentially impossible for
	anyone to write detailed specifications in advance.  Not only
	does the hardware evolve during development, thereby forcing
	the specifications to change, but the hardware engineers
	themselves have no way of knowing what they really want from
	the software until they have had a chance to try it out.
		This is way the modern "evolutionary" approach to
	software development looks less like a waterfall than like a
	spiral.  Starting with general requirements, the programmers
	quickly cobble together one or more prototype systems.  The
	engineers then try out the prototypes on the evolving hardware.
	Their suggestions guide the programmers in refining new
	prototypes.  And the process repeats as long as is necessary.
	The payoff is that the programmers have a much better chance of
	catching errors in the design phase, when the bugs can be fixed
	at an estimated one-tenth to one-one hundredth the cost of
	fixing them after deployment, and the software as a whole has a
	much better chance of doing what it really needs to do.
		But flexibility is precisely what the spell-it-out-up-
	front procurement culture lacks, says the report.  In addition,
	the bereaucracy balks at the big up-front investment in problem
	definition that must be made when the evolutionary approach is
	used.  Furthermore, as the report notes, "mo program manager
	relishes the thought of defending a request for funds when the
	major activity seems to be endless arguments over abstruse
	technical points by large numbers of well-paid engineers."
		So, what can be done?  In the near term, very little,
	says the report.
		The Department of Defense and a few other agencies have
	begun to move away from the waterfall model, and Paul thinks
	those steps should be encouraged.  Better methods should be
	developed for evaluating the quality, reliability, and safety of
	software, the report says.  And perhaps the software community
	should be encouraged to establish some form of professional
	certification standards.
		But nothing fundamental is going to change without changes
	in the procurement culture, says the report.  And that is going
	to take awhile, even though chronic cost overruns and scandals
	are creating mounting pressures to do so.  "Its not something
	you can jump right in and legislate," Paul told Science.  "The
	federal procurement system is like a software system with bugs.
	Every time it's broken down, somebody has patched it.  But
	keeping it together is getting harder and harder and costing more
	money.  And at that point, an experienced software engineer would
	throw up his hands and say, 'Hey! Let's toss this out and start
	over.'"

Several people responded to my posting in 9.40 regarding "computer risks,"
and many of them seem to me to share the same fundamental confusion.  Let me
use Saltzer's response in 9.41 as a representative example.  He replied

&gt;I claim that it is not that simple.  In a traditional library, it was possible
&gt;to invade your privacy by making a list of all the books you have every 
&gt;checked out.  

Sorry but I believe it is in fact EXACTLY that simple and indeed the example
cited shows it to be so.

The crucial point is confusing the technology that makes an act feasible, with
the act itself.

As Jerry pointed out:
&gt; The speed and efficiency with which data can be processed by computer can
&gt; convert a neglible risk into one worth discussing.

Just so; it is now *worth discussing*.  But *what* is it we should *discuss*?
Privacy, not technology.

We ought to discuss whether records of one's book reading should in fact be
public.  True, the question never arose routinely before because it wasn't
pragmatically possible ("benign protection by the status quo," in Ware's
elegant phrase).  Previously the question was moot, now it is worth
discussing.  But what ought we to discuss?  The QUESTION, not the TECHNOLOGY
that rendered it relevant.  And question is, what rights to privacy ought I to
have when I borrow books from a public library?  That question (a social and
moral concern, as Dave Smith points out) is the central issue in such
discussion.

That discussion will need to be INFORMED by technology to some degree: people
need to understand that certain actions will become easy in a computerized
book lending system that were difficult before (e.g., monitoring,
compilations, cross-matching).  But those actions are now EASY rather than
HARD, not POSSIBLE vs UNIMAGINABLE.

On this point, Ware quotes Hamming to the effect that
&gt; "when something changes by an order of magnitude, there are fundamental 
&gt; new effects."

Perhaps, but it's important to understand that they are often new only in the
sense that we did not think of them previously (in the old technology), not
that they are incomprehensible or unimaginable in those terms.  For example,
monitoring, compilations, and cross-matching of library records are all
possible now for enormous databases.  But I can perfectly well understand them
and their effects by imagining the corresponding manual operations.  

That distinction in turn is very important because it empowers people.
Admitting that there is nothing fundamentally new in such a system makes it
clear that ordinary people (incredibly enough, even those without degrees in
computer science) can coherently and intelligently discuss these issues based
on their ordinary intuitions and feelings about privacy.  It even makes it
clear that if there is a relevant specialized experience for this discussion,
it is probably constitutional law, not computer science.

It's time to take the veil of technological mysticism off these issues.  And
it is we in particular who ought to remove the veil.  People need to
understand that their existing knowledge, experience, and opinions on privacy
(and other issues) are both relevant and sufficient for informed debate.  The
crucial decision is whether the information ought to be public, not how it is
to be accessed.

As for the argument that:
&gt; The Registrar of Motor Vehicles in Massachusetts has long used the "it has
&gt; always been public" argument on car registration information as an excuse for
&gt; selling tapes to mass mailers.

That's little more than a bad pun, playing off two meanings of "public".  But
perhaps we need a finer distinction to avoid being tripped up by it in the
future, hence my use of the term "pragmatically possible".  Neither the motor
vehicle nor the library data were in fact ever pragmatically public, so the
issue never arose.  But now they can be and now we need to decide whether they
ought to be.

And *that* decision has nothing to do with the technology that made the point
worth discussing, and everything to do with our own sensibilities about
privacy.

In a similar vein, David Smith suggests that
&gt; if there's no tool to implement [a policy] adequately... the policy
&gt; [will not be] pursued.  Only when a tool becomes available that makes
&gt; implementation feasible will the policy be ... implemented.  

Right, and then we should discuss the POLICY, not the technology that made it
worth discussing. 

He also adds:
&gt; It's possible to maintain large, irresponsibly constructed paper databases
&gt; on suspected child molesters, but not feasible.

Perhaps he's not had much experience with: insurance companies, medical
records, legal records, the early social security system, etc., etc.  Large
irresponsible paper databases have been with us a long time.

King claims that he
&gt; supports the original thesis that, for serious breaches of privacy,
&gt; lack of a computer is no protection against data collection.

True, lack of technology doesn't preclude serious breaches of privacy, hence to
some degree we've always faced these issues.  But that's not the point, and it
wasn't the original thesis.  Even if lack of computers DID prevent breaches of
privacy, that would only render the point moot; it would not ANSWER the
question.  And the question is, what rights to privacy ought we to have.

One might say that computerizing the records will make possible invasions,
hence it is a computer risk.  But then in the same breath one ought to point
out as King does that computerizing the records will make possible a
unprecendented degree of privacy (just erase the disk packs; no one could
erase all the records in each book every two weeks, another order of magnitude
effect).  Hence we ought also to talk about the computer benefit.  Then,
having established that the technology can be used both to invade and to
ensure privacy, we ought to get back to discussing the real question: what
kinds of privacy ought I to have?

Finally, Jerry indicated that he is
&gt; ... prepared to tolerate a certain amount of fuzziness in identifying the
&gt; edge of the computer-RISKS arena by our beleaguered moderator.

The message was to the multitudes, not the moderator.  It is important that we
all remove the illusions of mystery about this stuff.  People need to be
empowered to think about this on their own and we should be telling them that.
We need to make it clear to them that what makes the issue worth discussing
(the technology) is quite distinct from what the issue is (what rights to
privacy ought we to have).

I held off submitting this in the hope that someone who knew the complete story
would post it; that hasn't happened, so here's what I know.

There was a very close, and racially-charged, mayoral election in Yonkers, NY;
the challenger was rather unexpectedly reported the victor by 4,000 votes on
election night.  When the official tally was started, though, the incumbent had
picked up 1,500 votes in just 5 of the 12 precincts.  The count was suspended
for the weekend, with the voting machines impounded; when it was finished, the
original result -- and numbers -- were upheld.

What happened?  It's an old story here, I'm sure.  Before the election, the
tally program was run with test input data.  They forgot to take out the test
data when tabulating the real returns.  From the story I heard, it wasn't clear
if the error was in the official tally or in the early returns; given the
numerical result, I tend to suspect the former.

Roddy Stinson is a columnist for the San Antonio, Texas "Express-News".
Here's one Question &amp; Answer from his column of Nov. 14, 1989 under the
headline 'RAINSTORMS DIDN'T STOP THE ARMY WHEN I WAS IN IT':

  The complaint desk is open --

  PLAINT:  I am a retired Army sergeant.  My wife just got out of intensive
  care at Brooke Army Medical Center.  I tried to call BAMC to make a medical
appointment for her, and this is the message I got: 'The patient appointment
system cannot operate at this time.  Due to inclement weather, the computers
had to be taken down.  Please continue calling periodically.  Thank you.  This
is a recording.'  That's pitiful.  That's ridiculous.  What happened to
typewriters and phones?  If a rainstorm can shut down the country, we're in big
trouble.  I'll tell you one thing -- rainstorms didn't stop the Army when I was
in it.  They told me to keep marching, and I did.
  
  [Stinson:] A spokesman for BAMC explained: "This (computer shutdown) happens
every time there is a possibility of thunderstorms because the central
appointments system is linked to a mainframe a mile and a half away, and if
lightning hits the lines, everything on there could be erased."  When I
expressed skepticism, he added: "Believe me, it has happened.  Lightning takes
out our phone system and electricity on a regular basis."  Progress marches on.

     Upon doing a routine, periodic inquiry of the local credit bureau to make
sure they have things reasonably straight on my credit report, I made a rather
disturbing discovery. The report issued to me, and presumably to whatever
business (or person representing themselves as a business) contains not only
the expected credit information, but THE NAMES, CREDIT LIMIT, ISSUERS, AND CARD
NUMBERS OF ALL MY CREDIT CARDS AS WELL! It might pay others on RISKS to find
out if this sort of thing is SOP, or merely the result of the incompetence of
our local bureau.

My bank, First Interstate, has recently implemented a handy new service.  Using
any touch-tone phone, bank customers may get information about the status of
their account at any time.  Normally, to get an account balance, the customer
must enter the amount of his latest deposit.  This provides, I feel, at least
some measure of security.  The problem is that the system also allows merchants
to check a check.  That is, will a check, for a certain amount, from a certain
account, clear at this time?  There is no security for this procedure.  The
merchant simply dials, enters the single digit code "6 - Validate a check" from
the vocal menu, enters the account number, and finally the amount.  The
computer will then return a boolean clear/no-clear.  Computer Science students
will recognize this for what it actually is: a medium for a binary search.  (At
this point I refer the interested reader to _Sorting and Searching_ by Knuth.)
The potential for abuse is obvious: Given the account number, it becomes
trivial to find the account balance.

My only shock is that the designers of the system were so casual about the
RISKS involved.

In RISKS 9.45 David Benson quotes from a Science article by M. Mitchell
Waldrop:
  ... But flexibility is precisely what the spell-it-out-up-
  front procurement culture lacks, says the report.  In addition,
  the bureaucracy balks at the big up-front investment in problem
  definition that must be made when the evolutionary approach is used. 

These two sentences seem inconsistent to me.  What's the difference between
"spell-it-out-up-front" detailed specifications, and a "big up-front investment
in problem definition?"  There's some fuzzy thinking going on here.

I agree that it is impossible to precisely specify a large software system when
the hardware environment and functional requirements aren't frozen.  In those
situations it may be necessary to prototype the system in order to understand
the problem.

But I don't believe the software development community has reached consensus
about tossing out the waterfall method.  My feeling is that it is our inability
or unwillingness to document requirements and specifications rigorously that is
the source of most fiascos.  Maybe the government requires the wrong kinds of
details in its specifications, and doesn't adequately review them for sanity.

How will switching from "specifications" to "problem definitions," and then
hacking together a prototype which is then "evolved" solve any problems?  This
is the old method of software development that modern software engineering
methods are trying to get us out of.  Only if you throw away the prototype
might there be hope you can then specify the system correctly.

  In Risks 9.45 David Benson discusses bugs in government software and
discusses some of the causes/reasons behind them.  I'd like, some day, to
actually see two notes in the forum at the same time in a scenario like: David
discusses problems with detailed up-front procurement specs and someone else
discussing the problems with less-than-complete procurement specs causing
problems.  It seems to be a no-win situation. Those up-front specs didn't come
out of nowhere. They were Congress', watchdogs', politician's etc. attempts to
solve a problem.  In typical Congressional ways, they use atomic weapons to
kill flies(!).  Each line in those regulations was probably the result of some
(comparatively) trivial screw up.  It has since cost us multiple orders of
magnitud more to "fix" the problem than to let it alone.

  David's suggestion to abandon the waterfall approach to software
design is good, but it carries the rather large risk that if it
doesn't happen to work ONE TIME, you might get a "Golden Fleece" award
and have your career dead-ended.

  As an interesting aside, I found issue 9.45 to have more meat in it than many
in a long time.  David's discussion, and the discussion of technology vs.
policy is what this forum needs more of.  Maybe the recent chastisers have had
a good effect.  Thanks.

about Congress finding bugs in software...

&gt; the Hubble Space Telescope of the B1-B Bomber, for example ...

Now I neither do work on the HST, or the B1-B, but I know something of both
systems.  I would suggest to Congress, Mr. Benson, or the author of the AAAS
article (which ought to know better), that mounting the HST on the B1-B (I
would guess as a bomb sight, having no other conceivable purpose by my guess)

RADAR AT U.S. BASE CAN TRIGGER PLANES' EJECTION SEATS:  LETTER
[ From the Montreal Gazette, 23 November 1989 ]

Knight-Ridder Newspapers

Robins Air Force Base, Ga. - The US air force has learned that radiation
from its PAVE PAWS radar at Robins AFB could activate internal equipment
- including ejection seats and fire extinguishers - on virtually all
planes that land at the base.        

The disclosure was made in an Air Force "update" letter to Senator Sam
Null (D-Ga.) made public this week by the senator's Washington office. 

Although the air force originally said that PAVE PAWS would not endanger
electro-explosive devices other than those on the outside of its plane, a
recent review of the radar has concluded otherwise, the air force letter said.

"As a result, Air Force Space Command is co-ordinating with the Air Logistics
Center at Robins AFB to implement procedures to ensure aircraft with internal
EEDs are also protected," wrote Maj.-Gen. Burton R. Moore, the air force's
director of legislative liaison.

But Nunn, in a written reply to Moore dated Nov. 20, says that the air force
hasn't fully answered his questions of last January, and has "raised new
questions" with its latest update.

"It would be helpful to know more about the hazard to such devices, what the
devices are used for, and what aircraft are equipped with them.  I would also
like to know how the air force determined that these devices were at risk,"
said the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman in his two-page letter.

The radiation hazard to internal EEDs is the latest safety revelation
concerning the southeastern PAVE PAWS - built too close the runway at Robins
AFB.  The radar, one of four nationwide, is designed to warn of sea launched
missile attacks and track satellites in space.  But since November of 1987, the
air force has been turning off the north face Robins PAVE PAWS to protect
vulnerable planes landing on its runway 3 kilometres north of the radar.

According to air force documents obtained by Knight-Ridder Newspapers
recently under the Freedom of Information Act, one aircraft at risk to
PAVE PAWS is the Strategic Air Command's KC-135R tanker, some of which
are based at the 19th Air Refuelling Wing at Robins.

EED equipment on other aircraft includes "flare/chaff dispensers,
pylon/ejector racks, tactical missiles, cruise missiles, crew escape, and
engine start cartridges," according to air force documents.

I have a copy of the report David Benson's message referred to--the
congressional committee report called "Bugs in the Program"--and I have some
comments on its recommendations about software development.  

There is an emphasis in the report--an overemphasis in my view--on the Federal
procurement process for software.  This is probably understandable given the
source of the report; Congress is concerned about spending money, not about
methodological issues in software engineering.  However, the attention being
given to this report, and its emphasis on the procurement process, could lead
to some misconceptions in the Congress about the nature of the problems we
face.

The fundamental problem about emerging computer risks is that computer
scientists are trying to integrate, in a systematic and predictable fashion,
three domains:  discrete state machines, the highly contingent and
variable-rich nature of the "real world," and the equally unpredictable
character of human subjectivity and intent.  This is a project similar to that
of Leibniz, for example, when he said that what philosophy should aim for is a
mathematical calculus that would provide an equation for any question--in other
words, absolute certainty for any aspect of experience, expressed in logical
and mathematical evidence.  Leibniz didn't succeed, and for the most part we
don't take this kind of enterprise seriously anymore, except in developing
complex computer systems.  

Since the whole nature of the "software crisis" is really just a dilemma
produced by the inability of people to adequately predict the future down to
the level of detail required by computers and their ancillary equipment, it is
something of a wonder why so many people are puzzled by the fact that we find
ourselves in this conundrum, or why we're wasting so much money in this effort.
Not to be too melodramatic about it, but the core of the Greek tragic tradition
is a mortal protagonist trying to manipulate the world according to his
designs, and then discovering, usually by running up against the wrath of the
gods, the limits of human power.  These days the gods deliver their lessons by
burning up mountains of money.

There seems to be a cognitive block on the part of many people in the
policymaking apparatus in understanding the real nature of the problem.  The
congressional report, for example, once again hauls out the various government
reports on the Strategic Defense Initiative and its software problems, as
though this idea was legitimate to begin with, that the whole thing is
something more than just an embarrassing boy's fantasy of omnipotence in space,
etc.  The Congress continues to treat the SDI, and its software difficulties,
as a real technical challenge, one that is only receiving less attention than
previously because of budget problems and the changing nature of the Soviet
threat.  The report quotes the Defense Science Board when it said that the "The
Strategic Defense Initiative. . . has a monumental software problem that must
be solved to attain the goals of the initiative."  This sentence makes one
slack-jawed with amazement.  Not only is it eye-rollingly obvious, but it
harrumphs that this "software problem" is something to be solved, which by now
should be considered completely absurd.  As Jack Ruina of MIT once said, the
SDI should have all the scientific credibility of astrology or water-dousing,
so the sentence of the DSB quoted in the congressional report should have all
the solemnity and relevance of a pronouncement on one's moon in Pisces.  The
fact that the SDI "software problem" is still discussed as a vexing issue of
public policy and an example of the growing software crisis shows how far off
the Congress is from understanding the true nature of the problem.

Another showcase example of the report is the B-1 bomber, and the citations
about the B-1 are once again from government agencies, the well-known
muckraking journal Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, and Jacques Gansler of
MIT, who is not only famous for his sympathy to the Pentagon, but who also runs
a private defense consulting firm.  There are no references to Nick Kotz's book
*Wild Blue Yonder:  Money, Politics, and the B-1 Bomber* (1988, Princeton
University Press), widely considered the definitive book on this fiasco.  Kotz
says, "After a continuous thirty-year defense buildup, marked by [such]
repeated excesses, the military program is totally out of control."  This
context in which large software projects are developed is completely absent
from the congressional report.  The story of the B-1 is not a story of
technical or procurement failures relating to its avionics software, although
this is certainly part of the overall narrative.  It is a sad and enraging
story of mismanagement, overselling, congressional cowardice and laziness, and
propaganda.  "Improved" software procurement procedures would be nearly
negligible in any real remedy to these problems.

The report by James H. Paul and Gregory C. Simon does provide a real service in
that it alerts the somnambulist Congress to some of the problems with software
safety, reliability, and professional education.  But if the result of the
report is to try and crack the whip on the software engineering profession in
order to produce more efficient development of code for the SDI, or for the B-1
bomber, or any number of projects that are doomed for entirely exogenous
reasons, the report will be regrettable.  The report recommends professional
certification, for example, which is an issue that I have not developed a
position on, but it seems to me completely premature to be talking about
professional certification for software professionals when the Pentagon itself
is a runaway train, and largely due to Congress' gullibility over high tech
funding requests.  It seems comic and slapstick if the Congress has overseen a
project like the B-2 bomber, for example, on which we have spent $22 billion,
and then is alerted by the Pentagon that this aircraft will cost somewhere
around half a billion dollars per copy, which puts Congress into a swirling
faint all of a sudden--and then when Congress recovers it shakes a wagging
finger at software engineers?  Or after spending $16 billion on SDI research,
Congress lethargically asks, how much will the software cost for this thing,
and the answer is eighty-eight kigillion dollars and the lifetime careers of
every single programmer in the Free World (which appears to be expanding).  And
Congress says, years into this thing, What??!!  Why weren't we told?  Let's see
a report on professional certification and the ethics of this profession!  Give
us a break!  The SDI was wasting money when it was just an idea in a paid
official's head, if he was thinking about it during working hours.

So it seems disingenuous to me, even if the intent was noble, to produce a
congressional report that quotes approvingly the following passage:  "Education
is the seedbed of good practice.  Whether computer science education in
American universities is contributing to or inhibiting good software practice
is not clear. . . ."  There is the clear call for "professionalization" of the
software field, and for the weeding out of incompetents and unethical bad
apples.  This from an institution that is a nonstop geyser of money for
crackpot ideas and mismanagement, money that will of course be willingly
deposited by people who are "professionals" at taking government money.
Congress, in a bar wearing a suit bulging with cash, and willing to listen to
every customer with a harebrained scheme for a big expensive system that will
save the world from disaster, is growling and spoiling for a fight when it
finds itself on the street wearing nothing but boxer shorts.  The
"cautiousness" of Congress in getting religion about software reliability and
cost overruns starts to look pretty silly, like one of the rich, pompous and
street-stupid louts that the Marx Brothers were always taking to the cleaners.

The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has just published a new
comprehensive report on software development, government procurement, and user
saftey risks called Bugs in the Program.  The cause of the study was the
Therac-25 X-ray therapy system, which has been discussed elsewhere [in RISKS].
The well-researched report describes some of the reasons for a software crisis,
citing inadequate technical capability to predict reliability and safety as
causes of accidents due to software.  In addition, it points out that all
government agencies have difficulty in managing complex software development
due to lack of technical and management training and experience.  Also,
inadequacies in computer science education and ethical training in our
profession are noted.

The rigid hardware approach to procurements and development is criticized as
being inappropriate to software, the most flexible part of systems.  (One
almost forgets this after living with these standards for a few years.)
Prototyping and user interaction during development is recognized as promoting
success.

The report recommends that Dr. Demming's statistical process control methods be
applied to software development and testing.  Further, it recommends that a
Working Group be established under the committee to begin improving the
software development process within the government, with assistance from NASA.
More research into future software problems and solutions should be funded, and
the government should develop the capability to evaluate proposed improvements
in the development process.

&gt; These two sentences seem inconsistent to me.  What's the difference
&gt; between "spell-it-out-up-front" detailed specifications, and a "big
&gt; up-front investment in problem definition?"  There's some fuzzy thinking
&gt; going on here.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that it is impossible to precisely specify a large software
&gt; system when the hardware environment and functional requirements aren't
&gt; frozen.  In those situations it may be necessary to prototype the system
&gt; in order to understand the problem.

I believe you've hit the nail on the head in your second paragraph, and
in effect answered the question you raise in the first.

The "spell-it-out-up-front", detailed-specification approach attempts to spell
out THE SOLUTION in great detail.  For example, the contract might call for a
microprocessor-based implementation using a distributed network of FooBaz 413
MPUs, running a real-time operating system capable of responding to interrupts
in no no more than 0.8263 nanofidgets, and capable of processing 1763
meta-shift-cokebottle commands per cup of coffee.

These sort of solution-specifications are often very comforting to the
contract-writer... they provide a detailed, measurable, and testable
description of the solution which must be delivered.  When the project
ends, it's relatively easy to compare the solution-as-specified with the
solution-as-delivered, and see whether there are any shortfalls.

This is all fine... as long as the person writing the specification _really_
understands what the problem is, and is actually capable of specifying a
package which will solve the problem.  If so, everybody's happy.

However... as others have pointed out, the solution is often specified
well before the problem is really understood, or by people who aren't as
aware of the problem as they should be.  The net result is a situation
we've seen all too often... a solution is delivered, it meets all of
the project specifications, and yet proves to be inadequate when
actually tested in the field, or to be incompatible with other packages
it really _should_ work with, or...

Things can get much worse... if, for example, the specification is
changed part-way through the project.  Adding a new requirement or two
to the specification can throw the whole implementation effort entirely
out of joint... leading to schedule slippage, cost overruns, or a
patchwork solution that proves to be unmaintainable.  All too often, the
solution must be thrown away, and a new one developed at great
expense... often by the same process, alas.

To paraphrase a guy I work with: "Don't hire me as a designer, and then
tell me what to implement.  If you do, you've just done my job, and you
don't need me.  Instead, tell me about your problem."

Given recent discussion about programming and programmer standards, and
the kind and quality of training programmers do or should get, I noticed
(and pondered the implication of) an ad on the Boston subway for a trade
school (CPI) in Cambridge, Mass., that announced the following training
schedule for four computer-type jobs:
Computer Operator - 20 weeks
Computer programmer - 12 weeks
Computer technician - 7 months
Data entry operator - 20 weeks

Seems a tad short time in which to learn programming with any depth
or proficiency, except maybe Basic.  Would any of you, in the position
to do so, risk hiring an entry-level programmer from such a training
program?

The school claims a 97% (overall) placement rate for its grads.  Nothing
about accreditation, or enrollment requirements, etc.  Too bad all the
little tear-off info cards had been torn off.

TRW lists all information received from their customers, or, clients, as TRW
calls them, I believe. 

This info includes the name of the client, your account number with them, the
type of account, the balance, balnce past-due, who has requested your credit
history and personal information such as social security numbers, your
residence addresses for at least the past few years as well as personal
information on whomever uses your credit accounts.

TRW also has a program called TRW Credentials Service which you may subscribe
to. For thirty-five dollars per year, you can get your credit record that is on
file with them. They also send you forms to fill out and return to them that -
if you fill them out completely - contain a complete and current financial
profile of you and your family. This information is kept online along with the
regular credit file and is made available "only upon application and with your
PIN code, which you provide the person or agency which would request it."

There are some really serious privacy problems with this service. Of course,
TRW is still a popular target for crackers and it is used by government, 
businesses, et cetera, looking for information. I have asked TRW to tell me
who would have access to my records without my knowledge and they have thus
far not only refused to make a reply but never, ever answer any written 
request for information that I make. (TRW also says that they will notify me
anytime someone requests a copy of my credit report but have failed to do
so: I have received an updated report in response to sending them a correction
to it and it shows some inquiries that were never reported to me.)

My bank had implemented a Telephone Banking service a couple of years ago, but
their implementation of security is a bit better.  To get in, you enter the
last ten digits of your ATM card and then your four-digit PIN code.  Once in,
you can check your balance, inquire on check status (by check number) or a
recent check history, last deposit, transfer funds between accounts, and even
pay bills.

The only problem I've ever had with it is occasionally I'll enter *SOS# to talk
to a Customer Service Representative, get the voice message (with annoying
pauses: "Please . hold . on . and a . customer . service . representative .
will . assist . you!" (note that there is no pause between "and a" :-) ).  Then
a click, and then a dialtone!  After hitting a key on the phone to see what it
would do, I get transferred back to the telephone banking service.  Isn't that
special! :-)

(Customers can go directly to the representatives by entering a different menu
code before going to the telephone banking service.  If they try and ask for
any information on an account, the representatives will have them go back to
the service and enter their 10 and 4 digit codes for security.)

In comp.risks osborn@cs.utexas.edu (John Howard Osborn) writes

&gt;My bank, First Interstate, has recently implemented a handy new service.
&gt;...  The problem is that the system also allows merchants
&gt;to check a check.  That is, will a check, for a certain amount, from a certain
&gt;account, clear at this time?  There is no security for this procedure.

Actually, this is another case of technology making things easier, but not
making a fundamental change.  I have an aquaintance who used to manage a small
shopping center.  He performed a simple search on a deadbeat tenant's account
by calling the bank
	"I have a check for $1000.  Is it good?"
then calling a different branch
	"I have a check for $2000.  Is it good?"
etc.  He was then able to tell the tenant exactly how much back rent would be
paid that month.  It is an amusing story when told from the point of view of my
acquaintance, not so amusing from a privacy viewpoint.

&gt; ...  A lady in Utah started getting anonymous phone calls in June, 1974. 

The area code for Utah is 801.

&gt; We investigated and discovered that there was a phone number that was
&gt; one dial pulse (there were lots of pulse-dial only exchanges then)
&gt; away from the 800 number that the computers were supposed to call.
&gt; We called the number and discovered on very frustrated lady! Ramada
&gt; [paid] for her to get a new phone number, and the problem went away.

The only area code that is one pulse away from 800 is 809.  This is the
area code for Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and The Bahamas.

Did the lady in Utah have an 800 number?  Or was she having her calls
forwarded from her winter residence in St. Johns? 8-)

Jon Mauney's story about using check inquiries to determine the balance in an
account rang a familiar bell.  My mother once managed several apartment
complexes.  One month a deadbeat tenant gave her a $250 check which bounced.
When the check was returned, my mother used the same method described by Mauney
to determine that the account had a balance of $220.  She then went to the
bank, deposited $30 cash in the deadbeat's account, and cashed the $250 check.
I've always wondered what the deadbeat's reaction was when he discovered what
happened.

A friend of mine, in part inspired by my sucess as a programmer, decided to
enroll in a two quarter "Computer Programmer" course of study at a Columbus,
OH, trade school. After a week, she had learned how to turn on an IBM PC clone
without it exploding or chasing people around the room. By the end of the
fourth week she had "learned Lotus." They then proceeded to the complexities of
BASIC. In just a few short weeks, she "learned BASIC." She couldn't describe
any but the simplest of algorithms and had no means of attack for simple
programming problems, but she could tell me all the "command words" in the
language. She dropped out before they got to the crowning achievement of the
program, DBASE III.

All through this time I was incredulous. These people expected to be
programmers. They were told that "starting salery for some programmers is
$35/hr." Yet they weren't even addressing fundemental algorithms, common
approaches to problem solving, or anything more than a Jr. High level "Here is
a word problem. Now solve it." I approached an instructor/administrator at the
school with some of my reservations and was told that they were being taught
"enough to get out into the workplace." What amazed me even more was that my
knowledge of "real programming" far exceeded his, even though my schoolwork was
in Physics, not CS.

No, I would not hire a graduate of such a program. Neither it seems would much
of Columbus. We had subsequent contact with four of the graduates of the
program. Only one had been employed in "computer programming" within four
months of graduation. He had worked for a week on a problem that was entirely
too advanced for him, and been allowed to resign gracefully. (Two were working
as cashiers, the fourth unemployed.)

I discovered that MCI (my default long-distance company) was having a bad
day when I tried to call my folks on Thanksgiving afternoon. I tried four
times in a row, and each time, instead of being connected (or getting a
"sorry" recording), I was patched into other peoples' conversations. What a
failure mode!

After satisfying myself that MCI had a bug, I selected ATT (10288+number)
and made my call. But most telephone users probably don't know how to do
that (despite ATT's best efforts); in the US we have become accustomed to
phones always working right.

(I am not an employee or stockholder of MCI or ATT. MCI usually works fine.)

David desJardins mentions a set of figures I've heard before, to wit

    ... look at neutron-activation bomb detectors, to be installed in
    airports.  They are said to have something like a 3% false positive
    rate. ...  Let's say that it [rate of bags with bombs to bags without]
    is 1 in 30 million ...  That corresponds to 1 million false positives
    for every true positive.  *That* is a high rate of error.  And our
    society has chosen to spend nearly a billion dollars on that system.

I'd question whether a system with such a high rate of error will help, or
whether it might not actually make things worse.  If the operator knows (or
works out from experience, as they certainly will even if they are not told)
that out of every million bags which the system says need looked at by the bomb
squad, only one actually contains anything suspicious, then it must be
painfully tempting to say 'well, I'm in a hurry today, can probably let just
this one through'.  And of course since this will usually be 'right' in the
sense that nothing untoward will happen, it will tend to be self-reinforcing
carelessness.  I can see where such a system might create a false sense of
security based on 'gosh, new technology that can detect any form of explosive'
while in fact increasing the chances of non-detection owing to the 'boy who
cried wolf' syndrome.

In short, while more research is almost certainly worthwhile, I don't believe
that putting this system into service in its present state of development could
be considered a responsible act.  Probably win votes, though.

The Computer Virus Catalog now classifies 45 viruses (AMIGA:24;MSDOS:15;
Atari:6). Activities are undertaken to make the documents available via servers
in different regions of the world; we hope that we can announce such servers in
the next weeks. If you wish to receive the documents (see Index appended, with
length of the documents given) sooner, please send a short request to the
author.

The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
established a new Internet mailing list named CERT-TOOLS.

The purpose of this new mailing list is to encourage the exchange of
information on security tools and security techniques.  The list
should not be used for security problem reports.

The CERT/CC has found that many sites have developed tools and
techniques to improve the security of their systems (e.g. tools to
assist users' selection of passwords that are difficult to guess,
account management techniques, monitors that help detect unauthorized
system access).  Also, several tool developers have expressed an
interest in sharing their work with others.  We hope this mailing list
will spawn new security tool development and allow individual sites to
take advantage of existing work.

The mailing list will not be moderated and the CERT/CC will not
formally review, evaluate, or endorse the tools and techniques
described.  The decision to use the tools and techniques described is
the responsibility of each user or organization and we encourage each
organization to thoroughly evaluate new tools and techniques before
installation or use.

Membership is restricted to system programmers, system administrators
and others with a legitimate interest in the development of computer
security tools.  If you would like to be considered for inclusion,
please send mail to:
        cert-tools-request@cert.sei.cmu.edu
You will receive confirmation mail when you have been placed on the
list.

We ask that the mailing list not be used for file transfers.  If you
have a tool or technique that you would like to share, please mail a
description of the tool or technique to the mailing list and describe
how others can acquire the tool or obtain additional information. The
CERT/CC is planning to collect many of the tools and will make the
archive available via anonymous ftp on the cert.sei.cmu.edu system.

All mail intended to be redistributed should be mailed to:
	cert-tools@cert.sei.cmu.edu

Please feel free to inform other colleagues interested in security
tools and security techniques about this list.  Also, please send
comments, criticisms, and suggetions on this or any other CERT/CC
activity to:
        cert@cert.sei.cmu.edu

Thank you,

Randy Davis certainly offers a coherent argument and we should be clear just
how much it would take to refute it.  His argument, at least as I understand
it, requires that one accept no more than our society's usual definition of
engineering as an instrumental activity: ends are to be distinguished from
means; society decides upon its ends; and engineering concerns itself with the
means.  If new technology facilitates certain forms of invasion of privacy,
then that calls for a societal decision about privacy, not about technology.
To refute this argument (if that is something one wishes to do) one must
address this distinction between ends and means, arguing either that it does
not make sense, that it does not and could not remotely approximate the actual
conditions, or that it is inherently unhealthy for us to organize our thinking
in those terms.  All of these arguments have been made [*], though not so far
as I recall on the Risks list.  Arguing the points in the abstract would
presumably be a uselessly redundant activity, but using the many examples that
come up on the list to explore them concretely could well be constructive.

This scenario was used in _THE CASE OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR_, a Perry Mason
mystery by Erle Stanley Gardner.  In it, a wealthy elderly man was
institutionalized by his money-grubbing relatives, and they got a court order
that forced the bank to turn over all of the man's assets.  Well, the man had
previously written a $125,000 check to a niece of his (who wasn't
money-grubbing, just poor).  But there was no money in the account to cover it,
because of the court order.  After the court order, the bank received a $50,000
deposit for that man's account from a past-due business transaction.  Mason
took out a loan for $75,000, deposited it in the account, cashed the $125,000
check, and repaid the loan, along with $12.50 interest, all within 15 minutes.
And it was entirely legal, because the court order had specified that the bank
had to turn over all money *currently* deposited in the bank.  The book
mentioned here was published in 1965.

	As with the case of the library card records recently discussed,
there is nothing particularly new about this risk just because computers
have made it easier to exploit.  In chapter 7 of Paul Theroux's novel "Fong
and the Indians", published in 1968, exactly the same scheme is used to
cash at least part of a meant-to-bounce 1000 shilling check against a 632
shillings ninepence balance.  The book does not make it clear how the
actual balance in the account was discovered, however.

John DeBert, in the referenced article provides a good summary of TWR's
"promised practice" in protecting the privacy of credit records while affording
anyone access to his/her own information.

It's chilling to reflect upon the fact that, in my community, TRW runs a
for-profit alcoholism treatment center to which first-time DWI offenders are
often sent for treatment as part of a program of "probation before judgement."
One wonders how mutually compartmented these TRW operations are?

I forwarded Brian Randell's item, "UNIX EXPO Blackout" from RISKS forum 9.45,
to Tandem's internal mail system.  I received several responses which seemed to
fall into one of two categories: (1) requests for more information, and (2)
justifications of Tandem's performance in the "race" described in the article.

I found these responses curious since they seemed to diregard the fact that I
was merely repeating third- or fourth-hand information.

Meanwhile, no one seems to have noticed this fatal flaw in the original contest:
fault tolerence has no direct relationship with how fast a computer restarts
after a power failure (unless, of course, it fails to come up at all).  Even
computers that make no claims whatever about fault tolerence (such as the
lowliest PC) still are expected to restart after a power outage.

A recent RISKS posting on credit information reminded me of an incident
that happened to me a few years ago.

Due to some flaw in my personality, I love to fill out questionaires.  One day
I received a "marketing" questionaire on oil-well speculations, the last
question of which was "Would you be interested in hearing about opportunities
in this area?"  I answered that one, "no" and mailed the questionaire off.

Soon I started receiving phone calls from oil-well salesmen.  Having forgotten
all about the questionaire, I asked one of these salesmen where he got my name.
He said from some data service in Texas; he even read my profile which
described me as a "wealthy entrepeneur who likes to invest in high-risk
projects".

I wrote to the company sending the data, informing them of their error.
They responded with a form letter explaining my rights under the Fair
Credit Practices Act.  Since their information about me was not derogatory,
I did not respond.

Later when I got yet another sales call I explained about the flakey
data base in Texas.  The salesman responded that he didn't get my name from
there--he got it from Dunn and Bradstreet!

So, now that I'm rich, I'm working on famous.  Anyone know who runs the
computers for "Who's Who in America"?

The other day, whilst merrily shopping at my lovely neighborhood Mervyn's, I
overheard a conversation between a gentleman buying some clothes (shirts I
think) and the cashier.  A disagreement arose over the price of a shirt: the
customer thought it was on sale for 14.95, but the "computer" responded to the
bar code with a price of 15.99.  (Note: all the price tags I saw had the price
clearly printed, by "the computer" of course, beneath the bar code.  Perhaps
the tag in question had been mutilated.)  The customer, not at all irate,
wanted to check the price he thought was advertised on a small placard above
the display on which he found the garment.  The salesperson gladly agreed, but
pointed out two things: first, that they never have prices that are NN.95;
second, that "the computer is usually right".  The customer grinned and said
"No, I build systems, and I know that's not true."

"Well, gee," I thought to myself.  I work on computer systems, and while I know
that they have the potential of being pretty danged wrong in pretty big ways, I
also know that the salesperson was right: *usually* the computer is right; or,
more precisely in this case, when she presents the UPC code to the POS
terminal, and the thing likes it and responds with the price that matches the
code, most of the time it will be correct.  It may be the case that the
database has not been properly updated to match short-term sales, as
(apparently, from previous postings in RISKS) happens in grocery stores, but I
really must wonder if it's correct to say that the computer is "wrong".  In the
Mervyn's example, there is the additional "ECC" of the Mervyn's pricing scheme,
which only allows certain fractions.  (In the end, the customer decided that
the computer was right after all.)

I'm as leary of computerization as the next man, but not to the point of having
an almost manic distrust.  I'm not an auto mechanic or designer, but off the
top of my head I can name a few critical systems that could fail on 280 at 70
mph with disastrous consequences.  I still drive.  I ride a bicycle, but I
can't really say I trust those little spokes.  In short, I don't have complete
faith in *any* system I trust with my life, but I use (and rely on) those
systems nevertheless.

  Like almost all old [more than 70 years], large [more than 10,000 people]
institutions, the government did not get to be as successful as it is by acting
the way it does now.  [Paraphrased from the original statement by Robert
Townsend, in _Up the Organization._ He was talking about GM.  Similar symptoms,
probably same causes.]

  An all too typical scenario for developing the technical section of a DoD RFP
[request for proposal] is that some technical folks may write 10 pages of plain
English, describing what they want; e.g., a typical mini-computer RFP may begin
with a list of software tools and applications that the users must have; then
talk about relaibility, so that the uses will indeed be able to work; then
mention cost, so that bidders don't blow the budget; then specify that the new
system must interface to the extant network; and finally, within those
constraints, be as fast as possible.

  Enter then the good people who must actually negotiate the contract.
Usually, that means least cost, or best bargain.  So the above RFP gets
rewritten to put cost first, and speed next; the software gets put in as a list
of "mandatory" and/or "desirable" options.  [Yes, that's one of my favorite
oxymorons - "mandatory option."]  Reliability is addressed in terms of
guaranteed response times to failures.  [An argument was once made by H-P that
it is better to respond in two days to only one failure per year, than in two
hours to a failure every week.  Sometimes the government accepts such logic;
sometimes not.]  Network interface is often left as an exercise for the buyer.
[On other occasions, "compatibility" becomes the reason for a sole source buy
of a the same brand, similar model.]  In most cases, those 10 pages now number
over 100.  And the rewrite usually takes 6 months or more.

  At the extreme, we have written specifications for systems that the vendors
do not make; e.g., instead of saying that we want lots of disk capacity in
little floor space, we specify drive characteristics.  That has led to some "no
bid" responses, much to the consternation of both sides.  And the process then
exceeds a year, including rewrites.  In that much time, the project needs have
evolved, since 25% to 35% of the project schedule has elapsed; and of course
the computer industry has evolved too; almost one PC-generation has passed.

  Ancient wisdom tells us that "Too many cooks spoil the broth."  That "A camel
is a horse designed by a committee."  Modern wisdom [Robert Heinlein] tells us
that "A committee is an animal with at least 6 legs and no brain."

  Why do we do this?  One good friend, Harry Parode, says that we only strive
to spend public funds honestly.  Somehow, we seem to feel that, if enough
people contribute enough words, the RPF, and the resulting system, will be
better.  I doubt it.  I tend to agree with the lesson in the story told after
CRAY Research built a better scientific computer than mighty IBM: Thomas Watson
asked how three dozen folks could beat a team of about 1000; when Seymour Cray
was told of the inquiry, he opined, "I believe Mr. Watson has answered his own
question."

Disclaimer: The opinions herein are my own; and I know darn well that the
government does NOT agree.

I have followed with interest the recent discussions of vote-counting errors in
Durham NC, Yonkers NY and elsewhere.  Perhaps the following may be of interest.
It is a discussion of a specific vote counting problem in a jurisdiction where
I served until last year as an elected official.

Lawrence Kestenbaum, 506 S. Albany St., Ithaca NY 14850          (607) 272-7750

  [grad student at Cornell University in City and Regional Planning
  (specializing in Historic Preservation), an attorney licensed in Michigan
  (number P34957), and a former Ingham County Mich Commissioner, elected from
  the 8th District in 1982, 1984 and 1986.  Nothing in this message is private
  or privileged information.] 

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Some of the recent problems with inaccurate election-night vote tallies can be
traced to the badly-handled interface between computer and manual systems.
Non-electronic vote counts, for example, are mistyped on computer screens
during the hectic atmosphere of election night.  Of course, when the computer
system plays the dominant role, the difficulties with the non-computerized
parts are even greater.

While most of the Northeast still votes on the old-style lever machines, the
Midwest -- Michigan at least -- has largely moved to computer punch card
ballots.  Punch cards have certain advantages: in the event of a recount, a
tangible, anonymous record exists of each voter's choices.  By contrast,
recount lawyers are often able to find whole voting machines whose votes must
be excluded from the count because of mechanical problems, thus disfranchising
anyone who voted on that machine.  Other problems are possible, but all in all,
results from punch card jurisdictions are regarded as being much more 'firm'
and resistant to being altered in recounts and challenges.  At the same time,
it lulls political people into a sometimes unjustified faith in
computer-generated vote tallies.

When I served on the county board in Ingham County, Michigan (1983-88), we had
a mixed system.  The choice of voting method was made individually by the 21
townships and cities within the county.  Thanks to strong persuasion by the
county clerk, almost all of the 250 or so voting precincts in the county voted
on punch cards.  The remaining five precincts, in four small jurisdictions,
used voting machines; absentee voters in those five precincts used punch cards.
In no other part of the county were absentee votes counted separately.  Under
contract with most of the punch-card jurisdictions, the county provided the
materials and organized the ballot counting process.

The software which aggregated and reported the votes for the county, and also
automatically generated all of the official statements to be attested to by the
Board of Canvassers, did not allow for the entry of non-computer precincts.
Thus, the county clerk's people had to break into the program and override its
security features in order to input the numbers for the five rogue precincts.
The risks here should be obvious!  Invariably, this task was postponed until
very late at night, when the operators (who normally worked 8am to 5pm) were
extremely tired.  More than once, as I recall, this led to errors in the
overall totals, though none which changed the outcome, and all were corrected
by the following day.

After a few years of this, the county clerk (with full support from the county
board) mounted a major effort to corral the five remaining precincts.  He
succeeded with all but one of them, the City of Leslie.  So, on a smaller
scale, the problem -- and RISK -- continues.

Lawrence Kestenbaum's message gives an interesting first-hand account.
However, there is much debate in the election computing community about the
relative tamperabilities of machine-readable cards (punched or mark-sensed),
lever machines, and direct-entry screen menus.  Punched cards give results that
are more or less repeatable (ignoring the hanging chad problems).  But they are
subject to tampering BEFORE any votes are ever tabulated (removed cards, added
cards, multipunched cards, hidden prepunches, trick punches that unleash Trojan
horses, etc.), which can make the repeatability argument moot.  The RECOUNT
would mask the prior fraud and even add apparent credibility!  The fantasy that
there is a CORRECT anonymous physical record is very tricky to convert into a
reality.  (There are different vulnerabilities in the other types of systems,
such as the presence of perfectly repeatable but hidden and probably
undetectable Trojan horses in the direct-entry systems -- especially in
proprietary systems.  See earlier RISKS...)

I worked on custom military design for almost 7 years recently.
I have two anecdotes to relate regarding recent RISKS discussions:

1) Some colleagues and I endeavored to design the operating systems for the
latest in a series of custom large-control-word multi-processor signal
processors using a purely waterfall model.  We insisted on writing the design
spec before writing any code, and finalizing the design spec (after initial
review) down to the individual bit level.  We then wrote pseudo-code for all
modules, and peer-inspected those.  Finally we wrote the code with strict
commenting standards and assembled it, then peer-inspected that.  Finally we
wrote module tests, simulated those, then string tests, simulated those, and
one day the hardware was off the drawing boards and in the lab.  The results?
The development cycle, with full waterfall design method and full regression
tested test database, was only 2 months over schedule (former efforts on
similar jobs ran up to a year over).  The norm for getting a basic operating
system up and running in a lab environment without bells and whistles was 6-9
months -- it took us a week.  Overall savings in development/debug time --
probably at least 40%.  Overall savings in down-the-road software maintenance
-- untold.  So let me say that I am skeptical at best when someone tells me
that waterfall design should be dumped on large involved custom
software/hardware projects.

2) I had a chance to have a several-hour chat with a Navy commander who headed
the technical management on the Navy end of our several-hundred-million-dollar
project.  He noted that the average time for delivery of a large military
contract now was 8 years and growing, and that the results were far from
satisfactory, particularly in the RISKS area.  He blamed much of this on
government procurement and the rampant cover-your-ass overspec'ing that went
on.  He proposed a system wherein the contractor(s) would study and prototype
for some time, a year for example, then come back and note the 10% of the job
that they felt was overspec and would cause serious money, time, and risk
problems.  Independent government negotiators would then attempt to take these
portions out of the contract if they were indeed overspec, but the contractor
would suffer little or no degradation in the original price quoted for the
contract for their having pointed these overspecs out.  He estimated the
average deliverable time would go down to about 5 years, and the products
delivered would be slightly cheaper and much more reliable.  He also was sure
his ideas would never fly at the Pentagon.  :-(

The New York Times today (12/1/89) features a story by Jeff Gerth that says
that the modernization of a Pentagon computer system used for general data
processing is a billion dollars over budget, and far behind schedule.  And the
congressional report released about this system says that Pentagon computer
systems have experienced "runaway costs and years of schedule delays while
providing little capability."

Charles A. Bowsher, the head of the General Accounting Office, says that
problems with the Pentagon's accounting system may impede efforts to reduce
spending in the Department of Defense because of inaccuracies in the data used
to manage the Department.

Today's New York Times article reports only on cost overruns and delays in
accounting and data-processing systems used by the Department of Defense and
the services.  But there are also these examples one could add to the list:

        *       The C-17 cargo plane being built by Douglas Aircraft
                has a $500 million cost overrun because of problems
                in its avionics software, and the software contractor
                has been fired, according to a member of Congress.

        *       The B-1 bomber still needs more than $1 billion to
                improve its ineffective air defense software.  The
                B-1 was originally sold as a "penetrating bomber,"
                meaning it was supposed to be able to penetrate
                Soviet air defenses.  Because of problems with its
                computer software, however, the B-1 is not expected
                to be able to penetrate Soviet air space, and that's
                why the Air Force is asking for the B-2 (which has
                its own software problems).  (At one point the B-1
                electronic countermeasures software created what 
                was called a "beacon" effect, meaning it would actually
                alert Soviet air defenses and give their radars
                a clearer signal of the aircraft than they would have
                if the airplane's systems had been turned off.)

        *       The software for the modernization of the Satellite
                Tracking Control Facility is about seven years behind
                schedule, about $300 million over budget, and will
                provide less capability than what the original con-
                tract called for.

        *       The modernization of the software at NORAD headquarters
                is about $250 million over budget, years late, and
                still non-operational.  

        *       The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASJP), which 
                is an electronic air defense system installed in over
                2,000 Navy fighters and attack planes, is $1 billion
                over budget, four years behind schedule, and, accord-
                ing to a Navy report, is only "marginally operationally
                effective and marginally operationally suitable."

As General Bernard Randolph, commander of the Air Force Systems Command, said
in February, "We have perfect record on software schedules--we have never made
one yet and we are always making excuses."

The "indent" program (C code formatter) distributed with Berkeley UNIX
has an insidious misfeature/bug in it.  The bug is also present in the
version that comes with SunOS.  The Ultrix folks appear to have written
their own "indent", which does not have the bug.

The problem is that "indent" takes expressions of the form "&lt;ident&gt;=-&lt;expr&gt;"
and silently converts them to "&lt;ident&gt; -= &lt;expr&gt;".  So instead of *assigning*
the negative value on the RHS to the variable on the LHS, the variable
is *decremented* by the RHS value.

I discovered this because an instance of the above expression occurred
in an initialization ("int x=-1;" -&gt; "int x -= 1"), generating a syntax error.
If this had not occurred in an initialization, who knows when the impact of
the change would have reared its ugly head ("Hey!  My F-16 just started
plummeting towards the ground!").

K&amp;R Appendix A.17 ("Anachronisms") notes that the "op=" assignment operators
were once written "=op".  So at some point in the prehistoric past, the above
conversion might have been valid.  Under the standard C syntax, however,
"indent" simply munges your code.

Marshall Williams, a former company cost estimator for Southeastern Color
Lithographers Inc., Athens GA, was convicted on 16 Nov 89 for "using his
company's computer network to destroy billing and accounting data as well as
backup copies of that data".  A key piece of evidence was a computer audit
trail of data-deletion commands that traced deletions to his terminal.  The
defense raised the potential for a frame-up resulting from someone tampering
with the audit trail data.  (No one seems to have suggested that someone else
might have been using his terminal.)

The crime allegedly cost Williams' former employer more than $400,000 in lost
business and downtime.  He faces up to 15 years in prison.  Williams contended
that he "knew nothing about his employer's complicated Xenix operatiung system
and could not have deleted the data."  He plans to appeal.

Leonard DiCicco was once a friend of convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick (see RISKS
9.6 and 9.7).  In July, DiCicco pleaded guily to charges of permitting Mitnick
to gain access to a computer at DiCicco's workplace last December, which was
then used to steal a $1-million DEC security software program.

According to a small notice in the "Los Angeles Times" 30-Nov-89, DiCicco
has now been sentenced to 5 years' probation, plus 750 hours of community
service, part of which will be spent installing a computer system at a
shelter for the homeless.

DESKTOP FORGERY, by David Churbuck, is the cover story in the 27-Nov-89 issue
of "Forbes".  It tells how to scan in a check, alter it, print it, and pass it
(with a few details omitted), and it tries to frighten bankers and others with
the endless possibilities.

Churbuck does note, "To be sure, the desktop computer did not create the crime
of forgery.  All it did was make the tools user-friendly.  Check-passers can
now practice forgery in the privacy of their own homes...."

On the CBS program NightWatch (for vampires and am-hackers) I just watched an
interview with Paul Brodeur who wrote those articles in the New Yorker this
spring on the danger of radiation of electrical fields (high voltage
power-lines, heating blankets, display terminals) and who has just come out
with a new book titled "Currents of Death" which some of you may want to put on
your Xmas reading list also.

I had not realized this before, but this man was also in the forefront of the
battle of getting the public's attention on the Ozone problem (10 years ago)
and the Asbestos problem (20? years ago).  A man worth paying attention to, it
seems.

"The Importance of EMC in the Preparation and Selling of Big Macs," by Fernando
M. Esparza is a fascinating article in the September- October 1989 issue of
"EMC Technology."  (EMC = Electromagnetic Compatibility, the science/art of
getting electronic devices to work properly without interfering with one
another.)
 
Esparza, the author of McDonalds' "Electrical Disturbance Standards," has some
great war-stories to tell about problems cropping up in these highly automated
fast-food environments due to unforeseen interactions among appliances.  One he
described as "the most serious interference incident that McDonalds has ever
experienced" involved toasters and timekeeping.
 
It seems that when McDonalds decided to introduce McMuffin products, they had
to install special toasters.  Soon, many of their employee time-clocks
inexplicably started to gain 2 to 4 hours each day, crediting workers with more
hours than they had actually worked.  After a lot of head-scratching (and
testing), they discovered that the new toasters' voltage control circuits
induced voltage spikes in the powerline during normal operation - sometimes as
many as 120 per second.  This disrupted the clocks on the same power circuit,
since they monitored the alternating current's waveform for the purpose of
time-keeping: the voltage spikes increased the number of "zero-crossings,"
which were used as the metric.
 
"By the time we were able to pin down the problem exactly, there were more than
5,000 toasters installed in the restaurants...  Some restaurants reverted to
manual procedures for payroll timekeeping, but there were a number of employees
who were paid for extra time because of the clock errors.  Although the
managers were understandably upset, none of the crew complained."
 
"Ghosts in the Drive-Thru" was another baffling problem, affecting the POS
(point-of-sale) system of a McDonalds in suburban Los Angeles: "The POS system
is a collection of computerized cash registers that are networked together in a
somewhat sophisticated and proprietary network," Esparza explains.  The problem
was that bogus food orders showed up randomly in the system.  "The restaurant
could distinguish ghost orders from real orders because the quantity of the
items displayed was the same - 11 cokes, 11 fries, 11 hamburgers, etc.  The
items themselves were directly copied from the previous, actual order.  These
orders could not be cancelled but had to be cashiered out of the system,
thereby rendering all product mix and sales information invalid and creating a
potential security/theft problem, in addition to slowing customer service in
the drive-thru."
 
The restaurant's POS system and all of its software was replaced, but the
problem continued.  To make a long story short, this McDonalds happened to be
near a cluster of radio and television transmission towers.  The POS system's
wiring acted as an antenna, capturing the signals, and corrupting some of the
data that flowed thru the wires.
 
One problem described in this article stands out as a potential threat to many
more retailers than just McDonalds: "The Cash Drawers that Opened by
Themselves."  Again making a long story short, Esparza discovered that the
problem began soon after the local police department upgraded their
communications system with higher-power mobile radios.  "Whenever they
responded to a call while in the drive-thru, the cash drawers opened...  An
open cash drawer without a cashier to supervise it is...a large security
liability."
 
Have any RISKS readers heard of police radio transmissions inadvertantly
opening other businesses' cash registers?

PGN's calling for RISKS readers to "play a stronger role in ensuring that our
R&amp;D and our educational offerings are suitably concerned with realistic
stringent requirements" is appreciated [Letter From the Editor, ACM Software
Engineering Notes, vol. 14, no. 6, October 1989, p. 2].  I often use RISKS
examples in class (to demonstrate that the instructor is in touch with the
world).  In fact the current issue of SEN arrived in time to illustrate to a
class the need for stringent requirements and testing. As if to underline the
point, the following appeared on page A3 of the 1 December 1989 Asbury Park
Press:
 
         Computer Error Slashes JUA Surcharges: by Coleen Dee Berry
 
  "Some 18,000 people who get their JUA automobile insurance policies through
  Computer Sciences Corporation may have thought their premiums were
  surprisingly less expensive this year.
 
  "They were right.
 
  "Due to computer error, CSC did not assess bad driver surcharges against
  about 18,000 of their policyholders. CSC is one of the four new computer
  companies hired to handle New Jersey Joint Underwriting Association policies.
 
  "As a result, CSC has had to advance $3.6 million to the JUA to cover the
  delayed payments, and last week began notifying those customers to expect a
  bill for the surcharges.  ...
 
  "The delayed surcharges were due to a glitch in the CSC's computer system
  during April and May, when the company was first taking over the JUA account.
  ...
 
  "The move to computer companies was undertaken because it was thought to be
  cheaper and more efficient, according to state insurance officials."
 
I wonder if this "glitch" is any relation to the fellow who once stole
Christmas? ...

The 3-Dec-89 "Los Angeles Times" carried a story by Paul Houston headlined
COMPUTERIZED VOTE TALLIES HAVE TOO MANY GLITCHES, EXPERTS CHARGE.  The bulk
of the story was a review of criticisms of these systems, pegged to last
month's close gubernatorial election in Virginia.  The article cited Mae
Churchill of Los Angeles-based Election Watch, Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, Roy Saltman (NIST) and Robert Naegele, a San Jose
computer consultant.

The final paragraphs of the article related a miserable demo:

  ... one of Fairfax County's (VA) 600 Shouptronic machines fouled up
  in a demonstration for Los Angeles Times reporter William Trombley
  last May.  "The machines have worked very well," Jane G. Vitray, 
  secretary of the county board of elections, said as she prepared to 
  demonstrate one of the machines to Trombley.
  
  But the machine that prints out the names of candidates and issues --
  the information that appears on the face of each machine -- printed
  everything in Italian.  The ballot plotter also prints in French,
  German, and Spanish, as well as in English.  "We didn't know it did
  that," Vitray said with some annoyance.  "We didn't want that feature."
  
  While an aide was left to deal with the language problem, Vitray and the
  reporter moved on to the voting booth, where bells were chiming and red
  lights were blinking and an inviting green button at the bottom right
  corner of the machine said "vote."
  
  "Don't push that," Vitray warned.  "Once you push that, you can't vote
  for anything else.  You only push that button when you're finished."  In
  a previous election, a number of voters had pushed the green button too
  soon and then "called to tell us we were depriving them of their
  constitutional right," Vitray noted.
   
  After Trombley finished voting, another red light came on to indicate that
  the result had been printed on a tape at the back of the machine.  But 
  when he and Vitray checked the tape, it was empty.
  
  Vitray was exasperated.  "I can't understand it," she said.  "Everything
  worked so well last week, when the Girl Scouts were here."

Some 15 years ago I worked the graveyard shift as a computer operator at a
local service bureau.  On two occasions we audited the city/county punched card
tallies.  Two (or more) members of the election commission brought the cards
along with a tape containing the auditing/tallying software.  The tape was
IPL-ready for any generic IBM 360 to run standalone.  It stacker-selected any
multipunched cards as well as "spurious" punches which should be blank.  Any
cards munged by the reader were recreated and verified by the election
officials.

Of course this does not solve the issue of missing/extra cards, write-ins, and
other issues previously mentioned, but it does show that there was very little
chance of our [the service bureau] tampering with or altering the results.  The
audit was done completely without interaction of the host site's software,
operating system, or any other typical "hacking" paths.

Last night on "Market Place", a nightly half-hour program which is broadcast on
one of the National Public Radio stations here, I heard a story reported by
Joyce Miller about an Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) trial program in San
Diego, California.  ETC is intended to speed cars along crowded highways and
still continue to collect tolls.  The idea apparently involves placing a small
(credit-card sized?) device on the car, which is then electronically sensed by
ETC equipment that then automatically bills the owner's account.  As I
understood the explanation, the driver doesn't need to stop (and maybe doesn't
even have to slow down(?)).  Drivers would pay a fee in exchange for the
convenience, and traditional systems would never be phased out entirely.

Someone spoke saying that the system saves 15 seconds per car over traditional
toll collection systems, which adds up when the roadways are crowded.  There
are 1000 cars in the trial program, which has been ongoing for several months
(?).  One participant was very pleased with the system.

The story included views by critics, who oppose the system because it is
collecting information about drivers' driving habits, which they say could
infringe drivers' privacy.  One speaker said that ETC is particularly dangerous
because the system is a government-controlled one.

I may have misunderstood that part, but it seemed that the critic wouldn't be
as worried if the database of drivers' tolls were in the hands of a private
company.  I assume he was concerned with a greater opportunity for merging
unrelated databases.  (But a private company could misuse such data too,
couldn't it?)

The reporter did not mention what authentication efforts are made.  I don't
know the method of sensing the ETC device (radio? optical? mag stripe?), but I
wonder if there's any method of checking if device belongs to a particular car.
If there is not, the devices might be very tempting to theives.

Anybody know anything more on this?

  [McDonald's toaster voltage controls introduced zero-crossing
  transients, which fouled up clocks that count zero-crossings]

I'm surprised that this hasn't occurred somewhere else.  The same technology
that causes spikes in the toaster power regulator (triac or SCR switching) is
also used in dimmers and other AC power regulators -- some of these available
for home use.  We used triacs in a home-made theater lighting controller some
years ago, and it put some hellacious transients on the line.

For the circuit-phobic, an SCR is a three-terminal semiconductor device that
has two states -- (1) don't conduct and (2) conduct (from positive terminal to
negative terminal) until the current stops flowing on its own.  The SCR is made
to conduct by placing a small voltage on its trigger terminal while there is a
forward voltage across its two main terminals.  (A triac conducts in either
direction, and is what we used, because it cuts the number of parts).  These
devices regulate power very efficiently -- the triacs we used were rated to
conduct up to 40 amps (RMS) with a maximum power dissipation of 40 watts
(regulating "house current", that comes to 4600 watts).

In triac-based AC power controllers, the power is regulated by varying that
amount of time that current flows.  The triac will stop conducting each time
the current passes through zero (120 times a second in this country), so what
is actually controlled is how long to wait after a zero-crossing to turn on the
power.  For full power, you wait not at all; for little power, you wait almost
1/120 second; for 1/2 power you wait 1/240 second.  When the power switches on
(120 times per second), it tends to put a voltage spike on the line -- for
large loads, and/or appropriate amounts of power, we found that it was pretty
easy for the transient spike to cross all the way through zero (which, it
happens, screwed up *our* zero-crossing detectors and made the lights flicker).

An excerpt from an article entitled "Cellular Goes Digital" in the January
1990 issue of Popular Science, which discusses Digital Cellular, a new scheme
using digital encoding and TDMA to allow three calls on one frequency:

    Digital phones could also be used for what Sodha calls locational services.
    "With the time-division multiple-access system, you have the ability to
    measure the time it takes for a signal to go to a vehicle and back.  That
    enables you to measure how far you are from the antenna tower," he says.
    What for?  "You could pinpoint fairly accurately the location of a
    vehicle."  The information could be used for navigation, or even to catch
    car thieves.  "Your insurance might be cheaper if you subscribed to the
    service," Sodha suggests.

While I have no doubt that the information gained by such a system would be
put to good use in combating crime, I do have my doubts as to how responsibly
the government would use such information.

The article also mentions the fact that eavesdropping will be much more
difficult since the transmissions will be digitally encoded and separated into
discrete time slices.  Although transmissions wouldn't be encrypted, special
hardware would be required to listen in.

Is the trade-off worth it?  Not to me.  I'll trade the possibility of someone
listening in on my boring phone conversations over the government possibly
having ongoing information of my whereabouts any day.

According to "The Sunday Correspondent" [a new `quality' weekly] of December
3rd, "Nuclear experts fear that reactors along the northern coast of France
have fundamental design faults that could lead to a disaster which could
devastate large areas of Britain. ...  British experts are also concerned about
the increasing reliance being placed by French nuclear engineers on computers
whose tasks are so complex they can never be checked for safety. ..." (page 1).

The inside story, page 3, concentrates on engineering problems with the French
PWR reactors, but there appear to be also some computer RISKS:

               "Key computer safety scheme error prone

  French nuclear engineers are programming their computers using a language
  which is notorious for allowing dangerous errors to slip in, say British
  experts.

  ... Although computer equipment is now highly reliable, the incredible
  complexity of the software they [sic] run makes it very difficult to
  guarantee their behaviour ...

  Professor John Cullyer, of Warwick University, ... says ...  [the complexity]
  is ``beyond present capabilities''.

  The French nuclear industry's wide use of a computer language called C is
  also criticised by [unnamed -- ANW] British software experts.  They claim
  that it is too easy to write dangerous programs with C, yet difficult to spot
  the mistakes ....

  [A French spokesman said ...] ``Yesterday we had a demonstration
  for visitors and everything worked fine''.

On the whole, I suppose I'm impressed that they use C rather than Fortran,
Cobol, Assembler or BNF.  Andy Walker, Maths Dept., Nott'm Univ., UK.

A story on "All Things Considered" (National Public Radio) this evening
reported that although Congress has recently repealed the catastrophic illness
law, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will be unable to stop collecting
insurance premiums until June 3, 1990.

It seems that the SSA "warned" Congress that unless legislative action was
taken by October 24, they would be unable to enact the changes quickly.

The problem?  

     "Apparently there are 150 different software programs that have 
     to be changed and the computers just are not geared up to do that."

Once again, the computer is at fault.  Interestingly, it is possible for
the SSA to raise the premium in January to $5.30.

By the way, people will eventually get their money back, without interest.

This digest has carried occasional articles about problems with 
the WorldWide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).  A history of the
project since the early 1970's appears in the article, "The Pentagon's 
Botched Mission," by Willie Schatz, DATAMATION, Sept. 1 1989, pps. 22-26.
&gt;From the lead paragraph:

"Seven years after the (WWMCCS modernization) project started, the military
has spent $395.4 million, the users are outraged, the system is unfinished,
responsibility for the project has been transferred, its name has been changed
twice, and no one is entirely sure what will happen now."

Here are excerpts from the article, Malpractice in IS? by J.J. Bloombecker
in DATAMATION, October 15 1989, pp. 85 - 86:

A ruling by a US Court in Missouri ... recognized computer malpractice as 
the basis for holding third-party IS practitioners liable for acquiring
an unworkable computer system for a client ...

In DIVERSIFIED GRAPHICS V. GROVES, the jury held consultants from Ernst &amp;
Whinney (Now Ernst &amp; Young, having merged with Arthur Young and Co.) liable
for shirking the Management Advisory Services Practice Standards of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in their procurement
of a turnkey system for Diversified Graphics.  In February, the US Court of
Appeals of the Eighth Circuit agreed, and it let the jury verdict stand.

"DIVERSIFIED is a significant precedent for [establishing] the proposition
that liability can by incurred by any professional performing the types of 
services that E&amp;W offered to perform," says Peter Sadowsky, a partner in The
Stolar Partnership in St. Louis, which represented Diverisified Graphics.  "It
is equally likely to apply to people doing systems design or programming, 
not just systems acquisition." ...

"Prior to DIVERSIFIED GRAPHICS, most courts refused to extend professional
liability standards to computer specialists.  Now we've got a federal court
of appeals doing just that,"  said J.T. Westermieir, a partner in the Washington
DC office of Fenwick, Davis and West, and a specialist in computer law. 

Futhermore, says Westermeier, an IS manager who lists membership in an
association such as DPMA or ACM on a resume implies that he or she has accepted
the associations professional standards.  Having done that, a computer 
professional should expect his or her work to be judged by those standards. 

Other lawyers who have analyzed the case, however, say it is unclear whether
professional standards for IS managers could be used as a similar basis as
the AICPA standards were in DIVERSIFIED.

John Hennelly, a partner at Bryan, Cave, McPheeters and McRoberts in St. Louis, 
which represented Ernst &amp; Whinney, says the case doesn't necessarily lead
to broader conclusions about the liability of nonaccountants ...

Eric Savage, with the Hackensack, N.J.-based law firm of Michael Goodman,
believes it was easy for the court in DIVERSIFIED to find E&amp;W guilty of
malpractice because of the accounting organization's highly visible
professional standards.  Thus, he says, it would be difficult to apply the
decision to a case that is adjudicating the liability of a computer
professional not employed by an accounting firm. ...
   
(There are two sidebars to the story.  One, labelled A CASE IN POINT, describes
the client's needs, and how the system recommended by the accounting firm
failed to meet the client's needs.  This sidebar quotes the court's finding
that the accounting firm did not have sufficient expertise to recommend a
computer system for this client.  Another sidebar, HOW SOME OF THE STANDARDS
COMPARE, quotes the relevant portions of the AICPA Standards, which essentially
say that members shall only accept jobs which they are qualified to perform,
and shall conscientiously perform the jobs which they have accepted to the
benefit of their client.  This is placed alongside sections from the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Disciplinary Rules which essentially
say the same thing.)

THE STRANGE LUCK OF WALTER JON WILLIAMS

Not too long ago, Tor SF author Walter Jon Williams got a very pleasant
surprise: His science fiction novel HARDWIRED (Tor, 1986) was prominently
featured in a national advertising campaign for Nissan Motors' new
"Infiniti" automobile.

Apparently the Powers that Be decided that some law of good fortune had
been violated.  When Williams returned from the World Science Fiction
Convention in Boston to linger over the pages of his newest Tor hardcover
ANGEL STATION, he got a most un-pleasant shock: Not only was there a rash
of very strange typographical errors on page 9 of the book, but fully
seventeen lines of type were completely missing from page 354.

When Williams called Tor's editorial staff in New York to report the
errors, they immediately checked the press run of the book.  Sure enough,
the defects were present in every copy -- despite the fact that all
previous proof sheets, and the book's bound uncorrected galleys, were free
of the errors.

This isn't "business as usual" for Tor. Although an occasional typo slips
by the proofreading process, and minor errors creep into final copies,
nothing of this sort has ever happened to a Tor book before.

How did it happen? Well, no one knows exactly -- but the evidence points to
some sort of software error in the generation of the final "repro proof"
long after the stages at which books are normally checked and proofread in
house. For example, the typos on page 9 all involve characters that are
exactly five letters off in sequence from the correct characters.

Tor is offering to replace all defective copies of the ANGEL STATION
hardcover with corrected copies from a new printing. To receive a correct
copy, simply remove pages 1 through 6 (three leaves) and send them, along
with your name and address, to Customer Service, St.  Martin's Press, 175
Fifth Avenue, New York NY 10010, Attn: ANGEL STATION Replacement. This
offer is open to individuals and dealers alike, though copies of the
removed pages must be received for each copy the owner wants replaced.

Alternately, collectors who wish to keep their "true first" edition, typos
and all, may write to Tor's own editorial offices at 49 West 24th St, New
York NY 10010 for an errata sheet correcting the errors, which includes the
missing text.

Meanwhile, Tor's editors are leaving nothing to chance where Williams's
work is concerned. They've set up a special Walter Jon Williams Task Force
to make sure the author's next work, a short-story collection called FACETS
scheduled for publication as a hardcover in January 1990, escapes the
strange luck of Walter Jon Williams.

Editor, (212) 741-3100.

Additional news about problems with the 486 chip, noted by Peter Neumann
in RISKS 9.36, appear in a trade newspaper article, "Bug Hampers
486 Shipments" by Elliot M. Kass in COMPUTER DESIGN (News Edition) 28(2), Nov.
13 1989, p. 1: 

Santa Clara, CA --- A Halloween fright spooked systems vendors late last month
when a flaw was discovered in the floating point unit of Intel's 80486 micro-
processor.  The bug, unearthed by Compaq Computer (Houston, TX) during routine
testing, could delay initial shipments of some 486-based systems up to two
months.

Intel played down the seriousness of the design defect, saying it still plans
to ship tens of thousands of the IC's this quarter.  The firm reported that it
had already fabricated a corrected version of the 32-bit microprocessor and 
that the first production quantities should be available by the end of the
month.  In the meantime, Intel has halted production of the flawed unit.

Intel declined to say how many of the defective chips have been shipped.  
Spokespersons insisted that the financial impact on the company would be 
mininal.  The 486 was introduced this past April, and volume shipments began
only recently.  The manufacturers will accept returns from customers already
in possession of the faulty IC's.

NOT THE FIRST BUG

Rumors about the bug had persisted for several weeks, according to industry
observers.  Confined to one small section of the IC unit, the flaws are neither
serious nor unusual considering the complexity of the 1.2 million transistor 
device, most analysts agreed.

Most sources agreed that Intel's time frame for correcting the problem was
realistic.  On average, the redesign will mean one- to two-month ramp-up
delays for 486-based systems, predicted Michael Slater, editor and publisher
of MICROPROCESSOR REPORT (Palo Alto, CA).

Ironically, this is the second time that Compaq has detected a flaw in an Intel
microprocessor.  Four years ago the systems maker discovered a bug in the 486's
predecessor, the 80386.  That problem, which involved the production process,
went undiscovered for 16 months after the unit had gone into full production,
and was very costly for Intel.  This time around, Slater pointed out, the bug
is confined to a small aspect of the chip's design, and was picked up a few 
weeks into production.

Compaq, which came across the problem during beta tests of its newly announced
Deskpro 486/25 personal computer, admitted that it in its present state, the 
486-based PC's weren't ready for market.  The new processors will heavily
target CAD and other technical applications dependent on the 486's floating 
point math processor.  The microprocessor unit's design flaw reportedly
involves the simultaneous execution of tangent and sine or cosine functions,
as well as certain error detection features.  General purpose business programs
that don't make use of the FPU could still run unhindered.

As of press time, Compaq was still uncertain how the shipping schedule for its
new machine would be affected, but said it was confident they would be in 
production quantities by the first quarter of next year.

VENDORS MODERATELY AFFECTED

THe effect of the chip defect on other vendors varied.  IBM (Armonk, NY) the
only vendor that's already begun shipping a 486-based product, suspended 
shipments of its 486/285 Power Platform.  Company spokespersons said they
would instruct customers already in possession of the board to limit its use to
test environments, or to applications that don't involve the affected portions
of the chip.

IBM said it expects to resume shipments of its processor board early next
month.  The company is continuing production of the Power Platform with the
original chips and will replace them once the debugged units are available.
The substitution procedure is relatively simple, the vendor noted, and will 
prevent further slipping of its shipment schedule.  Customers in possession
of the boards will receive an upgrade.

On CBC's Daybreak program this morning, there was an interview about the
possibility of selling information help by government institutions to private
companies. For example, names and addresses of municipal bonholders or property
owners could be used for direct mailing.

Currently, there is a dispute concerning the information held by the Inspector
of Companies on company names, and names and addresses of directors. This
information, although publicly available, is regarded by the Inspector as
confidential. For example, it would be possible to guess a person's political
affiliations from the presence of his name on the board of directors of a
political organization.

There are two issues here, being disputed by the private companies on one side,
and the government and the Quebec Civil Liberties Association on the other:

   1) Prevention of access to confidential data. (A straightforward computer
      problem).

   2) Making data available in a form that allows massive searching and matching.

This raises the privacy issues currently being disputed.

  From New York Times (5 Dec. 1989) business section (excerpts):

	            US West in Budapest phone deal

  US West Inc., one of the nation's seven regional Bell telephone
  companies, said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with Hungary
  to build a mobile cellular telephone system in Budapest.

  The Hungarian cellular system will be the first such telephone network to be
  constructed in Eastern Europe. Because of the shortage of telephones in the
  nation, Hungarians are expected to use cellular telephones for basic home
  service, as well as mobile communications.

  For Hungary and the other Eastern European countries, which have antiquated
  telephone systems, it will be faster and cheaper for the Government to
  deliver telephone service by cellular networks than it would be to rebuild
  the nation's entire telephone infrastructure.
                                                        [one paragraph omitted]

  The system, which is scheduled to go into operation in the first quarter of
  1991, will initially provide cellular communications to Budapest's 2.1
  million residents.  Eventually, the system will serve all of Hungary, which
  has 10.8 million citizens.
                                                      [rest of article omitted]

The article explains that "[the system is] viewed as an alternative until the
country can develop its infrastructure" and goes on to state that "Hungary
currently has 6.8 telephone lines for every 100 people" compared to 48.1 in the
United states.

Hungary's interest in supplanting an antiquated and inadequate phone system is
understandable.  The privacy issues, however, raised by a proposal to make
(presumably unencrypted) cellular telephone service one of the primary
communication channels of the country -- even in transition to a more capable
conventional system -- should be obvious to RISKS readers.

&gt;From "Boy Meets Girl, '89, Can Be a Detective Story" by Dirk Johnson, in
the New York Times, 10-Dec-89, Page 1:

  "Computerizing of public records in recent years has proved a boon to
  investigators, who say they can find out almost anything simply by
  keying a Social Security number into a computer...  `It's usually very
  easy', said Ed Pankau, the president of Inter-Tect [a Houston investigative
  agency], who is the author of `How to Investigate by Computer'."

The context of the article, from the lead paragraph: "Eager to trust but
determined to verify, many single women in this age of risky romance are hiring
private detectives to check the backgrounds of their suitors."  A few
paragraphs later, "Women are far more likely than men to hire an investigator,
and usually their suspicions are on the mark, detectives said."

In this case I'm tempted to call easy access to records (assuming it's legal) a
benefit instead of a risk.  Then again, I got married ten years ago, and my
fiancee's investigation of my background was more traditional, like meeting my
parents and using her "feminine intuition".  And the article ends with a
non-computer-related risk: The woman who is the subject of the article had
three men investigated and found "skeletons in their closets".  The fourth man
she investigated was a-ok, and she was so thrilled that she told him he had
passed the investigation.  He wasn't thrilled to hear that he had been
investigated.  "`He kind of freaked out', she said.  `But then, as I tried to
explain why I did it, he understood, kind of'.  She added, `We're not dating
anymore.'"

Recently I ran across a copy a paper in my files entitled "Are There Senses in
which a Computer may Properly by Held Responsible for its Actions?" by J.P.A.
Race from Brunel Univeristy, UK, in the volume "Information Technology for the
Eighties", ed. R.D. Parslow (Heyden,1981).  I include some extended excerpts
from his article.  Several of the points Race proposes have fascinating RISKS
implications, and I would be quite interested in more recent references on this
subject.  I also have not yet heard of insurance policies for the actions of a
computer.  Do such policies exist?

"...at the moment our natural reaction [to a wrong brought about by the agency
of a computer], to say `It was the computer's fault', will be laughted at.  The
sophisticated will [...] turn immediately to the human being involved, the
programmers, operators, compiler writers, maintenance engineers, sponsors,
consultants, hardware designers...  and try to apportion liability among them."

"Such critics of our `It was the computer's fault' are themselves naive.
We are quite quite correct in our instincts to start by blaming the
computer, for the following reasons:

    "The computer system may be indeed liable, and no one else.  The
    program may have been correctly designed and arranged to adapt
    to circumstances, but on this occasion the adaptation led it
    astray.  The human beings involved acted in good faith to the
    best of their ability, and are not liable.  Yet a blame-worthy
    thing happened.  Therefore the non-human system must be blamed,
    unless we call the happening an Act of God, which we would never
    do if a human being had been involved instead of a computer.

    "The computer system may evade responsibility wholly or in part,
    because of negligence or deliberate action on the part of one
    or all of the human beings involved.  But we have to start
    somewhere, and by calling to account the agent -- the computer --
    which is prima facie responsible, the process of finding a
    culprit fails safe.  We shall see later how the computer may
    be expected to defend itself by inculpating others, and how
    it can make amends if found wholly or partly liable.

Race defines a "computer system" as "one particular combination of hardware,
software, and data, such that its functional behaviour is different from any
other system", the data being particularly important to distinguish between
initial identical twins that have experienced different learning sets for their
expert systems.  He then draws a distinction that a responsible computer is not
at all the same as an "intelligent" computer.  "No, the characteristic of the
computer systems under discussion is not so much intelligence, as the ability
to rationalise, that is, to give an account of their actions, and to construct
courses of action using powerful planning procedures, like Terry Winograd's
SHRDLU..."

"We are talking about responsibility: no need to put [the computer system] to
Turing's test to show a human level of intelligence.  In fact, as pointed out
by Turing's brother, a computer like [this responsible system] will make a poor
showing at writing a sonnet, but that doesn't stop us from treating it as a
responsible agent.  Few submarine captains write good sonnets either, or
clerks, or public corporations, yet all these entities have responsibilities in
law."

"There are three aspects of punishment:

    Retribution: the need for society to get its revenge on the wrong-
    doer: a basically irrational (but quite understandable) emotional
    response.  If this means pushing a computer system over a cliff
    after it has driven someone to suicide through sending them wrong
    electricity bills, we can understand it. [...]

    Rehabilitation: In this sense, the aim of punishment is to improve
    the individual for his own sake and that of society.  In the case
    of a computer, this may involve re-programming or the indication
    to the computer that its previous response had been wrong, so that
    this reprimand is stored as a new parameter value to adjust its
    future behaviour.  The fact that we did not use a cat-o'-nine-tails
    or the brig does not mean what we did was not punishment, any more
    than it is not punishment - of a severe kind - if a court-martial
    reprimands an officer who runs a frigate aground.

    Deterrence:  The fact that [this computer system] is punished should
    be communicated to other computer systems working on similar things.
    [...]

"Lastly in this section we should consider the case where a computer is
involved as a principal in a civil suit: punishment is not involved,
but restitution of damages is.  In the past one would have thought it
bizarre for the mechanical agent to be the actual defendant, yet as was
said at the outset, our big problem with computers is that unlike
hammers, it is very hard for a plaintiff to find any human being to
accept responsibility for their bad behaviour.  So he should be able to
sue them, just as a corporation may be sued, and for much the same
reason.

"PROPOSALS

    Computer systems should be designed to include the ability to give an
    account of the bases of their actions, as `expert systems' do now,
    and, at a more mundane level, commercial systems do with an inbuilt
    `audit trail'.

    Our instinct to `blame the computer' when it makes errors should be
    elevated to a policy.  It should be possible to take civil or criminal
    action against it in circumstances in which a human agent would also
    have been taken to court.

    Based on the system's own account of events, and other evidence,
    responsibility will be assigned and judgement given.

    Where the responsibility is laid at the computer's door, the basis for
    its behaviour (program or data) will be altered.

    To provide for restitution of damages when a system is successfully
    sued in a civil action, it should not be a `man of straw' but would
    hold money reserves or insurance."

An automatic toll system is currently in operation in Southern Norway,
installed by Philips if my memory serves me adequately.  The system is
extremely straightforward in operation.  Regular users of the road simply buy a
playing-card sized reflective disk which is mounted on the nearside rear
window.  As a vehicle approaches the toll point it passes over a sensor (a
loop, I think) which activates a low intensty microwave transmitter.  A beam
from the transmitter strikes the upper nearside of the vehicle and a proportion
of rays are reflected from the disk onto a receiver.  Now as each reflective
disk has the ID of the vehicle owner embossed on it the reflected pattern also
presents the ID and thus beginning and endpoints of a journey on a toll road
can be accurately determined.  Furthermore, if the system receiver fails to
register an ID a video camera is activated which photographs the backend of the
suspect vehicle.  The owner can then be traced through the license plate.  Road
users can be either billed every month directly or may pay a cetain amount in
advance.  Vehicles can pass through the electronic "gate" at up to 70kmh with
detection accuracy of ID remaining up in the early nineties (?)(I am quoting
from memory but I remember being stunned by the figures at the time).  Only
extreme environmental conditions affect the system adversely (micro wave is not
as sensitive to climatic changes as infra-red radiation).  How do I come to
have this knowledge?  Well, we are designing an automated policing system here
which should keep us busy for a few years.

Curtis Jackson writes in <A HREF="/Risks/9.50.html">RISKS-9.50</A>:
&gt;We insisted on writing the design spec before writing any code, and
&gt;finalizing the design spec (after initial review) down to the
&gt;individual bit level.  We then wrote pseudo-code for all modules, and
&gt;peer-inspected those.  Finally we wrote the code with strict commenting
&gt;standards and assembled it, then peer-inspected that.  Finally we wrote
&gt;module tests, simulated those, then string tests, simulated those, and  
&gt;one day the hardware was off the drawing boards and in the lab.  

Note the order in which code and test data were prepared.  (Note also the
two "finally"s.)

This scenario illustrates part of the problem that we have in software
development.

Test data are part of the specification and the acceptance criteria of any
product.  In all other engineering activities they are prepared before, rather
than after the product.  In software, not only are they prepared after the
product, but often as an after thought.  For the most part, they are prepared
by the same person as produced the code.  Thus, the product exits test "when
the programmer can no longer find anymore of his own errors."

Before any one tells me that you cannot prepare the test data until after the
code because you do not know what either will look like until the code is
written, let me say that I have heard that argument before.  My answer (retort)
is that if you started preparing the code before you knew what the product
would look like and exactly how it will behave, then you clearly started too
soon.

Now the contributor quoted clearly thought that he and his colleagues were
proceeding in a rigourous and disciplined manner, in accordance with the very
best of practice.  That their practice could be so far from good engineering
practice is evidence of how far we have to go.

Note that he said nothing about building a prototype.  How would you like to
fly in an airplane built to a new design that did not inlcude a prototype?  (Do
not build a plane without a prototype; do not fly paasengers in the prototype.)

How long will we tolerate this practice and thw quality that results.  Must we
reinvent engineering?  Are we so wrapped up in our own mythology and metaphors
that we cannot learn from other disciplines?

	There is a new newsgroup that I subscribe to called
vmsnet.announce.newusers.  I decided to post a message to it.  That is when
the fun began.  The newsgroup is unmoderated.  After I posted to the newsgroup,
I received a mail message from a site scolding me for posting to a moderated
newsgroup and told me to post directly to the moderator instead.   He is a copy
of the message.

"This newsgroup is moderated, and cannot be posted to directly.
Please mail your article to the moderator for posting."

It then included my original message to make sure I knew what I had done.

	I was going to ignore it until I received 5 more messages from the same
site complaining about the same message.  I started to wonder, do we have a loop
here?  I fired a message off to the postmaster at the offending site to stop the
messages.  A day past and no reply.  The messages kept coming in.  I started to
keep track of how many and how often they were mailed.  They were mailed every
half hour since I first posted the message.  I then looked up the administrators
name in the UUCP maps.  I sent him a message directly to have him stop these
things.  He responded by saying he wasn't sure what was happening and to send
him a sample of the message so he could fix it.  Now we are up to 85 messages.
I finally got a response from him saying he had shut them off.  It seems one
of the sites that he is connected to accepted the message and then tried to hand
it off to his site.  His version of NEWS thinks that any newsgroup that has the
word 'announce' in it IS MODERATED no matter how you have it set up!  The remote
site tried every half hour to hand the message off to his site.  His site would
in turn reject the message and send a nasty gram back to me.  We finally got
all this straightened out after 140+ messages bounced back to me.  I don't think
I will post to that newsgroup in the near future!!!!!

Actually, indent is merely changing the old-style C code (x =- 1) to the new
style. (x -= 1).  Careful programmers always put in whitespace between
assignment and varibles for this reason.  Some compilers will flag
(x=-1) as a warning because it is ambigious.

Careful programmers also always use lots of parens to make their
intentions clear.  such as ((x&lt;3) &amp;&amp; (y&gt;2)).

Of course.  I alluded to the old style / new style conversion (K&amp;R A.17)
in my previous note.

I am a careful programmer.  The whole point is that sometimes I run across code
written by idiots who insist on two-space indentation, no spaces between
elements of comma-seperated lists ("x=foo(9,34,&amp;hoho)"), and writting code like
"int x=-1".  Indent held out the promise of being able to convert that crap
into something readable.  But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams.

Just so you know, the problem with indent swapping "x = -y" to "x -= y"
also works with "x = *y" to "x *= y"

The new Usenetoid newsgroup alt.folklore.computers (a.f.c) has been
having a discussion of the Mariner 1 space probe failure in 1962 due to
a missing "-" (Arthur C. Clarke: "The most expensive hyphen in history."
The vehicle cost $18,500,000.) which was discussed at length in
Risks in November and December 1987.

As was discussed in Risks, a popular but apocryphal version of this story
-- even appearing in computer textbooks -- is that a "." was substituted
for a "," in a FORTRAN DO statement, converting it to an assignment.
But no contemporary evidence was ever cited to support that story.

Now the a.f.c discussion began with exactly that apocryphal story;
someone has posted the old Risks discussion to clean that up.  But this
time one thing is different.  Someone else has posted giving a likely
explanation of the FORTRAN DO version of the story.  Notice, by the
way, that it did not cost even one spacecraft, let alone the billion
dollars claimed in one of the textbooks.

Fred Webb (fwebb@bbm.com) writes in alt.folklore.computers:

   Subject: Fortran story - the real scoop
   Summary: I was there!

   ...
   This kind of thing is a common Fortran bug, so there are probably
   many different stories going around with a similar theme.  Some
   of them are probably true.  I do know of one such instance that
   really did happen, at Nasa.

   I worked at Nasa during the summer of 1963.  The group I was
   working in was doing preliminary work on the Mission Control
   Center computer systems and programs.  My office mate had the
   job of testing out an orbit computation program which had been
   used during the Mercury flights.  Running some test data with
   known answers through it, he was getting answers that were close,
   but not accurate enough.  So, he started looking for numerical
   problems in the algorithm, checking to make sure his tests data
   was really correct, etc.

   After a couple of weeks with no results, he came across a DO state-
   ment, in exactly the form ... indicated above.  After changing the
   . to a , the program results were correct to the desired accuracy.
   Apparently, the program's answers had been "good enough" for
   the sub-orbital Mercury flights, so no one suspected a bug until
   they tried to get greater accuracy, in anticipation of later
   orbital and moon flights.  As far as I know, this particular
   bug was never blamed for any actual failure of a space flight,
   but the other details here seem close enough that I'm sure this
   incident is the source of his version of the story.

In <A HREF="/Risks/9.50.html">RISKS-9.50</A>, lai@east.Berkeley.EDU (Nick Lai) comments that indent
has an insidious bug under BSD and SunOS. He is wrong about the bug
under BSD and SunOS, right about the bug if his compiler is ANSI
compliant, but definitely right in pointing out the risk.

- On Unix systems, pcc derived C compilers will interpret that code
exactly as indent did, generating a warning in the process, so indent's
behaviour would not change the intent of the code. (Like the
compilers, indent should probably warn the user) Therefore, for old
style C, indent's behaviour is NOT wrong. Most old compilers would
have treated that code the way indent did, so indent just made the
code clearer.

- With ANSI C compilers, the =op style syntax is obsolete. This is one
of the QUIET CHANGEs in the proposed ANSI C standard -- see section
3.1.5 (Operators) of the Rationale (my copy is dated Oct 31,1988 -- the
section number may have changed since)

So, if the programmer wrote
        x=+1;

ANSI C compilers would interpret this to mean "assign the
value +1 to x". (GNU C version 1.34 on a Sun3 interprets it this way
*EVEN* with the -traditional flag)

K&amp;R1 C compilers would interpret this to mean "increment x by 1"
pcc derived compilers also complain with something like:
"foo1.c", line 7: warning: old-fashioned assignment operator
"foo1.c", line 9: warning: ambiguous assignment: assignment op taken
I don't know if other K&amp;R1 compilers complain this way.
(Note that Ultrix 3.1 compilers also follow K&amp;R1 and complain)

indent as distributed with BSD and SunOS silently assumes K&amp;R1 C behaviour
and converts it to
        x += 1;

GNU indent version 1.1 assumes ANSI C behaviour and converts it to
        x = +1;
Ultrix 3.1 indent does this too (even though their compiler still
follows K&amp;R1!)

People converting programs from old C to ANSI C should check all code
(using grep or some similar tool) to make sure sequences of the form
"=op" are converted to "= op" or "op=" depending which is meant! (And
make some suggestions on programming style to the person who wrote the
code originally)

Beverly Erlebacher &lt;erlebach@turing.toronto.edu&gt; points out that SunOS4.0
compilers also follow ANSI, and interpret =op as = op, compiling silently if op
is a unary operator. But SunOS4.0 indent works like SunOS3.x/BSD indent and
indents according to the old rules, making it op=. So for SunOS in my previous
note, please read SunOS3.x.

	You think the fun and games with statements like "x=-5;" are bad?
It is MUCH worse than that! Here is how the following line of code mutates
with each successive application of 4.3BSD lint (this happened to me):

Original:	x = .5;
				A typical piece of C code from a scientific
				application.
1st iter:	x =.5;
				Uh... still valid, but NOT an improvement.
2nd iter:	x .= 5;
				Now it's a syntax error!
Converged:	x.= 5;
				At this point it's stable: a good-looking
				valid piece of code has become a bad-looking
				syntax error!

	Fortunately Convex's "lint" has these bugs fixed. It's a very useful
tool, WHEN IT WORKS.

Simson L. Garfinkel in <A HREF="/Risks/9.53.html">RISKS-9.53</A> writes:
&gt;Actually, indent is merely changing the old-style C code (x =- 1) to the new
&gt;style. (x -= 1).  Careful programmers always put in whitespace between
&gt;assignment and varibles for this reason.  Some compilers will flag
&gt;(x=-1) as a warning because it is ambigious.

This case is a typical example of what RISKS is all about: the purpose of
"indent" is to change/add *white space* so the outcome is nicer and more
readable; it has no business "merely changing" the code in a way that might
change its meaning.

Since in old-style C the term (x=-1) was ambiguous, "indent" may issue a
warning or do nothing, but not try to guess which of the possible ways to add
blanks is the correct one, and certainly not rewrite it without indicating in
any way that it did.

Another aspect of RISKS is that in this case "indent" was run on a
program written in new-style C, in which that term had only one meaning
- which is different from the one assumed.  In essence, "indent" was
used to process input written in a language different from the one it
was designed for, but similar enough to confuse an innocent user.

The news about the SSA being unable to reprogram its computers in time
for the catastrophic health care bill repeal comes as no surprise to
anyone who's read "Nations at Risk: the Impact of the Computer
Revolution" by Ed Yourdon (1986, YOURDON Press).

   Indeed, the SSA problems are not unique, and are no reflection on the
   energy, talent or dedication of its staff -- but rather the
   accumulation of old hardware, old software, and a general lack of
   understanding on the part of Congress of the difficulties of dealing
   with massive volumes of data.  For the SSA, massive means 446 billion
   [bytes] of disk storage to service 650,000 inquiries each day.  It
   means 113 tons of computer printouts per month; 380 million wage
   reports per year, and 40 million checks per month.  As former
   commissioner John A. Svahn says, only a "daily miracle" gets the
   monthly checks out on time.  Having worked with the SSA computer
   people, I can personally testify to their enormous energy and
   professionalism, and I firmly believe that the $478 million five-year
   modernization program approved by Congress in 1982 will eventually
   (though not in five years) get the organization back in control.

The demurral about the time needed has unfortunately now been vindicated.

There's more on p. 432:

   o  Calculating the cost-of-living increase for 50 million recipients of
      Social Security benefits takes 20,000 hours of computer time on older
      computer systems within the SSA.  [That's 1.44 seconds per recipient!]
   
   o  When the SSA upgraded its computer systems in 1981 from five-digit chechs
      to six-digit checks, it required 20,000 man-hours of work and 2,500 hours
      of computer time to modify 600 separate computer programs.
   
   o  The morale in the SSA maintenance group was so bad at one point that one
      of the programmers was caught urinating on a disk pack...
   
   Before you laugh too loudly at this, remember that the SSA has one of
   the better MIS organizations in the country.  They deal with
   gargantuan volumes of data, and they work in a political environment
   that defies imagination -- but they get the job done, and they get the
   checks out each month...

True, an incorrect check is lots better than no check at all!

These passages are used to help illustrate one of the book's points, which is
that large information systems all over the U.S. are suffering badly, and that
problems with these systems are a significant factor keeping us from being more
competitive.  He makes a persuasive case; the book is worth reading (though
redundant towards the end).

Re: ... the Inter-Tect investigative agency in Houston promises to
verify ...  appearance in newspaper articles...
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hmmm... Interesting. I wonder if they include a copy of the article?
I've been on the front page of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch twice in my
life (that I know of :-); once was a picture of me playing the oil drum
in the Washington University Motley Marching Band (we were spelling out
"Columbus, Ohio, is a mighty fine town" in script and I was dotting the
"i" [I forget which one]) about 25 years ago. The other was just this
summer, when a letter to the editor I wrote about changing the date of a
street festival prompted the paper to make a survey and they mentioned my
name in the article about the results [my idea lost :-(]. I suppose the
kind of article they are really looking for is "Mr. X was convicted of
drugs and weapons charges in Superior Court today" and not such "light"
coverage, but I would hope they would get positive as well as negative
results in such an investigation.

But what do they do in cases of relatively common names? I know my name shows
up in various unusual contexts -- there was a "William Martin" who worked for
the CIA and defected to the Soviets some years back, and the "Man Who Never
Was" -- a famous masquerade deception designed to fool the Germans regarding
the Normandy invasion -- was named "William Martin".  I'm sure there have been
other "William Martin"s in this city whose names have shown up in newspaper
articles as being involved in various nefarious activities -- how would the
researchers know who was who? I'm guessing the articles have been scanned in
for a computerized text search to make this practical, but then this is just a
string-matching exercise without any other clues (pictures, SSNs, identifying
marks, whatever) to narrow the field. It seems of marginal utility unless the
name is really unusual.

Wonderingly,
Will

   [Don't bet on "William Martin" not being enough to catch you, unless you are
   willing to get caught in a Martingale and can afford to get blown away.

      For the novice, a martingale is a betting scheme -- such as continually
      doubling up if you lose, which probabilistically leads to the so-called
      "Gambler's Ruin" problem.  PGN]

	Several computers in the Earth Science department at Stanford were
brought to their knees Dec 13 by an interesting combination of bugs.  I can
only assume similar numbers of machines around campus in other departments also
succumbed. I don't really know, because our network is dead as a result of it!

	For some reason, the Stanford Chinese Student association mailing list
started bouncing mail infinitely between two Stanford machines, "Macbeth" and
"Portia". At each iteration the 30K of mail was rebroadcast anew to everyone on
the list, including at least one Chinese student on each machine in our
department. This was the first bug. I don't know why it happened. (Anyone know
that story?) This bug alone would have been bad, but not catastrophic...

	The problem was that after each successive bounce the return address
got longer and longer, until monstrosities like the following became
commonplace:

&lt;@Macbeth.Stanford.EDU,@Portia.stanford.edu,@Macbeth.Stanford.EDU,@Portia.stanfo
rd.edu,@Macbeth.Stanford.EDU:xu@spanky.Stanford.EDU&gt;

	Once the reply addresses got up to about the length shown in this
example, they started to overflow a fixed-length buffer in all Berkeley-derived
mails (NO checking for overflow, OF COURSE). This caused the affected mail
processes to go crazy. First of all they sent an error message back to the
sending machine (causing it to send the viral mail _again_ 30 minutes later).
Worse, the mangled mail processes continue to run forever until somebody kills
them. (And it takes kill -9 as superuser to do it.) One such mail process on a
lightly-used Earth Science machine accumulated _9500_ minutes of CPU before
anyone figured out why the machine had been so slow for the preceding week!

	Our first reaction was to scream at the people who run the list, and
they said they fixed the problem, but their fix only resulted in a greater
variety of mail loops being generated; various interesting orbits about portia,
polya, hamlet, macbeth, ...

	Needless to say as the traffic built up the CPUs and then finally the
network itself in the Earth Science department ground to a halt. It became
impossible to even log in to many machines to kill the offending mail
processes. Killing the processes wasn't very effective, either, since that
would not stop Macbeth from immediately starting the whole mess up again. We
finally pulled the plug on sendmail.

	Fortunately this evening Stanford had a power glitch that seems to have
crashed most of the offending machines, so the network is OK again now. :-)

The following is extracted from a brief item, "Prodigy service creates
controversy," on the business page in Wednesday's /Democrat and Chronicle/
(Rochester, NY).  It appears that when you're "where America shops,"
discussions about who America might be make you nervous. . .  Mark

&gt; There are better ways to get publicity, but a fight between homosexuals and
&gt; Christian fundamentalists nevertheless has called attention to the rapid 
&gt; growth of a home computer service owned by IBM and Sears.

&gt; The Prodigy service has expanded to a quarter-million subscribers in 
&gt; 160,000 homes from 30,000 homes a year ago.  It serves 21 of the nation's
&gt; largest markets, up from six a year ago.

[business stuff deleted]

&gt; Prodigy's adverse publicity came this week after it cancelled a chat 
&gt; service named Health Spa, a "bulletin board" that allowed subscribers to 
&gt; post notices or communicate on health-related issues.

&gt; Prodigy said Health Spa was canceled because of low usage, but some 
&gt; subscribers said it was because one section of Health Spa turned into a 
&gt; forum for a heated debate on homosexuality between gays and fundamentalist

There's an amusing but scary skit in the movie, "Amazon Women on the Moon"
regarding a women who checks out her boyfriend.

On a blind date, he arrives at her place.  She asks for his driver's license
and a valid credit card.  She walks over to her desk and runs the credit card
through a magnetic strip reader (like at a store) and gets a printout of all
the other dates he's had and how they turned out...

"Stepping on 29000 Bugs," by Michael Slater

The current stepping of Advanced Micro Devices 32-bit RISC processor, the 29000
revision D, still has three acknowledged bugs.  However, the bugs are all
relatively minor.  They consist of an instruction burst mode problem, an
exception handling priority error, and a data-access exception problem.

Since hardware workarounds have been required for the instruction burst mode
problem since the first silicon, existing designs either already incorporate
the fixes or don't produce the offending set of conditions.  Modifications to
the exception handlers can correct the other two bugs.  These same bugs were
also present in revision CA. The most serious bug from revision C, the failure
of the branch target cache to work reliably, has been fixed.

(Here follow many column-inches describing the problems and workarounds in
more detail.)

AMD has distributed samples of the new revision, and current orders are
expected to be filled with this revision.

AIDS Data Disk Has PC-Damaging Virus, by Michael Specter, The Washington Post

     A mysterious computer diskette about AIDS that was mailed to major
corporations, insurance companies and health professionals across the world
contains a hidden program that has destroyed information in thousands of
personal and corporate computers, police in London said Thursday.

     Officials of Scotland Yard said at least 10,000 copies of an unusual "AIDS
Information Diskette," which promised to help users deduce their risk of
becoming infected with the AIDS virus, were sent to people in England,
Scandinavia, Africa and the United States.

     Hospital systems from London to Stockholm reported damage Thursday and
AIDS researchers at major institutions in the United States, from the National
Institutes of Health to the University of California at San Francisco, issued
alerts to all their computer users.

     "Extremely urgent message for all National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease PC Users," said a flyer sent Thursday to AIDS researchers at
NIH.  "A diskette from PC Cyborg Corp. contains a highly destructive virus.
All systems running these programs had ALL hard disk data DESTROYED."  Neither
that corporation nor Ketema Associates, its parent company, has any known
officers or location, according to people who tried Thursday to find them.

     In Sweden, the State Bacteriological Laboratory sent letters to clinics
and doctors warning them of the diskette.  Chase Manhattan Bank was one of the
first companies to report problems with the diskette, which also was sent to
the London Stock Exchange, British Telecommunications, Lloyds Bank, the Midland
Bank, other major banks and manufacturing companies.

     "We have never seen anything approaching the magnitude of this attack,"
sand John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Assn., though he
noted no damage had yet been reported in the United States.  "It took enormous
preparation, coordination and a huge amount of money."

     People familiar with computer "viruses" and other computer "diseases" were
baffled by the maliciousness of the crime, the amount of money and
sophistication it required and its lack of any immediately discernible motive.

     Computer programs written as pranks or tools of minor sabotage have become
ubiquitous over the past few years.  But this one was different, according to
experts across the country.

     The diskette came in a slick package mailed from offices on London's tony
New Bond Street.  The bright blue cover sheet said the package contained AIDS
information, and informed recipients that the information was easy to use and
would help them calculate the risks of exposure to the disease.

        [This topic seems to be the all-time RISKS record-holder in terms of
        number of submissions.  Most of them were verbatim copies of John
        McAfee's messages, although John himself did not submit them to RISKS.
        I was tied up and could not be one of the early harbingers, so at this
        point I assume almost everyone has heard the story.  But just for the
        record is a summary of it.  Those who have been following the story can
        skip the rest of this issue.  PGN]

Subject:      Major Trojan Warning

This is an urgent forward from John McAfee:

     A distribution diskette from a corporation calling itself PC Cyborg has
been widely distributed to major corporations and PC user groups around the
world and the diskette contains a highly destructive trojan.  The Chase
Manhattan Bank and ICL Computers were the first to report problems with the
software.  All systems that ran the enclosed programs had all data on the hard
disks destroyed.  Hundreds of systems were affected.  Other reports have come
in from user groups, small businesses and individuals with similar problems.
The professionally prepared documentation that comes with the diskette purports
that the software provides a data base of AIDS information.  The flyer heading
reads - "AIDS Information - An Introductory Diskette".  The license agreement
on the back of the same flyer reads:

"In case of breach of license, PC Cyborg Corporation reserves the right to use
program mechanisms to ensure termination of the use of these programs.  These
program mechanisms will adversely affect other program applications on
microcomputers.  You are hereby advised of the most serious consequences of
your failure to abide by the terms of this license agreement."

Further in the license is the sentence: "Warning: Do not use these programs
unless you are prepared to pay for them".

If the software is installed using the included INSTALL program, the first
thing that the program does is print out an invoice for the software.  Then,
whenever the system is re-booted, or powered down and then re-booted from the
hard disk, the system self destructs.

Whoever has perpetrated this monstrosity has gone to a great deal of time, and
more expense, and they have clearly perpetrated the largest single targeting of
destructive code yet reported.  The mailings are professionally done, and the
style of the mailing labels indicate the lists were purchased from professional
mailing organizations.  The estimated costs for printing, diskette, label and
mailing is over $3.00 per package.  The volume of reports imply that many
thousands may have been mailed.  In addition, the British magazine "PC Business
World" has included a copy of the diskette with its most recent publication -
another expensive avenue of distribution.  The only indication of who the
perpetrator(s) may be is the address on the invoice to which they ask that
$378.00 be mailed:

          PC Cyborg Corporation
          P.O. Box 871744
          Panama 7, Panama

Needless to say, a check for a registered PC Cyborg Corporation in Panama
turned up negative.

An additional note of interest in the license section reads: "PC Cyborg
Corporation does not authorize you to distribute or use these programs in the
United States of America.  If you have any doubt about your willingness or
ability to meet the terms of this license agreement or if you are not prepared
to pay all amounts due to PC Cyborg Corporation, then do not use these
programs".

John McAfee

The latest on this is as follows:

If you have run this disk contact ROBERT WALCZY at PC Business World
on 01-831 9252 they have a FREE disk that combats the effects of the
disk and they will send a copy to users effected.

Either call Robert of FAX him on 01-405 2347 with your name and address.

The disk should be available in the next day or two.

The program will be available on CONNECT (01-863 6646) for download as
soon as it has been tested.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The AIDS disk when installed creates a number of hidden files and directories.
You can remove these files by running the program mentioned above or by using
the Norton Utilities, PC Tools or equivalent program.

The files that are hidden include a new AUTOEXEC.BAT and a number of other
files and directories that contain characters that can not be accessed by
standard DOS commands.  You will need to rename the files/directories before
they can be deleted.

This information will be updated as we learn more about the disk.

                   AIDS INFORMATION DISK
                   =====================

Update 2  13-Dec-1989 6pm

IF you have not run this disk DO NOT INSTALL it appears to be a very
cleverly written TROJAN program that can be activated by a number of
methods.  Currently the activation method that has been detected uses
a counter of the number of system reboots.  When the counter gets to
90 the system goes into a second phase and encrypts files and
directories on your hard disk.

The program appears to have a number of embelisments that makes one
think that the front door we have been shown MAY not be the only
method that the system uses for deciding when to activate.  This
is a very nasty program and the only 100% safe thing to do is to
backup all DATA files and perform a full reformat of your hard disk.

Followed by a reinstallation of all DATA, from your backup, and
programs from original system disks (or backup prior to installing
this software).

This should only be attempeted once at least TWO copies of all
valuable data have been extracted from the system.  Please remember to
boot your system off an original DOS disk before starting this
procedure.

Full details of the suggested procedure will be posted tomorrow.

Alan Jay

Readers who do not wish to follow this route may be interested to
in the folowing information about the primary activation system.

1)  A hidden 'ACTOEXEC.BAT' file contains

CD \&lt;ALT255&gt;
REM&lt;ALT255&gt;

    it then runs your AUTOEXEC.BAT which the program renamed AUTO.BAT

2) A hidden subdirectory &lt;ALT255&gt; contains a file REM&lt;ALT255&gt;.EXE

Each time the system is booted the program is run and the counter
incremented/decremented.  After 90 activations the system enters phase
TWO.

Please note that the system uses the &lt;ALT255&gt; character 'hi space' in the
file names to stop standard DOS procedures acting on these files.

IT MAY be possible to delete these entries and thereby disable the
program this is NOT certain and it will take several months to discover
if this is a safe course of events to take.

I hope that this information helps.  I also understand that this is in the
hands of the Fraud Squad / Computer Crime Division of the Metropolitan
Police.  If you have any further information I am sure that they would
be interested to here from you.

Today's Washington Post (12-21) reports on a General Accounting Office study,
"Financial Integrity Act" about Information Technology applications within the
government.  The overall message is that information systems technology is
costly and risky.  Here are some quotes:
 
"Federal agencies operate over 53,000 unclassified automated systems...life
cycle costs in the billions of dollars..."  The article reports costs of $17
billion for fiscal 89 versus $9 billion in fiscal 82 for these computer
applications.
 
"Invariably these systems do not work as planned, have cost overruns in the
millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars, and are not developed on
time.  Congressional interest..has increased..."
 
Some specific examples are cited.
 
"...defense [business as well as command and control] far exceeded their
original costs estimates...fell significantly short of expectations...design
flaws, misjudgments in requirements, poor program management."
 
The article describes a Navy financial system whose costs grew from $33 million
to $479 over nine years of development.  Also, an IRS system is estimated to
cost $1 billion, and has not shown benefits from currently operational
components.
 
Except for specific details, all of this is old news to many of us who have
been involved in large systems of various kinds for a while.  What does seem to
be new are trends toward larger fiascoes and for increased government concern a
by people who control purse strings.  Also, do stories of such failures
indicate that we reach an intellectual brisk wall when we try to develop large
systems?  Or, are we simply repeating dumb mistakes?

Excerpted from the S.F.Chronicle, 19 Dec 1989:

  The California Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for the use of
  standardized psychological tests in criminal trials to prove that a defendant
  does not fit the personality type likely to have committed the charged crime.
  In a 5-2 ruling, the court rejected a comparison that likened personality
  tests to lie detectors or voiceprints, which are excluded from tials because
  their reliability is not commonly accepted by the scientific community.  The
  court majority said introduction of standardized psychological tests in
  trials is not a revolutionary development and the tests reliability can be
  challenged by prosecutors.

  "We see no reason to subject (these tests) to the special restrictions
  governing admission of new, novel or experimental scientific techniques not
  previously accepted by the courts," wrote Justice David Eagleson for the
  majority.

  Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas dissented, saying the decision opened the way
  for new "mini-trials" focusing not on a defendant's guilt or innocence but on
  his personality profile and whether it conforms to "the profile displayed by
  the average child molester, robber, arsonist, or whomever."  He acknowledged
  that personality tests have been admitted by some courts to ahow a
  defendant's mental state at the time of the crime.  But that is "far
  different than using them to exclude defendant from the relevant class of
  defenders in much the same manner as a blood test or voice print," Lucas
  wrote.

  With the vote, the court reversed the child molestation convictions of a
  Kern County couple found guilty of committing lewd acts with four young boys
  in 1983 and 1984.  During the trial of Margie Grafton and Timothy Palomo,
  they attempted to call as an expert witness a psychologist who had given them
  two commonly used tests -- the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
  and the Millon Clinical Mutiaxial Inventory.  The psychologist, Roger
  Mitchell of Bakersfield, was prepared to testify on the basis of the test
  results and his interviews with Grafton and Palomo that they showed no
  indications of deviance and were unlikely to be involved with the charged
  crimes.

  Out of the presence of the jury, Mitchell told the trial court judge that
  the 566-question Minnesota test, copyrighted in 1943, had a reliability
  rating of over 70% [sic!!!] in diagnosing the illness of some patients and
  included hidden questions that detected lies by the person taking the exam.

  Many experts believed that the test makes it impossible [sic!!!] to conceal
  an abnormal personality profile, Mitchell told the judge.

  But the trial judge ruled that Mitchell could not testify because the
  defense had failed to prove the tests met the legal standard of general
  acceptance in the scientific community.

  The court yesterday overturned that ruling, saying the judge should have
  allowed Mitchell to testify.  The majority also found that if his testimony
  had been allowed, it may have changed the outcome of the case.

What has this to do with comp.risks?  The tests at issue are all wholly
computerized.  Moreover, as if common sense were not enough, it is well
established (the tests were statistically debunked in the 1960s) that the
maximum accuracy of diagnosis, in most unrealistically favorable circumstances,
is of the order of 20% -- hardly an improvement over a guess.  Besides, the
test is readily foolable, so much so that it is generally regarded as per se
invalid the second time it's taken by the same person.  Moreover, the
"reliablity" pertains only to the crudest mental types of disability
(schitzophrenia, paranoia, and five other yes/no nasties), whereas the computer
tests are generally preprogrammed to spew out pages of rambling mumbo-jumbo
analogous to daily horoscopes, execept that long psychiatric words are used.
Such print-outs more often than not contradict themselves in details.

I was once compelled to take such a test, by a California judge.  The examiner,
who actually gave classes in psychology to high-power groups of attorneys and
judges, without blush permitted me to answer difficult questions by tossing a
coin, because I said that was my "natural response" to the test.  Still, the
computer nevertheless reported that the test was "valid."  On one page it
reported that a compelling aversion to publicity, on another that I avidly
desired publicity.  One amusing diagnosis was the computer's finding that I
lacked a sense of humor!

I think this is worth the long posting, because these computerized tests are

A few weeks ago there appeared an article in RISKS that reported on a computer
software firm that had been successfully sued for "software malpractice".  I
didn't keep the article, so my details are sketchy.  As I recall, the judge
found that a programmer was culpable since he did not abide by ACM standards
for software, and since he was an ACM member he should have adhered to those
standards.

   This has been nagging at me for days.  I've been an ACM member for some
eight years and I've never even SEEN these standards.  Furthermore, I do not
necessarily endorse ACM standards just because they are from ACM.  The industry
certainly hasn't embraced all ACM standards (or any one else's for that
matter).

   Even if one DOES endorse the standards, one wouldn't necessarily use them in
all cases.  For example, when writing experimental or demonstration software,
formal development methods are often not used.  The efficacy of the "quick and
dirty" approach not withstanding, there are time when this is done UNDER THE
DIRECTION of management AND the customer.

   It boggles the mind to consider the possibility that one could be sued for
"software malpractice" without there being a formal definition of it or a legal
standard.  Breach of contract might have been a reasonable finding, but
this????  I've heard it said in many arenas that the legal system in this
country is out of control.  This seems to be yet another example of a system
out of kilter.  Will this lead to a situation where no one dares to sell
software to another party?  Will programmers seek to defend themselves from
their employers for fear of software quality violations?  Stay tuned...

	The Brooklyn Public Library has recently put in a computerized card
catalog system.  The branch nearest me (the main branch, as it turns out) has
about 4 terminals in the main lobby, which also contains the card files (in GOK
how many thousands of drawers).  It hasn't taken people long to become totally
dependent on the computerized system.  Typically there are lines with 2-4
people waiting at each terminal (probably a 5-20 minute wait) and not a single
soul using the card files.  Unless there happens to be a terminal free (very
rare) I just do it the old fashioned way.  I can look up 3 or 4 books in much
less time than it would take me to wait for a turn at the terminal.  I wonder
how long the average person will wait to use the "new fast computerized
catalog" before resorting to the "old slow way", even if the old way is faster.

The Bellevue, Washington, Journal American ran an article on
telephone glitches collected from its readers.

   o "... a dark stormy night, a desperate woman, a telephone from Kafka".
     Using a pay phone at a service station along the highway, she
     dialed 0 then the number and the phone went dead. She tried again
     and again. She finally reached an operator and found out that (a)
     the phone was owned by a private company (not AT&amp;T), (b) collect
     calls could not be made, and (c) she could not be connected with
     an AT&amp;T operator.

   o Another woman received hourly calls with the recorded message
     "The maximum dollar amount is exceeded by the number 4-4-4-4-4-4."
     The problem was traced to a pay phone at a local gas station with
     a full coin box. The phone was programmed to call someone when the
     coin box was full. Unfortunately, it was programmed with the wrong
     number.

   o For six months a woman had long distance calls to Mexico City
     on her bill. The phone company finally discovered that the woman's
     line was cross wired with a neighbor's line. The twist in the
     story was that the neighbor had recently moved into the house and
     did not realize it had TWO lines (the phone company had failed to
     disconnect the second line when the previous owner moved out).
     The neighbor's bill looked normal since most of his calls were on
     his primary line. Only when he used a secondary phone were the
     calls billed elsewhere.

   o One family had phones that rang three times then stopped. 
     Friends said they called and let the phone ring 20 times
     and no one answered. "After extensive investigation [GTE]
     found an electronic glitch at a nearby central office."

The article concluded: "the letters we received showed that people are
dependent on the telephone and, when things go wrong, hardly in a mood
to hear a pitch about the values of consumerism. True phones don't go
wrong often, they said, But when they do ..."

In the recent Electronic Design News (a trade newspaper), the cover story is
about Fujitsu's recent claims of 200,000 hrs MTBF on some of its hard drives.
That is nearly 23 years of 24-hour continous use.  Needless to say, this number
is not obtained from units in the field, but extrapolated from their test data.
Other manufacturers consider that number to be marketing strategy, although
some have large (but not that large) numbers, too.  If its any consolation, the
article said that the drives had a 5 year warantee...

I could not help but be reminded of the 10^-9 claims of some software producers...

I worked with WWMCCS in 1985/6 and many of their problems stemmed from a 
technology bet that they had made 3-4 years earlier.  They had a software
first philosophy that stressed using as much commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
software as possible.  They bet that by 1986, respondents to the RFP would 
be able to bid COTS 1) multi-level secure operating systems and 2) 
distributed heterogeneous DBMSs.  It is 1989 and there are still precious few
(if any) examples of either.  When it became obvious that neither was going
to appear by 1985/6 when they were scheduled publish the RFP, they were not
prepared and the program began scrambling to find stop gaps.  It was
downhill from there.

In the last few days I have learned the risks of posting to comp.risks!

1) No, Convex's "lint" does not edit files, I meant "indent"! Oops.
(Re: Fun and Games with Indent, <A HREF="/Risks/9.54.html">RISKS-9.54</A>)

2) I also learned the dangers of using questionable terms like "yellow peril".
I thought these days that "yellow peril" was so outdated that it carried about
the same force as "Redcoats". Evidently I was wrong. If I upset anybody, I'm
sorry. You can stop educating me as to the correct current popular definition
now! Hopefully in a few decades or so my usage will become correct.

In RISKS Digest 9.56, Roy Smith talks about delays waiting for computerized
card catalogs (and that it was sometimes faster to use the old-fashioned
approach).

I find that one of the best advantages of electronic self-service is that
it usually provides FASTER service than waiting for a human operator;
A good example is bank ATM's.  (I can usually park my car, go inside the
bank, transact my business, and be back in the car and on my way before
the FIRST car in the drive-thru line has left).

Usually, the speed-up advantage for these cases is offset by a loss in
convienience.  Two examples:

(1) Most Service Merchandise catalog showrooms in the area have one or more
"Silent Sam" self-service ordering stations.   These are (basically) dumb
terminals which can collect your name and address, take orders, and will even
tell you if a particular item is out of stock or that only the "display" item
remains.  (Amazingly, the inventory counts seem to be reasonably
accurate!).  However, the station does not print a reciept; the receipt
gives you, at least, the "guaranteed" time that your order will be filled
by.  Without the reciept, you have no idea how long you'll be waiting, and
if the order is delayed or forgotten, you have nothing with which to claim
the "reward" usually offered for these cases.

(2) Burger King is experimenting with a self-service ordering system called
"Touch and Go": an ATM-like device with the complete Burger King menu on a
large touchpad display.  Posters and a nearby video player encourage
customers to "avoid long lines" and use the "simple" Touch-and-Go system.
The machine takes your order, takes your money, and gives you a change and
your receipt; you then proceed to the "Touch and Go" area at the counter to
pick up the food.  (It even takes/gives pennies!!)

When I first tried this at the Acton store, I was impressed at the smarts
(if you order a "breakfast" item at dinnertime, for example, a voice and
CRT display both tell you that "this restaurant is not serving breakfast
at this time").  Then I tried to order a double cheeseburger with "ketchup
only"; and found it impossible.  I mentioned this to one of the employees
while placing my MANUAL order, and was told that the software was going to
be upgraded shortly to allow special orders.  The machine was the only one
of its kind and was being market-tested in the Acton, MA store.

A few weeks go by, and sure enough, an extra option is added to let you
customize individual items.  So I order the double cheeseburger again,
and press the "Have It Your Way" button.  New options appear on the
CRT:  "Adjust Ketchup" and "Adjust Pickle".  Both are set to "normal", so
I touch "Adjust Pickle" and set "Pickle" to "None".  Great, an
electronically-ordered "ketchup only" double cheeseburger at last!

What do I actually get?  A double cheeseburger with ketchup and mustard.
Seems that mustard is normal on a double cheeseburger, and Touch-and-Go
offers no way to turn it off.   I bring the burger up to the counter where
they acknowledge this, and replace the cheeseburger for free.  "I'm glad
you brought it back," the salesperson tells me.  "This has been happening a
lot.  The machine goes on the road next week; we'll be glad to be rid of
it."

This somewhat cryptic paragraph is from "Romanians Talk of Life Then and Now"
by Russell W. Baker, in the Christian Science Monitor, December 27th, 1989:

	Dragos Vaida, an associate professor of mathematics at the University
	of Bucharest, told how he had published a book on computer science,
	but was obligated to change the title because it referred to
	programming languages.  Elena Ceausescu, who was in charge of
	technology, was against computer science, he said, because it gave the
	people technical knowledge that could be used against the dictatorship.

What I'm curious about is what the new unoffensive title could have been.  If
Elena was upset about computer science in general, why wasn't the book simply
banned?  Or was she upset that people might learn about "programming
languages", which to her might sound like mind control?  Strange story.

The last paragraph suggests the RISKS were the same 700 years ago.

[From The Times (London) Saturday, December 23, 1989 by Simon Tait,
Arts Correspondent]

A seal, which would have been the equivalent of cheque card, passport
and credit card rolled into one for the person who lost it more than
700 years ago, has been found by archaeologists working in Oxford.

Mr. David Dawson, of the Oxfordshire County Museum, Woodstock, where the seal
will go on display, said: "This was a personal seal which would have been
carried round everywhere by the owner.  He would have been lost without it, and
it is a rare thing to find because it would normally have been destroyed on his
death."

What makes the small, corroded and fragile 13th-century seal unique is that it
was found in premises known, through records in the Bodleian Library, to belong
to the seal's owner.

It bears the legend `S' ROGERUM COMENORE CLICI, indicating that the seal
(sigillum) belonged to Roger of Cumnor, clerk or priest, who worker as a
lawyer.  The site is on the corner of Hollybush Row in Oxford, on which Halls
Brewery stood most recently, which is being developed by Grosvenor Square
Property Developers.

Roger who gave two buildings on it to Oseney Abbey in 1265, during the reign of
Henry III, according to the Bodleian Library.  The seal was found in a ditch
between the two buildings.

Mr. Brian Durham, a member of the Oxford Archaeological Unit which made the
discovery during excavations last week, said: "The new find could be a forgery
but the more likely explanation is that it is his early seal, which he lost
when he was actually living in the house.  You can picture him hunting
unsuccessfully for it."

"Since he worked, in effect, as a solicitor, he would have had to alert
everyone to the fact that the seal could have been stolen and used for
forgeries.  Then he would have had to have a different seal made."

Commercial email to fax gateways are beginning to hit the market.  I've been
faxing email for people for many months, and one problem which recurs is people
supplying me with incorrect fax numbers.  I usually try a voice call first, to
ensure that the destination phone number is indeed answered by a fax machine.
Occasionally it is not, and I am forced to confuse the innocent person who
answers.  Often, the person can supply me with the correct fax number.

This problem is compounded with fully automated computerfax systems.  Some
computerfax hardware is able to detect voice on the line, and hence "do the
right thing": don't call again, and return an error.  Some computerfax systems
do not properly detect voice, and they might redial the phone number N times
before returning an error.

One solution might be to use computerfax hardware that has the capability to
play digitized voice and ask the recipient to press touch tones to indicate his
annoyance level!  Most computerfax hardware does not have this capability,
unfortunately.

A risk is that blue network meanies would purposely ask for a fax to be
delivered to a non-fax number, in order to cause an "annoyance".  Annoyance
calls are illegal.  I wonder whether the computerfax machine owner is liable
for such calls, or whether the sender is responsible?  (comp.dcom.telecom cats
can probably answer this question.)

We've seen the uproar in Washington about junk faxes...  Computerfax opens the
door for an email user to cause junk fax, intentionally or unintentionally.

I just happened to be rereading the above cited paper (CACM, 22 11, Nov 1979,
pp. 594-7), and stumbled upon Bob Morris' tale about discovering the password
file spewing out instead of the message of the day file on each new login,
because two people were editing the two files in the same directory and the
editor used the same temporary file names for both of them (MIT's CTSS, early
1960s).  Yes, it really happened.  But since this case is often cited as a
piece of apocrypha, I thought it might be worth mentioning here, particularly
for the younger folks for whom 1979 (not to mention the early 1960s) is
prehistory.

   [That is the paper that describes preencryptive attacks on the encrypted
   password file.]

The following appeared in yesterday's (1/2/90) Wall Street Journal in a
summary of some of the more absurd events of the past year.  The sad part
of it is that too many people might take the story as literal truth...while
others ignore questions of security as unnecessary makework.

  WHAT REALLY HAPPENED OCT. 13:

  Arthur Cashin, a Paine Webber trader at the New York Stock Exchange, writes
  a daily market letter with a touch of the wacky.

  The Monday after the Friday-the-13th plunge, when traders were still
  wondering if the market would crash again, Mr. Cashin explained what really
  happened Friday:

  "At about 2:25 (EDT) a nine-year-old named Lance, sitting hunched over
  his Nintendo machine in Hohokus, N. J., opened the wrong door in a game
  of "Mario Brothers."  Once the door was open the computer virus escaped
  and immediately began calling in sell orders to the New York Stock Exchange's
  DOT system.  The virus was programmed to enter the orders in alphabetical
  order based on industry, so it began with airlines and ended with the
  zoysia grass distributers (which were least affected by the sell-off)."

  "Is that what happened?  Well, no!  But that is what you will probably hear 
  from a variety of academics and self-appointed experts as regulators
  review Friday's events."

During the Fall 1989 semester, I taught a computer security class at a 
local college.  Most of the students were junior or senior CS majors.

One of the questions on the final exam was "Describe one advantage that
passwords have over biometric devices (e.g., retinal scanners, fingerprint
readers) as an authentication mechanism."

I was expecting answers along the lines of 'passwords are more acceptable
to users in most cases than sticking their eyes up to a slot', since I had
spent a lot of time covering Saltzer and Schroeder's eight design principles,
one of which is 'psychological acceptability' of mechanisms to users.  (Other
acceptable answers existed - e.g., with biometrics, one must deal with both
false positives and false negatives - there's a chance the real person will
be rejected.)

One student's answer:  "Passwords have the advantage that it's easier to let
my friend use my account.  If the system uses biometric devices for user
authentication, I have to be there when he logs in, to get him on to the 
system.  But, if the system uses passwords, I can just tell him my password,
and don't have to be there - he can login at his leisure."

So much for that one-week unit on 'Individual Accountability'.

In RISKS 9.55 it was reported that a local radio news broadcast said that RAND
had been hit with the AIDS virus [sic].  This is not correct.  We have not seen
the "AIDS Information Disk" here.  There was a flurry of activity from the
press when AP reported that we had warned our researchers to be on the lookout
for the Disk in their incoming mail (true).  I talked to several TV stations,
passing on the information that it's not infectious (i.e. isn't a virus), and
that it underlines the fact that everybody should make frequent backups and be
careful what they stick into their computers.

The Pennsylvania Wild Card Lotto computer systems had to be reprogrammed to
accommodate the end of the decade.  That had already supposedly been
accomplished -- but apparently not carefully enough.  In the first Lotto of
the new decade, the computer systems were unable to determine the winners and
further software fixes were required.  [Philadephia Inquirer, 4 Jan 1990,

Most of the arguments about safety critical hardware and software that I've
seen assume that digital computers pose new problems.  In effect, the
argument is that safety critical digital control systems are a radical
novelty (to borrow from Dijkstra's essay on the Cruelty of Teaching Computer
Programming), and thus that they cannot be discussed by analogy to older
solutions to the same problem.

One historical parallel which may prove interesting in this context is the
railroad interlocking machine.  Interlocking machines were purely mechanical
digital computing machines that served to enforce a set of operating rules on
railroad signalmen operating the switch-tracks and signals at a railroad
interchange.

I suspect that there are useful parallels between the history of railroad
interlocking machines and the more recent developments in safety critical
digital control systems.  An error in the logical design of an interlocking
machine could easily go undetected until it caused a train wreck, and I
wonder if old cases involving railroad interlocking machines might provide
useful precidents for many of the software liability questions that have been
raised recently.

Here's a short description of the problem solved by a relatively
simple interlocking machine:

   Consider the following track layout:

                       3-&gt;     TOWER                  8-&gt;
       ----------2-------------------------------7-----------
           &lt;-1    \                      &lt;-5    /
                   \   4-&gt;                     /
                     ------------------------- 
                                         &lt;-6

       1, 5 and 6 are signals controlling traffic from the left.
       3, 4 and 8 are signals controlling traffic from the right.
       2 and 7 are switch tracks.
       All signals may be up (go) or down (stop).
       All switch tracks may be set to direct traffic up to the
         straight through track or down to the siding.

       The control levers for all of the signals and the switch
         tracks are located in the tower, where the signalman may
         work them one at a time.  (One at a time because it takes
         his full strength to overcome the friction of the system
         of cranks and push-rods that connects each lever to the
         corresponding switch-track or signal.)

   The problem:  There are 8 levers in a row, each with 2 settings;
     thus, there are 256 possible states of the system.  (I've seen
     photos of old railroad control towers with banks of 20 or more
     control levers.)  Of these 256 states, only a few are safe.

       Example:  If switch 2 is set up, switch 7 is set down, and
         signals 1, 4, 5, and 8 are up, a train entering the
         diagram from either side will procede through the diagram
         and derail as it passes through the incorrectly sew switch
         at the opposite side of the diagram.

   The classic solution:  A mechanical interlocking machine is added
     to the tower.  A tower containing an interlocking machine was
     a sufficient improvement over an un-interlocked control tower
     that the term interlocking tower came to be applied to such a
     tower.  An interlocking machine consists of a set of 8 transverse
     rods crossing 8 rods linked to the control levers.  Each transverse
     rod is linked to one of the control rods and at each point where
     a transverse rod and a control rod cross, the transverse rod may
     be notched to allow the control rod to move or un-notched to lock
     the setting of the control rod.

       In the above example, signals 1, 3 and 4 would be interlocked
         with switch track 2 such that the setting of 2 could only be
         changed if 1, 3 and 4 were in the down position, and so that
         3 could only be raised to the up position if switch 2 was
         set up, and 4 could only be raised to the up position if
         switch 2 was set down.  A similar set of interlocking rules
         would apply to 5, 6, 7 and 8.

     The "program" for the interlocking machine can be viewed as the
     pattern of notches in the transverse rods.

Modern solutions to the interlocking problem use electrically operated
switches and signals with relays and more recently computerized controls to
interlock their operation.  Long before such modern solutions came into use,
interlocking machines were built into the control towers along most mainline
trackage in North America.  The interlocking machines for simple passing
sidings such as I've described above could be standardized, but there were
(and are) many places where the track layout controlled by an interlocking
tower was unique and required what we would now call custom programming.

Incidentally, in addition to the possible relevance of the history of
interlocking towers to modern problems in safety-critical computing systems,
lots of good assignments can be derived from this problem.  For example,
given a set of interlocking rules, derive a finite-state machine describing
the legal states transitions.  Alternately, write a program that, when given
the current state and a (partial?) specification of a desired state, produces
a plan for a series of legal transitions that will reach the desired state.

In the wake of sky-rocketing mortgage rates in Australia comes this
story from the "Sydney Morning Herald", Friday January 5th, 1990:

``Sorry, the bank's already debited your mortgage

  As many as 100,000 Commonwealth Bank customers found their accounts
  prematurely depleted yesterday when a computer debited home loan
  payments due for any day in January rather than just Wednesday.

  The Commonwealth's general manager, retail, Mr Peter Andrews, said
  staff became aware of the mistake when some customers found cheque or
  Keycard accounts debited ahead of time.

  Mr Andrews said a computer sweep on Tuesday night would normally have
  debited customers who had elected to pay their home loans automatically
  on Wednesday.

  The error affected up to 100,000 home loan holders throughout Australia,
  but Mr Andrews said most customers would not have become aware of it.
  They would have noticed "only if they were taking money out and found
  their accounts were overdrawn," he said.  Emergency arrangements had
  been set up to give them access to cash.''

The following is taken from "The Sydney Morning Herald" Mon 8th January:

``Positive identification

  It might not have caught the killer, but at least it has identified
  the victim.  A fingerprint checking computer immediately revealed to
  Seattle police the identity of a body found along a busy road in
  Portland.  A manual fingerprint comparison, using the police
  department's hundreds of thousands of fingerprint files, would have
  taken months, according to police.  The computer's _positive
  identification_ [ emphasis mine ] took just a few seconds.''

Peter's note recalling the colossal time-sharing mishap of the interchange of
the message-of-the-day with the password file which occurred on CTSS in the
early 1960's made me go look up the article and see what was said about the
cause.  The article says "due to a software design error, the temporary editor
files of the two users were interchanged..." but it was deeper than that.

To simplify the organization of the initial CTSS system, a design decision had
been made to have each user at a terminal associated with his own directory of
files.  Moreover the system itself was organized as a kind of quasi user with
its own directory which included a large number of supporting applications and
files including the message-of-the day and the password file.  So far, so good.
Normally a single system programmer could login to the system directory and
make any necessary changes.  But the number of system programmers had grown to
about a dozen in number, and, further, the system by then was being operated
almost continuously so that the need to do live maintenance of the system files
became essential.  Not surprisingly, the system programmers saw the
one-user-to-a-directory restriction as a big bottleneck for them.  They
thereupon proceeded to cajole me into letting the system directory be an
exception "since system programmer's would be careful to not make mistakes."

But of course a mistake was made.  Overlooked was that a software design
decision had been made in the standard system text editor that it would only be
used by one user at a time working in one directory so that a temporary file
could have the same name for all instantiations of the editor.  And with two
system programmers editing at the same time in the system directory, the
disaster of the swapped temporary files finally occurred.

The tale has at least two morals: First, design bugs are often subtle and occur
by evolution with early assumptions being forgotten as new features or uses are
added to systems; Second, even system programmers make mistakes so that prudent
system management must be based on expecting errors and not on perfection.

In a recent RISKS, Al Arsenault records his distress at an answer he received
on a test he gave in a course on computer security.  A student stated that one
advantage of passwords over biometric authentication was that he could give his
password to a friend so that the friend could use his account.  Mr. Arsenault
comments, "So much for that one-week unit on 'Individual Accountability'".

I'm afraid he is missing an important point.  The fact of the matter is, people
lend things to friends.  They lend clothes, they lend cars, they lend money.
They let people use their telephones.  They even lend things like ID cards when
they can get away with it.  Those in charge of things like security cards don't
like this, and they try hard to prevent it, resulting in a continuous battle
with people who just want to continue to live their lives.

At times, it's easy to forget that most people share neither the world view
nor the interests of the "security community".  Yes, they are aware that they
should not let "anyone" know their bank card password - but when, for example,
they are sick in bed they consider it a useful thing that they can give the
card and password to a friend and have him get some money and do a bit of
shopping for them.  This, too, is a positive good.

I'm sure Mr. Arsenault covered the standard set of distinctions among
identification schemes - something you KNOW, something you HAVE, something you
ARE.  Each has its own features, which in different contexts may be good or
bad.  Something you KNOW can be replicated to others; something you HAVE can be
lent; something you ARE can't be transfered.  These are neither advantages nor
disadvantages; they are simply inherent features.

Consider an analogy: Why is letting someone use your computer account
inherently different from letting someone use your telephone?  Would you never
be willing to tell a trusted friend your telephone access code?
           							-- Jerry

   [Yes, some people are concerned about computer security and others are not
   -- at least not until they've been burned.  But Reality and Sensibility
  are in this case two radically different things.  If you want individual
  accountability, you do not share passwords.  The telephone system is
  intrinsically vulnerable to illicit use of credit cards.  If you wish to
  trust a friend, that may have low risk -- unless MANY people are involved;
  then you might like to have records that show who is actually using your
  resources.  However, suppose you are designing a computer system that
  recognizes fingerprints as authenticators.  It would be rather silly to
  design the system to recognize facsimile copies of a fingerprint so that
  someone else could conveniently enter the system when provided with a
  fingercopy (which can itself be repeatedly copied).  (Ignore the fact that 
  the previous person's fingerprint may be liftable from the glass!)  Much more
  sensible is to design the computer system so that it encourages individual
  accountability, while also permitting flexible controlled sharing.  That is
  what Multics was all about in 1965.  What's new?  PGN]

             6th Chaos Communication Congress 1989 
               'Open frontiers: CoComed together'

The 6th annual congress of Hamburg's Chaos Computer Club (CCC) was held on
27-29 December 1989 in Hamburg. The recent political development in Germany
also influences the hacker scene; only after a controversial debate, the
organisers denied a suggestion to move the congress to East Berlin. Among the
about 300 visitors, about 50 people from East Germany were present.  A few
foreign visitors came from France, Netherlands and USA. The congress was
male-dominated, with a growing female participation (about 40). The other major
German hacker groups (from Bavaria, Cologne) were not present.

Following trends of the 5th CCC congress, themes relating to computer security
were less dominant. As CCC members and congress organisers age and their
professional background dominates (a significant part works in computing), the
political impact of computerisation becomes dominant, not only under a revised
West/East German scenario. Even the presentation of comp.security changes:
invited speakers with solid scientific background lecture in traditional style,
some even with overhead folios from international conferences; even a state
attorney (responsible for the case FRG vs.S. Wernery re hacking!) participated
in a surprisingly fair and open discussion on criminal law against hacking.

Major themes were:
      - information about computerisation and network infrastructure
        in East Germany 
      - cooperation with East German computer freaks
      - cooperation with eco-groups
      - 'female computer handling'
      - KGB-hacker 'Hagbard'
      - Security in open networks (2 invited speakers)
      - Hacker Ethics and Harper's Hacker Conference (Capt.Crunch)
      - Free Flow of Information, Copyright
      - UNIX discussions: several workshops, UUCP
      - Virus Forum II.

Several sessions were devoted to the state and possible developments of
computers + communication (c+c) in East Germany. With insufficient computers
and an outmoded telephone net, CCC appealed to the German public to donate
unused equipment (C64, Apple II, PCs) to eastern groups. As substitute of the
insufficient telephone net, the recently installed 'packet radio' should be
used for computer communication; pc-communication with packer-radio was
demonstrated at the exhibition. As a start of computerisation, CCC plans to
hold another congress (Kaos Kommunikation Kongress) in East Berlin early in
1990.

Representatives of the East German citizen movement, esp.from 'New Forum'
discussed possible developments. Many participants (most oriented towards the
left wing of the political spectrum) adviced the East Germans not willingly to
follow West German c+c industry and public authorities (Telekom) to install
traditional technology; as an example, ISDN is widely critized because it
neglects data protection laws.

Following discussions on CCC congress 88, several projects of ecological data
processing and communication started (e.g. data collection in the environment
of industry and nuclear power plants). CCC and some eco-groups plan to install
an information center on a ship during the EEC's North Sea conference (March
1990). A special session and workshop was also devoted to female
computer-handling; a goup of male (30) and female (20) participants discussed
the role and attitudes of women in education and profession; similar
discussions in national and international conferences (e.g. IFIP TC-9) may
point to revised design principles (e.g. reduced complexity, possble
plausibility control).

Only a minor part of the congress was devoted to traditional hacker themes.
Surprisingly, CCC did not follow it's tradition to extensively discuss hacker
experiences of the last year. The KGB hack (broadly published in March, 1989)
was *no theme*; instead, a session was devoted to the memory of Karl Koch alias
'Captain Hagbard', one of Cliff Stoll's 'Wily Hackers' (CACM 5/1988) who, after
having informed the public authorities as one of 2 chief witnesses in the case,
committed suicide. 3 personal friends (without any interest in computing) and
PENGO (the other chief witness) described Hagbard's sad life story, full of
family problems and addictions (drug, hacking). The role of the media as well
as CCC's role (part of which had strongly denied any contact to the crackers)
was controversially discussed.

Btw: the trial against 3 KGB hackers will begin on January 11,1990. 

A whole 4 hour session was devoted to 'Security in open networks', with Dr.
Raubold (director in GMD, the national research institute for computers and
communication) and Dr. Pfitzmann (Karlsruhe, Faculty for Informatics)
introducing into technologies of encryption (DES, RSA) and of secure
communication in open networks; the 20 participants which stayed until the end
were mainly students of Informatics and programmers.

'Captain Crunch' reported about the recent electronic conference which was
sponsered by Harper's; the results will be published in this magazine early in
1990 (survey document in English available on request). He moreover
demonstrated, via AT+T operator swithced connection, PicturePhone.

Virus Forum II (1989) was intended to show the developments since Forum I
(1985) where CCC made viruses publicly known in FRG. Ralf Burger (author of a
Virus Book, where he published also virus code including a MVS/370 virus), Wau
Holland (CCC's founding father), Juergen Wieckmann (editor of Chaos Computer
Book) and K.Brunnstein discussed trends of viruses.  Meanwhile, more than 80
viruses are known on INTEL 80xxx-systems, and more than 70 on several
68.000-systems as AMIGA, Atari and MacIntosh. Viruses are found to grow from
'families', the descendants of which are ever more difficult to analyse and
produce growing damages.

While the participants agreed in the threat assessment, there was significant
disagreement about the consequences. Burger argued that everybody can program a
virus; publication of virus code does not contribute to the virus threat.
Brunnstein argued strongly against, that many young programmers learn to
program viruses mainly from published code which they change slightly to
produce their own virus; even if they program a virus for learning purposes,
they loose control when it spreads via the friends' diskettes. Virus
publication as part of virus distribution presents severe threats to data
processing in economy, public services and private life.  IFIP General Assembly
therefore passed a motion that every member society should appeal to its
national legislative bodies to classify virus publication and distribution as a
crime (the author will send the text of the IFIP resolution on request:
VIRUSBAN.DOC: 56 lines, 3 kBytes).

Another controversy raised when Burger told the audience: 'My antivirus finds
every virus'; unfortunately, he didnot accept a bet from the audience to prove
his promise. Burger also said, that he needs only one hour to detect and
eliminate any anomaly; this differed significantly from the 250 hours which
according to Brunnstein are needed to analyse and classify a complex virus and
to produce the proper antivirus.

Some participants from the audience differentiated between good use of viruses
and bad use. It could be Good Use of viruses against inacceptable activities,
such as nuclear weapons or state activities such as census.  Following such
ideas, Wau Holland said that the existence of viruses gives a chance to analyse
whether they are 'socially acceptable'.
 
The `electronic newspaper', which reports the major discussions of CCC'89, was
significantly more professionally organised than last year; it was produced by
the team of CHALISTI, CCC's newly (1989) founded electronic newspaper, as
edition no.4. Due to the minor foreign participation, most documents are
German, with only two documents are written in English (Capt.Crunch's report on
the Harper Hacker Conference, and the IFIP General Assembly's resolution on
legal activities against viruses). There may be an English translation of the
CCC newspaper in some time (?early February); I will send a short notice to PGN
when this is available.  People interested in the German version (1794 Lines,97
kBytes) or the English documents (135Li nes,8 kBytes) can reqzuest it from the
author.
      
Conclusion: CCC and its constituency is on the *way to professionalism*.  On
this way, CCC may loose control and even contact to real hacker groups, which
they previoulsy hold in cases such as Btx and NASA hack; in the KGB case, CCC
evidently had neither information nor control of the crackers.  On the other
hand, CCC's propagation of UNIX enlarges the threats inherent in UUCP and the
UNIXes.

After more than 30 years of accumulated evidence to the contrary, the U.S.
Defense Department apparently still believes that so-called command-control-
communications (C3) systems should be designed and built from the top down as
fully integrated systems.  While that approach may have some validity in the
design of weapon systems, it simply doesn't work for systems intended to gather
information, aid analysis, and disseminate decisions.  The top-down approach
has wasted billions of dollars so far, with more to come, apparently.

I noticed the citation in RISKS 9.52 of the article, "The Pentagon's Botched
Mission," in DATAMATION, Sept. 1 1989, which describes the latest development
failures in the World Wide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).  The
cited article indicates that they are still following the same misguided "total
system" approach that helped me to decide to leave that project in 1965.  I
confess that it took me awhile to figure out just how misguided that approach
is -- I helped design military computer systems for 11 years before deciding to
do something else with my life.

In RISKS 9.56, Dave Davis and Tom Reid observe that current C3 development
projects seem to be sinking deeper into the mire of nonperformance even as the
plans for these systems become more grandiose and unrealistic.

Please understand that I am not arguing against top-down analysis of
organizational goals and functions.  It is clearly essential to know which are
the important responsibilities of an organization in order to properly
prioritize efforts.  Based on my experience, attempts at aiding analysis and
decision-making tasks with computer applications should begin with the lowest
levels and proceed upward IN THE CASES THAT WORK.  Contrary to some widely held
beliefs, many such tasks do not lend themselves to computer assistance and the
sooner one weeds out the mistakes and intractable tasks the faster one can
improve the areas that do lend themselves to automation and integration.

A great deal of time, effort, and money can be save by approaching development
in an evolutionary bottom-up way.  It is essential to shake-down, test, and
improve lower level functions before trying to integrate at a higher level.
Trying to do it all at once leads to gross instability that takes so long to
resolve that the requirements change long before the initial version of the
system is "finished."  Each time one moves up a level it is usually necessary
to redesign and modify some or all of the system.  It is much faster to do that
a number of times than it is to try to build a "total system" the first time
because that approach almost never works.

Someone (Karl von Clausewitz?) once said that people who don't know history are
condemned to repeat it.  A modern corollary is that people who do know history
will choose to repeat it as long as it is profitable.  Unfortunately, the
Defense Department's procurement policies often reward technical incompetence
and charlatanism.  I will support this claim with a few "peace stories" that
would have been much more atrocious "war stories" if any of the systems that we
designed had been involved in a real war.  Fortunately, that didn't happen.

The presumption that computer-communication system development should be done
on a grand scale from the outset is just one of many bad ideas that have taken
root within the military-industrial establishment.  The reason that this
misconception has persisted for decades is that there is no penalty associated
with failure.  On the contrary, failures are often very profitable to the
contractors -- the bigger, the better.  The bureaucrats who initiate these
fiascos usually move on before the project fails, so if anyone tries to point
fingers they can say that it was the fault of the subsequent management.

While the "total system" approach is one of the more persistent causes of
failure in C3 development, it is by no means the only misconception afloat.  In
subsequent segments I will review some other causes of historical fiascos.  All
of this will be ancient history, since I got out of this field about 25 years
ago.  Of course, many of the more recent fiascos are protected from public
scrutiny anyway by the cloak of national security.

(Next segment: a SAGE beginning.)

Yellow Cab in San Francisco is using a dash-mounted computer in each taxicab to
facilitate dispatching and supposedly to prevent dispatchers from favoring
particular drivers.  However, the system ($800,000) ``remains plagued by
breakdowns and by drivers grumbling that foul-ups mean a loss in income.''
"When the system is on line, it works well," said Leon Collett, first vice
president of the cab firm.  "But we have had transmitter problems, hardware
problems, software problems."  ...  [Computer Snarling Yellow Cabs in S.F.,

There's no horror story to go with this, we wised up in time...

Recently, we aquired two Sun SparcStation-1s.  We only bought 1 100Mb
drive for each from Sun and we're (still) waiting on shipment of our CDC
drive.  To save space, I only installed the basics: /, /usr, development
tools, and a couple of other goodies.  I did *not* install the man pages,
as they took up around 6Mb of badly needed space.

Then I had an idea:  Mount /usr/man from our DECstation 3100 as /usr/man
on the sparc-1s.  It worked, and I sent mail to all accounts saying that
the man pages were from Ultrix/BSD, and probably shouldn't be trusted
in critical apps; they were just there for ease of remembering things like
which ls(1) flag does what.

The next day there's mail telling me I've screwed up.  There *are*
man pages for the sun, and I've mounted DEC3100:/usr/man pages over
them.  I typed "man ar", and sure enough, there were man pages with


Sun Release 4.0         Last change: RISC                       &lt;pagenum&gt;


at the bottom of each page...  I was astounded.  Luckily, the ar commands my
prof needed must have been the same, as no data was lost, and everything
worked.  I dismounted all nfs, and looked at /usr/man -- nothing was there.
"man ar" returned an error about not finding the man pages.

A little experimentation shows that the SunOS 4.0.3-4c man command
inserts the above line in the formatted man pages.

I think it's presuming a little too much to go ahead and cite the
source/version of a manual page from within the formatting program...

	for this particular CDROM to come online, during which time the
	Macintosh is busied out, thus the inexplicable delay....

	Part of the blame for this confusion can be laid squarely on
	Apple.  Their own Human Interface Guidelines specify that the
	pointer should be replaced with a watch for a "lengthy
	operation" (Inside Macintosh p.I-37). They often follow their
	own guidelines, but not in this case.

This is probably one of those cases in which an implementation in one
part of a complex system (the CD-ROM drivers) invalidated a simplifying
assumption which had been made in another part of the system (the Finder).

During normal operations, it takes very little time for the Mac operating
system to process a "disk mount" event.  The current application (the Finder,
in this case) calls MountVol(), which reads in the volume information
and adds the necessary entry to the drive queue.  The delay is usually
less than a second, and so the Finder's author didn't consider it a
"lengthy" operation which required putting up the stopwatch-cursor.
There are a couple of circumstances in which this assumption turns out
to be invalid, though.  One of them is when the volume being mounted
is a CD-ROM which adheres to the ISO 9660 standard.

The Mac operating system keeps track of the number of files available
on each volume, and the Finder can display the counter.  However, ISO
9660 CD-ROMs don't store this value in their headers.  So, when you
mount a new CD-ROM, the Mac's "Foreign File" code quite politely
calculates the file-count, by stepping through the disk's directory!
As you've noticed, this can take a loooooong time!

Unfortunately, there's no practical way for the Finder to tell that
it's about to mount an ISO 9660 CD-ROM until _after_ it has done so.
&gt;From the Finder's point of view, the MountVol() call is an atomic
operation... one which takes a long time to return, it's true, but
one which is not divisible into a look-first/do-it-now couplet.  Hence,
the Finder can't tell that it should [have] put up a stopwatch, until
it's too late!

Fortunately, this issue will probably be moot when the new version of
the ISO 9660 Foreign File code is released by Apple. I've heard that
Apple has eliminated the scan-the-directory-and-count-the-files process;
it's too much work to do, for a small bit of information which is rarely
used or useful.

Presumably, the new driver-code will be available through Apple dealers at no
cost.  It would be adding insult to injury for Apple to tell users that they'd
have charge this Fur'in File code on their Apple Fee Line.

A large computer manufacturer (which my friend prefers remain anonymous) laid
off 7% of its employees just before Labor Day.  

My friend, who works there, and who I will refer to as 'Pat', was told he/she
was not in the group to be terminated.  However, when Pat called Saturday to
get phone mail, Pat found his/her phone mail box no longer existed.  Pat also
could not log on to the company computer system. Needless to say, Pat was
worried over the weekend. When Pat went to the plant on Tuesday, the magnetic
badge would not open the computer-controlled door.

After some investigation, it turned out that a data entry operator had made
some errors in entering employee numbers, and indeed Pat along with a few
others in the same boat were still supposed to be employed.

It took 36 hours before all of Pat's computer-controlled privileges could be
restored, (apparently, there was no procedure for correcting errors of this
sort).  Finally, some weeks later, Pat found that all of Pat's accrued vacation
days had been reset to zero!

Here's a short article on the risks of having an 800 number.

The 1/12/90 San Diego edition of the Los Angeles Times had the following
article (first, a little background, Joan Kroc is having trouble finding a
buyer for the San Diego Padres):

     It started with a joking headline on Times sports editor Dave Distel's
column on Thursday: "Have a Credit Card Ready and Call Now! 1-800-BUY-PADRES."
Richard Cole, co-owner of Emslee Products of Cleveland, Ohio, is not laughing.
His company sells sanitary napkins.  Its number is 1-800-BUY-PADS.  "Our phone
has been ringing all day," Cole said. "My secretary can't get any work done,
I'm losing orders, I'm paying 12 cents per minute for every call, what in hell
are you people doing out there?"  [...]

  It's the careless attitude that a computer password is no different than a
house key that literally opens businesses and government to fraud and espionage.
  The difference between loaning someone your house key and you passwordd is
simple.  You own your house (or the bank does :) ), but your password and the
resources that it protects are not yours, or yours to lend.
  In addition, one loaned password can affect many people, even an
organization, if abused - or misused, for that matter.
  Lending and trust are key concepts in a democratic society, and
important in social interaction.  Yet in the electronic society that we
live in, where a single password can affect people's lives, prudence
and adherence to good security policies are just as important.

Well, it was a very strange week for me to be off-line, not to be able to
report timely commentaries on the AT&amp;T long-distance breakdown, several
glitches aboard the shuttle Columbia, the Internet Worm trial of Robert T.
Morris, and the San Jose CA indictment of three young computer people.  On the
other hand, most everything was well covered in the media, which had a
field-week (= 5 field-days?).

The exact cause of the 15 Jan 90 AT&amp;T slowdown is apparently still not known,
although the result involved the propagation of bogus status information
describing the partial outage of one network node, due to a software flaw.
Apparently this information propagated to other nodes, and was amplified in
turn by each of them (because of the same program flaw?), creating the
`illusion' of a major outage.  It should be noted that AT&amp;T's service record up
until that time had been exceptionally good, reflecting a fundamental concern
for very high system availability.  This outage immediately brought to mind (1)
the article by Eric Rosen (Vulnerabilities of Network Control Protocols, ACM
Software Engineering Notes, vol 6, no 1, January 1981) on the October 1980
four-hour collapse of the Arpanet, as a result of accidentally propagated bogus
status messages that could not be garbage collected, and (2) the possibility of
intentional insertion of a malicious effect.  The latter possibility has been
discounted by AT&amp;T, but I observe somewhat tangentially that if an effect
(e.g., a fault mode or vulnerability) can be triggered accidentally, in many
cases it could alternatively have been caused intentionally.  This was indeed
the case in the Arpanet collapse, which was completely accidental.

The shuttle glitches included the spurious sounding of various alarms as well
as the sudden rolling over of the spacecraft, among others.

The Morris trial awaits the final summations, the jury's decision, and the
verdict, probably Monday or Tuesday.

The San Jose indictment involves three people accused varyingly of certain
malicious computer-related and/or telephone-related security violations.  This
case will presumably drag on for a long time.

In each of these cases, RISKS will look forward to some definitive,
nonspeculative reports, i.e., first-hand analyses by people involved, rather
than just press clippings.  The article by Eric Rosen on the Arpanet outage,
noted above, and the article by Jack R. Garman, on the first shuttle
synchronization problem, The Bug Heard 'Round the World, Software Engineering
Notes, vol 6 no 5, October 1981, are superb examples of what I have in mind.
Those of you who haven't seen those articles really should.  They are
absolutely required reading for all RISKS folks.

Our sendmail time-out multiple-copy problem may or may not still exist (I
believe all known fixes and some other hopeful improvements have been
installed).  However, several of you suffered multiple copies of <A HREF="/Risks/9.59.html">RISKS-9.59</A>,
apparently because of a gateway glitch caused by someone's overflowing mailbox.
(I continue to further subpartitioned the mailing list, in an attempt to
isolate or minimize the problem, but even with small sublists it seems to
continue sporadically.)  I apologize for the frustration that results from
multiple copies.  My own frustration is most considerable when I cannot do
anything about the problem.  

Above all, the difficulties of getting concurrent processing programs flaw-free
is illustrated by almost all of the above-mentioned cases, the AT&amp;T slowdown,
the Internet Worm, the first shuttle synchronization problem, and the Arpanet
collapse.  PGN

The assertion by AT&amp;T, "in an effort to allay customer fears about the networks
reliability," that the outage was "traced to a single computer program," not
only fails to reassure me, but alarms me greatly.  It suggests a serious
failure on their part to understand the nature of the problem.

While the proximate cause of this problem was an error in the design or
implementation of a single program, the actual cause is a system that is unable
to isolate failing components, and indeed that specifically designed to
propagate the failures in such a way as to cause the failure of the entire
system.

This is the second event in as many years to demonstrate the failure of the new
telephone system to cope with the challenges that confront it.  If, on the day
before the Hinsdale fire, you had asked me if the failure of a single central
office could cause the loss of all long distance service to 350,000
subscribers, I would have said "No, we do not build telephone systems that way.
You might lose access to one carrier, but you would retain access to the
others."  Never would I have imagined that Illinois Bell, only partially in
response to the equal access requirements, would centralize all access to all
carriers in a single unattended central office.

Likewise, if on Sunday, you had asked me if a change, error, or manipulation of
a single program in a single switch could bring down the entire AT&amp;T network, I
would have been happy to reassure you that such could not happen.  AT&amp;T has
been the leader in teaching the rest of the world how to avoid such failures.
While an authorized programmer, or even a hacker, might be able to affect a
single switch, the system is specifically designed to prevent the effect from
propagating.  Little did know; little would I have believed.

If AT&amp;T management actually believes its press releases, if they are not simply
propaganda designed to comfort the sheep, then it truly bodes ill for our world
economy.  Of course, part of the difficulty with such propaganda is that you
might yourself forget that that was what it was.  In a large organization like
AT&amp;T, it is likely that at least some of your employees will be taken in.

I recognize that there are limits to our ability to identify and isolate
failing components, that at some point further attempts to do so become
self-defeating.  If AT&amp;T were claiming that this event was, similar to the
second great Northeastern blackout, caused by, or even in spite of, such
measures, I would be less alarmed.  What concerns me is the pretense that such
a failure is so anomalous that special precautions or design considerations are
not indicated.

Did you have trouble completing long-distance calls yesterday?  Maybe you 
should sue AT&amp;T for malpractice.  Consider the following Congressional 
testimony (on the topic of SDI software) from Solomon J. Buchsbaum, Executive 
Vice President, Customer Systems, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, December 3, 1985:

  Some critics have specifically questioned if it is possible to generate 
  great quantities of {\it error-free} software for the system, and to ensure 
  that it is, indeed, {\it error-free software.}

  This is the wrong question. ... Software is always part of a larger system 
  that includes hardware, communications, data, procedures, and people.

  The right question, as well as the key issue, is the broader one of whether 
  the total BM/C3 system can be designed to be robust and resilient in a 
  changing and error-prone environment.  The key, then, is not whether the 
  software contains errors, but how the whole system compensates for such 
  errors as well as for possible subsystem failures. ...

  Can such a large, robust, and resilient system be designed--and not only 
  designed, but built, tested, deployed, operated and further evolved and 
  improved?  I believe the answer is yes.  I seem confident of this answer 
  because most if not all of the essential attributes of the BM/C3 system 
  have, I believe, been demonstrated in comparable terrestrial systems.

  The system most applicable to the issues at hand is the U.S. Public 
  Telecommunications Network. ...

  There are three keys to achieving high reliability, availability, 
  maintainability, and adaptability.

  The first is the use of distributed architectures both for the entire 
  network and for major systems within the network.  The approach 
  compartmentalizes crucial functions in modules throughout the country ...
  
  The second key is the use of redundancy, again both in the entire network 
  and in the component systems.  And the third key is the coupling together, 
  the integration, of all the component systems by means of well-specified, 
  well-controlled interfaces.

  The network as a whole is much more reliable than its individual 
  components.  That's because the network is designed to be fault tolerant.  
  It continuously and automatically checks its own condition.  When a problem 
  is detected, it isolates the faulty component, so that the network can 
  continue to function using a substitute or redundant component.

  For high availability, the public telecommunications network is designed 
  to work at its specified level of performance even when some of its 
  component elements are unavailable. ...

  ... This approach not only reduces software complexity.  It also permits 
  the fullest use of software as a strength, enhancing network flexibility 
  and resiliency.

Perhaps Dr. Buchsbaum envisioned an SDI that might for a significant fraction 
of a day tell over half the incoming ICBMs "We can't handle you right now, 
please keep trying"?

Perhaps Dr. Teller thinks that the problem would go away if we just gave 
everyone a Brilliant Telephone?

Last night my car had a dead battery (I left the lights on -- something that a
very simple piece of digital circuitry could have prevented, but I digress), so
I called AAA road service.  I noted that they had installed a new digital
routing system for phone calls. "If you are cancelling a service call press
1,if this is an inquiry about an existing service call, Press 2, if this is a
new service call, Press 3."  All well and good, except that when I finally
reached a real operator, she informed me that the towtruck would arrive "within
90 minutes."  In less than the proposed hour and a half I managed to beg jumper
cables off of an innocent passerby and get the car strarted, so I decided to
call AAA and cancel the service call.

I dialed, pressed 1 as instructed, and waited.  The reader should realize that
my car was illegally parked (this is Boston), running (I wasn't going to get
stuck with a dead battery again!), and had the keys in the ignition.  I was not
patient.  I waited about four minutes, then tried again.  Same result.  I was
now out of dimes, but I noticed that the AAA machine began its message with "we
will accept your collect call..." so I decided to call collect.

Surprise!  I discovered that New England Telephone had just installed _its_
digital system for collect calls.  It is quite sophisticated, using some kind
of voice recognition circuit.  The caller dials the usual 0-(phone number), and
then is asked "If you wish to make a collect call, press 1...If you wish to..."
Then the recording asks "please say your name."  The intended recipient of the
collect call then gets a call that begins "Will you accept a collect call from
&lt;recording of caller stating his name&gt;"

I knew what was coming, but I didn't want to miss this experience.  I gave my
name as something like "Russell, Goddammit!," and NETs machine began asking
AAAs machine if it would accept a collect call (which it had already, plain to
the human ear, said it _would_ accept) from "Russell Goddammitt!".  Ms. NET
(why are these always female voices?) kept telling Ms. AAA "I'm sorry, I don't
understand you, please answer yes or no," but Ms. AAA went blithely on with her
shpiel, instructing Ms. NET which buttons to push.

I stood at the phone (car still running...machines nattering away at each
other) wondering who could do this episode justice.  Kafka?  Orwell?  Groucho?
I was sure that one machine or the other would eventually give up and turned
things over to a human being, but, I finally decided to dial a human operator,
and subject the poor woman to a stream of abuse.  She connected me to AAA,
where I punched 3 (rather than the appropriate but obviously malfunctioning 1),
and subjected yet another underpaid clerk to my wrath.

&lt;Toronto Globe and Mail (Dec. 16, 1989)&gt;

In the wake of a chaotic election last year, the first Canadian city to use
sophisticated electronic-voting machines is going back to counting votes the
old-fashioned way.  By a 13-3 vote, Toronto politicians decided yesterday to
sell more than $1.6-million worth of optical scanning machines bought for the
November, 1988, municipal election. That race was marred by a recount brought
about by the discovery that 1,408 ballots had been improperly handled by the
machines.

More than a year later, the election is still not over. On Monday, a
court-ordered recount is to be held in the Wards 3 and 4 separate school
trustee race. [In Ontario, separate == Roman Catholic.]  The council's decision
flew in the face of a task force proposal, put forward before Council
yesterday, to double the number of electronic voting machines, to 500 from 250,
in time for the next election. It would have cost an additional $1.6-million.

Not only are the machines more efficient, they are more accurate and provide
quicker results at the end of the day, said Martin Silva, who headed an
elections task force set up last year.  "There's nothing wrong with the
machines," Mr. Silva said in an interview.  He attributed the election problems
to the previous council's decision to buy only half the number of machines
needed.

Toronto was the first Canadian city to use the optical scanning machines, in
a by-election before the 1988 election, said an official in the city clerk's
department. It is also the first to get rid of them, he said.
Other cities using the same machines include North York and Vancouver. A
similar system is also used in Scarborough and Etobicoke, said Robert Clark,
director of legislative services in the Toronto clerk's department.

A few comments:

&gt;From my experiences in working for candidates in many elections (municipal,
provincial, and federal), I would say that it's not just optical scanning
machines that get confused by ballots. Manual counting depends on the quality
of the people doing the counting. Given that poll clerks and Deputy Returning
Officers (the people who actually count the votes on election day) are patronage
appointments (in Canada), I'm not too hopeful.

And there are the confused rules: Here in Ottawa, we had endless recounts in
one city ward election (first one candidate was declared the winner,
then the other). It finally had to be settled by a new election (won
convincingly by one candidate, thank heavens), after the last recount declared
a tie. And what was one of the big issues in the recounts: whether a
"happy face" beside a candidate was a vote for that candidate!

The following appeared in the BUSINESS BRIEFING section of the 22 January 1990
issue of INSIGHT magazine:

          "Supermarket shoppers would be wise to keep a watchful
     eye as their purchases are passed over the checkout scanning 
     systems used in most stores, says the New York State Department
     of Agriculture. The agency reported last month that inspections
     of 33 stores with electronic checkout showed that all but one 
     overcharged their customers.

          'It is in the shoppers' best interest to check that the 
     prices they are being charged are those that are being advertised,'
     says department spokesman Gerald Moore. The problem, he adds, is
     that 'scanners are only as accurate as the people who program them.'
     The department contends that stores are not reprogramming the 
     computerized price scanners frequently enough to reflect sales and
     other price changes. Inspectors posing as customers and purchasing
     some 150 items in each store were overcharged for 3 percent on 
     average. The department kept no tally of whether inspectors were
     overcharged.

          Retailers contend that just as many pricing errors are made in 
     favor of the customer and that overall accuracy oof scanning systems
     is superior to conventional cashier checkout. `Consumers would not 
     accept the technology if they felt it was inaccurate,' says Peter 
     Larkin, spokesman for the Food Marketing Institute, a grocery trade 
     group. To ease consumer anxiety about the technology, many 
     supermarkets offer a guarantee that backs up the accuracy with product 
     giveaways for items consumers find overpriced by the scanner.

          Whether customers come out even in the end is not the issue
     according to Moore. `It shouldn't be a crapshoot. People should be
     charged waht is advertised.'"

     I seems to me that consumers accept the technology not because they feel
it is accurate, but because it makes checkout faster. Also, where I live
Kroger gives your money back on items that are not charged the price marked
on the shelf. However, this still puts the burden on the customer. In the
"old days," you could check the price marked on the product against the one 
rung up. Now you have to write down the price on the shelf and compare it at 
the checkout. When there are lots of people impatiently waiting in line behind 
you, are you really going to do that?

Today's Guardian Newspaper contains an article by Rex Malik, a well-known UK
commentator on the computer scene, entitled "Every Move You Make ...",
discussing possible implications of two current European R&amp;D initiatives
concerning the use of computers in road transportation, DRIVE and PROMETHEUS.
As I understand it, DRIVE is an EC (European Community) initiative that has
been largely motivated by concerns about social and environmental impacts of
road traffic, whereas PROMETHEUS is a EUREKA project (which means that it is
collaboratively sponsored by various European national governments directly)
that is backed mainly by the automative manufacturers.
                                                            
Brian Randell, Computing Laboratory, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

PS: Some years ago Malik authored a book entitled "And Tomorrow .. The World?
Inside IBM" (Millington, London, 1975), which - how shall I put it - redressed
the somewhat uncritical view of IBM to be found in Thomas J.  Watson Jr's "A
Business And Its Beliefs: The Ideas That helped build IBM" (McGraw-Hill, New
York 1963). I recommend both - but only if read together! (This
"recommendation" is not intended to have any specific explicit relevance to
RISKS :-)

     =====
 
 Contracts for the EC's Drive (Dedicated Road Infrastructure for
 Vehicle Safety in Europe) programme preliminary phase were awarded
 earlier this year....
 ...
 Drive is a major EC pre-competitive research and development
 programme.  It is almost a cousin of the EC's Esprit, and it is likely
 to have radical consequences.
 ...
 Drive is an attempt to work out how to use information technology to
 create the infra-structure needed to help reduce the EC's road
 accident-related death and injury figures, (currently around 55,000 of
 the former and 350,000 of the latter), reduce environmental pollution
 and improve road traffic efficiency by enmeshing the road system in a
 web of IT.
 
 That's the radical bit.
 
 The parallel Prometheus programme aims to add electronics - automatic
 guidance and navigation systems - to vehicles, creating "smart cars"
 permanently linked to the Drive traffic environment management control
 systems.
 
 The long-term aim is to transform driving and driving conditions.  But
 when put in the context of other trends, these technical developments
 may have different connotations.
 
 The initial Drive contracts are for the specification phase.  Proposal
 T416, for example, is for a "Black Box", a Vehicle Journey Data
 Recorder - an improved digital version of the tachographs which
 monitor the driving times of professional drivers.
 
 But T416 goes much further.  It aims to produce a record for
 non-professional drivers giving the exact trajectory of a vehicle
 during the last 1,000 meters preceding an accident.
 
 This system is likely to operate within a road management environment
 in which vehicles will be linked at all times via a radio
 telecommunications network which will provide information about routes
 and traffic conditions - which, in the longer term, may over-ride
 systems of driver control.
 
 It could effectively turn vehicles into part of instantly assembled or
 disassembled what-you-might-call electronically-coupled trains.
 
 It could also provide a running record that we lawfully behave by
 recording in real time where and who we are when we leave our own
 private world and enter society's.
 
 This traffic management environment will operate across national
 frontiers.  You thought you could get away?  You thought wrong.
 Orwell may well have been right in intent even if he wasn't with the
 date, technology or politics.
 
 We are, with the best of motives - what after all could be a better
 motive than the saving of lives in massive numbers? - and for the
 greatest good of the greatest number (where have I heard that before?)
 creating the conditions which underlie the Orwellian nightmare.
 
 Whether we operate them in the Orwellian way is, of course, a
 different issue.

Taken from the "Sydney Morning Herald" 15 Jan 90:

``A [Sydney] reader recalls his time in Zimbabwe, when computer setting
  was installed at the country's main commercial printers.  A supervisor
  from the hot-metal printing days had always used a mallet to jog the
  linotype machines back into action, and found that old habits die
  hard.  The result?  A technician flown in from Johannesburg to repair
  a badly bruised computer.''

                             Database `akin to ID card'
                                   by Tony Healy
                           (The Australian, 23-Jan-1990)

Incensed pharmacists have forced the deferral of a nationwide computer network
which they say has many features of the Australia Card. [A national ID card
scheme whose introduction was recently abandoned] According to confidential
documents obtained by _The Australian_, the proposed network will record
every medical prescription issued to every individual and family in Australia
during long periods of time.  It will thus form a detailed and easily accessed
record of personal illness and disease.

Although the network has received little publicity, it was originally scheduled
to start operating on a pilot basis in April and to be fully operational by the
end of the year.  It is to be implemented by the same government body that
wanted the Australia Card -- the Health Insurance Commission -- using the same
computers it bought for the Australia Card.

Most controversial of all is the commission's intention to link its database
with that of the Department of Social Security.  This intention is explicitly
stated in the documents held by _The Australian_ -- a Health Insurance
Commission report titled Strategy Proposal for the Management of the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Program.

In the report, the commission also proposes making its network available on a
commercial basis to pharmaceutical suppliers.  Such a link realises the worst
fears of civil libertarians, who contend that the centralisation of information
and high speed access exposes information to abuse.

Both the Pharmacy Guild and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) have
objected to the risk this poses to patient confidentiality.  Guild protests
forced the commission to postpone the introduction of the network by six
months., its president, Mr Jim Mathews, said.

The federal president of the AMA, Dr Bryce Philips, said the association has
sought formal assurances from the commission that patient confidentiality can
be guaranteed.  "If it can't, we will not be part of it," he said.  A pointer
to the furtiveness surrounding the network is that the AMA learned about it
only by chance late last year, Mr Mathews said.  In its report, the Health
Commission also states its intention to create a culture in which people carry
an identifying card.

Confidential tender documents issued by the commission call for the network
eventually to be able to accept magnetic stripe cards.  In addition, the
commission recently tried to expand the information it gathers from concession
application forms.

Pharmacists point out that the extra information gives the Government the same
information it wanted to record on the Australia Card and have refused to
provide it.

The rationale behind the network is to reduce an estimated $[AUS]30 million
worth of pharmacy benefits fraud identified in report by the Attorney General.

The network will consist of online terminals in each of Australia's 5500
pharmacies, connected to a central database running on the commission's two IBM
3090 mainframes.

Before issuing prescriptions, pharmacists will be required to check all
customers on the computer. A principal reason is their eligibility for
pensioner and other concessions -- this concerns about 80 per cent of
prescription customers.

A spokesman for the Federal Minister for Community Services, Mr Staples, denied
the claims and described them as part of pharmacists' heated campaign against
the Government.

From Telephony, Jan 22, 1990 p11:

    "The fault was in the code" of the new software that AT&amp;T loaded
    into front-end processors of all 114 of its 4ESS switching systems
    in mid-December, said Larry Seese, AT&amp;T's director of technology
    development. In detail:

    The problem began the afternoon of Jan 15 when a piece of trunk
    interface equipment developed internal problems for reasons that
    have yet to be determined. The equipment told the 4ESS switch
    in New York that it was having problems and couldn't correct the
    fault. "The recovery code is written so that the processor will run
    corrective initialization on the equipment. That takes four to six
    seconds. At the same time, new calls are stopped from coming into the
    switch." Seese said.

    The New York switch sent a message to all the other 4ESS switches
    it is linked with that it was not accepting additional traffic. 
    Seese referred to that message as a "congestion signal."  After 
    the switch successfully completed the reintialization, the New York 
    switch went back in service and began processing calls.
    That is when the fault in the new software reared its ugly head. 
    Under the previous system, switch A would send out a message that 
    it was working again, and swithc B would double-check that switch 
    A was back in service. With the new software, switch A begins  
    processing calls and sends out call routing signals. The reappearance
    of traffic from switch A is supposed to tell switch B that A is 
    working again.

    "We made an improvement in the way we react to those messages so 
    we can react more quickly. The first common channel signaling system 
    7 initial address message (caused by a call attempt) that switch B 
    receives from swithc A alerts B that A is back in service. Switch B 
    then resets its internal logic to indicate that A is back in service," 
    said Seese.

    The problem occured when switch B got a second call-attempt message 
    from A while it was in the process of resetting its internal logic. 
    "[The message] confused the software. it tried to execute an instruction
    that didn't make any sense. The software told switch B `My CCS7 processor
    is insane'", so switch B shut itself down to avoid spreading the problem,
    Seese explained.

    Unfortunately, switch B then sent a message to other switches that it 
    was out of service and wasn't accepting additional traffic. Once switch
    B reset itself and began operating again, it sent out call processing
    messages via the CCS7 link. That caused identical failures around the
    nation as other 4ESS switches got second messages from switch B while 
    they were in the process of resetting their internal logic to indicate
    switch B was working again.

    "It was a chain reaction. Any switch that was connected to B was put 
    into the same condition."

    "The event just repeated itself in every [4ESS] switch over and over 
    again. If the switches hadn't gotten a second message while resetting,
    there would have been no problem. If the messages had been received 
    farther apart, it would not have triggered the problem."

    AT&amp;T solved the problem by reducing the messaging load of the CCS7 
    network. That allowed the switches to rest themselves and the network 
    to stabilize.

WHMurray.Catwalk@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL [WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.ARPA] says
&gt;The assertion by AT&amp;T, "in an effort to allay customer fears about the networks
&gt;reliability," that the outage was "traced to a single computer program," not
&gt;only fails to reassure me, but alarms me greatly.  It suggests a serious
&gt;failure on their part to understand the nature of the problem.

I think you need to remember that this failure report was intended for the
great unwashed, who relate the term 'computer' to their Apple II, or possibly
the protagonist in the movie 'The Demon Seed'.  It is clearly inadaquate for
those of us who are technically literate.  I for one am looking forward to

Trading on the London Stock Exchange suffered a minor disruption on 23 Jan 90
when a computer problem interrupted the quotation of the stock exchange market
indexes for two hours and 20 minutes.  The problem was spotted when The
Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading stocks suddenly went from a
slight gain to a noticeable loss. The exchange shut down the index service at
noon, installed a standby computer and began operating the service again at
2:20 p.m.  The exchange's automated computerized trading system was not
affected, and individual stock quotes were accurate.  [Source: N.Y. Times News

I felt I had to say a few things about Douglas Jones' item in RISKS 9.58.
Whilst I realise that UK and US usages may be different, I think that some of
these points may be of interest to all readers anyway.

&gt; (One at a time because it takes his full strength ...)
Some levers control the signal or points electrically, and so require almost
no effort. For this reason, the lever handle is cut short so that only one
hand can be used on the lever. Nevertheless, the signalman will only operate
one lever at a time.

In large boxes, two or three signalmen may work a single frame ("frame" is the
UK term for the row of levers). In this case, it is possible for two or more
levers to be operated at the same time. This was a contributing factor to the
accident at Hull (Paragon).

[Note to PGN: msb@sq.com mailed you and me a description of this about two
years ago. If you or he still has it, it might be worth posting it to RISKS.]

&gt; (I've seen photos ... with banks of 20 or more control levers.)
In the UK, 20 levers would be regarded as a small frame (and so low paid!). A
typical main-line box would have 50 to 60 levers, and a large one could have
two frames of 120 levers each. This makes the interlocking problem
considerably more complex.

&gt; ... thus, there are 256 possible states of the system.
&gt; An interlocking machine consists of a set of 8 transverse rods crossing 8
&gt; rods linked to the control levers.
It would be unusual for there to be exactly 8 transverse rods, or "tappets" as
they are known. Each tappet implements one condition in the interlocking. It
is not sufficient to consider the static states, as there are many
circumstances when a *change* must be forbidden (e.g. don't move 2 if 1 is up,
even though either state of 2 is legal when 1 is up). In the example given, the
conditions, one per tappet, would be:

    1, 3, 4 down to move 2
    5, 6, 8 down to move 7
    3 up only if 2 set to straight through
    4 up only if 2 set to loop
    5 up only if 7 set to straight through
    6 up only if 7 set to loop
    1 up only if 3 and 4 down
    8 up only if 5 and 6 down
    1 and 8 cannot both be up

Thus 9 tappets would be required. (The last condition implements a general
rule that trains are never allowed into a passing loop from both directions at
the same time).

(Of course, this layout would not be implemented as such. Firstly, the points
would have locks, each controlled by their own lever. Secondly, two further
signals would be placed at the same locations as 1 and 8, but applying in the
opposite direction, so that a train can be shunted between the two sides of
the loop without leaving the area controlled by the signal box. Thirdly, these
two signals would be electrically interlocked with equipment which ensures that
a train cannot be signalled on to a single line which is already occupied.
Fourthly, there would be distant signals about a mile before 1 and 8, which
show only "caution" and "clear"; these could only show clear if the points are
set for straight through running, and all signals in that direction are at
"go". Finally, a King lever would be installed to allow the box to be unmanned
at night; when the lever is pulled, it is possible to clear the signals in
both directions at the same time, notwithstanding the interlocking, and the
signal boxes on either side would be connected to each other as if this one
was not there. So in fact we would have 13 levers, probably about 18 tappets
(I haven't worked it out), and some electrical interlocks (see below). But
this is starting to sound like rec.railroad :-)

Modern practice in lever frames (which are slowly being phased out) is to use
electrically controlled bolts as well as or instead of tappets to lock the
levers. This allows practices such as:

    - don't allow a signal to be raised without permission from the next
      signal box down the line;
    - ensure that permission applies for "one pull only", and that the signal
      must be replaced before permission can be given again;
    - only allow the exit signal to be raised if a "token" has been issued for
      the single line section ahead; two signal boxes are connected so that
      only one token can be issued at a time (the token may be physical or
      logical);
    - ensure that a train has occupied and cleared a specific track circuit
      before the signal can be cleared again ("Welwyn control").

The Farnley Junction accident (<A HREF="/Risks/5.66.html">RISKS-5.66</A>, 30 Nov 87) shows that safety
critical software problems are nothing new (the accident occurred because NOT
NOT X equals X), and railways do indeed have something to teach us.

A friend of mine worked as a computer operator in a company with a large IBM
computer.  One day, they called in the repairman for a faulty console.  When
the repairman arrived to check out the problem, he noticed that some of the
keys of the console keyboard were stuck down, in the shape of a closed fist.
His comment: "We can fix this, but it will not be under warranty."

&gt;I seems to me that consumers accept the technology not because they feel
&gt;it is accurate, but because it makes checkout faster.

It seems to me that consumers accept the technology because they have no
choice. The only markets in Los Angeles that DON'T use automated scanners are
small convenience stores (e.g. 7-11).  If you want to buy food, you HAVE to
accept the scanner system.  My wife has objected to the lack of marked prices,
preventing her from checking the receipts.  I have suggested she take a pen to
the market and mark the prices as they come off the shelf. The only problem is
a fair percentage of the shelf prices are missing, which I imagine IS a
violation of some law. Go tilt at windmills!

It may very well be the case that people accept the technology because they
feel it is more accurate.  The real issue is that this 'feeling' may be
unfounded, or based primarily on marketing hype.

David Marks quotes an INSIGHT magazine article: "Retailers contend that just as
many pricing errors are made in favor of the customer..."  What then should the
attentive shopper, checking his prices, do when he sees an UNDERcharge go past?
My conscience is regularly stricken when I shop at the local purveyor of
organic and transitional organic foodstuffs.  Service ranges from pleasant and
ineffectual through bossy and dumb, checkout pricing is by seminumerate human
being.  I buy Thomas Hardy's ale there, which costs $2.89 for a 6 ounce bottle,
or $11.56 for a carton of 4.  Each bottle is marked $2.89, but the carton price
appears nowhere.  If asked by the checkout clerk I tell them the price is
$11.56, but if they don't ask I accept what they charge.  About half the time,
it's $2.89 for the whole carton.  I tell myself this makes up for the utter
incompetence of say, the organic meat department, but I still feel guilty when
I leave.  What should I do?  ...Distressed in Oregon

    [Perhaps it is really Oregonic meat, not Organic meat, and someone is 
    illiterate as well as innumerate.  Perhaps you should switch to Samuel
    Adams beer.  Although Hardy was more literate, Adams might have been more
    patriotic.  But you could have a nice chat with the manager.  You will
    probably find that the hearty ale is not Bar Coded.  (HardyHar at your
    neighborhood bar.)  PGN]

The following is an excerpt from a message sent by one of our computer security
people.  Michael J. Chinni, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey  

                          Verdict: "GUILTY"

Student "worm" whiz is found guilty.  A U.S. court jury returned its verdict
about 9:30 pm after approximately six hours of deliberation.  Robert T. Morris
was found guilty of federal computer tampering charges for unleashing a rogue
program that crippled a nationwide computer network (Internet system).  A date
for sentencing has not yet been set.  Morris faces up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.  He is the first person brought to trial under a 1986
federal computer fraud and abuse law that makes it a felony to break into a
federal computer network and prevent authorized use of the system.  Morris
testified that he had made a programming error that caused a computer "worm" to
go berserk and cripple the Internet system back on November 2, 1988.  The
"worm" he designed immobilized an estimated 6,000 computers linked to Internet,
including ones at the NASA, some military facilities and a few major
universities.  Morris's attorney Thomas Guidoboni argued that Morris never
intended to prevent authorized access.  However testimony showed Morris did
indeed deliberately steal computer passwords from hundreds of people so the
"worm" could break into as many computers as possible.  It was brought out in
the trial that he took deliberate and conscious steps to make the rogue program
difficult to detect and eliminate.  Morris camouflaged sending of the program
by unleashing it from the computer system at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge and made it look like it had been sent from the
University of California at Berkeley so authorship of the program could not be
traced to him at Cornell.  Other evidences showed Morris had at least six
earlier versions of the "worm", which had been found on his Cornell computer
accounts and that his own comments on the "worm" program used the words
"break-in" and "steal".

    On the 26th June 1988 at 12:45:39, flight ACF 296Q, an Airbus owned by
the German company Durus Verwaltungsgesellschaft MBH Co Mobilien KG, and
exploited by AIR FRANCE crashed in a forest in eastern France, whilst flying at
very low altitude during an Air Show.
    Today, the captain, Michel Asseline has lost his French pilot license for 8
years. He is now flying in Australia.
    One and a half years after this accident it is still not known why this
crash happened. A report written by the commission dealing with the enquiries
about the crash has not yet been released to the public, but "Le Temps de la
Finance", a French financial newspaper is now able to give at least SEVEN major
contradictions in the report. Please note that the report they had in hand was
the final draft.

Le Temps de la Finance. Nr. 59 Thursday, 18 January 1990.

" The first part of the conclusions implicates the organisers of the air
show and the company AIR FRANCE. The planning of the flight was insufficient
because the whole file was submitted too late. The commission doing the
enquiry revealed that the technical flight plan given to the crew of the
aircraft by the regional operations department of AIR FRANCE did not mention
anything about the axis of the runway, or the altitude of the flight.
   One of our informers pointed-out that the different flight plans given to
the commission, including messages to/from the crew were bad quality
photocopies.
   The airport on which the tragedy happened had 2 parallel runways which were
not fit to receive an A320 should an incident occur."

There then follows a reminder that this was a demonstration flight and the
passengers were in a very joyful mood. One argues that this could have been
transmitted to the pilots. The aircraft was one of a new type which might have
triggered an excess of confidence in the pilot's head. In addition, the
size of the airport was so small that the pilot might have thought he was at
a higher altitude.

" The commision has implied NO FAULT concerning the functioning of the aircraft,
or its design. However, certain affirmations of the commission leading the
enquiry can be discussed...

1:  On the day of the accident, the altimeter reference value had been changed
to a value which was not sensible. The commission emphasizes that since that 
time, it has never happened again. But an aeronautical specialist has confirmed 
to us that it is impossible  to affirm that this anomaly has never happened
since.

2:  when the DFDR (Digital Flight Data Recorder) (A Fairchild 800) was decoded,
some of the data was badly restituted. During 8 seconds, the readings of the
data were incorrect and corrupted, and some errors in the software controlling
the restitution of parameters of the A320 are thought to be the cause of the 
anomaly, the report says. The tape was therefore cleaned and then most of the
data was read without problems. But the examining magistrate is now talking 
about verifying the authenticity and integrity of the flight recorder data.

3:  The commission noted that the data of the DFDR is incoherent for 3 seconds
starting 12:45:39, which is the exact time of the crash, and then data
relating to an earlier flight is found sonce the DFDR functions in a closed
loop. But a specialist told us that this is technically impossible !
This view agrees with information published in [another French newspaper], the
"Canard Enchaine" on Wednesday 17 January 89 which was talking about 
irregularities and interference concerning the DFDR decoding. That paper
disclosed that the tape was cut and information transfered to another tape for 
reading and decoding...

4:  The emergency lighting did not work because of a programming error. (this
information is repeated twice in the report, pages 28 and 31). In
aeronautical circles, it is said that this is 'due to a bad power supply
which was corrected in many months because of problems concerning the official
approval' [ !? ]. The organisation which certified the circuit, the DGAC
(Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile [ French equivalent of FAA - ocl])
is a branch of the same organisation which controls the IGAC, the commission 
which led the enquiry.
The signal requesting evacuation of the cabin did not apparently work since
nobody heard it, and the head of the cabin crew did not manage to find the
microphone of the public address system. It had apparently broken-off
from its stand, which was very fragile.

5:  Did the equipment broadcasting the altitude work all right ? (this is
a hypothesis). It was heard at 100 feet. But then the dialogue between the
pilots was interrupted and from that time nothing is really sure.
The pilot told the control tower that he was at 100 feet, and flight plans
indicate a minimum of 100 feet, but it was observed from the ground that the
aircraft was in fact at 30 feet. On page 55 of the report, it is said that
if the airplane drops under the required altitude, this implies that the 
captain is piloting by sight, and has not registered the data given by the
vocal equipment. But Michel Asseline cut-out the automatic protection for 
thrust (Alpha-floor). This is needed when there is a need to fly over
100 feet and the aircraft is very inclined. But why would he cut it out 
when flying under 100 feet, since it is automatically de-activated under that
altitude ?
And then there is also the surprise of the pilots in the cockpit when the
airbus chopped the first trees of the forest: 'Shit, the trees !'
This tends to prove that the pilots were not aware of their low altitude, and 
that they were not aware of the presence of this patch of forest, since it was
not marked on the plan, although electric pylons are noted 1.5Km away from
that zone.
[...]
... all of these deficiencies seem to accumulate, on an aircraft which,
according to the commission had NO MECHANICAL AND INSTRUMENTAL DEFICIENCY WHICH
COULD ENDANGER THE AIRCRAFT'S SAFETY.

6:  Did the engines work properly ? As soon as he escaped from the aircraft,
the captain Michel Asseline cast doubts on the response of the engines. These
are built by CFM, a 50/50 between General Electric (USA) and Snecma (France)."

There then follows a number of contradictory statements from Snecma and 
Asseline, and the fact that one can feel that an engine is not giving enough 
power to 'leap-out' of such a situation under these circumstances, since the
engines cannot instantaneously give maximum thrust.

" Asseline answers that the constructors of the engine CFM56 were aware of the
problems of acceleration of the engine at low altitude but told AIR FRANCE
about that only after the crash."

Along with the article is a photocopy of a bulletin released by Airbus
Industrie Flight Division, entitled:

"Operations Engineering Bulleting - A320.
Validity A320 - CFM only
Bulletin Nr. 19/1  DATE: MAY 88

Reasons for issue:

   It has been observed (recently), so far on test aircraft only, that a
VSV position control deficiency could prevent the engines from accelerating
up to full power under certain flight conditions:

- low altitude
- high aircraft speed
- engine acceleration initiated from N1 between 40% and 70%

Two production aircraft have been checked and no engine presented any sign
of this problem.

Explanation:

[...]
The most likely reason for the problem is a lack of muscle pressure to 
control the VSV's to their intended position when aerodynamic loads are
high. Therefore the problem is unlikely to occur at low aircraft speed.

Actions:

A full investigation... [...]
As a precautionary measure, the following procedure it to be applied should the
problem be encountered.

Procedures:

If the "compressor vane fault" warning come-on ECAM at low altitude (below
10000 feet), associated with a lack of N1 response (typical values for throttle
position: 100% N2, 80% N1), the fault can be cleared by decelerating the engine
to idle, and then performing a rapid acceleration from idle speed to full
power. "

The newspaper says that 2 conditions out of 3 were met, and that the engine
throttle positions were the same during the crash. N1 is low power throttle
position (40% - Max 80%).  One second before the crash , N1 was 67%. It then
increased to 83% and 84%.  A failure was possible. Since the aircraft serial
number was 009, it could be considered as nearly being still a prototype.

"7:  The report is incoherent on a few points. It doesn't get alarmed that 
although the stick was pulled back fully (written on pages 22 and 43), the
inclination of the Airbus did not change.
[...]
Last problem: Can the DGAC, through the commission leading the enquiry,
admit that an aircraft that it certified earlier is defficient ?
All parties involved, Air France, the French Civil Aviation Authority,
the Snecma, are all owned or controlled by the French State.
Would the French State have any advantage in taking itself to court ?"

There then follows a discussion about the political and economicl factors
at stake. Enormous sources of revenue from exportation of Airbus and of CFM56
engines which also equip some Boeing aircraft.

The article concludes that if nothing was wrong with the aircraft, it is
in everybody's  interest to help the inquiry so that all questions that remain 
can be answered, and the public be hopefully reassured why the flight
ACF 296 Q terminated in the woods of Hasheim, in the east of France.

disclaimer: I know, I am a hopeless translator. I am merely relaying to this
list what I read in the paper. I have no opinion on that matter, neither does
KCL or in fact anyone I know... So please: no flames, thanks.

&gt;Newsgroups: comp.dcom.telecom
&gt;Subject: AT&amp;T Crash Statement: The Official Report
&gt;Organization: TELECOM Digest

Here's AT&amp;T's _official_ report on the Martin Luther King day network
problems, courtesy of the AT&amp;T Consultant Liason Program.

Don
        =========================================================

Technical background on AT&amp;T's network slowdown, January 15, 1990

                             *  *  *

At approximately 2:30 p.m. EST on Monday, January 15, one of AT&amp;T's 4ESS toll
switching systems in New York City experienced a minor hardware problem which
activated normal fault recovery routines within the switch.  This required the
switch to briefly suspend new call processing until it completed its fault
recovery action -- a four-to-six second procedure.  Such a suspension is a
typical maintenance procedure, and is normally invisible to the calling public.

As part of our network management procedures, messages were automatically sent
to connecting 4ESS switches requesting that no new calls be sent to this New
York switch during this routine recovery interval.  The switches receiving this
message made a notation in their programs to show that the New York switch was
temporarily out of service.

When the New York switch in question was ready to resume call processing a few
seconds later, it sent out call attempts (known as IAMs - Initial Address
Messages) to its connecting switches.  When these switches started seeing call
attempts from New York, they started making adjustments to their programs to
recognize that New York was once again up-and-running, and therefore able to
receive new calls.

A processor in the 4ESS switch which links that switch to the CCS7 network
holds the status information mentioned above.  When this processor (called a
Direct Link Node, or DLN) in a connecting switch received the first call
attempt (IAM) from the previously out-of-service New York switch, it initiated
a process to update its status map.  As the result of a software flaw, this DLN
processor was left vulnerable to disruption for several seconds.  During this
vulnerable time, the receipt of two call attempts from the New York switch --
within an interval of 1/100th of a second -- caused some data to become
damaged.  The DLN processor was then taken out of service to be reinitialized.

Since the DLN processor is duplicated, its mate took over the traffic load.
However, a second couplet of closely spaced new call messages from the New York
4ESS switch hit the mate processor during the vulnerable period, causing it to
be removed from service and temporarily isolating the switch from the CCS7
signaling network.  The effect cascaded through the network as DLN processors
in other switches similarly went out of service.  The unstable condition
continued because of the random nature of the failures and the constant
pressure of the traffic load in the network providing the call-message
triggers.

The software flaw was inadvertently introduced into all the 4ESS switches in
the AT&amp;T network as part of a mid-December software update.  This update was
intended to significantly improve the network's performance by making it
possible for switching systems to access a backup signaling network more
quickly in case of problems with the main CCS7 signaling network.  While the
software had been rigorously tested in laboratory environments before it was
introduced, the unique combination of events that led to this problem couldn't
be predicted.

To troubleshoot the problem, AT&amp;T engineers first tried an array of standard
procedures to reestablish the integrity of the signaling network.  In the past,
these have been more than adequate to regain call processing.  In this case,
they proved inadequate.  So we knew very early on we had a problem we'd never
seen before.

At the same time, we were looking at the pattern of error messages and trying
to understand what they were telling us about this condition.  We have a
technical support facility that deals with network problems, and they became
involved immediately.  Bell Labs people in Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey joined
in moments later.  Since we didn't understand the mechanism we were dealing
with, we had to infer what was happening by looking at the signaling messages
that were being passed, as well as looking at individual switches.  We were
able to stabilize the network by temporarily suspending signaling traffic on
our backup links, which helped cut the load of messages to the affected DLN
processors.  At 11:30 p.m. EST on Monday, we had the last link in the network
cleared.

On Tuesday, we took the faulty program update out of the switches and
temporarily switched back to the previous program.  We then started examining
the faulty program with a fine-toothed comb, found the suspicious software,
took it into the laboratory, and were able to reproduce the problem.  We have
since corrected the flaw, tested the change and restored the backup signaling
links.

We believe the software design, development and testing processes we use are
based on solid, quality foundations.  All future releases of software will
continue to be rigorously tested.  We will use the experience we've gained
through this problem to further improve our procedures.

It is important to note that Monday's calling volume was not unusual; in fact,
it was less than a normal Monday, and the network handled normal loads on
previous weekdays.  Although nothing can be guaranteed 100% of the time, what
happened Monday was a series of events that had never occurred before.  With
ongoing improvements to our design and delivery processes, we will continue to
drive the probability of this type of incident occuring towards zero.

[A tragedy is when you learn the wrong thing from a fiasco.]

After AT&amp;T's early and re-assuring statements about the nature of their recent
failure, I complained about the potential to permanently mislead their
employees about the nature of the failure.  Now it turns out that the
statements were premature and misleading.

I comment now at the risk of still being too soon.  However, I will limit my
comments to the community and to what is now already all too clear.

THE FAILURE WAS NOT IN THE FAILURE OF A SINGLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE.
NEITHER IS IT LIKELY TO BE AN ISOLATED CONDITION.

The failure was not, as was first suggested, a propagating alarm condition.
Rather, IT WAS THE INABILITY TO PROPERLY HANDLE THE RETURN TO THE LINE OF A
FAILING COMPONENT.  It was not a COMPONENT problem; it was, as I feared and
suggested a SYSTEM problem.  This is a growing class of complex system failure.

It was the major cause of the NASDAQ outage and it contributed to Hinsdale.
NASDAQ's system behaved as expected when the service from the local utility
dropped.  It failed when the external power came back on line.  The ability of
the operator in down-state Illinois to properly read the situation in Hinsdale
was complicated by the fact that the power system and the fire alarms were
coupled, in a subtle way, so as to confuse the readings, and because the
attempts of automatic systems to compensate for the fire, not only perpetuated
the fire, but confused the alarm information even further.

We are testing to see what happens when a component fails.  WE ARE NOT PROPERLY
TESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE COMPONENT SUCCEEDS IN CORRECTING ITSELF
AND COMES BACK ON LINE.

Potentially, there is a second lesson to be learned from AT&amp;T.  It is that it
is possible to over-automate.  As I noted earlier, the real problem was not
that a component failed, but that the system could not tolerate it coming back
on-line.

Note that AT&amp;T had automated the procedure for restoring a failing component.
This decision contributed to the failure.  Now, if this kind of component
failure was so common that manual intervention would be ineffective and
inefficient, then the decision to automate it would be appropriate.  Otherwise,
it is an example of OVER AUTOMATION.  Such automation adds so much complexity
that it causes failures that would not have taken place in its absence.

AUTOMATE ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITH SUFFICIENT FREQUENCY THAT
AUTOMATION IS JUSTIFIED.  AVOID GRATUITOUS AUTOMATION.

Notice that the procedure was inadequately tested, and that this contributed to
the failure.  In fairness to AT&amp;T and others who have had similar problems,
such conditions are difficult to simulate and the procedures difficult to test.

IF YOU CANNOT TEST IT, DO NOT DO IT.

			    CERT Advisory
			   29 January 1990
		      Sun Sendmail Vulnerability

The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has learned
of, and has verified, break-ins on several Internet systems in which the
intruders have exploited a vulnerability in the Sun sendmail program.  This
vulnerability exists in all versions of SunOS up to and including the current
version, 4.0.3 on Sun 3, Sun 4, and Sun 386i systems (note that 4.0.2 is the
most current version of SunOS on the 386i machines). That is, all current Sun
systems.

The vulnerability has previously been reported to Sun and a solution to this
problem (Sun bug # 1028173) is available via a new version of sendmail supplied
by Sun.  The new sendmail is available directly from the Sun Answer Center
(1-800-USA-4SUN).  Sun 3 and Sun 4 sendmail binaries are also available via
anonymous FTP from uunet.uu.net in the /sun-fixes directory.

This incident underscores the need for system administrators to maintain an
awareness of the steps their vendors are taking to improve the security aspects
of their products, and to seriously consider upgrading system configurations
when solutions to security problems are made available.

Administrators of Sun systems are urged to contact Sun for the new version of
the sendmail program.  Administrators of machines other than Suns are urged to
contact their vendors to verify that they are running the latest version of
sendmail, since there may have been security related fixes to it in the past
year.

If you need further information on this problem, contact your Sun
representative or CERT/CC.  CERT/CC can be contacted by telephone at (412)
268-7090 (24 hours) or email to cert@cert.sei.cmu.edu (monitored daily).

Our thanks to Matt Bishop and Wayne Cripps for their efforts in analyzing and
investigating this problem and its solution.

  [Perhaps the "secure" version would fix the RISKS sendmail timeout problem
  that occasionally gives some of you multiple copies of RISKS, but then there
  apparently are other things that we need that it does not do!  For this
  reason there are various versions of sendmail floating around, none of which
  is quite what is needed.  Oh, well, what's new?  PGN]

Subject: GPO Library disk infection (PC)

I phoned the folks at the GPO and confirmed that the above report is indeed
true.  They faxed me a copy of a letter which they're sending out to the people
that they know have received the disks.  Below is a (transcribed - sorry if
there are typos) copy of that fax.
                                                  Ken

===== Cut Here =====

Dear Depository Librarian:

GPO has just been notified by the Census Bureau that one of the floppy
disks just distributed by GPO with the _County and City Data Book_
CD-ROM is infected with a computer virus AND SHOULD NOT BE USED UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  The floppy disk was listed on shipping list
90-0057-P as C 3.134/2:C 83/2/988/floppy-2.  The title on the floppy
disk reads as follows:

Bureau of the Census
Elec. County &amp; City Data Bk., 1988
U.S. Stats., Inc., 1101 King St.,
Suite 601, Alexandria, VA 22314
(703) 979-9699

PLEASE DESTROY THE FLOPPY DISK AS SOON AS IT IS RECEIVED.  (Do NOT
reformat and reuse the floppy disk.)

The virus has been identified as the Jerusalum-B virus (also referred to as the
Israeli virus).  It infects any .COM or .EXE program on MS-DOS personal
computers and increases program size by approximately 1,800 bytes.  Other
programs are infected when they are executed in an infected system.

The Jerusalum virus can cause significant damage on an infected personal
computer.  It generally slows down the system and some versions destroy all
data on the hard disk.  .EXE files continue to grow in size until they are too
large to execute.

If your computer has already been infected, we recommend that, if possible, you
seek assistance from a computer specialist at your institution immediately.
There are special programs available for detecting and eradicating computer
viruses.  One may be available in your institution or from someone you know.
DO NOT USE YOUR PC TO ACCESS A NETWORK OR PRODUCE FLOPPY DISKS CONTAINING .EXE
OR .COM PROGRAMS FOR BY OTHER PCS.

The _County and City Data Book_ CD-ROM can be used safely with the
software on the other floppy disk disk distributed in that shipment
((C 134/2:C 83/2/988/floppy).

If you have any questions, please call Jan Erickson at GPO (202
275-1003) or the Census Bureau Customer Service at (301 763-4100).

The Census Bureau and GPO regret any problems that this may have
caused.  Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that it does not
happen again.

In response to the many comments regarding my previous transaction, about the
student who responded to a test question that passwords are better than
biometrics because one can give out a password to a friend and thus does not
need to be physically present when the friend logs in to one's account:

I gave the student no credit for his answer.  (It made no difference 
whatsoever in his semester grade.)  True, I could have worded the question
differently:   "If one is concerned about maintaining individual 
accountability, what is one advantage...".  However, I did not believe that
the lack of the qualifier made his answer acceptable:  the student should
have understood the context of the question.

In discussing the question/answer with the student afterward, I described
a situation that happened a couple of years ago in another class I 
was teaching.  (The story is true; the names have been changed to protect
the guilty.)

I was teaching a course in Pascal programming to a class of Information
Systems Management majors.   "Joe", a student in the class, was engaged
to "Sue", who had taken the course the previous semester.  Joe told Sue
his password, so that she could help him with his class programming
assignments.  However, in the middle of the semester, Joe dumped Sue
for Sally, another student in the current class.

For Sue, revenge was sweet.  Since she knew Joe's password, she logged in to
his account and 'fixed' his programs.  She didn't delete his files; that would
have been obvious, and fixable from backup tapes.  Instead, she subtly changed
lines of code in the programs (e.g., 'while (x &lt; MaxSize)...'  became 'while
(x&lt;= MaxSize)...').  The net result was that the programs ran, but gave
incorrect answers.

Joe never did find out what happened.  I found out about it because Joe wound
up failing the class (NOT just because the programs didn't work, but that
contributed).  Sue felt guilty; she came to see me after the semester and
explained what she had done.  I made some comment to her about 'he should have
changed his password after changing his personal life'.  She said that he
eventually did.  But, Joe told his new password to three or four of his other
friends; it was not difficult for her to find out his new password from one of
them.

As I explained to the Computer Security student, this is exactly the problem
with sharing your password.  Once you have given it to someone else, you have
lost control of it.  There is no real way of being sure exactly who knows your
password and what is being done with/to your account, unless you can completely
trust everyone you give your password to.

Now, I do understand that sometimes individual accountability is not important.
If the security policy for the system says that individual accountability is
not an issue, and everyone clearly understands what that means, then I have no
problems with sharing passwords.  I just want everyone to understand the
potential consequences before they make that decision.

I also understand that, no matter what security policies/rules say, some people
are going to do what they want - including sharing passwords, etc.  I cannot
stop that, any more than I can stop people from breaking other rules/laws, etc.
As a teacher, what I want to do is make people aware of the possible
consequences of breaking those rules.  That applies to the consequences from
the Academic Computing Center ("we're terminating this account, because you
didn't abide by the rules") and to the consequences from those who get access
to the accounts.  Once users understand the rules, the reasons, and the
consequences, they will make their own decisions.  The only thing I can do is
report anything I personally know about to appropriate authorities, and hope
for the best with the rest.

(To further someone's analogy about giving someone your ATM card and PIN when
you're ill, so they can get you some money: understand before you do it that,
if this person wants to take some extra money from your account and pocket it,
(s)he can.  If this person loses your card and the slip of paper (s)he has
written the PIN on, then someone else can get your money.  Once you understand
that, then you have to make up your own mind about whether the risk is worth
the benefit.)

                          Sixth Annual Computer Security
                              Applications Conference
                                December 3-7, 1990
                                 Tucson, Arizona
The Conference

    Operational requirements for civil, military, and commercial systems
increasingly stress the necessity for information to be readily accessible.
The Computer Security Act of 1987 requires that all Federal agencies take
certain actions to improve the security and privacy provided by federal
computer systems. Accomplishing both operational and security requirements
requires the application of the maturing technology of integrated information
security to new and existing systems throughout their life cycle.
    This conference will explore technology applications for both civil and
military systems; the hardware and software tools and techniques being
developed to satisfy system requirements; and specific examples of systems
applications and implementations.  Security policy issues and standards will
also be covered during this five day conference.

Papers, Tutorials, and Vendor Exhibits

    Technical papers and tutorials that address the application of integrated
information security technologies in the civil, defense, and commercial
environments are solicited.  Original research, analyses and approaches for
defining the computer security issues and problems identified in the
Conference's interest areas; secure systems in use or development;
methodological approaches for analyzing the scope and nature of integrated
information security issues; and potential solutions are of particular
interest.  We are also interested in vendor presentations of state-of-the-art
information security products.

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:
    Send five copies of your paper or panel proposal to Dr. Ronald Gove,
Program Chairman, at the address given below.  Tutorial proposals should be
sent to Dr. Dixie Baker at the address given below.  We provide "blind"
refereeing; put names and affiliations of authors on a separate cover page
only.  It is a condition of acceptance that manuscripts submitted have not been
published.  Papers that have been accepted for presentation at other
conferences should not be submitted.

    Papers and tutorial proposals must be received by May 18, 1990.  Authors
will be required to certify prior to June 20, 1990, that any and all necessary
clearances for publication have been obtained, that they will attend the
conference to deliver the paper, and that the paper has not been accepted
elsewhere.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by July 30, 1990.  Camera

"Computer Viruses: Dealing with Electronic Vandalism and Programmed
Threats" by Eugene Spafford, Kathleen Heaphy, and David Ferbrache.
1989, 109 pages.  Published by ADAPSO.

The book has been written to be an accessible resource guide for computer users
and managers (PC and mainframe).  It presents a high-level discussion of
computer viruses, explaining how they work, who writes them, and what they do.
It is not intended to serve as a technical reference on viruses, both because
the audience for such a work would be limited, and because such a reference
might serve to aid potential virus authors.

The goal of the book is to dispell some common myths about viruses (and worms,
trojan horses, et. al.), and provide simple, effective suggestions for how to
protect computer systems against these threats.  It furthermore stresses that
most systems face greater threats from other areas, so the proper attitude to
take is to strengthen overall security; concrete suggestions for enhancing
overall security are also presented.

The appendices provide extensive references to other publications, security
organizations, anti-viral software sources, applicable (U.S.)  state and
Federal laws against computer crime, and detailed descriptions of all IBM and
Apple Macintosh viruses known as of 1 October 1990.

Although written for ADAPSO members, almost any computer user should find it
instructive.  The appendices are an excellent source of further information,
addresses and phone numbers, and pointers to software.  At least one university
professor has indicated he will use the book in a security course, and some law
enforcement agencies are also considering using the book for instructional
purposes.

The authors are interested in comments and feedback about the book, especially
in areas where information might be added.  You can contact them by sending
mail to "virus-book@cs.purdue.edu"

Table of Contents: Preface, Executive Summary, Introduction,
  Programmed Threats, What is a Computer Virus?, Names,
  Dealing with Viruses, Prevention, Security, Legal Issues, Attitudes,
  Further Information on Viruses,  Information on Anti-Viral Software,
  Further Information on Legal Aspects of Viruses, 
  Further Reading and Resources

My sincerest apologies to those of you who received multiple copies of
<A HREF="/Risks/9.63.html">RISKS-9.63</A>.  I keep breaking the mailing list up into smaller sublists, but for
the first time TWO of the sublists were victimized by the lurking SENDMAIL
flaw.  I will try mailing this issue to the sublists sequentially, waiting for
each sublist to complete before going on to the next, just in case there are
competing effects.  I have been putting out fewer issues in hopes of minimizing
your annoyance, but that is also counterproductive.  So, please bear with me as
I try this issue serially over the sublists...  Painful, but it might help!

By the way, the end of the AT&amp;T "Official report" message in <A HREF="/Risks/9.63.html">RISKS-9.63</A> had a
few trailing blank characters that overflowed the line and made the next line
look blank on my screen, which means that the undigestifiers probably gagged on
it and refused to recognize the following message separately.  I try hard to
avoid that, but this one slipped through.  For those of you who get RISKS as
individual messages, Oops.  Sorry. :-(

Group questions software's reliability after Bruce Accident  
(Canadian Press)

A computer software error that released thousands of litres of radioactive
water at the Bruce nuclear station raises questions about the reliability of
software at the new Darlington station, Energy Probe says.  "This spurious
software accident at Bruce Unit 4 should be regarded as a warning about
software safety in general," Tom Adams, utility analyst with the energy
watchdog group, said yesterday.  But Ontario Hydro says the group is comparing
"apples to oranges."

The computers at Darlington have three backup systems that automatically shut
down the reactors in certain emergencies, spokesman Dave Stevens said.  The
Crown utility says a software flaw caused last week's accident, when a
mechanical fuelling machine was loading and unloading fuel bundles into reactor
Unit 4 at the Bruce station at Kincardine, near Owen Sound.  No one was injured
and neither workers nor the environment were directly contaminated by the
tritium-irradiated heavy water, which escaped from the reactor as steam.

Although Mr. Stevens said he did not know whether Hydro had anticipated such an
accident, he said the utility had contingency plans for the release of heavy
water.

A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Control Board, which regulates the safety of
the nuclear industry, described the accident as "very unusual and also very
significant" because of what could have happened.  "It has the appearance of
something that could have been worse," Zygmund Domaratzki said in a telephone
interview from Ottawa.  "If that fuelling machine had kept on going it would
have ripped the end of that channel," allowing the fuel bundles to tumble out,
Mr. Domaratzki said.  With that kind of mishap, he said, "it wouldn't take much
to cause widespread contamination within the reactor building."  As it was, the
accident cost Hydro time and money, he said.

Meanwhile, heavy water continued leaking from the Bruce reactor yesterday at
the rate of about seven litres per hour.  Workers planned to remove 13 fuel
bundles from the damaged fuel channel and retrieve the fuelling machine, still
dangling on the face of the reactor.  The unit is expected to be down for at
least six weeks.

Because two of the other three reactors at Bruce are still down, the giant
utility may have problems meeting demand if there is a severe cold snap.

Found in the British ``Guardian'' newspaper of 25 January 1990:

  ``The entire state police force in the New South Wales Australia, found
  itself driving illegal cars after an enthusiastic computer deregistered them,
  Paul Zucker reports on the Newsbytes online newsletter.  The police were
  instructed to book themselves, or each other.

  ``The problem was cause by a high ranking officer (not named) who failed to
  pay illegal parking tickets.  His unmarked car was registered to the police
  department.  After statutory warnings were ignored, the computer program
  deregistered all cars belonging to the offender: that is, all cars belonging
  to the police department.''

It may be that I am still under the influence of Dijkstra's CACM article, but
notice how the computer is given the human attribute "enthusiastic".

Subject: Fire and 753 controllers
Date: 30 Jan 90 14:25:25 GMT
[From: Neal Immega]
Organization: Shell Development Company, Bellaire Research Center, Houston, TX

Shell Development Co. had a fire in a SUN 4/280 when diodes on a
Xylogics 753 disk controller overheated and caught fire. The plastic
card guides on the Illmanite double wide to triple wide controller
also appear to have burned and may have contributed to the damage of
the two adjacent disk controller cards (which operated perfectly while
burning!). Flames four inches high were coming out of the top of the
card cage when the fire was extinguished.

This problem could have been prevented if we had been notified of the
10/10/89 field change notice from Xylogics to make a free upgrade to
all boards by adding a heatsink for the diodes. The new design has a
bronze colored strip 1.5 inch wide running the length of the card.
Xylogics said that I should have been notified by the distributor
(CITA Technologies) and CITA says that they were not told of the
problem. The Xylogics contact for this is Laurie Walker at
617-272-8140. She will need the serial number from the board (X plus 7
numbers from the back).

I am surprised that no one has pointed to the [IMHO] real error committed by
AT&amp;T: that is, upgrading all of the ESS4s to the same s/w revision at the same
time.

This exposes the network to a single error, with consequences that affect the
entire network simultaneously.

To contrast, from personal experience: I run the internal mail network in Prime
Computer, which runs SMTP mail on 3000 systems in 27 countries.  I have been
criticized for not being agressive in upgrading the revision of PDNmail (an
RFC1090 implementation) to current release.

My reason is that the network is much more robust running a range of different
versions (much like Long-Lines was, before everything was ESSn, with DLL'd s/w:
which is why this didn't happen before). Many of the systems run other software
implementations entirely, which also helps. Except when those implementations
are "ports" of the same software, witness the continuing generic sendmail
problems.  Not that anything is wrong with sendmail, per se, but there ought to
be more independent implementations-from-specification.

The resulting heterogenous network of systems is so robust that I can test new
implmentations of PDNmail by replacing the mailer on the most heavily loaded
system (!), and watching closely for several hours. (Not that I am generally
advocating this sort of thing!  "ah, Schickelgruber, you have a new version of
the master S/W?  It compiles, Ja? Sehr gut, load it on Hinsdale ... " :-)

Systemic problems with new versions become apparent after only a few systems
are using it in production service; and only affect a small part of the
network, even if undiagnosed or uncorrected for long periods of time.

&gt; Here's AT&amp;T's _official_ report on the Martin Luther King day network
&gt; problems, courtesy of the AT&amp;T Consultant Liason Program.
&gt; ...
&gt; While the software had been rigorously tested in laboratory
&gt; environments before it was introduced, the unique combination of
&gt; events that led to this problem   couldn't be   predicted.
                                    ^^^^^^^^ ^^

Don't they mean "wasn't"?  The rest of the report seems (to me) to be
reasonably detailed, well explained, and apparently honest, but this one little
dissemblance ruins the whole thing.  Is there any justification for the
assertion that the prediction was (and is) _impossible_ in these circumstances?

In RISKS 9.63, Olivier Crepin-Leblond provided a number of interesting
conclusions regarding the A320 crash at Mulhouse-Habsheim.  _Flight
International_ also leaked the commission's findings, which accord heavily with
what he translated.  It should be noted, however, that while the engines were
at comparatively high power settings at the time of impact, the flight path of
the airplane was quite unusual -- it approached the field from a high altitude,
"dirty" (flaps and landing gear extended), and with engines at *flight idle.*
It is entirely conceivable that the airplane was far behind the power curve at
the point the flight crew decided to go around; moreover, this maneuver is
unusual enough in of itself to bring into serious doubt the crew's judgement.

The altimeter issue is also interesting, but has largely been applied to the
incident after later experiences with altitude displays going haywire on IFR
approaches (including one well-publicised incident into Zurich).  In the
crash, the visibility was unlimited VFR; at low altitudes in such weather, 
one does not pay much attention to the altimeter, anyway--even in airliners.
The captain still insists that his flight instruments did him in.

Lastly, I note with some amusement the captain's new place of employment.  
Australia has been undergoing a very bitter pilot's dispute.  The largest
airline recently fired all striking pilots (which is to say, all of its 
pilots) and has been recruiting heavily overseas, offering relatively 
senior positions to anyone with even marginal qualifications.

Thanks to moraes@csri.toronto.edu for pinning down my half-remembered
quotation in the preceding segment (RISKS 9.60):
&gt; The actual quote is "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned
&gt; to repeat it." from George Santayana's "The Life of Reason".

The grandfather of all command-control-communication (C3) systems was an
air defense system called SAGE, a rather tortured acronym for Semi-
Automatic Ground Environment.  As I reported earlier in RISKS 8.74, some of
the missles that operated under SAGE had a serious social problem:  they
tended to have inadvertent erections at inappropriate times.  A more
serious problem was that SAGE, as it was built, would have worked only in
peacetime.  That seemed to suit the Air Force just fine.

SAGE was designed in the mid to late 1950s, primary by MIT Lincoln Lab,
with follow-up development by IBM and by nonprofits System Development
Corp. and Mitre Corp.  The latter two were spun off from RAND and MIT,
respectively, primarily for this task.

SAGE was clearly a technological marvel for its time, employing digitized
radar data, long distance data communications via land lines and
ground-air radio links, the largest computer (physically) built before or
since, a special-purpose nonstop timesharing system, and a large
collection of interactive display terminals.  SAGE was necessarily
designed top-down because there had been nothing like it before -- it was
about 10 years ahead of general purpose timesharing systems and 20 years
ahead of personal computers and workstations.

While the designers did an outstanding job of solving a number of
technical problems, SAGE would have been relatively useless as a defense
system if a manned bomber attack had occurred for the following reasons.

1. COUNTERMEASURES.  Each SAGE system was designed to automatically track
   aircraft within a certain geographic area based on data from several
   large radars.  While the system worked well under peacetime conditions,
   an actual manned bomber attack would likely have employed active radar
   jamming, radar decoys, and other countermeasures.  The jamming would
   have effectively eliminated radar range information and would even have
   made azimuth data imprecise, which meant that the aircraft tracking
   programs would not have worked.  In other words, this was a air defense
   system that was designed to work only in peacetime!
   (Some "Band-aids" were later applied to the countermeasures vulnerability
   problem, but a much simpler system would have worked better under expected
   attack conditions.)

2. HARDENING.  Whereas MIT had strongly recommended that the SAGE computers
   and command centers be put in hardened, underground facilities so that
   they could at least survive near misses, the "bean counters" in the Pentagon
   decided that this would be too expensive.  Instead, they specified
   above-ground concrete buildings without windows.  This was, of course,
   well suited to peacetime use.

3. PLACEMENT.  While the vulnerabilities designed into SAGE by MIT and the
   Pentagon made it relatively ineffective as a defense system, the Air
   Defense Command added a finishing blunder by siting most of the SAGE
   computer facilities in such a way that they would be bonus targets!
   This was an odd side effect of military politics and sociology, as
   discussed below.

In the 1950s, General Curtis Lemays's Strategic Air Command consistently
had first draw on the financial resources of the Defense Department.  This
was due to the ongoing national paranoia regarding Soviet aggression and
some astute politicking by Lemay and his supporters.  One thing that Lemay
insisted on for his elite SAC bases was that they have the best Officers
Clubs around.

MIT had recommended that the SAGE computer facilities be located remotely,
away from both cities and military bases, so that they would not be bonus
targets in the event of an attack.  When the Air Defense Command was
called upon to select SAGE sites, however, they realized that their people
would not enjoy being assigned to the boondocks, so they decided to put
the SAGE centers at military bases instead.

Following up on that choice, the Air Defense Command looked for military
bases with the best facilities, especially good O-clubs.  Sure enough, SAC
had the best facilities around, so they put many of the SAGE sites on SAC
bases.  Given that SAC bases would be prime targets in any manned bomber
attack, the SAGE centers thus became bonus targets that would be destroyed
without extra effort.  Thus the peacetime lifestyle interests of the
military were put ahead of their defense responsibilities.

SAGE might be regarded as successful in the sense that no manned bomber
attack occurred during its life and that it might have served as a
deterrant to those considering an attack.  There were reports that the
Soviet Union undertook a similar experimental development in the same time
period, though that story may have been fabricated by Air Force
intelligence units to help justify investment in SAGE.  In any case, the
Russians didn't deploy such a system, either because they lacked the
capability to build a computerized, centralized "air defense" system such
as SAGE or had the good sense not to expend their resources on such a
vulnerable kludge.

(Next segment: command-control catches on.)

The sendmail problem to which our moderator frequently refers is
actually a design problem in the SMTP protocol (that sendmail
implements) and so is well within the domain of RISKS discussions.
Especially since the design problem has been recognized since at least
1983, but SMTP is so entrenched that the problem has never been fixed.

The way in which SMTP sends a message is, roughly:

	1. Send message headers to server, etc. &amp; get responses
	2. Send DATA keyword to server &amp; get affirmative response
	3. Send entire message to server with no response
	4. Send "." to Server
	5. WAIT UNTIL SERVER HAS DELIVERED MESSAGE AND RESPONDS.

[5] is the problem.  At any given time during [5], there are two
possibilities.  Either the server has crashed and will never send an
answer, or the server is still in the process of transmitting the mail. 

There is NO WAY for the sender to tell the difference between these
two possibilities.  This is because:

	a. SMTP presumes that TCP is reliable, so it doesn't allow
	   the sender to retransmit anything.  Hence, the sender can't
	   send any data during the wait in [5] to find out if the
	   server is still alive.

	b. TCP, to be efficient for long lived connections, does
	   not guarantee continual monitoring of the connection.  If
	   TCP has no data to send, it never sends any data (except
	   for the Berkeley-derived keep-alive option, which are not
	   part of the TCP spec, but see below).

	c. EVEN IF TCP did monitor the connection, the SMTP process
	   could die or go into an infinite loop without resetting
	   the TCP connection.  (You can't catch this
	   case: Halting Problem).  I can vaguely remember
	   hearing of this happening in 1983.

I truly believe this problem is unsolvable, without changing SMTP.  The
Programming Marines, who build and sell systems must solve it anyway.  Or
alleviate it, anyway.

The ad-hoc solution is to set a timeout; assume the message takes no more than
time T to process by the server, so if the sender waits for 2T or so, the
server must have crashed.  This helps, but it clearly doesn't solve the
problem, since the sender has no metric by which to judge T except the length
of the message.

For example, a message transmitted to a Large, Risky Mailing List might take an
order of magnitude longer to process than a simple user-to-user message.
Hence, it is likely that messages to large mailing lists will tend to fail with
the sender timing out and resetting the connection; this condition is noticed
by the server AFTER transmitting at least part of the message.  The sender
later retries, so you get multiple messages.  Very many messages, if you are
unlucky, or its a Monday or you moderate a very large and risky mailing list.

(BTW, it was decided in SMTP's design that it was better to have multiple
messages than to have messages get lost, so it is not considered acceptable for
the SMTP server to queue the message but not deliver it during the pause in
[5]).

The general problem: building functionality on top of a "reliable
system" does not GUARANTEE that the result is reliable.  The
reliability must, in some way, be verified by the topmost level.

Hence, you balance your bank statement to make sure your checks (cheques.uk)
were really cashed shortly after you sent them off, and you look for cancel
checks if you get a red notice from a bill you sent off.

It is now possible for you to file your income tax return electronically.  Yes,
you.  Of course the IRS will not accept it directly from you; they only deal
with "tax preparers' like H&amp;R Block, the owners of CompuServe.  Not to worry.
There are value-added re-sellers who will accept your return from you, check it
and forward it to the IRS.  I have seen ads now from two different such
re-sellers: "Nelco" and "Nexus Direct."

PGN's misgivings to the contrary notwithstanding, it is not likely to open up
the IRS's computers to tampering by taxpayers.  From their point of view it is
as safe as having you send it to them by snailmail and a lot cheaper than
key-entering it themselves.

From the taxpayers' point of view, it is a great deal safer than putting
it in the snailmail and having it transcribed by a temp at the IRS.  Of
course, a copy of your return can end up in the computers of the
services.  On the other hand, that happens whenever you deal with a tax
preparer.  That has only marginally impacted the success of H&amp;RB.

Incidentally, when you file with H&amp;RB, or any number of other preparers,
they offer to give you your refund on the spot.  It is really in the
form of a loan, but the loan is re-paid directly to them by the IRS.
The IRS likes this arrangement because they can pay the refund by
EFT/EDI.  Not only do they not handle the paper return, but they do not
have to prepare a check for the refund.   It is almost as if the IRS has
opened thousands of offices across the country where they will prepare
your return for you and give you your refund on the spot.  Of course,
since it is for-profit, it may be a little more efficient.

Who pays?  Well who always pays?  At least there are some choices.

How about it H&amp;RB?  How long will it be before I can "GO 1040" on
CompuServe?

&gt;&gt; While the software had been rigorously tested in laboratory

&gt;
&gt; Don't they mean "wasn't"?  The rest of the report seems (to me) to
&gt; be reasonably detailed, well explained, and apparently honest, but
&gt; this one little dissemblance ruins the whole thing.  Is there any
&gt; justification for the assertion that the prediction was (and is)
&gt; _impossible_ in these circumstances?

   I noticed this too.  On reflection, though, I'm sort of glad that they said
it this way.  Of course this error could have been predicted.  Any particular
error could be predicted, if the right person looked at it at the right time.
But what *is* impossible is to predict all errors, all of the time, with
probability 1.  So, if you interpret the above statement above as, "The event
occurred randomly in a situation where the probability of such errors could not
be reduced to zero," then I think it is a reasonable description of the truth.

   Certainly it is a better reaction than the other common thing that one sees
in these press statements, which is something like, "Steps are being taken to
ensure that no similar outage can ever occur again."  This is an unrealistic
and false reaction which would cause me, at least, far more concern than the
AT&amp;T reaction.  Of course they will try to prevent such problems.  But it is
equally obvious that the probability of such events will remain positive.

Coming back from London about a year ago I was seated next to a pilot
from a Munich based company who flew 757s. He'd overshot his flying time
and was heading back to Munich from Kenya over London. We talked about the
Airbus crash and it seems that in pilot circles it was attributed to the
fact that the older Airbus machines had Rolls-Royce engines. It seems that
when given full power they reacted about 3 seconds faster that those on
the A320. In his opinion these three seconds were vital. Needless to say,
the A320 pilot was familiar with the older model(s) and this may have played
a role in his judgement. On a side note the pilot also mentioned that the
757, which also has the fly by wire system, sometimes "hangs". The only
way to get the electronics to function again is to power cycle the lot.

We reported earlier on the diskettes containing a destructive Trojan horse
program.  Something like 20,000 disks were mailed from London around 11
December 1989.  When executed, it trashed PCs in at least Britain, Norway,
Sweden, Belgium, Denmark and California.

Joseph W. Popp, 39, a zoologist from the Cleveland area, has been arrested in
Ohio on a federal fugitive warrant, and charged by Scotland Yard in London with
blackmail and extortion.  In court in Cleveland, Popp told U.S. Magistrate
Joseph W. Bartunek he is under a psychiatrist's care and must take drugs for a
mental condition.  The judge has scheduled psychiatric evaluation prior to any
further hearing.  Popp apparently (has/had?) worked for the World Health
Organization.

Les Earnest's posting on SAGE reminded me of an anecdote James Fallows tells
in his book, NATIONAL DEFENSE (Vintage Books, 1982, p. 59):

  "As a child in California, I grew up five miles from SAGE headquarters at
  Norton Air Force Base.  Each year our classes would take school field trips
  to Norton.  The dramatic conclusion came when we were ushered into the SAGE
  control room.  The commanding general would appear at this point and attempt
  a demonstration of how quickly and reliably his system worked.  In every
  instance I can remember, there was a technical screw-up of some kind, and the
  general would lead us out, assuring us that, heh heh, this sort of thing did
  not happen very often."

Much of Fallows' book is a critique of technically complex weapons systems,
which many readers of this digest would find interesting.  Fallows summarizes
the SAGE story this way (also on p. 59):

  "Wouldn't it be wonderful if, instead of leaving aerial combat to a group of
  pilots trying to figure it out for themselves which enemy planes to destroy,
  the whole enterprise could be automatically controlled from the ground?  If
  you had a huge radar and computer complex, it might be able to identify all
  the "friendly" and "enemy" planes in the sky and rationally distribute
  assignments for shooting them.  Then it could transmit commands to each
  fighter plane, guiding it precisely to its target.  Visions of this sort lay
  behind a $20 billion radar complex of the sixties known as SAGE --- which,
  after countless revisions, finally foundered due to the technical complexity
  of devising a computer program that could keep the friendly and enemy planes
  straight.  Nonetheless, the Air Force and Navy have invested further billions
  in radar planes known as the AWACS and E-2, which face the far greater
  technical challenge of doing the same thing from a single plane in the air."

In a footnote Fallows says more of the technical difficulties of distinguishing
friend from foe:

  "The real problem was that since planes in a dogfight fly in unpredictable
  patterns, when two "blips" from two planes crossed on the radar screens the
  computer could not be sure which plane was which when they separated again.
  ..."

(Fallows doesn't give a source for this explanation of the foundering of SAGE;
the more usual explanation is that SAGE became obsolete after the Soviet Union
concentrated on aiming ICBM's, rather than manned bombers, at the continental
U.S.A.  I remember a local news story around 1982 saying they were finally
shutting down the SAGE installation at McChord Air Force Base near Seattle,
Washington).

DOD PLAN ADDRESSES SOFTWARE PROBLEMS by Brian Robinson

Washington - The Defense Department is expected to go public next month with an
ambitious plan aimed at solving its growing software problems.  The product of
an agency-wide collaboration, the plan represents the first time the Pentagon
has managed to get a broad consensus on the issue.

The master plan, to be implemented over five years, will tackle the rapidly 
expanding size and development costs of defense software, a problem made worse 
by the tendency of different groups within the Pentagon to go their separate
ways when it comes to software requirements.

Some 20 groups within the defense community reportedly took part, including the
Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Communications Agency, National Security Agency,
and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

The plan covers six major topics: software acquisition and life cycle
management, government software policies, organizational coordination and
cooperation, personnel, the software technology base and software technology
transition. ...

Pentagon analysts have predicted growing problems as military systems expand
in size and complexity and as projects are developed that require programs
with many millions of lines of code, the Strategic Defense Initiative 
being the prime example. ...

A House investigations subcommittee report late last year accused the Defense
Department and other federal agencies of putting lives at risk and wasting 
billions of dollars with substandard software ...

The National Research Council also condemned the current state of sofware and
development practices, contending that researchers in government and industry
had not kept up with the development of complex software systems.

The DoD will collect public comments on the plan at a forum April 3 -- 5 in 
Falls Church, VA.

(The article does not mention who, or which agency, was the source of this
story.  The article also does not mention any of the DoD agencies and projects
already charged with this problem, including STARS, SEI, AJPO, or the 1987
Defense Science Board study).

Anyone who is interested in technology as a cultural phenomenon will probably
want to read the following book:

C. A. Bowers, The Cultural Dimensions of Educational Computing: Understanding
the Non-Neutrality of Technology, Teacher's College Press, 1988.

It is often said that computers are neutral in that, like pencils and hammers,
they can be used for either good or evil.  This might be true on some possible
interpretations, but Bowers argues that it is false on a long list of others.
Specifically, he argues that particular computer systems for education often
incorporate unarticulated assumptions about computers, about thinking, about
society, and about the relations among these things, and that the use of these
systems can inculcate or reinforce the uncritical, even unwitting acceptance
of those assumptions by students and teachers alike.  He gives many examples,
and his arguments seem to me to apply equally well to a wide variety of other
applications of computers.  In developing his arguments, he touches on a wide
variety of critiques of technology and of computation as social phenomena.
Although he has done a valuable public service in presenting these ideas in
accessible ways, the principal weak spot of the book is a sometimes excessive
credulity toward the critiques themselves, which are not of uniform quality.
Reading him thus calls for a critical and selective attitude as well as an
open mind, but then it is exactly his point that we should bring such an
attitude to everything that concerns technology.  Highly recommended.

Recent continuation of the Vincennes controversy in the Naval press
spurs an observation:

     When faced with a catastrophic failure, the non-computer naval
     community is analyzing the system specifications and comparing
     them with the actions taken (albeit non-mathematically).  When
     faced with the same catastrophe, the RISKS community utterly
     ignored the specifications and lept into discussion of potential
     software flaws and changes.  This from a group where proof of
     conformance to specification has a strong following.

By specifications I refer not to the engineering documents used in building the
shipboard equipment.  I mean the laws and treaties governing the behaviour of
combatant and non-combatant in areas of conflict.  They did and do have direct
relevance to the computer systems.

There have been at least five relevant treaties covering such behaviour in the
last century.  There is a tremendous literature exploring issues and
alternatives.  Situations like the Vincennes are explicitly explored and
analyzed.  These are the recognized specifications for how all parties should
behave.

I am not interested in renewing controversy over the events.  Parties
interested in the relevant treaties and laws might start with the overview in
_International Law for Seagoing Officers_, Roberts, and branch out from there
into details and current discussions.

I am interested in some introspective analysis of why the computer community of
RISKS totally ignored the specifications.  Understanding this behaviour can
lead to understanding a common failure mode of computer systems.

Was it ignorance?  If so, why no requests for information?  Why such
willingness to proceed in ignorance?

Was it fear that the discussion of treaty and law might degenerate into
political arguments?  If so, how can systems involving political sensitivity be
subject to specification and analysis?

Was it other group dynamics?  If so, how can these be controlled productively?
(In my own case I would place this as dominant.  I became interested in the
discussions and overlooked the growing irrelevancy.  Furthermore, the group
dynamic discouraging radical departures from the current topic of discussion
made me hesitate to change topics.)

What other factors were involved?

I can think of only one invalid excuse.  Unlike most systems, these
specifications are readily available to the public world wide.

&gt;From Telephony, Jan 22, 1990 p11:
&gt;
&gt;    The problem began the afternoon of Jan 15 when a piece of trunk
&gt;    interface equipment developed internal problems for reasons that
&gt;    have yet to be determined.

An interesting twist to this: several members of the media have gotten phone
calls from a rogue hacker claiming that he and a few friends had broken into
the NYC switch and were "looking around" at the time of the incident.

This raises two interesting (at least to me) possibilities: 

  1) They had, indeed, broken in, and were responsible for the crash.
     (Don't blindly accept published statements from AT&amp;T that it
     was all a simple glitch.  Stories told off-the-record by law
     enforcement personnel and telco security indicate this kind of
     break-in is common.)

     If this is true, what to do from here?  Obviously, this raises
     some major security questions about how best to protect our phone
     systems.  It also raises some interesting social/legal questions.
     The nationwide losses here are probably greater than the Internet
     Worm, but the Federal Computer Crime and abuse act don't cover it
     (only one system tampered with).  Other laws maybe cover it, but
     is there any hope of proving it and prosecuting?

  2) These guys were not on the machine but are trying to get the
     press to publish their names as the ones responsible.  This would
     greatly enhance their image in the cracker/phreaker community.
     It's akin to having the Islamic Jihad call up and claim that a
     suicide caller had crashed the system (to protest dial-a-prayer
     and dial-a-porn, perhaps; remember that the Great Satan is a
     local call from NYC :-).   It raises interesting questions about how
     the press should handle such claims, and how we should react to them.

A third possibility exists, of course, that those guys had hacked into the
switch, but they had nothing to do with the failure.  That raises both sets of
questions.

I worry that it won't be long before this kind of thing happens and the phone
calls ARE from some terrorist group claiming responsibility: "We are holding
your dial tone hostage until you get your troops out of Panama, make abortion
illegal, stop killing animals for fur, and prevent Peter Neumann from making
more puns."

Or, perhaps AT&amp;T security gets a call like: "We've planted a logic bomb in the
switching code.  Put $1 million in small unmarked bills in the following locker
at the bus station, or in 4 hours every call made in Boston will get routed to
dial-a-porn numbers in NYC.  We'll tell you how to fix it as soon as we get the
money."

Any bets that something like this will happen this year?  Last year's WANK worm
and politically-motivated viruses seem to suggest the time is ripe.

I would like to make a comment regarding the AT&amp;T incident. 

I want to state clearly that I work for Bell-Northern Research. We are the R&amp;D
arm of Northern Telecom, which happens to be in hot competition with AT&amp;T. In
particular, I work on the DMS switches, for which 4ESS is the prime
competition.  In no way do I represent the official views of BNR or NT. What
follows is strictly the observations of a computer professional.

The article does not answer the key question:

   How can such a simple and REPRODUCIBLE bug be released to the
   field? Especially in such a critical arena?

Note that a number of things had to happen:

 1) The failure of a single piece of equipment turns into the
    (perceived) failure of all equipment at the same site. Thus,
    "Multiplying" the problem.

    I.e., recovery of a single trunk ends up sending messages out through
    ALL trunks.

 2) Recovery action of "healthy" sites ends up "Spreading" the problem.

    The recovery of a truck should not cause the collapse of the whole site.

 3) Testing does not catch the problem.

    The problem is reproducible and should have been caught in a pre-release
    simulated real-life testing of the error recovery system.

All of these are likely flaws are in any system. Error recovery is rarely
needed - on most systems, you just reboot the machine or just logoff/logon to
your account again. As a result, most people don't think about error recovery
much less test it. Unfortunately, error recovery is very difficult to design
and even harder to test.

It is not an SMTP requirement to complete delivery between receipt of the "."
signifying the end of the message and returning the "250 OK" message.  It is
perfectly valid to simply store the message and return the OK; you do NOT have
to deliver in real time while the sender waits.

That sendmail often does this is perhaps a common flaw, but don't confuse it
with any RFC requirement!  It's valid to accept the message and mail back a
delivery failure later.  Probably sendmail should do that.

The most common cause of long waits is expanding mailing lists;
sometimes this takes so long that the sender times out and resends the
message on the assumption that it's failed.  However, the recipient
sendmail believes it to have succeeded, so lots of people gets lots of
copies of the message until such time as the network environment lets
things happen within the timeout limits.

We at UCSD have most of our mailing lists explode in deferred time so
that an incoming message for one of them is just stored and immediately
acknowledged.  It is then delivered later.

Another common reason for long waits between "." and "250 OK" is the
time taken to process headers; if that invokes calls to the system
nameserver to look something up in the DNS, there might well be a
delay.  That's not good planning but lots of people do it.

Sending sites probably ought to have their timeout set to around 15
minutes to a couple of hours to avoid these problems, at least until
sendmail is fixed.

Finally, sendmail has a tendency to do invalid longjumps on timeouts of
various kinds: occasionally the stack is buggered and the longjump
winds up causing it to die horribly, leaving the list of delivered
addresses un-updated.  Then the next queue run happens and the people
early on the list get the message again and again and again....

I've heard rumors of a patch to sendmail that makes it checkpoint the
delivery list (the qf file) after every successful delivery.  That
solves that problem, but it's really a bandaid on the bad longjump
problem.  I don't have a copy of that patch.

I know people swear at sendmail; it's a difficult program to understand
and it's been worked on by a lot of people, so some degree of bit-rot
has indeed set in.  But I'm pleased that it works as well as it does.
It just happens to be one of those programs that causes maximum user
annoyance when it goes wrong.

I would rephrase the SMTP problem slightly, and draw different conclusions:

After the message terminator ("." CRLF) has been sent, there are three
possible states:

1.  The server SMTP crashes before accepting responsibility for delivery
    (defined by receipt of an OK code at the client SMTP).
2.  The server SMTP crashes after accepting responsibility for delivery
    but before it can deliver the OK code to the client SMTP.
3.  The server SMTP doesn't crash.

What makes this bad is that during synchronous delivery, the final
acceptance OK code isn't returned until the server SMTP has delivered
the message to its recipients.  If the recipient is really an address
exploder, some addresses may be processed to completion before the
server SMTP crashes.  This is a state 1 condition because the server
SMTP has implicitly accepted responsibility for delivery to *some* of
the recipients of the message, but not yet all.

There is also a vulnerable window in state 2 above.  You would think
that the window is very small, but there is ample opportunity for a
swapout or some other act-of-God delay in the execution of the
acknowledgement delivery, during which time the server can crash.

Both of these seem to happen more frequently that people thought.

# (BTW, it was decided in SMTP's design that it was better to have multiple
# messages than to have messages get lost, so it is not considered acceptable
# for the SMTP server to queue the message but not deliver it [synchronously]).

On the contrary, the server SMTP may do anything it wants as long as it
takes responsibility for delivery of the message.  In particular this
means using asynchronous delivery, after simply queueing the message to
decrease the vulnerable window (of state 1).  Some people like the 'real-time'
feedback of synchronous delivery, but it is a dangerous thing to like
given the cost.

There are economic arguments for doing synchronous address verification
in the SMTP protocol (if you are on a volume-charged network, you don't
want to transfer the message data until you know the server SMTP knows
what to do with the message), but doing so also leads to instability on
client SMTP computers as queues build up waiting for a slow server.

Barring economic/bandwidth issues, in message transfer the HOT ROCK
model is very appropriate: you try to get rid of a queued message as
quickly as possible, by almost any means.  This requires asynchronous
checking and delivery in server SMTPs.

See also RFC1047 by Craig Partridge on "Duplicate messages and SMTP".

Thanks for your message.

 &gt;      It is not an SMTP requirement to complete delivery between receipt of
 &gt;      the "." signifying the end of the message and returning the "250 OK"
 &gt;      message.

I stand corrected.  The problem I bring up is in the design of the
protocol and the consequent generalization to software design.  It
would be different if the protocol spec SPECIFIED that no processing
was to be done during this time.  That would certainly diminish the
problem, and one could make the valid argument that this fixes the
problem "enough." After all, by the same top-level reliability
argument, SMTP itself can never guarantee truly reliable mail (only
the sender and recipient of the mail can do that). 

 &gt;      Another common reason for long waits between "." and "250 OK" is the
 &gt;      time taken to process headers; if that invokes calls to the system
 &gt;      NAMESERVER to look something up in the DNS, there might well be a
 &gt;      delay.  That's not good planning but lots of people do it.

(my emphasis added) That one is interesting, since SMTP (and, I admit,
my significant exposure to it) somewhat predates domain naming.  An
example where a lingering bug in a design is made worse by changing
system requirements. 

 &gt;      I know people swear at sendmail.

I'm not one of them.  Although I hate debugging sendmail scripts as
much as the next system type, I'd much rather do that than deal with
binary distribution software that is non-configurable.  After all, my
systems requirements change from time to time, too.

I never knew of such a design decision.  It's certainly not applicable
to the mail on the Internet today, considering that the domain system
allows mail to be sent to hosts on networks not directly connected to
the Internet.  Queueing is inevitable since there is no way for the
SMTP-server to wait for final delivery on a network that does not
support notification of that event.

RFC 821, page 2:

   When the recipients have been negotiated the SMTP-sender sends the
   mail data, terminating with a special sequence.  If the SMTP-receiver
   successfully processes the mail data it responds with an OK reply.

Note the word used is "processes", not "delivers".

The RFC also specifies that if the server finds that it can deliver to
some of the recipients but not others, then it should respond with an OK
reply, but also compose and send an "undeliverable mail" notification
message back to the original sender of the message.

If I were writing an SMTP-server I would take take the above as an
invitation to queue the message after doing a cursory check of the
recipient addresses, send an OK reply, and dispose of the message at
leisure, sending error notifications as necessary.

Certainly Geof Cooper's problem is inherent in SMTP, but I assumed that PGN's

each outgoing mail message as a pair of files, a qfXXX file listing headers and
recipients and a dfXXX file listing the mail body (where the two values of XXX
match).  Sendmail processes an outgoing mail request by locking the qf/df pair
(well, the XXX value) and attempting delivery to each of the recipients listed
in the qfXXX file.  When it's made an attempt on each recipient, it writes a
new qfXXX file recording the recipients to which the mail has yet to be
delivered.

In our environment, sendmail executions got interrupted all the time: we
rebooted our mail-handling servers daily, and our sendmail processes would get
stuck on an SMTP connection for all kinds of reasons.  Thus, when our sendmail
would start processing a message with many recipients, its run would often be
interrupted before it had made a complete pass through all the recipients; in
such cases, it would never record the fact that delivery was successful to any
of the recipients.  The next time sendmail started processing that long list of
recipients, it would try 'em all again: bingo, duplicates.

My solution was to have sendmail update the qfXXX file (containing the list of
recipients) after every successful delivery.  This required a little
source-code hacking, but it was very helpful for us.  Not only did we stop
generating lots of duplicate mail, but we also reduced our mail-processing load
so that processing of those many-recipient lists would terminate!

  Subject: Risks of Voicemail systems that expect a human at the other end

  Last night my car had a dead battery (I left the lights on -- something that
  a very simple piece of digital circuitry could have prevented...

Yes, indeed.  And the first time that piece of circuitry failed in any
interesting, amusing, or dangerous way, 40 people would send articles to RISKS
deploring the inexorable trend toward technological overkill in today's
society, suggesting how dumb the engineers were to have replaced the good, old
fashioned manual switches, and pointing out how that sort of failure NEVER
happened with manual switches.

They would of course be right (manual switches fail differently) and they
would have forgotten all the dead batteries that didn't happen.

Three morals:

    Accidents that don't happen rarely make it into the papers, the
    public consciousness, or get factored into the ire over failures.

    As Don Norman put it rather nicely a while back, the baseline on any
    technology isn't zero defects.  Nothing is perfect now, and for any
    change the relevant question is how it works, how it fails, and whether
    on balance it's better than what we had; not whether it's perfect.

    There is no free lunch: if you want the convenience, you have to accept
    the attendant, inevitable risks.

Applying this to the phone system failure, the only perfectly reliable
communication medium is none at all; you have to be in the same room with
someone.  If you want to be someplace else and talk to them, you have to accept
the risk of malfunction.  And you want direct dial international calls, call
waiting, one-touch memory dialing, conference calls, and call forwarding, too?
Then accept the risks inherent in increased complexity that inevitably come
along.  It won't be perfect, but you might be better off than you were.

In _Risks Digest_ 9.66 Phil Agre recommends _The Cultural Dimensions of
Educational Computing: Understanding the Non-Neutrality of Technology_
by C. A. Bowers.  Agre's succinct summary begins:

&gt; It is often said that computers are neutral in that, like pencils and
&gt; hammers, they can be used for either good or evil.  This might be true
&gt; on some possible interpretations, but Bowers argues that it is false on
&gt; a long list of others. ...

Like many scholars who examine our emerging electronic culture, Bowers is
running 25 years behind Marshall McLuhan.  Here is McLuhan on the subject of
"neutrality":

	    In accepting an honorary degree from the University of
	Notre Dame a few years ago, General David Sarnoff [head of RCA
	--gls] made this statement: "We are too prone to make techno-
	logical instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who
	wield them.  The products of modern science are not in them-
	selves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines
	their value." That is the voice of the current somnambulism.
	Suppose we were to say, "Apple pie is in itself neither good nor
	bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value." ...
	There is nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear scru-
	tiny, for it ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all
	media, in the true Narcissus style of one hypnotized by the
	amputation and extension of his own being in a new technical
	form. ... It has never occurred to General Sarnoff that any
	technology could do anything but _add_ itself on to what we
	already are.
		_Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man_ (1964)

To be fair to Bowers, he may be aware of McLuhan's work.  I have not yet read
Bowers's book so I cannot say.  I _can_ say that most of the writers I have
read who expound on the unforeseen implications of the electronic age are
thoroughly insensible to the unseen implications of the age of print.  The risk
is that we may regard a necessary consequence of electronic culture as a "risk"
to be prevented by suitable countermeasures, because it offends the
sensibilities we acquired from print culture.

(Continuing from RISKS 9.65)

As the U.S. Air Force committed itself to the developement of the SAGE air
defense system in the late 1950s, new weapons that did not require centralized
guidance came to be rejected, even though some appeared to be less vulnerable
to countermeasures than those that depended on SAGE.  An example was a very
fast, long range interceptor called the F-109 that was to carry a radar that
would enable it to locate bombers at a considerable distance and attack them.
As such, it did not need an elaborate ground-based computer control system.

My group at MIT Lincoln Lab had been responsible for integrating earlier
interceptors and missles into SAGE.  We subsequently joined Mitre Corporation
when it was formed from Lincoln Lab's rib and were later assigned the
responsibility for examining how the F-109 interceptor might be used.

I had assumed that the Air Force was genuinely interested in seeing how the
F-109 could best function in air defense.  Accordingly, we worked out a plan in
which the interceptors that were in service would be deployed to various
airfields, both civilian and military, so as to make them less vulnerable to
attack.  This dispersal together with their ability to function with minimal
information about the locations of attacking bombers appeared to offer a rather
resiliant air defense capability that could survive even the destruction of the
vulnerable SAGE system.

When we published a utilization plan for the F-109 based on these ideas, The
Air Force made it clear that we had reached the "wrong" conclusion -- we were
supposed to prove that it was a bad idea.  We apparently had been chosen to
"study" it because, as designers of SAGE, we were expected to oppose any
defensive weapons that would not need SAGE.

In order to deal with the embarrassing outcome of this study, a Colonel was
commissioned to write a refutation that confirmed the ongoing need for
centralized computer control.  The Air Force insisted that anyone who requested
our report must also get a copy of the refutation.  Mitre necessarily acceded.
In any case, the F-109 was never built in quantity.

			The seductive image

Though the designers of SAGE came to recognize its weaknesses and
vulnerabilities and the Air Force should have been reluctant to build more
systems of the same type, it somehow came to be regarded as the model of what
the next generation of military control systems should be.  Never mind that it
was essentially useless as a defense system -- it looked good!

The upper floor of each SAGE command center had a large room with subdued
lighting and dozens of large display terminals, each operated by two people.
Each terminal had a small storage-tube display for tabular reference data, a
large CRT display of geographical and aircraft information (with a flicker
period of just over one second!), and a light gun for pointing at particular
features.  Each terminal also had built-in reading lights, telephone/intercoms,
and electric cigar lighters.  This dramatic environment with flickering
phosphorescent displays clearly looked to the military folks like the right
kind of place to run a war.  Or just to "hang out."

Downstairs was the mighty AN/FSQ-7 computer, designed by MIT using the
latest and greatest technology available and constructed by IBM.  It had:

o  A dual-processor nonstop timesharing system.  The off-line computer was
   usually either undergoing preventive maintenance or was following the
   actions of the online computer so that it would be ready to take over if
   that machine failed.  In this respect it was similar to the commercial
   nonstop systems developed much later by Tandem and its followers.

o  The computer was composed of rows of glimmering vacuum tubes spread over
   an area about the size of a football field, with lots of large magnetic
   drums used both for secondary storage and as communications buffers.
   (Magnetic disks had not yet been perfected.)

o  It used the recently-invented magnetic core memories in the largest
   and fastest configuration yet built: 256K bytes with 6 microsecond
   cycle time.  Each of the two main memories was packed into the volume
   of a shower stall, a remarkable density for that period.

o  A gigantic air conditioning system was required to suck all the heat out
   of the monsterous computer.

Remarkably, all of this new technology worked rather well.  There were some
funny discoveries along the way, though.  For example, in doing preventive
maintenance checks on tubes, a technician found one that was completely dead
that had not been detected by the diagnostics.  Upon further examination it was
discovered that this tube didn't do anything!  This minor blunder no doubt
arose during one of the many redesigns of the machine.

Both the prototype and operational SAGE centers were frequently visited by
military brass, higher level bureaucrats, and members of Congress.  They
generally seemed to be impressed by the image of powerful, central control that
this leading-edge technological marvel had.  Of course, General Lemay and his
Strategic Air Command could not sit by and let another organization develop
advanced computer technology when SAC didn't have any.

In short order the SAC Control System was born.  Never mind that there was not
much for it to do -- it had to be at least as fancy as SAGE.  When the full
name was written out, it became Strategic Air Command Control System.  The
chance juxtaposition of "Command" and "Control" in this name somehow conjured
up a deeper meaning in certain military minds.

In short order, Command-Control Systems became a buzz word and a horde of
development projects was started based on this "concept."  The Air Force
Systems Command soon realized that it had discovered a growth industry and
reorganized accordingly.  The specifications for the new C2 systems generally
contained no quantitative measures of performance that were to be met -- the
presumption seemed to be that whatever was being done already could be done
faster and better by using computers!  How wrong they were.

(Next segment: Command-control takes off)

change in the military in his lifetime was the change in ROEs, whereby U.S.
ships now fired first instead of waiting for a confirmed attack.  He stated

In RISKS 8.46, Paul Eggert summarized M. Mitchell Waldrop's article "Will
the Hubble Space Telescope Compute?" which appeared in 'Science' magazine
17 March 1989, pp 1437-1439.  

The story said "critical operations software is still a mess  -- the victim
of primitive programming methods and chaotic project management."
Supposedly completed in 1986, bugs were still turning up as fast as the
programmers could fix them, and the system, the $70 million Science
Operations Ground System (SOGS),  ran at only one-third optimum speed.
According to the article, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the
program managers, were counting on faster computers plus better algorithms
plus some (unspecified) AI techniques to fix SOGS.  They were confident
that SOGS would be ready when the telescope was launched.

Last week, the 'Los Angeles Times' ran a lengthy story about the Space
Telescope, but the article did not mention the software.  I called the
reporter, and he said that he had been at the Space Telescope Science
Institute along with other reporters including Waldrop.  He says that
Waldrop and others did indeed bring up questions about the software, and
they were simply told that it's all fine now.  We'll soon see.  The Hubble
Space Telescope is to be launched from the shuttle in an upcoming mission.

Reading between the lines of the AT&amp;T pronouncements on the Jan-15 failure,
it sounds to me (as a systems programmer) that the "bug" was a reentrancy
problem.  Specifically, the recovery routine was not reentrant.  Under the
old way of handing recovery, a single "I'm OK" message would indicate that
the previously failed switch was back in service; in the new scheme, the
recovery of the failed switch was signalled when new call-setup messages
started flooding in, causing the recovery routine to be reentered.

This is sheer speculation on my part; can anyone out there who is "in the
know" either confirm or deny this speculation?

In a paper entitled "Assuring Quality and Reliability of Complex Electronic
Systems: Hardware and Software", published in the January 1988 Proceedings of
the IEEE, Edwin A. Irland (who has a whole list of past work for Bell Labs and
related companies and whose current position (according to the reprint I have)
is as the Assistant Vice President of Switching Analysis and Reliability
Technology for Bellcore in Red Bank, NJ) writes the following, which I think is
very much apropos:

  ... The subtlety of these methods implies an important source of
  unreliability; unreliable error recovery.  Thus it is important that
  system testing pay meticulous attention to fault simulation to
  uncover weaknesses in the recovery.  Data taken on electronic
  switching systems show that failure to recover from simplex faults
  is usually a significant source of total outage time....

A "significant source" indeed...

  Subject: DILLARD'S VIOLATING CONFIDENTIALITY - PUBLISHING EMPLOYEE SSN'S
  Newsgroups: misc.consumers,misc.headlines,misc.legal,dfw.general
  Summary: Sanctions possible against employees who don't comply
  Keywords: publish, social security numbers, invasion of privacy

On February 4, 1990, Dillard's Department Stores (headquartered in Little Rock,
Arkansas) began using employee's personal Social Security numbers for their
employee I.D. and sales associate numbers.  These Social Security numbers are
visible and, for the time-being, NOT "scrambled" enabling any customer to
obtain the Social Security number of any sales associate.

Dillard's plan is to begin "scrambling" the numbers anywhere from two weeks to
a month according to various sources.  After this process, "nobody will be able
to identify [the number] as a Social Security number" according to Ed Auffert,
Assistant to the General Counsel.  Mr. Auffert added that after the scrambling
"gen" has been added to the system, all employees will be required to use their
Social Security numbers.

According to a memorandum distributed to all employees recently, employees
"must" use their "nine-digit sales numbers" in order to "insure credit for
sales rung."  The memorandum states that the "terminals will accept three-digit
sales numbers" in the interim.  In store announcements and other management
sources at the Dillard's Department Store at Northpark Center in Dallas have
indicated that sales data may not be accurate on employees continuing to use
their older three-digit sales codes.  Since this data is used to evaluate
employee performance, this could mean that employees not desiring to divulge
their Social Security numbers to the public could eventually be disciplined or
discharged.  When contacted personally, Northpark store manager Peter Rodriquez
confirmed that employees might be "disciplined" for choosing not to use their
personal Social Security numbers even in the interim period (prior to computer
"scrambling" of the employee's SSN).  After being advised of the intent to use
this information as part of a Usenet article, he refused to comment any further
and referred further contact to W.R. "Bob" Applebee a regional director for
Dillard's in Fort Worth Texas.

Mr. Applebee, when contacted by phone, stated emphatically that the "policy (on
the use of Social Security numbers until the encryption was complete) had been
rescinded."  He stated that at present no employees "anywhere in the Dillard's
store system" were using their Social Security numbers.  Further, Mr. Applebee
stated that these numbers were "not visible on any printed cash register
receipts."  Contrary to Mr. Applebee's claims, a subsequent check of the
Dillard's store in Northpark Center produced several receipts with employee
Social Security numbers clearly visible as the sales I.D.

As to the "encryption" method to be used, Dillards officials were unable to
provide any details.  At least one source familiar with this project feels that
it would be possible to decrypt these numbers if comparisons could be made
against other encrypted Social Security numbers.

For the mean time, Dillards officials maintain that there is "nothing illegal"
about what they are doing.  They agree that there are going to be employees
that disagree with this policy, but seem to convey the feelings that these
people are free to seek employment elsewhere.

More details will be relayed to the appropriate groups as they become
available.

Any comments on the matter may be emailed to 'dillard@sulaco.sigma.com' or
'sulaco!dillard'.  Any comments received are subject to being relayed to
Dillard's headquarters in Little Rock ANONYMOUSLY IF SO INDICATED.

Fortunately for many of us, after about 40 years of intense debate in the
automotive industry on this complex and challenging "lights on" problem, some
manufacturers are adding a simple device that alerts you if your lights are on
when the ignition is off.  These range from a simple analog "BReeee!"  in my
Chevy Blazer to digital (shudder!) voice synthesis in some upscale foreign
yuppiemobiles.

I for one rate this innovation right up there with Post-It Brand Notes,
Microwave Popcorn and VCR's in it's subtle yet sweeping effect on the
whole of Western Society.

</i><PRE>

An editorial in the New York Times this morning (Feb 9) entitled
``Obscenities, Hang-Ups and Technology'' discussed Caller ID, the new
phone feature showing the caller's number before the phone is answered.
It discussed the privacy issues, namely the enhanced privacy of those
who no longer receive obscene calls, and the reduced privacy of those
placing calls.  Suppposedly it is ``a potent deterrent that already
seems to have sharply reduced those annoyances [crank calls] in New Jersey.''

Then it mentioned Call Blocking, an added feature not available in New
Jersey, but to be available for free in California:
    ``By pressing two or three keys, callers could keep their
    numbers from being transmitted.  The recipient would not
    see the number on the screen, only a 'P' [what do you
    suppose 'P' stands for?] or some other symbol.  Like an
    apartment dweller who sees that the front door peephole
    has been blocked, he could simply decline to respond to the call.
    The trouble with Call Blocking is that it undermines Caller ID.
    Why would people buy Called ID if it could be so easily defeated?''

The answer is easy: they would for the same reason they install
peepholes--they will know when it is being defeated.

The editorial goes on to distort the balance of privacy issues:
    ``Three privacy interests intersect here.  It is difficult choosing
    between two--the interest of the recipient of calls who wishes not
    to be harassed and the interest of the caller who wishes no to be
    identified.  The third interest, however, might be overriding:
    society's interest in discouraging offensive phone calls generally.''
Simply repeating one side of the argument twice (from an individual and
a societal point of view) does not make it carry twice the weight.

The editorial concludes that a bill sponsored by Sen. Herbert Kohl to
require free Call Blocking should be defeated, until the impact on
privacy of Caller ID with and without Call Blocking can be measured.

I wrote a response to the editor, which concludes:

Even without Call Blocking, those wishing to harass could do so
anonymously from pay phones.  But this might be too much discouragement for
those wishing to place anonymous calls to crisis hotlines, as you suggest.
Of course the organizations running those hotlines can probably be trusted
not to use Caller ID to trace their calls.  But people considering placing
such calls need all the encouragement they can get to go ahead without fear
of identification.

The real danger to society in Caller ID comes from the ability of large
companies to maintain databases by phone number.  It will be convenient if
corporations can quickly identify and service their regular customers by
looking up the phone number when a call comes in.  But one might wish to
make a call inquiring about some product without running the risks of
receiving follow-up calls or being placed on a related mailing list.

Call Blocking provides the perfect solution.  While private individuals with
Caller ID would refuse blocked calls if they feared harassment, I am sure
that even those corporations that made use of a phone database would be
willing to accept some anonymous inquiries.

Although the drop in obscene phone calls is easy to measure, the risks
to callers' privacy are much harder to quantify.
I sense that you do not even plan to measure them at the end of the
experiment you propose, in which New Jersey will be the guinea pig.

In <A HREF="/Risks/7.69.html">RISKS-7.69</A> Vince Manis tells us that his General Electric
answering machine has only 256 possible access codes for remote
message retrieval.  I have the same machine.  Valid combinations
are 3 consecutive touch tones of the form [0-7][0-7][0-3].

In <A HREF="/Risks/7.73.html">RISKS-7.73</A> William Curtiss points out that most answering
machines just ignore digits until you get the correct security
code.  "As long as the incoming stream contains the code
somewhere you are given access.  Since 256 combinations needs
three digits, a carefully constructed string of 258 digits will
contain every possible combination (for example, if the code is
a triplet composed of just the numbers 1 and 2 then the string
1211122212 contains all eight triplets)."

The shortest string of digits that I was able to generate for
defeating my answering machine was 452 digits:

000100200301101201302102202303103203304004104204305005105205
306006106206307007107207311121131221231321331401411421431501
511521531601611621631701711721732223233240241242243250251252
253260261262263270271272273330034034134234335035135235336036
136236337037137237344044144244345045145245346046146246347047
147247354054154254355055155255356056156256357057157257364064
164264365065165265366066166266367067167267307407417427437507
51752753760761762763770771772773

DTMF decoding chips are required to recognize a tone as short
as 50 milliseconds with an interdigit interval of another 50
milliseconds, making a total of 100 ms for each digit.  So the
whole 452 digit string could be dialed within 45.2 seconds
using a demon dialer.  Since my answering machine will wait a
minute or more while you leave a message, it could be cracked
with just one phone call.

Can anyone suggest an algorithm to generate a shorter string
than I have above, or better yet, an optimal string?  A string
length of 258 digits is a lower bound, but is there necessarily
a solution that short?

I checked more than a dozen different answering machines on the
market that allow remote message retrieval using touch tones, and
the best let you select combinations of the form [0-9][0-9][0-9].
A key space of 1000 combinations is hardly any improvement.

I discovered a security weakness that would allow you to trick
answering machines with remote message retrieval into making phone
calls and delivering untraceable ransom messages!

Here's how:

Dial someone's answering machine and leave a message with the format:
1.  14 seconds of nonsense talking (to keep the tape running)
2.  dial, say, 555-1234 using touch tones (which will be recorded)
3.  a few more seconds of random talking
4.  finally your ransom message

Now dial the security code (which you discovered as described in my
companion article) to get the answering machine to play back the
messages.  As soon as you hear the start of your nonsense message,
hang up.  The machine will continue playing the messages, oblivious
to the fact that no one is listening.  The telephone exchange will
supply dial tone to the answering machine's line 12 seconds after
you hang up (12 seconds at my exchange).  Two seconds later, the
answering machine will play the recorded touch tones 555-1234,
effectively dialing that number.  A few seconds later, the person
at 555-1234 answers and your message is delivered!  And it cannot
be traced to you.

Of course, you would call back the answering machine and clean
up the evidence.

I believe that the technique will work on all answering machines
with remote message retrieval provided that:

1. You have the security code (see my other posting about how good
   these are).
   
2. The exchange will supply dial tone to the callee after the
   caller hangs up.  This is true on all modern switches.
   
3. The phone line of the answering machine permits touch tone
   dialing.  This is a way to secure your answering machine:
   switch to pulse dialing only service.
   
4. The machine and its tape reproduce touch tones with enough
   fidelity.  Mine do.
   
5. The machine will ignore dial tone.  There are no guaranteed
   electrical changes on the line when a caller hangs up, so
   watching for dial tone would be the only reliable indicator,
   which my machine ignores.
   
6. The machine will record touch tones.  Mine will record
   everything (except that the 3 digit security code gets it to
   play back the messages).  The security hole could be plugged if
   the machine would stop recording as soon as it got any touch tone.
   
7. The machine will play all touch tones recorded on its tape.
   I did have some trouble here since the machine cannot tell if
   a tone is coming from the tape or from the caller on the line.
   During playback, my machine will interpret a "1" as a command to
   fast forward and "3" to fast reverse, and thus disrupt the 
   dialing if these digits are part of the number.

A more likely hazard than untraceable ransom messages is the relaying
of long distance messages that are charged to some innocent answering
machine owner, or harassing the owner by having him billed for
random toll calls (long distance, overseas, 976, 900, etc.).

The 2/11/90 New York Times Magazine has a long article on the space telescope.
This article goes into some detail on the project's software problems

	". . .scientists were aiming for a 1985 launching, but because so much
	of the technology related to secret military systems, the Pentagon
	dictated that only 116 managers in the project could have access to
	the contractors' plans.  'This lack of manpower came back to haunt us
	many times,' Robert O'Dell, who now teaches at Rice University, wrote
	in Sky &amp; Telescope magazine last July.  'It kept NASA from closely
	following the contractors' work and made it very difficult to know what
	was happening at any given time.
		Costs soared and deadlines were missed.  The system that
	controls the telescope's directional pointing encountered difficulties,
	which made matters worse.  Only after a management reshuffling at
	Marshall Space Center, and the addition of more overseers, did the
	project finally get back on track, but with launching delayed until
	late 1986."

The article continues explaining problems that resulted from launching the
telescope from the shuttle to a 380 mile orbit instead of to the originally
planned on 22,300 mile equatorial orbit.  Leading into:

		"Rodger Doxsey, chief of engineering support for the space
	telescope institute, concedes that the delay caused by the Challenger
	disaster was not all bad:  'We were not ready to operate the
	telescope in 1986.  There would have been a big scramble just to get
	it operating.  But that's a route history didn't take.'
		The biggest problem was in developing the computer software
	to control the constantly orbiting telescope:  slewing it into
	position, pointing it to targets and keeping them in the field of view,
	making adjustments dictated by the interference of Earth and the need
	to avoid looking at the Sun. (To prevent damaging glare to the
	optics, the telescope cannot point within 20 degrees of the bright
	limb of Earth or within 50 degrees of the Sun.)   Computers also
	instruct the telescope about which cameras or sensors to operate for a
	particular observation, and which of the many camera filters it should
	use.  The computer must then schedule a time when the resulting data
	can be radioed to Earth through the two tracking and data relay
	satellites, which are not always available, because of commitments to
	shuttle missions and various spy satellites.  Each observation,
	whether for a few hours or several days, must be meticulously planned 
	down to the second.  'The entire architecture for this software has
	had to be very much redefined in the last four years,' Doxsey says."

Last week I fulfilled one of my civic obligations by complying with a summons
for jury duty - which meant showing up at the appointed time and place, in
order to sit and wait until called or dismissed. [This on the same day the
Commonwealth announced it would file misdemeanor charges against no shows.  But
I digress.]

In Massachusetts, you are called to serve one day or one trial. The one day is
covered by sitting in the jury assembly room, waiting.  Once the one-day /
one-trial obligation is met, you are not supposed to be summoned again for
three years.

In the introductory remarks given by the jury clerk, he admonished us to
stash our certificate of service in a safe place, because it will be the
only sure-fire proof that we did, indeed, do our duty. He continued, and I
quote, "SOMEONE did something to the computer, and so a lot of people
who should not be receiving jury summonses are - sometimes monthly..."

I was struck by the fact that the clerk did not blame the computer for
having messed up the records of who was eligible for a summons and who
wasn't, that he blamed it on a human. And this was a person who,
although articulate, would not normally be thought of as terribly
concerned with such fine distinctions.

Accents are more than just decorations

The ASCII character set has (obviously) been developed by Americans
for Americans.  This is all very well, but since most nations use
American computers they, too, get to use the ASCII character set.
One consequence of this is that one gets into problems when trying to
display characters not present in the original ASCII set.  What has
been done, then, in most instances is the replacement of certain less
commonly used characters, mainly [\]{|}, with "national" characters.

But this isn't problem-free.  One thing soon noticed is that even
though the characters display as letters on the screen, they are
still by most programs interpreted as non-alphabetics to the
confusion of (not exclusively) novice users.  This also means that
programming languages which use these special characters, C is a
prime example, look strange, to say the least, when displayed with
national characters.

Another problem that soon crops up is that of sort sequence.  Most
languages treat accented characters as letters with decorations, thus
aacute, agrave, acircumflex and so on, all count as a's.  However, in
the Nordic languages the situation is somewhat different.  Aring,
Adieresis and Odieresis in Finnish and Swedish, and their Danish and
Norwegian counterparts Aring, AE and Oslash count as actual letters -
thus they have an alphabetic order of their own.  To further
complicate the matter, this order isn't the same in the different
languages - Finnish and Swedish have ...X Y Z Aring Adieresis
Odieresis while Danish and Norwegian has the order ...X Y Z AE Oslash
Aring.  In spite of this, the decision was taken to use the same
order in all four countries and the Danish/Norwegian order was chosen.

This means that when you sort something alphabetically in Swedish,
all words containing Aring will end up in the wrong place.  If they
end up at all, that is to say - a few years ago I read in the
newspaper that the literary magazine BLM had failed to send out any
issues to subscribers who's name started with Aring.  This was blamed
on "computer error", but a little afterthought gave the realization
that some programmer had used a test like
if ch &gt;= 'A' and ch &lt;= 'Odieresis' then ...
and thought he had handled the entire alphabet.

Eight-bit character sets solve the problem of displaying both
national characters and braces/brackets but they generally don't
solve the problem with different sort orders.  

There are then some added complications: 
At least in Swedish, V and W are considered to be equivalent, thus
"Walle" comes before "Ville" in a sort.

The Aring has been introduced in Danish and Norvegian very lately, as
a replacement for the Aa-digram.  However, proper names are still
often spelled with aa, and thus aa and aring have to be sorted as if
they were equivalent, but then again, there are foreign words that
contain the combination aa, and these are to be sorted as if they had
tow a's in a row, so one would get "(den) Haag", "H&lt;aring&gt;b",
"Haagerup".  This is probably not very easily done on a computer...

(Comments on various postings in Risks 9.67:)

Les Earnest's memoir of SAGE reminded me of a story told by a high-school
buddy who went into the Air Force before college.  He ended up as a technician
at a SAGE installation.  As Les relates, SAGE used a dual-processor system
for reliability: one online, one offline for testing.

One day, the officer in charge stepped out for coffee.  The technicians
switched to the other cpu and started running diagnostics on the system
that had been online.  One of these diagnostics turned on all lamps to
check whether any were burned out.  The officer then came back with a
cup of coffee, glanced at the system he thought was defending America
and decided that the Hour Of Destiny had arrived.  The coffee cup was
tossed aside as he lept to battle stations.  The next day, as my friend
related, a very prominent "ON LINE" sign was added to the system.

My friend also mentioned that the graphics system could be used to display
pictures of young women that were somewhat unrelated to national defense
-- unless one takes a very long view -- with the light pen being used
to select articles of clothing that were considered inappropriate in the
mind of the viewer.  (Predating the "look and feel" of MacPlaymate by
almost 30 years.)  Perhaps Les could expand on this; paying special
consideration to the risks involved in this type of programming.

....

The discussion of whether the Vincennes' missile control system must obey
"rules of engagement" brings up an interesting problem that has no simple
solution: who is in charge of the technology?  To simplify the problem
somewhat, should the engine control computer in my car allow me to drive faster
than 55 miles per hour?  Should I reprogram that computer when I enter an
Interstate highway or ship the car to Germany?

A few years ago, I was one of the developers of the DECtalk speech synthesizer.
I took some care to make sure that the most common English obscenities were
properly pronounced.  One of my goals with DECtalk was to build a tool that
could be used by a speech-impaired person and I felt that, no matter how
improper the language, it was not my job to restrict the user's expression.

The purpose of a missile control computer is to kill people.  It strikes me as
bizarre to require the computer program to obey international law as well.  Why
should a machine be held more -- or even as -- responsible than the ship's
captain?

....

In Scandinavia, car headlights are to be kept on 24 hours per day.  The local
manufacturers have added relays to shut the headlights off when the ignition is
turned off.  This seems both simpler and more effective than buzzers and
synthesized voices.  Of course, this is technology being used to aid compliance
with the law.

....

When I started this note, I thought I was commenting on three unrelated
topics.  Apparently, everything is related.

&gt;Fortunately for many of us, after about 40 years of intense debate in the
&gt;automotive industry on this complex and challenging "lights on" problem, some
&gt;manufacturers are adding a simple device that alerts you if your lights are on
&gt;when the ignition is off.  These range from a simple analog "BReeee!"  in my
&gt;Chevy Blazer...

I have a Blazer (actually a GMC Jimmy, the same vehicle) with the "analog
BReeee!" feature referred to by Mr. Woodhead.  I won't disagree that the
buzzer is a nice feature.  The observed rate of "battery dead due to lights
on" with this vehicle, however, is higher than any other vehicles we have
ever owned (two occurrences in 18 months).

The problem is caused by a small convenience light located on the ceiling
of the vehicle just inside the rear cargo compartment door.  The light
housing includes a rocker switch, which requires very low pressure to
operate and is aligned axially rather than longitudinally.  The switch
is therefore easily operated by accident.  The act of lifting a grocery
bag from the rear compartment can cause the lip of the bag to move the
switch, for example.

This tiny light is NOT coupled into the manufacturer's "beeper system",
of course - that would be too annoying.  The light is very faint, so
faint that one can fail to observe it when peeking into the garage at
night.  We believe that about three days of continuous operation of
the light are sufficient to drain the battery to the point that it
will not start the car (we're not sure about this, since we never
really know when the switch was thrown as we scurry around, days later,
connecting jumper cables :-).

To my mind, this is an excellent "microexample" of how a complex system
design can fail miserably to achieve the intent of the designer.  Although
this system is not computerized, it contains an obvious message: reliability
can't be glued on.

&gt;  "Apple pie is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used...

I have read none of the works on this topic, but (unless I am thoroughly
confused) it seems that McLuhan's apple pie analogy is a somewhat sarcastic
attempt at supporting his argument that technologies (and apple pie) do
have inherent qualities or a "nature" which renders them "good or bad" of
their own.  Apparently he feels that the "nature" of apple pie is good, and

Certainly he could not infer such a quality unless he liked apple pie,
something which is obviously not true for all people.  In fact, for those
allergic to apples, the nature of apple pie is, if anything, bad.  And so
he has succeeded in proving the very point made by Sarnoff.

Lately there has been little lack of discussion about reliability of
telecomunications systems.  I have also seen several articles which
discuss the security of the same systems.  MIT has recently installed
an ISDN system using a #5ESS system.  There has been a whole lot of
discussion about what the system can and cannot do.  October '89's
issue of Technology Review has an article entitled "The Twilight
Phone."  In February's issue there is an editorial and two replies.

The editorial claims that it is possible to use the phone system to
bug rooms.  The replies claim that, while theoretically possible,
getting the switch to do that would require programming expertise and
physical access to the switch.

There then is the possibility that folks in charge could order the
owners of the switch to bug a room.  This is more invasive than a
normal wire tap, because the phone's microphone could be left on all
of the time.

Then there is this article which appeared in the WSJ.  It does not
state how said hackers "entered the company's computer," but it makes
me wonder.  I'd be interested to hear how these calls were rerouted.

    Hackers - Accused of scheme against BellSouth. Legion of Doom group.
	    {The Wall Street Journal, 8-Feb-90, p. C20}

    Federal  grand juries  in  Chicago and Atlanta   indicted four alleged
    computer hackers in what authorities called  a fraud scheme that could
    potentially disrupt emergency "911"  telephone service throughout nine
    Southern states.  The men, alleged to be part of a closely  knit cadre
    of computer hackers known as the Legion of Doom, gained access  to the
    computer system  controlling telephone emergency  service of BellSouth
    Corp.,  the Atlanta-based    telecommunications  giant.  The   Chicago
    indictment   said   members of the  Legion   of  Doom are  engaged  in
    disrupting  telephone    service  by entering  a   telephone company's
    computers and changing the routing of telephone calls.  The hackers in
    the group  also fraudulently obtain money from   companies by altering
    information in their computers,   the indictment  said.  The   hackers
    transferred stolen telephone-computer  information from  BellSouth  to
    what prosecutors   termed a  "computer   bulletin  board  system"   in
    Lockport, Ill.  In turn, the men planned to  publish the computer data
    in a hacker's magazine, the grand jury charged.

&gt;From the AP wire: by Sharon Herbaugh, Associated Press Writer,

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - An Indian Airlines jet with 146 people aboard crashed
and burst into flames while attempting to land at a southern Indian airport
today and 91 people were killed, authorities said.  The Airbus 320 crashed at 1
p.m. while on final approach to the runway at Bangalore airport, airline and
airport officials said.  The plane apparently grazed a grove of trees and
crashed about 50 yards from the runway, they said.

State-run television showed shots of the crash site, a grassy plain on a golf
course adjacent to the airport.  The craft's tail was intact, but its fusilage
was shattered and charred and the nose smashed.  "The crash occurred before the
plane touched the runway, and it caught fire as soon as it crashed, said P..S.
Ghetty, airport manager in Bombay, where the hourlong flight had originated.

The crash was the first by the sophisticated Airbus 320 on a commercial flight.
One of the planes crashed in a demonstration flight at an airshow in eastern
France in 1988 killing three people and injuring 50.  Airline officials said
the plane, which was an hour behind schedule, carried 139 passengers and a crew
of seven.

[More about injuries]

Airline officials did not know what caused the crash, but they said weather
was not a factor.  The jet was acquired by the nation's government-run
domestic carrier about three months ago for $38 million.

After Indian Airlines announced it was adding 31 Airbus 320s to its aging fleet
of Boeing, Fokker, and Avro planes, news reports criticized the airline for
failing to adequately train pilots to fly the sophisticated aircraft, the first
civilian airliner with a fully computerized flight control system.  The carrier
also was criticized for failing to provide adequate hangar space to house and
maintain the planes.

[more about some previous Indian Airlines accidents]

Indian Airlines, the major domestic carrier, flies to 73 cities nationwide
and to nine nearby countries.  It has come under criticism for allegedly
failing to maintain pre-flight safety procedures on its fleet and to adequately
supervise its pilots.  Delays in flight schedules are also endemic.

The A320, built by the European consortium Airbus Industrie, is the first
civilian airliner equipped with a fuly computerized flight control system,
which the manufacturer says permits safer, electronically controlled flight.
Developed at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the A320 was certified for flight on
Feb. 26, 1988, and went into service in April 1988.

[There have also been some unofficial radio reports that suggested that the
flight control system was involved in this crash.  My friends in the
industry say that this cannot possibly be known for a while. nancy]

[...] Doubts were expressed about the ability of the airline to maintain the
complex flight control equipment, and the effects of dust on the system, both
with explicit reference to computing systems.

I find it hard to raise any possible risks in technology transfer to developing
countries (does that label apply to India?) given the overtones of chauvinism
if not downright racism, but it seems from this interview as if the Indian
engineers themselves question their ability to handle this package.

I suspect other parallels exist with well-meaning donation/supply of IT
infrastructure that failed to match local conditions eg lack of tropical
"hardening", availaibility of spike-free UPS, spares, training.

FAULTS AND FAILURES: FERRY ELECTRONICS OUT OF CONTROL by Karen Fitzgerald
with John R. Devaney and Robert Thomas

In a seeming reversal of progress, Washington State Ferries, the agency that
manages the United States' largest ferry transportation system, has begun 
replacing the electronic control systems of six of its boats with pneumatic
controls.  A string of failures, beginning in the early 1980's after the
Issaquah-class ferries were introduced, eventually forced the change.  Ferries
rammed docks, for instance, or puttered away from them even though no command
was given.  In a few instances, a ferry shifted  from forward to reverse with 
no warning.  In contrast, an Issaquah boat retrofitted last June with a hybrid
electro-pneumatic system has outstripped all expectations, according to vessel
maintenance engineer Ben Davis.  

[ Here the article includes a photo of an Issaquah ferry.  They are large,
carrying several hundred cars, their passengers, and hundreds of walk-on
passengers - JJ ]

As part of the state's Department of Transportation, Washington State Ferries
in Seattle operates 24 vessels, encompassing a variety of control systems.  No
others have had the problems of the six boats in the Issaquah class, which 
are unique in having variable-pitch propellors, one at each end of the boat.
When the captain sets the control handle positions for transit or movement 
near the dock, the control system must set the appropriate propellor speed,
pitch, and clutch engagement.  Variable pitch makes the craft extremely 
maneuverable, able to move sideways and turn on the spot.

Many of the problems could be traced to the vendor, Propulsion Systems Inc.
(PSI), which went bankrupt in 1981 and was then bought by the ferry builder,
the now-defunct Marine Power and Equipment Co.  "The problem is not so much
with digital controls," said Davis, "as with horribly shoddy control system
design."

[ Here the SPECTRUM article describes examples, including poor understanding
of the propulsion system, grounding and shielding problems, poor protection
against power supply dropouts and transients, poor documentation and
configuration control, and incorrect assembly ]

... a 1986 Lockheed Shipbuilding Co. study recommended switching to pneumatics
to improve reliability. ... The agency chose a hybrid control system that
operates electrically from control handles to control cabinet ... but operates
pneumatically from cabinet to propellors and engine governors ...  (the
replacement control system is) supplied by Mathers Control Inc., Seattle. ...

The Prodigy Services publication, PRODIGY STAR, (Volume III, No. 1) recently
showcased a "major benefit".  The Prodigy system accesses remote subscribers'
disks to check the Prodigy software version used, and when necessary, downloads
the latest programs.  This process is automatic when subscribers link to the
network.

I asked Prodigy how they protect against the possibility of altering
subscribers' non-Prodigy programs, or reading their personal data.  Prodigy's
less-than-reassuring response was essentially (1) we don't look at other
programs, and (2) you can boot from a floppy disk.  According to Prodigy, the
feature cannot be disabled.

A court in Celle (a small town near Hannover, FRG) today (Thursday 15,1990)
convicted 3 KGB hackers of espionage (=to work for a foreign service against
the interests of the country) for the KGB. Sentences were mild and partly
significantly below the recommendation of the public prosecutor.  Markus H.
(whom Clifford Stoll regarded as 'the Wily hacker') was found guilty of having
intruded US military computer systems 30 times (out of 450 attempts); his
sentence: 20 month prison (for 3 years on probation) and to pay 10,000 DM; Dirk
B. was sentenced to 14 months and has to pay back 5,000 DM. And finally, former
croupier Peter C. (who essentially connected the links to KGB but has no
knowledge in computing) was sentenced to 2 years and has to pay back 3,000 DM.
All of them lost the `citizen rights' (e.g. to participate in elections, either
passively or actively) for 2-3 years. The prison sentences are deferred for 3
years probation time. They were immediately released from detention pending
trial.

The chairman of the 2nd senate of the Nether Saxonian Criminal Court said in
his oral argumantation, that the Federal Republic didnot suffer seriously from
the hack, but that US military institutions and a large manufacturer were
damaged. (As the German law has not the same universality as US law, damage tu
US instutions couldnot be prosecuted). Moreover, the court expressed strong
doubts that a real damage was done: 'only' a security package of a large
manufacturer and the source code for a UNIX system were mentioned.  (the large
manufacturer evidently prepares a civil case). Independent of whether the
sentences are accepted and will become valid, the estimations in media about
billions DM of damage were rather premature.

It will be interesting to analyse (in the written argumentation) why the court
didnot convince the hackers on the hacker attacks (the German penal law
recently was updated by a new paragraph on computer espionage which was not
applied). The defenders tried (evidently successfully) to show that Cliff
Stoll's proofs were insufficient to show that the guy in Hannover (H.)  really
was the guy whose commands were executed 10,000 miles away. With a court
without any knowledge (the chairman asked the hackers more than once: `What
means' questions on e-mail etc), with public prosecutors and with criminalists
which evidently lacked the basic knowledge, it may not surprise that the
defenders succeeded in put the material in question (Cliff Stoll's book was
forbidden to be sold in its German version, due to several statements which the
defenders neglected).

I apologize for any misformulations esp. regarding legal language (I am not
educated as a lawyer); moreover, I hope that my personal doubts about the
competence of the criminal agencies, the prosecutor and the court are not
overstated here. On the other side, the 2 hackers (a 3rd one committed suicide
last year, and the defenders tried to load all the guilt on him) and the 4th
one, `Pengo' who may face another process (in Berlin), all belonging to the
so-called `Leitstelle 511' (due to the telephone prefix of Hannover) of Chaos
Computer Club are not those professionals as they are regarded by the media and
the lawyers.           Klaus Brunnstein

    [Gerald is collecting stories on the risks of choosing the wrong

    another (a better) programming language would have been used.  He cited
    the Mariner (but hadn't seen the newer explanations in <A HREF="/Risks/8.75.html">RISKS-8.75</A> or 
    <A HREF="/Risks/9.75.html">RISKS-9.75</A>), the Internet Worm fingerd problem, and the 15 Jan 90 AT&amp;T 
    slowdown.  But he included the following text on the AT&amp;T problem.  PGN]

| | Date: Fri Jan 19 12:18:33 1990
| | 
| | This is the bug that cause the AT&amp;T breakdown
| | the other day (no, it wasn't an MCI virus):
| | 
| | In the switching software (written in C), there was a long
| | "do . . . while" construct, which contained
| |    a "switch" statement, which contained 
| |       an "if" clause, which contained a

	Again it looks like this bug wouldn't have occurred in another
	programming language.

You C what I mean? Do you know other stories like these, if possible with
references? I don't want to praise Ada or pick at C and Fortran; I am looking
for any story where a provably inappropriate/insecure programming language has
been used.

The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, February 13, 1990
By John J. Keller, Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

New York -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., still reeling from a cripling
network outage less than a month ago, suffered another accident on Friday that
wiped out toll-free 800 service to tens of thousands of callers nationwide.

AT&amp;T blamed the latest disruption on a service technician who had forgotten to
program some information on a group of 800 numbers into a network computer.

Only companies subscribing to 800 numbers using the prefix 424 were affected,
said AT&amp;T.  That included the Internal Revenue Service's toll-free, tax-service
number 1-800-424-1040.  Another IRS line that allows callers to order forms by
phone was also cut off.

AT&amp;T declined to identify business and government agency customers other than
the IRS that were affected by the Friday shutdown, which lasted about 90
minutes, from 12:40 p.m. EST to a little after 2 p.m.

While that's nowhere near the nine hours that AT&amp;T's network had problems on
the afternoon and evening of Jan. 15, it was an embarrassing epilogue to the
earlier breakdown.  Until the January problem, AT&amp;T hadn't experienced a major
network problem in its 114-year history.  The January outage was caused by a
software programming error in the company's network signaling system.

"AT&amp;T offers the most modern services, but this latest accident was at the
lowest level of sophistication," said Jack B.  Grubman, an analyst at
PaineWebbber Inc.  "Thats not good."

The AT&amp;T spokesman blamed Friday's accident, which he called a "very small
mishap" and a "minor inconvenience," on a network service technician who was
"load balancing" or making network routing changes to some 800 numbers.  The
technician was supposed to transfer the list of these 800 numbers from one
network control point to another, he said.  But apparently the technician
forgot to program the routing changes into one of the control points, shutting
down service on as many as 200 toll-free lines, including those leased by the
IRS.

An IRS spokesman said the agency didn't have a clear idea of how many people
were affected by the shutdown, but "obviously it was in the thousands.  We hope
it didn't cause too much of a problem."

On Jan. 7, New England Telephone began switching over to a new computerized
system for handling collect calls from touch-tone pay phones. Instead of an
operator, you get a computerized voice telling you to punch "one one" for a
collect call. Then you say your name, the computer dials the other number,
tells the person it's a collect call and then plays you back as you state your
name.

Just one problem. One of the reporters where I work was negotiating a sensitive
interview and needed to talk to the editor-in-chief. He didn't have any change,
so he tried calling collect. Another editor picked up the phone, thought it was
one of those "goddamned computer telemarketing things" and promptly hung up.

AT&amp;T has recently seen fit to start using Illinois Bell ISDN at my location,
replacing thousands of individual answering machines (that don't work with
digital phones) with an AUDIX answering system.

We have automatic number identification inside the complex, displaying the
caller's name on an LCD screen on the phone.  We can block ANI when we call
somebody, then the name shows up as PRIVATE.

However, if your ANI-blocked call goes to AUDIX, AUDIX leaves your phone number
along with your message!  Leaves me wondering how much I can trust commercial
ANI blocking if Illinois Bell even offers it.

(The other nifty feature of AUDIX is that it leaves a message of your call even
when you don't want it to.  Only fix I've found to this is to type *** and
confuse it).

The San Francisco Chronicle reports today that the Jasons, a group of
technically-oriented defense intellectuals who study weapons systems as
consultants to the Pentagon, have prepared a report on the "Brilliant Pebbles"
program that is highly critical of the concept.  Although the report was
delivered to the Pentagon last fall after the Jasons' summer study session, the
general thrust of the report was not revealed until yesterday, Sunday, February
18, at a symposium at the annual convention of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, being held in San Francisco.  A summary of the Jasons'
findings was presented by John M. Cornwall, professor of physics at UCLA and a
member of the Jasons group.  Also part of the symposium was Lieutenant General
George Monahan, director of the SDIO.

General Monahan told the audience that it will cost between $50 and $60 billion
to develop and deploy "Brilliant Pebbles," although others have put the cost at
$100 billion.  General Monahan said, "We could have a very robust first-phase
defense" with "Brilliant Pebbles."  "And the technology is at hand to deploy
such a system, so the major considerations now are political."  

Cornwall, however, said that the Jasons do not consider the technology to be at
hand, and he outlined a number of problems with the "Brilliant Pebbles"
concept.  He said that the system would be "a somewhat leaky defense," and the
"pebbles" would be vulnerable to countermeasures.  They would also be
ineffective against hostile missiles using fast-burn boosters. Cornwall also
reported that the lasers proposed as guidance mechanisms for the projectiles
are currently inadequate for the job.

Cornwall concluded, "This design is not ready to be locked into place."  He did
recommend further support, however, because the system may eventually prove to
be a "near-term" possibility.  The Bush administration's proposed budget for
the "Brilliant Pebbles" program has increased from $129 million in FY 90 to
$329 million in FY 91.

from New Scientist, 17 Feb 90, page 18

    A nuclear reactor at one of Europe's leading physics research centers has
been shut down by French safety authorities following the discovery that it had
been running at 10 percent over its permitted power output ever since it came
into operation in the early 1970's.
    The extra power went unnoticed because the instrument used to measure the
output of the reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) at Grenoble in France
was calibrated with ordinary water, whereas the reactor uses heavy water.
    Its reactor generates the world's highest flux of neutrons...  ... heavy
water is 10 per cent denser than ordinary water. The density term used by the
scientists in the equation linking flow with pressure was that of ordinary
water. They then poured ordinary water past the diaphram and observed the
relationship between flow and pressure.
    "The mistake came in twice; in the equations they used, and in the actual
calibration," says Gerard Pautrot, spokesman for the reactor section at ILL.
The result was that the power output was systematically underestimated by 10
percent.
    Since the uncertainty in calculating the rate at which the uranium is
burned is also around 10 percent, the operators of the reactor never noticed
that the fuel was burning faster than expected, says Pautrot.
    It will not be necessary to alter the data that scientists have obtained
with the beam, which is monitored independently. The error was found only when
engineers who were trying to improve the system re-examined the old calibration
procedures and noticed the error.

Subject: Warning: NIH font size nit-picking
Date: 20 Feb 90 23:02:08 GMT

	One of our faculty members had a grant administratively rejected by
NIH because, claims NIH, the guidelines for type size had been violated.
They specify 10 to 12 point type, no more than 15 characters per inch.  This
grant was done using troff, in Times Roman 10 on an Apple LaserWriter, which
is what most grants around here get done in.  Turns out, however, that Times
Roman 10 gives you an average of about 16-1/2 characters per inch.

	Apparently somebody at NIH sits there with a ruler and counts
characters.  I suppose one could debate at length the wisdom of being so
finicky about this, but the important thing is that they are,  and people
should be aware that they do take this seriously and size their type
accordingly.  OBTW, they did agree to accept the grant for the same deadline
if we would print it out again in a larger size and get it back to them in a
couple of days, so I guess they are being reasonable about this.

Here is a short AP item from the 'Los Angeles Times' 21 Feb. '90:

   COMPUTER SECURITY AT STOCK EXCHANGES CALLED VULNERABLE

Internal security weaknesses of stock exchange computer systems raise risks
of sabotage that "could literally bring securities trading to a halt," even
though the systems are well protected against attack by outsiders, a
congressional study disclosed Tuesday.

The study by the General Accounting Office found a number of internal
control weaknesses at the computer centers of the nation's two major stock
exchanges and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which oversees the
over-the-counter market. 

A related GAO study called for beefed-up security measures for the
electronic funds transfer systems used by the Federal Reserve System and
most of the nation's banks.

Crash due to stress?  Airbus-Copilot had training problems
(translated from Badische Neueste Nachrichten 22 Feb 90)

Toulouse (dpa). The crash of the Indian Airbus A320 during landing at Bangalore
is possibly due to an unqualified pilot, reports the French Newspaper "Depeche
du Midi" of Toulouse. The copilot C. A. Fernandez has shown problems during
stress situations during his training on a simulator at the training company
Aeroformation in Toulouse, the paper reports on Wednesday (21 Feb 90 uv).
Therefore the instructors have not given him the qualification certificate and
have decided to require an extended basic training in India.  The pilot S. S.
Gopujkar was probably acting as an instructor during the accident flight on
last Wednesday (14 Feb 90 uv), despite the fact that he didn't have the
required qualification. This would explain, why he asked the control tower to
make a manual landing on sight.  The president of Aerospatiale SA, which is
part of the Airbus consortium, announced yesterday (21 Feb 90 uv), that the
crash had no technical causes, according to existing information.  (end of
translation of the article)

So again it is - only - human  malfunctioning (insufficient training,
bad management procedures, financial reasons ?).   Udo Voges

  I have to disagree strongly with the assertion that this bug wouldn't have
occurred in another programming language.  The bug in question is a programmer
error, not a language error, and therefore the same programmer could just have
easily made some other programming error in another language.

  To quote from K&amp;R 2nd Ed, "A break statement may appear only in an iteration
statement or a switch statement, and terminates execution of the smallest
enclosing such statement; control passes to the statement following the
terminated statement."  I don't see anything in there about if statements, and
it seems to me that an attempt to use break to exit from an if statement is
just a stupid programming error, not a language flaw.

  There is some merit to the claim, "Well, a better language would not have
allowed such a mistake," but not much (merit, that is).  All programming
languages have room for stupid errors of one sort or another, or at least all
of the ones that are widely used in industry do.  I think we're opening a real
can of worms when we start blaming the language for something that is the
programmer's fault -- if we can't expect our programmers to understand the
language with which they are programming, then what *can* we expect?

Presumably the break was intended for the do..while construct, not the if.  In
any case the problem is generic, and often arises when modifying previously
correct code, for instance to handle a new special case.

&gt;	Again it looks like this bug wouldn't have occurred in another
&gt;	programming language.

Hogwash.  This is the silver bullet fantasy, a RISK in itself
when held by practicing programmers.  C's break is simply
a restricted form of GOTO, and GOTOs with the wrong target are
a common error in every language that has GOTOs.  That is, every
language that would be considered for "serious" applications like
switching systems.

Several languages have a break construct that accepts a numeric argument to
indicate how many levels to break out of.  Rather than eliminating this kind of
error, they offer it increased scope.  There is no silver bullet.

I've always found "break" a bit confusing.  In this case, I would guess
that the programmer knew exactly where he wanted to break to ... that is,
what the next statement executed after the "break" statement should have
been.  I suggest that writing a "go to" might have been more appropriate.

Mr. Baumgartner:
    I'm very surprised that you didn't take, as your principal example
of an error suggested by the programming language, the requirement in
C to use one equal-sign (=) for a replacement but two of them (==) for
a comparison.  There have been countless instances of programmers
using two when one was meant and, more commonly, one when two were
meant, as in an "if" statement.  Because it's perfectly legal in C, in
an "if"  statement, to do a replacement and a comparison at once, the
compiler never complains if you use only one equal-sign there.  An
unintended replacement can be a subtle bug indeed!
    The true reason for my response to your query, however, is my
objection to the characterization of "break" misuse as a fault
suggested by the language.  You didn't look deeply enough.  The real
problem is the contortions forced upon the C user to render his code
in holy STRUCTURED format.
    If the AT&amp;T programmer had coded "goto" instead of "break", he
would have likely had a problem with his peers but none with the
machine.

Regards, rLs

What is to prevent someone from abusing a computer taped &amp; delivered 'name'?

  COMPUTER:  Please state your name.

  CALLER:  Hi Mom, I'll be home tomorrow on flight...

  COMPUTER:  (After dialing number) Will you accept a collect call from
     "Hi mom, I'll be..." If you wish to accept charges, please say "yes,"
     otherwise say "no."

  CALLEE:  No.

  COMPUTER:  Thank you.  (And does not charge anyone for the message just
     forwarded.)

Does anyone know how long of a "name" will be accepted?  How about if modem
tones will be accepted, stored &amp; relayed if given during the "name" period?

			"The Multifaceted Hacker"
		     or "What makes a hacker hack?"

I'd like to enlist the assistance of the RISKS community in defining the many
different faces of what a hacker is (in any and all senses of the word).

A good friend of mine, Rossella Str&lt;o"&gt;m, is researching this subject for a BBC
World Service radio documentary. She intends to explore the subject what she
hopes will be a new and different angle, and one that I hope RISKS readers
would regard as more accurate. You could help make it so.

As an illustration, newspapers &amp; the rest of the media first picked up on the
image of the "Boy Wonder Hacker", prepubescent geniuses writing sophisticated
computer programs instead of playing football like other kids.

Then they picked up the image of the "Wily Hacker", the cyberpunks on the Dark
Side, breaking into military computers and selling secrets to the men in black
hats for drugs and money.

Some of us, of course, would have preferred the world to recognise the
old-fashioned cosy image of the hacker as a clever programmer, or someone who
is good with train sets.  (This could be your last chance to help revive the
traditional meaning of the word)

All of the above are true to some extent. None of the above completely define
"The Hacker Phenomenon" (whatever that really is).

What Rossella is looking for is information on the human side of what being a
hacker is. What makes some people spend long hours working on clever programs
for their own sake; what makes some people see unauthorised access to computers
as a game?

In other words, CHARACTERISTION and MOTIVATION.

I have of course recommended the following books to her as a starting point.

	 "Computer Power &amp; Human Reason" by J. Weizenbaum
	 "Hackers" by S. Levy
	 "The Cuckoos Egg" by C. Stoll.

But I'm sure there's much more to it than that and I believe that RISKS readers
are a unique group to ask this question.

I'm sure that many readers of RISKS would be interested in your replies, but if
you do have any insights which you don't want to send to the general
distribution, then you can contact Rossella in complete confidence by mail at
the following address:
       
		Postbus 597,   NL - 2131 BA Hoofdorp,   The Netherlands.

or through me.  Thanks.  Nigel Roberts.  Tel: +44 860 578600 or +44 206 396610

Subject: The "Twelve Tricks" trojan - alert and description
Message-ID: &lt;KPETERSEN.12565845400.BABYL@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL&gt;
Date: 12 Feb 90 21:31:29 GMT

The "Twelve Tricks" trojan - alert and description

We have recently received and analysed a trojan that we believe warrants an
urgent alert.  We are calling it the Twelve Tricks trojan, and it is very
interesting, very nasty, and quite complex.  This message is not meant to be a
complete description of the trojan - we feel that it is important to get a
warning out quickly, rather than aim for completeness.  It is not a virus.

The trojan consists of a program (more about this aspect later) which you run;
running the program, as well as the obvious things that the program is expected
to do, also replaces the partition record (also called the Master Boot Record,
or MBR) on your hard disk with its own version.  This can easily be recognised
by inspecting the hard disk at cylinder zero, head zero, sector one, which can
be done with a disk sector editor such as Peeka.  If the partition has this
trojan in place, it will contain the following text near the beginning:

SOFTLoK+ V3.0 SOFTGUARD SYSTEMS INC
2840 St. Thomas Expwy,suite 201
Santa Clara,CA 95051 (408)970-9420

At this point, let us state that we believe that the company mentioned above
has nothing whatsoever to do with the trojan; perhaps the trojan author has a
grudge against them.

The trojan uses a far call to the hard disk Bios code in order to plant this
partition.  To do this, it must know the location in memory of the entry point;
it tries five different ones, one of which is the one documented in the IBM
PC-XT Technical reference manual, and the other four are presumably fairly
common alternatives.

The purpose of planting the trojan with a far call is, we believe, to escape
detection by Active Monitor programs that protect a computer by monitoring the
interrupt table, and preventing unauthorised writes to system areas on the hard
disk.  Since Twelve Tricks doesn't use an interrupt to plant the MBR, such
programs won't be able to prevent it.  We tested this using Flushot+, probably
the most successful of the Active Monitors, and Twelve Tricks went straight
through it - the same would be true, we think, of any other Active Monitor.

The Replacement MBR

When the MBR is run, which is every time you boot from the hard disk, Twelve
Tricks copies 205 (d7h) bytes of itself onto locations 0:300h to 0:3d6h.  This
overwrites part of the interrupt vector table, but it is a part that doesn't
get used very much.  This means that these d7h bytes are memory resident
without having to use any of the TSR calls of Dos, and without having to
reserve part of high memory.  Reserving part of high memory is the usual ploy
used by Boot Sector Viruses, but the drawback of that route is that you might
notice that a few kb from your 640 kb has disappeared (CHKDSK would reveal
this).  The method used by Twelve Tricks would not show up as a loss from your
640 kb.

When the computer is started up, a random number generator determines which of
the Twelve Tricks will be installed.  It does the installation by replacing one
of the interrupt vectors with a vector that points to the Twelve Tricks own
code, and then chains on to the original code.  The twelve tricks are:

1.  Insert a random delay loop in the timer tick, so that 18.2 times per
second, the computer executes a loop that is randomly between 1 and 65536 long
(different each time it is executed).  This slows the machine down, and makes
it work rather jerkily.

2.  Insert an End-Of-Interrupt in the timer tick.  This interferes with the
servicing of hardware interrupts, so for example, the clock is stopped, TSRs
that depend on the timer tick don't work, and the floppy motor is permanently
on.

3.  Every time a key is pressed or released, the timer tick count is
incremented by a random number between 0 and 65535.  This has a variety of
effects; programs sometimes won't run, when you type "TIME" you get "Current
time is divide overflow", and copying files sometimes doesn't work.

4.  Every time interrupt 0dh is executed, only do the routine three times out
of four.  Interrupt 0dh is used on PCs and XTs for the fixed disk, on ATs for
the parallel port.

5.  Every time interrupt 0eh is executed, only do the routine three times out
of four.  Interrupt 0eh is used for the floppy disk.

6.  Every time interrupt 10h is called (this is the video routine), insert a
delay loop that is randomly between 1 and 65536 long (different each time it is
executed).  This slows the video down, and makes it work rather jerkily and/or
slowly.

7.  Every time the video routine to scroll up is called, instead of the
requested number of lines being scrolled, the entire scrolling window is
blanked.

8.  Every time a request is made to the diskette handler, it is converted into
a write request.  This means that the first time you try to read or write to a
diskette, whatever happens to be in the buffer will be written to the diskette,
and will probably overwrite the boot sector, FAT or directory, as these must be
read before anything else can be done.  If you try to read a write protected
diskette, you get "Write protect error reading drive A".  If you do a DIR of a
write enabled diskette, you get "General Failure ...", and if you inspect the
diskette using a sector editor, you'll find that the boot and FAT have been
zeroed or over-written.

9.  Every time interrupt 16h is called (read the keyboard) the keyboard flags
(Caps lock, Num lock, shift states etc) are set randomly before the keystroke
is returned.  This means that at the Dos prompt, the keyboard will only work
occasionally.  Programs that poll interrupt 16h will be unusable.  Holding down
the Del key will trigger a Ctrl-Alt-Del.

10.  Everything that goes to the printer is garbled by xoring it with a byte
from the timer tick count.

11.  Every letter that is sent to the printer has its case reversed by xoring
it with 20h.  Also, non-alpha characters are xored, so a space becomes a null,
and line feeds don't feed lines.

12.  Whenever the Time-Of-Day interrupt (1ah) is executed, do an
End-Of-Interrupt instead.  This means that you can't set the system clock, and
the time is set permanently to one value.

These are the twelve tricks.  In addition there are two more things that the
trojan does.  It uses a random number generator; one time out of 4096, it does
a low level format of the track that contains the active boot sector; this will
also destroy part of the first copy of the FAT.  You can recover from this by
creating a new boot sector, and copying the second copy of the FAT back over
the first copy.  After it does the format, it will display the message
"SOFTLoK+ " etc as above, and hang the computer.

If it doesn't do the format, it makes a random change to a random word in one
of the first 16 sectors of the FAT, which will make a slight and increasing
corruption in the file system.  This is perhaps the worst of the things that it
does, as it will cause an increasing corruption of the files on the disk.

The Dropper program

The program that drops the trojan was, in the specimen that we analysed, a
hacked version of CORETEST, a program to benchmark hard disk performance.  The
file is CORETEST.COM, it is version 2.6, (dated 1986 in the copyright message)
had a length of 32469 bytes, and it was timestamped 6-6-86, 9:44.  When we
looked in more detail at this program, we found some interesting things.

It looks as if the original CORETEST program was an EXE file, and the trojan
author prepended his code to it.  This code consists of some relocation stuff,
then a decryptor, to decrypt the following 246h bytes.  The decryption is a
double xor with a changing byte.  Those 246h bytes, when run, examine the
memory to try to find one of five sets of hard disk handler code (presumably
corresponding to five Bioses).  When it finds one of them, (we have identified
the first one as being the IBM XT Bios) it plants the trojan MBR in place,
using a far call to the Bios code.  The trojan MBR is 200h of the 246h bytes.
The trojan is patched so that it also does disk accesses using a far call to
the same location.  Finally, the prepended trojan passes control to the
original program.  We call the combination of the prepended code, plus the
original program, the Dropper.

The main purpose of the encryption, we would guess, is to evade detection by
programs that check code for bombs and trojans. There are no suspicious strings
or interrupt calls in the code until it is decrypted at run time.

As far as we can tell, it is not a virus, but a trojan.  However, it is
unlikely that all the patching to the original program was done by hand - it is
far more likely that the trojan author wrote a prepender program (we would call
this the Prepender), to automatically attach his code to the target executable.
If this is the case, then there are two consequences.  The first is that he
might have trojanised other programs besides the one that we have examined.  In
other words, there might be other Droppers around besides the one we have
examined.  The second is that if that is the case, we cannot rely on the
encryption having the same seed each time, as the Prepender might change the
seed each time it operates.  So it would be unsafe to search files for the
encrypted MBR.  Instead, we propose a search string based on the decryptor.

Indeed, a further possibility exists.  The Prepender program might have been
placed into circulation, and people running it would unwittingly be creating
additional Droppers.  There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that that is
actually the case, but we would ask anyone who detects this Dropper in one of
their files, to also examine all the others.

Detection

Here's a variety of ways to detect the trojan. The hexadecimal string e4 61 8a
e0 0c 80 e6 61 is to be found in the MBR. This string will also be found in
memory if you have booted from a trojanised MBR, at location 0:38b. You can use
Debug to search in memory.

A useful search string to detect the Dropper is

be 64 02 31 94 42 01 d1 c2 4e 79 f7

Getting rid of it

It's easy to get rid of Droppers; just delete them and replace them with a
clean copy.  If you find the string above in the MBR or in memory at 0:38b, you
need to boot from a clean Dos diskette and replace the partition record.  DO
NOT use Fdisk to do this unless you are prepared for Fdisk to zero your FAT and
directory; you will lose all your data that way.  One way would be to do a
file-by-file backup, low-level format to get rid of the trojan MBR, then Fdisk
Format and restoer your backup.  We would recommend doing two backups using as
different methods as possible if you use this route, in case one of them fails
to restore.

The other way to replace the partition is to run a program that drops a clean
partition record onto the MBR, but doesn't change the partitioning data.  We
are currently preparing one of these - please ask if you need it.

Damage done

The whole of the MBR is used for the code.  Most normal MBRs don't use more
than half the space, and a number of other programs have started using this
space.  For example Disk Manager, and the Western Digital WDXT-Gen controllers
(but the Dropper doesn't work on the WDXT-Gen).  This means that the Dropper
might cause an immediate problem in some circumstances.

The main damage done, however, will be in the impression that this trojan
creates that your hardware is suffering from a variety of faults, which usually
go away when you reboot (only to be replaced by other faults).  Also, the FAT
gets progressively corrupted.

Occurrences

So far, this has only been reported in Surrey, England.  It was noticed because
it made a disk using Speedstor to control it, non-bootable.  Disks that are
controlled in the normal way, remain bootable.  We would be grateful if any
sightings could be reported to us, especially if the Dropper program is
different from the one we have examined; we would also like a specimen of it,

Earlier this year, the New York Times published an anonymous op-ed piece about
Gorbachev's reforms.  Since the piece was quite pessimistic, speculation arose
about the author's identity.  The 19 February 1990 issue of The New Republic
has an article by Lionel Barber identifying the author as historian Martin
Malia at U. C.  Berkeley.  Among the reasons given for this choice was:

   The hardest evidence, however, comes from Berkeley's own history
   department.  According to a staff member whom I interviewed, Malia
   composed part of the Daedalus article [a longer version of the
   op-ed piece] on a departmental computer under the filename "PERES" -
   presumably a reference to perestroika, not the Israeli politician.
   The staff member called up the file on his own computer during our
   interview and read me lengthy passages, all of which were identical
   to passages in "To the Stalin Mausoleum" [the title of the Daedalus
   article].

A few pages further on in the same issue, Katie Hafner (who I believe
was causing a stir elsewhere on the network recently) has an article
on the Robert Morris trial.  Her conclusion was that Morris'
conviction was a small step for some abstract principle, but had
little or no relevance to practical concerns about computer crime.

Sunday's launch of the space shuttle was delayed because of problems with the
backup tracking computer used by the range safety officer.  According to the
Air Force, the problem was ``bad software''.  No word, at least in the stories
I've seen, about what the bug was, or about why it affected only the backup
computer -- or how long this bug has been present.

Idahonian/The Daily News, Weekend, February 17 &amp; 18, 1990

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Magellian spacecraft speeding toward cloud-shrouded
Venus on a $550 million mapping expedition, will need frequent commands
from Earth until NASA fixes a computer problem.
	Despite the failure of a computer chip on the spaceship, "there's
no threat to the mission," said Edwin Sherry, a technical assistant at
the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
	Until engineers locate the faulty chip, they must send Magellan
new commands every other day to make sure it is pointing in the proper
direction, Sherry said.
	He said a similar computer chip failure happened before Magellan
was launched and that such a failure is expected about once annually.
"You'd hope for zero faults like this," Sherry said.  "But they're
typical of working with state-of-the-art equipment.  It's remarkable we
have so few."
	Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4.  It will
go into a polar orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
	[Two paragraphs about the mission deleted.]
	The problem developed Sunday as the spacecraft got ready to take
a fix on two distant stars to make sure it was pointing the right way.  An
error was detected in a tiny part of Magellan's computer memory.
	The error prompted Magellan to shift to a backup computer and point
its solar panels toward the sun to increase the power supply.
	The failure was apparently the result of electrical corrosion at a
junction between two types of material on a single memory chip, leaving the
chip unable to remember anything, Sherry said.
	He said, however, engineers haven't yet ruled out the possibility
that the chip was damaged by an electrically charged particle spewed out
by the sun, which is near the peak of its 11-year cycle of activity.
	Magellan uses gyroscopes to sense when pressure from solar wind
makes the spacecraft drift slightly, or point in the wrong direction.  The
gyroscopes normally issure automatic commands to three spinning wheels,
which correct the spacecraft's alignment.
	Magellan's main computer is programmed to take a fix on the two
stars each day to determine the spacecraft's actual allignment.  If this
"star calibration" shows the gyroscopes failed to align Magellan correctly,
they again command the wheels to adjust the craft's position.

[Oh well, its only an AP staff reporter...]
[I recall that there is also some computer problem with Galileo, maybe
from an article in AAAS Science, but I haven't seen it on RISKS.]

Crash in India Rekindles Dispute over Safety of Airbus A320 Jet
(Steven Greenhouse, c.1990 N.Y. Times News Service, BRIEF EXCERPT)

   PARIS.  The crash of an Airbus A320 jet that killed 97 people in India last
week has reignited a dispute in France over whether the computerized, highly
advanced aircraft is too complicated to fly.  The French pilots union is urging
the airliner be grounded in France.  ``This plane is sometimes put into
operation by people who aren't qualified enough,'' said Jean-Claude Bidot,
secretary general of the French Airline Pilots Union. ``It's a supercomplicated
aircraft.''
   But the maker of the plane, the four-nation consortium known as Airbus
Industrie, said the plane was quite safe and the French pilots were opposing it
to protect their economic interests.  The plane uses two pilots; many other
aircraft use three.  [...]

This presumes that the error was made by one particular programmer.  But such
production code is surely the responsibility of a team of programmers, each
module being evaluated by more than one peer and supervisor.  All programmers
make errors.  The problem is why this "stupid programming error" survived
through to production.  Correcting the code does not correct this root problem;
and the root problem, failure to catch the error, may be less likely in other
languages.

&gt; if we can't expect our programmers to understand the language
&gt; with which they are programming, then what *can* we expect?

Certainly, we must expect programmers to make such mistakes whatever their
launguage, and however well they understand it.  Some languages do assist
error-catching more than others, APL being the extreme worst case, for example.

The BLISS family of languages originally had this hazardous multi-level break,
"EXIT[n]", but then they added (*sigh*) a better scheme. Any expression (and in
BLISS, *all* control structures such as begin/end, if/then, case, for/while
loops, etc, were expressions and could yield values) could have a label
attached, and from anywhere within that expression only you could say, "LEAVE
&lt;label&gt;" or "LEAVE &lt;label&gt; WITH &lt;value&gt;". That way, the thing being left stayed
constant even if you added or removed interior levels. Further, labels had to
be declared before being used (generally considered a pain, until the day it
saved you from a mispelling), and a label could be used -- attached to
something -- only once in the scope of its declaration.  (Of course, you could
have many LEAVE's inside a labelled structure.)  Outline:

		LABEL FOO;
		LOCAL X;
		&lt;other decl's&gt;...
		...
		X = FOO: WHILE (not_done)
			 DO
			     ...
				IF (condition)
				LEAVE FOO WITH 47;
			     ...
			 OD;		! yes, BLISS used CASE/ESAC, IF/FI, &amp;c.

The default value for a loop which exits "normally" is -1.

In my experience, the labels+LEAVE construct gave *much* more reliable code
than C's "break", or BLISS's old EXIT[&lt;num&gt;], or the like, while still avoiding
GOTOs. (And being able to deliver a value made writing common search loops
easy.)

There is little point to enumerating the vulerabilities of C; one could write a
book about them.  In fact, Andy Koenig already has: ``C Traps and Pitfalls'',
which I recommend to anyone using the language.  That is not the point,
however.  The real question is whether or not any real language is sufficiently
free of such traps as to significantly reduce the probability of errors.

To tremendously oversimplify the situation, languages that are higher-level
than C often achieve their power at the price of complexity.  This complexity
itself can can breed errors; see, for example, Hoare's comments on Ada, or
Koenig's early paper ``PL/I Traps and Pitfalls''.  To be sure, the power can
help avoid some bugs -- the ``fingerd'' bug that the Internet
virus/worm/parasite exploited could not have happened in PL/I because strings,
and in particular variable-length strings, are a built-in data type; one would
not have C's temptation to use fixed-size arrays.

On the other hand, languages that are ``safer'' than C often achieve their
safety by significantly restricting their expressive power.  This can have
several results.  First, the programmer must concentrate more on low-level
details again, with the concommitant pressure towards short cuts (i.e., fixed
length arrays -- Pascal, for example, does not even have malloc()).  Second,
the language may become unsuitable for large projects; again, Pascal comes to
mind.  Third, programmers will cheat -- move around the boundaries of the
language using escape hatches or arcange knowledge.

It may be that there is a suitable compromise.  There have certainly been
enough attempts; what is missing is convincing evidence that these actually
reduce the error rate in real life.  Note that by ``real life'', I specifically
include the lifetime history of real programs -- and that includes
modifications and changes over the years by many different people.  I assume
that there have been some attempts to measure this; I wouldd appreciate
citations.

The other approach often taken is to design languages that are in some sense
``suitable for verification''.  That is, features are inserted or omitted not
simply because of their complexity or aesthetics, but also because of their
effect on attempts to verify the program using formal methods.  Apart from the
aforementioned question of whether or not such languages are really suitable
for real programming problems, they do nothing in and of themselves to reduce
the error rate; they merely make it easier for a competent, well-trained
programmer with enough time to validate a program as its being written.  (Some
would claim that writing a program using formal methods will result in
less-buggy programs.  I will not dispute that here, except to note that that
requires more time up front -- and we all know how feasible that can be when on
a tight schedule, even if it seems likely to reduce total project time later
on.)

If such languages help, though, we are very far from our original ideal, which
was a technical solution to the problem.  Verifying programs, or constructing
them using formal methods, requires rather different, and arguably scarcer,
skills than are present in the programming population today.  It is thus a
people problem, and an educational one.  In fact, it is far from clear that
this will accomplish very much overall except to recast the obvious: that
better programmers write better programs.  Wasn't it Knuth who demonstrated
years ago that the best programmers produced code that was 4-5x faster *and*
4-5x smaller than the worst?

Our goal must be to let anyone write better programs.  The challenge is not
only devising the methods, but also demonstrating that they work.

&gt;     If the AT&amp;T programmer had coded "goto" instead of "break", ...

The reason the programmer would have had problems with his/her peers is that
(unconstrained) goto's greatly reduce the maintainability of the code.
Ultimately increasing the likelihood of failure.  In my experience, it has been
very rare that with a little more thought, I couldn't come up with a solution
that got rid of the need of a goto.  Non-local goto's are almost always a sign
of unwarranted complexity and that the design should be rethought.  By
the way, I am experienced in large scale complexity.  I have developed,
maintained and converted +million line programs.

Mark Brader's posting in <A HREF="/Risks/9.69.html">RISKS-9.69</A> about the reporter who reached the editor
who said "... computer telemarketing things" just goes to illustrate one of the
pervasive threads of this forum: Computer Aided Stupidity will have far more
impact on society than Computer Aided Intelligence for years to come.  Mark's
reporter and editor seem to be cases in point.

Automated systems such as this have easy mechanisms to allow the user to talk
to a live operator when the automated system doesn't meet their needs.  It does
have to occur to one or other of the users (in this case the reporter) that the
live operator would be a good idea.  Automation is brought about because of
consumer pressure brought on the PUCs which control the telephone operating
companies' rates.  If you would really prefer an all manual system, perhaps
next time your PUC is considering a rate application from your telephone
company, you will go along and tell them you don't think the phone company is
asking for enough.  By and large, this is an uncommon occurrence.

Perhaps we could all entertain ourselves with stories about how when you call
with these new fangled rotary dial phones, they don't even know that Millie is
always next door at Dottie's having coffee at this time of the morning like the
operator always knew.  I doubt if there ever was or will be an innovation
involving something we all use every day that doesn't let someone come up with
a story to convince himself he's (marginally) smarter than some machine.  Once
the new becomes familiar we usually really do end up in control of the
machines.

Unfortunately, we're all used to receiving multiple copies of the Risks digest
from time to time. However, when I got home today, I found twelve copies of
Software Engineering Notes at my front door. Apparently, somewhere along the
distribution line, the twelve copies were bundled together with my name and
address at the top. The other eleven are for various individuals spread out
through Ontario. The ordering of the journals is based on ACM membership
number.

An interesting Risks twist. I'll put the other eleven back in the postal system

BROCKVILLE (CP) - Ma Bell got a wrong number last month -- 17,000 times.  That
is the number of long-distance calls incorrectly charged to telephone numbers
in Iroquois, Ont.  A Bell Canada official has described the mistake, blamed on
computer error, as the company's biggest foul-up in years.

During the billing period from Jan. 12 to Feb. 16, calls made by residents of
Athens, Ont. were charged to customers in the Iroquois exchange.  [...]
I"ve never seen anything like this in my seven years as area manager," said Ron
Kristiansen, customer services manager for Bell's Brockville, Kingston and
Belleville exchange areas.  Some Iroquois customers reports they had been
charged for up to 40 long-distance calls they had not made, more than doubling
their monthly phone bills.

&gt; We talked about the
&gt; Airbus crash and it seems that in pilot circles it was attributed to the
&gt; fact that the older Airbus machines had Rolls-Royce engines. It seems that
&gt; when given full power they reacted about 3 seconds faster that those on
&gt; The A320. In his opinion these three seconds were vital. 

However, it's a totally different category of engine (CFM-56 vs. large-fan).
Different airplanes require different approaches, and "type conversion"
training is usually very thorough.  The pilots in question also had 300-odd
hours in type (each), 10,000+ hours of experience (each, distributed among
different aircraft types), and the captain (who was flying) was the chief of
A320 training for Air France.  What's noteworthy about the Mulhouse-Habsheim
crash was the lack of formal cockpit procedures and the lack of flight crew
experience in the type of maneuver performed.  It was almost definitely pilot
error.

&gt;a role in his judgement. On a side note the pilot also mentioned that the
&gt;757, which also has the fly by wire system, sometimes "hangs". The only
&gt;way to get the electronics to function again is to power cycle the lot.

That may be so, but it's not possible to extend the lesson to the A320, since
the design of the systems are totally different (the fundamental *design*
philosophy as regards pilot access to the electrical system is different, too).
And as a small note, the flight augmentation system of the 757 is in no way 
comparable to the A320's fly-by-wire system (or its associated software 
protections).  The former is dedicated to damping aerodynamic instability;
the former introduces new *control laws* and appears to be intended to work
around problems involved in the use of side-stick controllers.

This sentiment bugged me--light-footing it around safety-critical issues 
because they might reflect poorly of the policies of developing nations.  
Bugged me enough to write a rather long-winded response (which I'll be glad
to email to anyone who's interested in my ramblings).  Suffice it to say that
maintenance *is* a critical issue among all airlines operating new equipment,
and that the situation is *particularly* serious in developing nations.

&gt;required qualification. This would explain, why he asked the control tower to
&gt;make a manual landing on sight.  

The problems in this account are:

1.  No airline that I'm aware of performs simulated in-flight systems failures
on revenue flights.

2.  Airbus proper regards "manual" (electric horizontal stabilizer trim and
manual rudder) backup as a last-ditch emergency system.  Numerous reports 
indicate that its operation isn't even part of the standard Airbus training 
curriculum.  It's not something that a marginal pilot is likely to be playing 
with.  Marginal pilots tend to hide *within* automation, to become systems 
managers, rather than pilots.

3.  It's highly unusual for an aircraft to consult with an air traffic con-
trol facility on the operation of on on-board system (unless, of course,
the pilot expected to crash).  

The account sounds highly suspect.  Upon examination, various terms could
be examined--perhaps "manual" means hand-flying it (with protections)
to the ground, rather than tracking an ILS, and the tower wished to confirm
that the ILS wouldn't be used or something.  I don't know.  But note that if
this IS the case, the A320's "safety" features should prevent precisely this
sort of crash--the pilot should be able to fly to the surface, jerk
back on the stick, do the most violent maneuvers, etc--all without crashing
the airplane (that is, above 100', beneath which the protections disappear).

&gt; So again it is - only - human  malfunctioning (insufficient training,
&gt; bad management procedures, financial reasons ?).   Udo Voges

But then the question is: assuming that the systems ARE working properly, when
does it stop being "human error" and become poor ergonomics?  RISKS has
traditionally concentrated on software or hardware reliability issues, which
are in themselves important issues.  But don't forget that the very way the
pilot INTERACTS with the aircraft is also a safety issue, and the A320 has
thrown the lessons painfully learned over the past 80 years right out the
window.

Indeed, on a more general scale, the A320 is only the most extreme example
of a disturbing trend.  If one studies the different cockpit designs of 
airplanes introduced since 1981 (all of which use different display formats on 
CRT-based flight and engine instrumentation), one starts to recall the absolute
lack of standardization that was rampant during the 1920's, 30's, and 40's.  
When one considers the problems this will cause in training, and factors in 
pilot gullibility (perhaps believing what the manufacturer says about the
safety features of the airplane--I find it quite amusing that the pilot op-
ponents to excessive automation or fly-by-wire are being branded with '50's-
mentality "anti-progress" labels), I suggest that we can probably expect the 
same sort of safety records.

The A320 sidestick layout is asymmetric - the captain flies with the left hand,
the first officer with the right. This means that when the first officer is
flying in the left-hand seat - as will happen from time-to-time, e.g., for
training - there is the added unfamiliarity of using the other hand.

     is left-handed and *both* are flying with the *wrong* hand.  But the
     switching back and forth must undoubtably be confusing.  PGN]

I'm incredulous at the number of replies seeming to say, "No language
prohibits all errors, so we might as well use "C"".

Some 25 years ago, PL/I had named scopes.  You can say something like

Foo: BEGIN
...
  EXIT Foo;
...
  END Foo;

and the EXIT has a clearly-defined scope, irrespective of how many
intermediate levels of nesting there are.

   In RISKS 9.71, there seems to be a general discussion of programmer
error and its inevitability. I think that the entire discussion can be 
summarized as follows (sorry, I don't know who originally wrote this):
 
     The tendency to err which programmers have been noticed
     to share with other human beings has often been treated as
     if it were an awkwardness attendant upon programming's
     adolescence, which (like acne) would disappear with the
     craft's coming of age. It has proved otherwise.
 
   For years I avoided `C' because I was literally intimidated by the ease 
with which one can confuse oneself, such as:
 
#define square(x) ( x * x )
[...]
b = square( a++ );
 
   Eventually a wise friend pointed out that no language can hope to 
second-guess your intentions and point out possible errors in logic, and 
that few programmers could maintain their sanity near a compiler that did 
so. Since then I've developed a few rules of thumb, such as not modifying 
the contents of more than one variable per line wherever possible (a 
natural outgrowth of having done some assembler), and I have been able to 
put out occasional `C' code that is neither more nor less buggy on average 
than what I write in any other language - though that doesn't say much!

This is a most unusual RISK.  That famous paper put the poor GOTO so out of
vogue that programmers are actually afraid of using it -- they will make their
programs more complex and harder to understand in order to avoid using the
dreaded goto.

They do this out of fear of rejection.  Some great programmer will read
their code, see the "goto" and go tsk-tsk.  Horrors.

Because C has no multi level break or continue, the use of a goto to do loop
exception handling detracts in no way from the "structuredness" of the program.

But the fear of the stigma of goto has lead programmers to bugs, it seems.
Yet another example of a RISK due to fear of RISKS.

To lock is to block!  sometimes.

Due to a bug in SunOS 4.0.3, lockd (/usr/etc/rpc.lockd) will occasionally dump
core on NFS servers.  This happens silently and goes unnoticed until some NFS
client attempts to lock a file on that server.

As a result, a process requesting a file lock on a file will block on disk wait
indefinitely (`D' state report from ps) until lockd is restarted (manually) on
the NFS server for that file.

The quickest way to detect this is to check for a core file in /.
"file /core" will provide the name of the process which is responsible
for the core file.  Now, quickly check if that process is still around
using "ps".  If it is not, it is probably necessary to restart the
service manually.  In the case of lockd, it is sufficient to:

	cd / ; /usr/etc/rpc.lockd

to restart/restore the service.  The "cd" makes sure the next core
dump will go in / again, which is where we "expect" it.

   [Our MM -- but not RISKS' --was out of commission as a result of the lockd
   problem.  The LOCK-MESS MONSTER STRIKES AGAIN.  BY THE WAY, we are backing

A short while ago I passed a message I'd seen on the net (in RISKS?)
about railway interlocking to one of my colleagues here at Newcastle
who is very interested in such topics. He gave me permission to
forward his reply to RISKS, so here it is.

Brian Randell

   =======
&gt;From: J.A.Hunter@newcastle.ac.uk
With reference to:
&gt; Date: Fri, 5 Jan 90 09:49:21 CST
&gt; From: Douglas W. Jones &lt;jones@pyrite.cs.uiowa.edu&gt;
&gt; Subject: Railroad interlocking systems
&gt; [...]
&gt; I suspect that there are useful parallels between the history of railroad
&gt; interlocking machines and the more recent developments in safety critical
&gt; digital control systems.  An error in the logical design of an interlocking
&gt; machine could easily go undetected until it caused a train wreck, and I
&gt; wonder if old cases involving railroad interlocking machines might provide
&gt; useful precidents for many of the software liability questions that have been
&gt; raised recently.
 
There's one case in British railroad history of an interlocking frame being in
service for many years and then (apparently) causing a train wreck.  It
happened on February 14th, 1928 at Paragon Street station, Hull, in the East
Riding of Yorkshire.
 
The area had a large and complex track layout controlling several main and
secondary lines and freight routes to the local dockyards.  On that day two
trains met head on, one having been incorrectly routed onto the wrong track.
The signal box (control tower) in question would have had around two hundred
levers and had three signalmen in charge.
 
To understand the accident it is necessary to realise that signalling safety
depends on more than just the interlocking frame.  There are trackside devices
that "prove" the position of points and signals and prevent, for instance, a
signal being cleared if the switch it refers to has not been set appropriately,
with both blades in position and locked.  Additional equipment detects the
presence of a train to prevent a switch being moved under it.  These days this
is done using electrical track circuits, in which the presence of a train is
detected by the short-circuit through the axles from one rail to the other, but
in mechanical systems this was not always present and various mechanical
detectors were used.  One of these was a treadle fitted near to switches;
depressed by the flanges of the vehicles' wheels, it locked the switch in place
until cleared.
 
In the Hull accident, the signalmen were concerned not to delay a late running
train and one of them reset the signal cleared for train A after the locomotive
and three coaches had passed it.  At this point the locomotive was still thirty
feet from the trackside treadle which would lock the next switch during
passage.  During the time the train took to reach the treadle, less than a
second, it had effectively disappeared from the logic of the interlocking
frame.
 
During this "window" one of the other signalmen set the route for train B.
Working from the situation found after the accident, it was possible to show
that this second signalmen has mistakenly pulled levers 95 and 96 instead of
the correct 96 and 97.  Train A was then routed into the path of train B.  The
interlocking that would have prevented this had been disabled because the first
signalman had been too quick in cancelling the cleared signal, releasing the
interlock on the switch, and the trackside detection of the train had not yet
been triggered.
 
Clearly this type of accident requires a human presence.  The two signalmen
represent co-operating processes who failed to obey the rules on (human)
interlocks, and the machinery failed to limit their actions.  I suspect
that many aspects of railroad safety are probably of greater interest to
psychologists than to computer scientists.  Railroad interlocking frames
may represent some of the most reliable computer programs ever constructed,
but they are not immune from misuse by the "user".
 
In present-day railroad signalling systems, many more of the operations are
automatic and detection systems are more complete.  Modern British practice
requires that once a route has been set, a time delay of about one minute is
enforced by the software before a conflicting route can be set.  That such
systems are not perfect and still rely on human vigilance was shown by the
Clapham (South London) accident late in 1988 where a faulty track circuit train
detector "lost" a train standing at a signal allowing an automatic system to
route another train into the rear of it.

     ISBN 0-7153-8362-0
 
My copy is a 1982 fourth edition, but the book is is still in print.  The
information on the Hull accident above is my precis from a more detailed
study within that publication.

Physician Beatrice Golomb tells of a 99-year-old man who turned up in
the emergency room (JAMA, Dec. 8, 1989, page 3132).  His white blood
cell count,  although far out of line, was reported by the computer to
be within normal limits.  The computer, it turned out, was reporting
values for the newborn, having figured that year of birth, plugged in
as '89, was 1989, not 1889.  Golomb's comment:  "The normal ranges
provided by hospital computers are not always to be credited."

On Tuesday Feb. 27, 1990, the central computer that controls the traffic
light timing for the city of Lakewood (a major suburb of Denver) failed,
causing traffic delays of over 30 minutes. The computer system's disk
drive suffered a burnt and seized bearing, causing it shut itself down.
The replacement of the drive did not occur until the next evening.
Several interesting items related to this incident:

	1&gt; The system has exactly one drive. No redundancy (sp?). Of course,
they do backup the disk, however, since there is only one disk drive,
they had nowhere to put the backed data. (The disk crash apparently eat
the disk media). From past experience with supposedly critical computer
systems, it would seem that this is common. Concern about reliability of
computer systems to most operators of said systems seems to stop once
they are assured that no data will be lost. Of course, it never seems to
occur to them that if they cannot access that data it's useless.

	2&gt; All of Lakewood's traffic system is controlled by one computer. Need
I say more?

	3&gt; The traffic system was apparently design under the impression that a
computer failure would be virtually impossible. When the computer failed,
traffic lights had no fall back mechanism for running under a reasonable cycle
time. Each light had to be manually set by city traffic crews.

One wonders if this kind of traffic control system is representative of
common practice. If so, think - you could immobilize a major urban area
by knocking out three or four computer systems.

[Quoting J.A.Hunter via Brian Randell]
&gt; Modern British practice requires that once a route has been set, a time delay
&gt; of about one minute is enforced by the software before a conflicting route
&gt; can be set.

The actual practice is that if the signal governing entry to the route is at
"Danger", the route can be cancelled immediately (by pulling the button for
that route on the panel). If the signal is in any other state (i.e. a train
could legally pass it), then the route is locked for a while. Simple locking
locks the route for 2 minutes (not 1). Comprehensive locking only locks the
route if there is a train near enough to the signal to be affected by it
turning red, and waits until that train has come to a stop at the signal (e.g.
has occupied a 200m track circuit at the signal for 30 seconds). If a train
passes a signal at Danger, points ahead of that signal are locked
automatically.

&gt; That such systems are not perfect and still rely on human vigilance was shown
&gt; by the Clapham (South London) accident late in 1988 where a faulty track
&gt; circuit train detector "lost" a train standing at a signal allowing an
&gt; automatic system to route another train into the rear of it.
This accident was caused by faulty installation. At the time, the signalling
system was being replaced by a new one, and a wire had been removed from the
logic concerned with a certain track circuit. The wire had not been cut back
and had its end insulated, but was just bent out of the way. Later work on
that logic disturbed the wire, and it came back into contact with the terminal
it had been removed from. It then fed current into the logic, making it appear
as if the track was clear. This allowed the signal to turn green.
 
&gt; A good source book for information on British railroad safety is:

&gt;    published by David &amp; Charles Inc. (North Pomfret, Vermont 05053),

Not just a good book, but the definitive one. The current edition has been
updated by Geoffrey Kitchenside.

   This is not a new risk.  Older generation aircraft that have yolks instead
of sidesticks are flown in exactly the same manner.  Throttles are usually
located in the center panel, and both pilots use their inboard hand for
throttles, and their outboard hand to manipulate the yoke.  Sidestick
controllers just change the position of the hand, but not which hand is used.
There are other differences in the use of sidesticks (such as lack of
interconnection on the Airbus), but in handedness they are similar to
conventional controls.

   Switching hands with which one flies is generally viewed as a non-problem.
Pilots get used to switching seats and the hands they fly with early on in
their training, usually well before they step into a jet airliner cockpit.  On
a frequent basis I switch between right and left seats and between aircraft
yokes (which are flown with the left hand from the left seat) and sticks (which
are flown with the right hand from the left seat.  The process is natural and
not at all confusing.

   I have not seen any reports that indicate that there is a significant
problem in switching, although that doesn't prove that there is no loss of
performance.  Pilots reports of difficulty with this are rare (at least, in my
experience).

    It is far more difficult to change between aircraft types, or even between
individual aircraft of the same type, when the positions of instruments and
secondary controls vary.  Problems arising from such differences are well
documented and have been identified as causal in numerous accidents.

The New York Times has recently had two articles on avionics.
On Feb 14, the Business Technology column featured "McDonnell's
Less Costly New Jet", the MD-11, which is 16% cheaper to fly than the
DC-10, and is intended to "fill a niche" between Boeing's 767 and 747.

  The plane contains an automated cockpit that the company calls the
  world's most advanced, as well as more fuel-efficient engines, some
  lighter-weight parts and aerodynamic refinements like a shortened tail.

But, later we find that

  The plane is a prime example of how aircraft manufacturers are hesitant to
  introduce new technology if it does not translate into savings for the
  airlines.  "High technology isn't necessarily what an airline	wants," said
  Dale Warren, a vice president at Douglas.  "They're in business to make a
  profit."  For example, the company replaced only a few aluminum parts with
  lightweight composite materials, which are more expensive, and chose not to
  use a "fly by wire" electronic control system, in part because of its cost.

A few paragraphs describe the cockpit:

  The most dramatic change to the DC-10 is in its cockpit, which Douglas says
  is the world's most automated.  The plane will have two pilots, compared with
  three in the DC-10; the flight engineer has been replaced by computers that
  automatically perform duties like monitoring fuel flow and adjusting cabin
  pressure.

  The computers can, to some extent, "think" for the pilots, switching valves
  if something should go wrong.  Pilots watch six video displays run by
  computers instead of the dozens of mechanical gauges and dials on the DC-10.
  "Essentially, the pilot pushes a button at the end of the runway and the
  system will guide the plane to the concrete at the destination," sayd George
  Wallace, program manager for Honeywell Inc., which makes the cockpit
  electronics for the plane.

  While similar automated cockpits--already in place on Boeing aircraft and
  Douglas's MD-80 plane--have won prais, pilots have also expressed concern
  that their basic flying skills may atrophy.

  Douglas chose to use a conventional control system, in which the controls are
  operated from the cockpit by mechanical means rather than electronically by
  computers in a new system as "fly by wire" that is used on some Airbus jets.
	
The article ends by noting that flight testing is 6 months behind schedule.

The Sunday Business section on Feb 18th had a long article "All About:
Avionics".  This mentioned that "Cockpit electronics have become sophisticated
enough to all but take the place of the pilot. ... With the push of a few
buttons, autopilots can guide a plane from NY to LA while the real pilot sits
back."

The electronics may cost $1M, or 10% of the plane's price.  The article notes
that American companies (Bendix/King, Collins Avionics, and Honeywell) dominate
the market.  Other companies would have a hard time entering the market because
of the need for government approval of the systems.

Some problems are discussed:

  The biggest advantage of the glass cockpit is that the black boxes can
  talk to one another.  The on-board computers can calculate an altitude for
  the greatest fuel efficiency and the autopilot can guide the plane there.

  Most pilots like the new technology, with some reservations.  If something
  goes wrong, the problem may be hard to detect.  "Trouble-shooting is a more
  delicate art than before," said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS
  Securities.  And a three-year NASA study of 200 Boeing 757 pilots found that
  they were concerned about spending too much time staring at computer screens
  and not enough looking out the windows.  They also worried that their basic
  flying skills would atrophy as they spent more time punching keypads.  "I was
  somewhat concerned with the 'I can't fly but I can type 80 words per minute'
  syndrome," said one pilot.  Still, about 90% of the pilots saw the glass
  cockpit as a big step forward.
  
Evidently, new FAA rules will require more electronics by 1993, to warn
of impending collisions and warn of wind shear.  The companies that
make the electronics seem happy about this new business.  Other
future possibilities mentioned include storing flight maps on optical disk,
exchanging written messages with flight controllers by 'datalink',
and moving to satellite communication and navigation.

The last paragraph mentions that

  Another project sounds like it could all but replace the co-pilot.  The Air
  Force boldly calls it the "pilot associate."  More than a mere autopilot, the
  associate devices use artificial intelligence to help fly the plane, plan
  missions and deploy weapons.  The project is in such an early stage that it
  will take several years to find its way into jet fighters and, eventually,
  commercial planes.

Note that the concerns expressed in these articles are only about the pilot's
own skills decreasing, and not at all about possible mistakes on the part of
the computer system.  The only reason given for not using fly-by-wire is
economic.

Doubts about Indian engineers and RISKS faced by developing countries.

Regarding the A320 crash, George Michaelson &lt;ggm@cc.uq.oz.au&gt; writes:
&gt;Doubts were expressed about the ability of the airline to maintain the
&gt;complex flight control equipment ...
&gt;... it seems from this interview as if the Indian
&gt;engineers themselves question their ability to handle this package.
&gt;                              ^^^^^

Indians are extremely annoyed with the performance of the state-run
domestic carrier Indian Airlines, which has a long history of
incredible management problems aggravated by political interference.
Many Indians would agree with those doubts directed at the ability of
*that airline*, but few would accept those doubts directed at Indians
engineers *in general*. This is not the forum to enumerate the
technological sophistication that Indians have demonstrated. Suffice
it to say that the interpretation of the word *their* in George
Michaelson's analysis is difficult to swallow.

&gt;I suspect other parallels exist with well-meaning donation/supply of IT
&gt;infrastructure that failed to match local conditions eg lack of tropical
&gt;"hardening", availability of spike-free UPS, spares, training.

You are right here. Often, however, developing countries are taken for
a ride! I was involved in the assembly of a Flying Spot Scanner at the
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, using equipment imported from
a reputed company in the UK. One of the crucial power supplies blew up
when powered up. We traced the problem to incorrect wiring (the
connections to the collector and emitter of a transistor were
reversed, if I remember right). It was evident that the unit *had
never been powered up before shipment*, let alone tested; but the
company refused to admit it, making sly references instead to our lack
of training. We gave up the idea of litigation because of the high
costs involved. Please think for a moment about the RISKs FACED BY
developing countries.

A few misunderstandings seem to be creeping into the debate on the A320.
At the risk of adding my own misunderstandings, let me try to clarify a few 
points raised in <A HREF="/Risks/9.71.html">RISKS-9.71</A> by Steve Milunovic and <A HREF="/Risks/9.72.html">RISKS-9.72</A> by Robert Dorsett.

Steve Milunovic (9.71) refers to:
&gt; ... a dispute in France over whether the computerized, highly advanced
&gt; aircraft is too complicated to fly.

One justification for introducing fly-by-wire as in the A320 is that, since
most crashes are due to pilot error, a system that reduces the probability
of such error will make flying safer. There are two aspects to this:

 - Reduction in the pilot's workload.

 - Automatically preventing a command from the pilot taking the aircraft out
   of a 'safe flight envelope', e.g. overriding a command to put the nose up
   and throttle back if this would cause a stall.

To achieve these aims, the A320 must be EASIER to fly than than its
predecessors. It has been argued (I think by one of the pilots' unions) that 
being trained to fly the A320 does not qualify a pilot to fly a 'traditional'
('fly-by-string'?) aircraft, in the same way that a driving test taken in an
automatic does not qualify a motorist to drive a vehicle with a standard*
gearbox.

(The issue of MAINTENANCE, as opposed to flying the aircraft, is a different
matter, and I am inclined to agree with Robert Dorsett on this.)

He also refers to a claim that:
&gt; ... the French pilots were opposing it to protect their economic interests. 
&gt; The plane uses two pilots; many other aircraft use three.

To be precise, the crew of a traditional aircraft of the size of the A320
includes a pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer. The flight engineer's job is
to monitor the systems on the aircraft and recover from, or work around, system
failures. Along with fly-by-wire, the A320 includes automatic monitoring of
systems with a CRT display of their status to the pilot and co-pilot. The
argument is that this reporting system does most of the job of the flight
engineer, who is therefore redundant.

Part of the economic justification for the A320 is, therefore:

 - Room for one more passenger.

 - Save the flight engineer's salary.

It is the French and Australian flight ENGINEERS' unions who have argued most
strongly against two-man crews. Their vested interest is obvious, but they have
made a strong case on the grounds of safety for the traditional division of
labour between flying the plane and watching dials. This case was well
presented in a BBC television program in the 'Horizon' series a year or so ago
called 'The Essential Third Man'.

(I believe that one inducement that was offered to the pilots was increased
rates for two-man crews. I am not sure what the current positions of the various
pilots' unions are. If they still oppose the loss of the engineer, I would say
it is to their credit.)

Steve also points out:
&gt; ... as a small note, the flight augmentation system of the 757 is in no way
&gt; comparable to the A320's fly-by-wire system (or its associated software
&gt; protections).  The former is dedicated to damping aerodynamic instability;
&gt; the former [latter? - PM] introduces new *control laws* and appears to be
&gt; intended to work around problems involved in the use of side-stick
&gt; controllers.

Er..., not QUITE. The software in the A320 Electronic Flight Control System
(EFCS) is right at the heart of the whole system. The traditional joy-stick
between the pilot's legs has been replaced by the side-stick because, since the
connection between the pilot and the control surfaces on the wings is electrical
rather than mechanical, brute force is no longer necessary to move the controls.
The side-stick transmits the commands of the pilot to the EFCS, which processes
them together with input from sensors (air-speed indicator, altimeter, etc.) and
sends signals to the effectors governing the control surfaces.

The 'control laws' define how this processing is done. They are implemented as
tables of parameters. There are several sets of laws, each controlling a
particular mode of flight (take-off, cruising, landing, etc.). I am puzzled
by Robert Dorsett's aside:

&gt;... (that is, above 100', beneath which the protections disappear).

The protections CANNOT disappear at any altitude, however low. Perhaps he means
that at this phase of the flight a different set of control laws come into
force. Robert quite correctly states that:

&gt; Airbus proper regards "manual" (electric horizontal stabilizer trim and
&gt; manual rudder) backup as a last-ditch emergency system.  Numerous reports
&gt; indicate that its operation isn't even part of the standard Airbus training
&gt; curriculum. 

I believe they train to use manual backup on a simulator. I believe also that
an actual landing using manual backup has been demonstrated by a test pilot,
but that the ability to do such a landing was not required as part
of the type certification. The EFCS is 'flight-critical' (if it fails under
certain circumstances it could result in a catastrophic accident), but not
FULL-TIME flight-critical (its availability need not be 100%, since the
mechanical backup will enable the aircraft to cruise straight and level while
the system is rebooted).

Whatever the details, however, the point is that there is NO WAY that the A320
would be flown on a commercial flight without the EFCS, except in an emergency.

He goes on to say:

&gt; Upon examination, various terms could be examined [You can say that again!-PM]
&gt; --perhaps "manual" means hand-flying it (with protections) to the ground,
&gt; rather than tracking an ILS.

I'm inclined to agree. This confusion over the meaning of "manual" also
bedeviled the accounts of the previous crash.

The point of the slow fly-past at the Mulhouse-Habsheim air show was to
demonstrate the ability of the EFCS to fly the aircraft very close to stalling
without actually doing so. Without such an automatic system, such a manoeuvre
simply would not be possible. Loose statements to the effect that the automatic
system was 'switched off' for the demonstration are nonsense. What probably WAS
done was to set up the EFCS so that cruise 'control laws' still applied at low
altitude, but this is pure speculation on my part, and I should not open my
mouth too wide without hard information as a backup.

To avoid rambling on ad nauseam, I will make two last points:

 - The EFCS is not the only flight-critical software controlled system on the
   A320. The Full-Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) is just as vital,
   and obviously must act in cooperation with the EFCS. I have a fair amount
   of information on the fault-tolerant hardware and software architecture of
   the EFCS, but I do not know of anything that has been published about the
   FADEC.

 - The overriding concern regarding type-certification of fly-by-wire is our
   continuing inability to certify systems containing software to high levels
   of reliability. FAA and CAA regulations (taken in conjunction with
   explanatory memos) require that a flight-critical system must have a
   demonstrated probability of failure no greater than 10^-9 per flying hour
   in a flight of mean duration. The same set of documents state that no means
   exist of assigning such a probability number to software-induced failure.
   Certification in this case largely rests on the demonstration of adherence
   to a development process standard (RTCA-DOC/178A), together with provision of
   fault-tolerance.

It is this latter anomaly that research should address urgently.

*Note for US readers: A vehicle with a standard gearbox has a third pedal
 called the 'clutch', and a wobbly lever next to the driver's seat which has
 to be moved every time you change speed.

Mileage Plus is United's travel bank.  I can redeem miles traveled on United
Airlines along with dollars spent on my Mileage Plus Visa card for free travel
rewards.

I just finished a conversation with a United Mileage Plus representative,
informing her for the FIFTH time that my zip code is 91125 rather than 91102.
Each time their computer changes the zip code back to 91102 in a way that they
cannot override.  I get no mail from them.

The problem is that Caltech has its own zip code.  My address is

	Tim Kay, 	Caltech, 256-80, 	Pasadena, CA  91125

The representative checked further and explained that their computer "knows"
that Pasadena doesn't have a 91125 zip code.  (They then somehow come up with
91102 totally bogus; 91106 is the surrounding zip code.)  Could I please give
them my home address instead?  No, I don't check my mail box at home.

She had no further suggestions.  I guess I'd have to stop using their services
until I move!

I suggested we try

	Tim Kay, 	Box 256-80, 	Caltech, CA  91125

I can't wait to see what happens.

Something interesting that I heard was going on at [eastern college] was that a
couple of students were able to get a hold of a credit-card magnetic strip
recorder somehow.  They also stole purses, wallets, anything that they could
get their hands on that had credit cards in it.

After doing the above, they would dig through dumpsters (we all know that
story) and pick up carbons or other receipts that have credit card numbers on
them, and make a list of valid card numbers.

Using the encoding machine, they then erased the old card number off of the
magnetic strip (which had probably been reported stolen by this time) and
encoded on that same strip one of the card numbers that they had picked up out
of the dumpsters.

So now they have say a MasterCard with an invalid number embossed on the front
of it, and a different-but-valid account on the magnetic strip.  What good is
this?  Plenty good for the clever thief!

They then went into shopping malls or anywhere that the credit-card validation
machines were the all-too-familiar "slide the card through and read the number
off the mag strip" type.

The merchant would authorize the card successfully and get an approval code,
then run the card though and get a paper receipt.  The merchants never check
the card number on the authorization machine display and compare it to that of
the card!

When the merchants send in the credit card slips to the bank, they of course
come back, and I imagine it takes a long time to figure out what exactly
happened.

Merchants beware!

Below are excerpts from three reports related to the Feb. 14th Airbus crash
which appeared in the weekly edition of The Statesman, an English language
newspaper published from Calcutta and New Delhi.

   Madras [India], Feb 17.  -- An Indian Airlines A-320 aircraft, on a
   scheduled flight from here to Bangalore this morning, developed a
   snag in mid-air and was brought back safely.

   When the aircraft was airborne for 20 minutes and was halfway to
   Bangalore, there was a drop in cabin pressure and passengers
   complained of suffocation.  It was flown back and grounded and the
   passengers were transferred to a Boeing-737 and flown to Bangalore.

   The day after the A-320 aircraft crashed in Bangalore [on Feb.  14]
   killing 90 passengers one of the engines of another A-320 Airbus
   failed as the aircraft was getting ready for take-off from Begum
   airport in Hyderabad for Madras.  The flight was aborted.

   Alarmed by the frequent snags, Indian Airlines pilots are wary of
   flying the A-320 Airbus, the most sophisticated civilian aircraft
   anywhere in the world.

   The fly-by-wire system of computer-driven controls used in the
   A-320 is common to Mirage-2000 fighter planes also.  The Indian Air
   Force has built air-conditioned hangars in Gwalior for its Mirage
   fleet but Indian Airlines has not even provided ordinary hangars
   for its A-320 aircraft.  Two of its grounded A-320 were parked in
   the open for two months, one in Bombay and the other in Delhi,
   exposed to heat, dust and moisture.         ...

[On Feb.  18, the Civil Aviation Ministry grounded all 14 Airbus aircraft in
the Indian Airlines fleet pending an official inquiry.  Delivery of 12 more
A-320 aircraft on order has also been suspended.  -nb]

   New Delhi, Feb.  15.  -- Preliminary investigations into the Airbus
   crash at Bangalore yesterday are reported to be focusing on the
   sudden drop in height of the aircraft as it was on its final
   approach for landing at the runway of the airport, reports PTI
   [Press Trust of India].

   According to Civil Aviation Ministry sources here today, there was
   no distress signal from the pilot to the control tower and the
   aircraft appeared set for a smooth landing before the sudden drop
   under clear weather conditions.

   The sources said it was possible that the pilot either misjudged
   the height at which he was flying or he was misled by the
   instruments on board...

    Bangalore, Feb.  14.  --       ...

   [The Civil Aviation Minister Arif Mohammad Khan] said the pilot
   [Captain S.  S.  Gopujkar, who was in command of the flight] was
   one of the most experienced in Indian Airlines and even
   manufacturers of the Airbus had placed him in the "excellent pilot"
   category after he underwent training.  "He was flying the aircraft
   and it is a mystery how the accident happended", Mr Khan said.

[See, in contrast, the report translated from Badische Neueste Nachrichten 22
Feb 90 by Udo Voges in Risks 9.70. - nb]

The following is from Indian Abroad, March 2, 1990, published from New York.

   New Delhi -- Even as the Airbus Industrie launched a campaign to
   undermine [sic] the expertise of Indian Airlines' Airbus pilots in
   the French media, the Indian government continued to persist with
   its apprehensions about the aircraft.

   A technical committee armed with comprehensive terms of reference
   began a probe into the whole Airbus affair last week.  ...

   The five-member expert committee announced by Civil Aviation
   Minister Arif Mohammed Khan, would go into Indian Airlines' state
   of preparedness to safely operate the Airbus.  ...

   The issue of the Airbus' safety has become a national one with
   important newspapers making editorial comments.  The Indian press
   has urged the Indian government to thoroughly examine the safety
   aspects of the plane before allowing [it] to fly once again.   ...

Pilot to blame for Airbus-Crash
(translated from Badische Neueste Nachrichten, 9 March 1990)

Paris (dpa). The crash of an Airbus A320 in India in mid February, in which 90
people were killed, is due to carelessness of the pilot. This was found after
analysis of the tape from the cockpit. In Paris it was announced, that the
function of the airplane was not in question.  According to the announcement,
the analysis of the tape showed that the pilot of the crashed airplane of
Indian Airlines was training the copilot during landing. In the course of this
he didn't pay sufficient attention that the airplane should keep its required
speed. This was announced from well-informed French sources.  The Indian
Government has gotten a preliminary report, in which the reopening of the use
of the Indian A320 is recommended.

Martin Minow contributes some SAGE anecdotes in RISKS 9.68, including the
following.
&gt; My friend also mentioned that the graphics system could be used to display
&gt; pictures of young women that were somewhat unrelated to national defense
&gt; -- unless one takes a very long view -- with the light pen being used
&gt; to select articles of clothing that were considered inappropriate in the
&gt; mind of the viewer.  (Predating the "look and feel" of MacPlaymate by
&gt; almost 30 years.)  Perhaps Les could expand on this; paying special
&gt; consideration to the risks involved in this type of programming.

While light pens did exist in that period, SAGE actually used light
_guns_, complete with pistol grip and trigger, in keeping with military
traditions.  Interceptors were assigned to bomber targets on the large
displays by "shooting" them in a manner similar to photoelectric arcade
games of that era.

Regrettably, I never witnessed the precursor to MacPlaymate, which
probably appeared after my involvement.  While I never saw anything bare
on the SAGE displays, a colleague (Ed Fredkin) did stir up some trouble by
displaying a large Bear (a Soviet bomber of that era) as a vector drawing
that flew across the screen.  Unfortunately, he neglected to deal with X, Y
register overflow properly, so it eventually overflew its address space.
The resulting collision with the edge of the world produced some bizarre
imagery, as distorted pieces of the plane came drifting back across the
screen.

(Continuing from RISKS 9.67)

A horde of command-control development projects was initiated by the Air
Force in the early 1960s.  Most were given names and each was assigned a
unique three digit code followed by "L."  Naturally, they came to be
called called "L-systems."  A Program Manager (usually a Colonel) was put
in charge of each one to ensure that financial expenditure goals were met.
Those who consistently spent exactly the amounts that had been planned
were rewarded with larger sums in succeeding budgets.  Monthly management
reviews almost never touched on technical issues and never discussed
operational performance -- it was made clear that the objective was to
spend all available funds by the end of the fiscal year and that nobody
cared much about technical or functional accomplishments.

In 1960, after earlier switching from MIT Lincoln Lab to Mitre Corp., my
group was assigned to provide technical advice to a Colonel M., who was in
charge of System 438L.  This system was intended to automate the
collection and dissemination of military intelligence information.  Unlike
most command-control systems of that era, it did not have a descriptive
name that anyone used -- the intelligence folks preferred cryptic
designations, so the various subsystems being developed under this program
were generally called just "438L."

I had recently done a Masters thesis at MIT in the field of artificial
intelligence and hoped to find applications in this new endeavor.  I soon
learned that the three kinds of intelligence have very little in common
(i.e. human, artificial, and military).

IBM was the system contractor for 438L and was already at work on an
intelligence database system for the Strategic Air Command Headquarters
near Omaha.  They were using an IBM 7090 computer with about 30 tape
drives to store a massive database.  It turned out to be a dismal failure
because of a foreseeable variant of the GIGO problem, as discussed below.

The IBM 438L group had also developed specifications for a smaller system
that was to be developed for other sites.  Colonel M. asked us to review
the computer Request for Proposals that they had prepared.  He said that
he planned to buy the computer sole-source rather than putting it out for
bids on the grounds that there was "only one suitable computer available."
When I read it, there was no need to guess which computer he had in mind
-- the RFP was essentially a description of the IBM 1410, a byte-serial,
variable word length machine of that era.

When Colonel M. sought my concurrence on the sole-source procurement, I
demurred, saying there there were at least a half-dozen computers that
could do that job.  I offered to prepare a report on the principal
alternatives, including an approximate ranking of their relative
performance on the database task.  He appeared vexed, but accepted my
offer.

My group subsequently reviewed alternative computers and concluded that
the best choice, taking into account performance and price, was the Bendix
G-20.  I reported this informally to Colonel M. and said that we would
write it up, but he said not to bother.  He indicated that he was very
disappointed in this development, saying that it was not reasonable to
expect his contractor (IBM) to work with a machine made by another
company.  I argued that a system contractor should be prepared to work
with whatever is the best equipment for the job, but Col. M seemed
unconvinced.

This led to a stalemate; Colonel M. said that he was "studying" the
question of how to proceed, but nothing further happened for about a year.
Finally, just before I moved to another project, I mentioned that the IBM
1410 appeared to be capable of doing the specified task, even though it
was not the best choice.  Col. M. apparently concluded that I would not
make trouble if he proceeded with his plan.  I later learned that he
initiated a sole-source procurement from IBM just two hours after that
conversation.

In the meantime, the development project at SAC Headquarters was falling
progressively further behind schedule.  We talked over this problem in my
group and one fellow who had done some IBM 709 programming remarked that
he thought he could put together some machine language macros rather
quickly that would do the job.  True to his word, this hacker got a query
system going in one day!  I foolishly bragged about this to the manager of
the IBM group a short time later.  Two weeks after that I discovered that
he had recruited my hotshot programmer and immediately shipped him to
Omaha.  I learned to be more circumspect in my remarks thereafter.

The IBM 438L group did eventually deliver an operable database system to
SAC, but turned out to be useless because of GIGO phenomena (garbage in,
garbage out).  Actually, it was slightly more complicated than that.
Let's call it GIGOLO -- Garbage In, Gobbledygook Obliterated, Late Output.

The basic problem was that in order to build a structured database, the
input data had to be checked and errors corrected.  In this batch
environment, the tasks of data entry, error checking, correction, and file
updating took several days, which meant that the operational database was
always several days out of date.

The manual system that this was supposed to replace was based on people
reading reports and collecting data summaries on paper and grease pencil
displays.  That system was generally up-to-date and provided swift answers
to questions because the Sergeant on duty usually had the answers to the
most likely questions already in his head or at this finger-tips.  So much
for the speed advantage of computers!

After several months of operation with the new computer system, the
embarrassing discovery was made that no questions were being asked of it.
The SAC senior staff solved this problem by ordering each duty officer to
ask at least two questions of the 438L system operators during each shift.
After several more months of operation we noted that the total number of
queries had been exactly two times the number of shifts in that period.

The fundamental problem with the SAC 438L system was that the latency
involved in creating a database from slightly buggy data exceeded the
useful life of the data.  The designers should have figured that out going
in, but instead they plodded away at creating this expensive and useless
system.  On the Air Force management side, the practice of hiring a
computer manufacturer to do system design, including the specification of
what kind of computer to buy, involved a clear conflict-of-interest,
though that didn't seem to worry anyone.

&gt;From the Toronto /Globe and Mail/, 9 March 90:

  The much-hyped launch of Chantale Daigle's* book took a bizarre twist
  yesterday as the publisher ordered that all 40,000 copies be burned and
  a corrected version be issued.
  
  ``We made a serious technical error.  We printed the working copy of
  the (computer) disc instead of the final, edited version,'' said Monique
  Summerside, a spokesman [sic] for Les Editions 7 Jours Inc.
  She said that the changes to be made were strictly grammatical and 
  typographical, and were not due to the threat of a lawsuit.  ``This is
  very embarrassing and even more expensive, but we have a obligation to
  the public to provide a good product.''

  . . . The book was scheduled to go on sale yesterday . . . but
  distribution was delayed until Monday because of the recall.

	[*Chantale Daigle was at the centre of a controversial
	Canadian court case concerning abortion last year.]

     [A Toronto Star article from the same day was submitted by David Sherman,
     dave@lsuc.on.ca, who wondered how likely would it have been for a printer 
     to accidentally print from an earlier draft when using pre-computer

     involved -- the old version was simply not around anymore!  But it would

Unlawful computer use leads to arrests
ALEX H. LIEBER, Collegian Staff Writer

Two men face charges of unlawful computer use, theft of services in a
preliminary hearing scheduled for this morning at the Centre County Court of
Common Pleas in Bellefonte.  David Geyer, 234 S. Allen St., and Robert W.
Clark, 201 Twin Lake Drive, Gettysburg, were arrested Friday in connection with
illegal use of the University computer system, according to court records.
Geyer, 36, is charged with the theft of service, unlawful computer use
and criminal conspiracy.  Clark, 20, is charged with multiple counts of
unlawful computer use and theft of service.  [...]

Clark, who faces the more serious felony charges, allegedly used two computer
accounts without authorization from the Center of Academic Computing or the
Computer Science Department and, while creating two files, erased a file from
the system.  [...]  When interviewed by University Police Services, Clark
stated in the police report that the file deleted contained lists of various
groups under the name of "ETZGREEK."  Clark said the erasure was accidental,
resulting from an override in the file when he tried to copy it over onto a
blank file.  According to records, Clark is accused of running up more than
$1000 in his use of the computer account.  Geyer is accused of running up more
than $800 of computer time.

Police began to investigate allegations of illegal computer use in November
when Joe Lambert, head of the university's computer department, told police a
group of people was accessing University computer accounts and then using those
accounts to gain access to other computer systems.  Among the systems accessed
was Internet, a series of computers hooked to computer systems in industry,
education and the military, according to records.

The alleged illegal use of the accounts was originally investigated by a
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie-Mellon University, which assists
other worldwide computer systems in investigating improper computer use.

Matt Crawford, technical contact in the University of Chicago computer
department discovered someone had been using a computer account from Penn State
to access the University of Chicago computer system.

In RISKS 9.71, R. Clayton quotes an article in the New Republic which gave
astounding "evidence" for the attribution of an anonymous article based on
claimed textual correspondence between it and a file on a computer. (I
assume that Clayton's submission was concerned with the lack of security of
the computer file.) The New Republic article said:

   The staff member called up the file on his own computer during our
   interview and read me lengthy passages, all of which were identical
   to passages in "To the Stalin Mausoleum" [the title of the Daedalus
   article].

What kind of evidence is this? Even if the reporter had personally seen the
file on the screen, it means nothing. File ownership is easily faked. And
since passages were read to the reporter, it was probably a telephone
interview. "Yes, I've got the article right here on my computer screen..."
Wow. I have a bridge to sell to that reporter.

In Risks 9.69, Donald B. Weschler writes:

&gt; The Prodigy system accesses remote subscribers' disks to check the
&gt; Prodigy software version used, and when necessary, downloads the latest
&gt; programs.  ...  I asked Prodigy how they protect against the possibility
&gt; of altering subscribers' non-Prodigy programs, or reading their personal
&gt; data.  ...  According to Prodigy, the feature cannot be disabled. 

This issue was debated at length on the PRODIGY service several months
ago; an explanation was given by Harold Goldes, one of the PRODIGY
service's more technically knowledgeable user-support people.  The
"programs" updated by the PRODIGY software are not executable files
loadable by the PC's operating system; it is not even clear that it is
code executable by the PC's CPU.  Rather, routines to draw the
individual graphics displays used by the PRODIGY software are cached on
the user's disk in a single file, STAGE.DAT, and this cache is updated
via normal cache-updating algorithms.  The PRODIGY software is unable to
update the DOS-executable object programs automatically, and has to send
out new disks when this is necessary.  The explanation given in the
_PRODIGY_Star_ newsletter was an overly-abbreviated version, limited in
technical detail by the PRODIGY service's orientation to nontechnical
people, and, no doubt, by space limitations. 

Nevertheless, due the PC's lack of security mechanisms, the possibility
of altering subscriber's programs or reading personal data does exist on
any such system.  PRODIGY representatives have repeatedly stated that
the PRODIGY software will not do this, and my examination of the
operation of the software has not shown any evidence that any file other
than STAGE.DAT is updated. 

A topic that has not been so clearly answered is what some users feel to
be the PRODIGY service's overuse of its built-in censorship facilities
and its employment of "over 100" censors; they feel the PRODIGY sevice
uses this facility to control the expression of opinions on the
service's bulletin boards which may adversely affect marketing goals.

From: AirLine Pilot, February 1990:

NASA BUILDING TECHNOLOGY BASE FOR HUMAN-CENTERED AUTOMATION

NASA has launched a research program aimed at improving aviation safety by
developing and applying what it calls "human-centered automation" for flight
crews and air traffic controllers.  The agency hopes to develop, by 1994, a
design for both a cockpit and a controller station that are both intelligent
and human centered.

According to NASA documents developed for a recent NASA conference on aviation
safety and automation, the agency's goal is to "provide the technology base
leading to improved safety of th national airspace system through development
and integration of human-centered automation technologies for aircraft crews
and air traffic controllers."

Automation, says NASA, "can improve the efficiency, capacity, and dependab-
ility of the national aviation system."  But, the agency acknowledges, 
*humans* will manage, operate, and assure the safety of the next-generation
system.  Therefore, "human-centered automation is the key to effectiveness."

The specific objectives of the NASA program are to:

* develop philosophies and guidelines for applying human-centered
automation to the flight deck and to ATC controller stations;

* Provide for flight crews human-centered automation concepts that "ensure
full situational awareness"; and

* provide for air traffic controllers human-centered automation concepts and
methods that "allow integration and management of information and air-ground
communications."

The program has three main elements:

The element dealing with "human/autoamtion interaction" will treat such 
subjects as a methodology for analyzing human error, ways of measuring work-
load, and "functional validation of intelligent systems."

A program element on intelligent error-tolerant systems will evaluate
collision avoidance systems, "smart" checklists, weather displays, a cockpit
procedures monitor, and more.

A third program element, concerned with ATC/cockpit integration, will look
at pilot/controller communications management, enroute flow management and
scheduling, final approach spacing, and similar issues.

There was an interesting article in the January issue of Car and Driver
magazine titled the "Ten Best Things To Come." One of the ten things is
drive-by-wire. They discuss some of the issues some of the issues applicable to
both fly and drive by wire:

    "Obviously, a primary concern with drive-by-wire systems is
    reliability and fail-safe operation."

There's a picture of a electronically controlled throttle; the PC board says
BOSCH on it and the hardware appears to be the upper assembly of a carburetor,
i.e. there's a servo which control a throttle plate. This may be the unit used
in the BMW 750iL which is claimed to be the only example of a drive by wire
automobile on the American market.

The systems they expect us to see in the future will control not only the
throttle but steering and suspension. Examples include four wheel steering and
dynamic camber adjustment.

Hopefully, auto manufacturers will be as conservative with drive by wire
systems as they have been with the computer controlled engines they are current
building. For example, the engine in my '89 GM car has a computer that controls
functions such as fuel delivery and ignition.  But nearly all the computer
controlled systems have backups that implement the "limp home mode." There's an
oil pressure switch which activates the electric fuel pump should the computer
fail to. The ignition system has a backup circuit that takes over if the
computer stops supplying ignition timing data.

I must take issue with Eric Roskos saying that PRODIGY can only update
information in the STAGE.DAT file.

In doing my article on PRODIGY for The Christian Science Monitor, I was told by
Prodigy's manager of software services that one of the really nifty tricks of
PRODIGY is that nearly the entire system running on the PC --- including the
.EXE files --- can be updated remotely.  This eliminates the need to send out
floppy disks with updates.  (They didn't have it working well at the beginning
and actually had to send out one update --- an extremely expensive
proposition.)

The reason for wanting to do this is based on two things: prodigy's pricing
structure and its target market.  Prodigy charges one $9.95 a month.  At that
price, it just isn't possibly to economically send out floppy disks.
Especially if they want to have 1-5 million subscribers within the next 2-10
years.

The other thing is their target market: they want people who don't know
anything about programs or files.  Automatic updates eliminate the necessity of
having to have users put disks into their computers and try to figure out what
is going on.

The Prodigy censors is a very real problem.  They have recently shut down
PRODIGY groups that have ventured into "unacceptable" topics like abortion and
homosexuality.

&gt; ... Hopefully, auto manufacturers will be as conservative with drive by wire
&gt; systems as they have been with the computer controlled engines they are
&gt; currently building. For example, the engine in my '89 GM car has a computer
&gt; that controls functions such as fuel delivery and ignition.  But nearly all
&gt; the computer controlled systems have backups that implement the "limp home
&gt; mode." ...

  Don't let an acute failure mode lull you into a false sense of security.
My 8500-mile '89 GM car is in a dealer's repair shop due to computer
failure.  If the emissions computer *fails*, the car will "limp home."
But if an erratic computer misinterprets the car's state, it will send
faulty control signals and cause unpredictable performance. "Hey, HAL - Can
you say 'Garbage In, Garbage Out?'"

  For two weeks, the computer failed intermittently, occasionally stalling
the car without warning - not a pleasant experience, especially when it
stalled while going 55mph on a 10-lane highway, and at a busy intersection
while making a turn.  After several such failures and three tows, the car's
computer finally failed for the mechanics, giving them the required
justification to replace the computer.

  The computer already has the capability to detect faulty sensors
throughout the engine.  A second, independent computer is needed to monitor
the performance of the engine computer (i.e., "guard the guards") in order
to detect and record intermittent failures.  At minimum, the car should also
have a manual override switch to enter "limp home" mode instead of the $45
"tow home" mode.

Summarized from a story by Sheryl Stolberg in the 'Los Angeles Times' 10
March 1990:

Fox Television employees in New York and Los Angeles discovered in February
that someone had been trying to gain access to their computers, using the
same password in both cases.  

Free-lance journalist Stuart Goldman was arraigned Friday and charged with
violating federal and California anti-hacking laws.  His personal computer
and floppy disks were confiscated.  According to the federal prosecutor's
affidavit, Goldman made several attempts -- at least one of them successful
-- to gain entry to "sensitive data files regarding ... news stories worked
upon by the company's journalists."  

Network officials would not disclose what information was sought,  but
Goldman had worked briefly for the Fox-produced news tabloid 'A Current
Affair', and he had recently been trying to sell an inside story on such
shows to the 'Los Angeles Times'.

[See 'Hacking for a competitive edge' in RISKS 8.71 for an earlier case of
journalists apparently trying to steal stories via computer hacking.]

           Don't Give Up Your Privacy to Find Out Who's Calling
                               Gary T. Marx

The telephone is something that is usually answered, but rarely questioned.
But this is changing with the proposal of the regional phone companies to
introduce unblockable Caller ID.

Almost everyone answers "yes" to the question "Would you like to know who is
calling you before you pick up the phone?"  But most people would answer "no"
to the corollary question, "Would you mind if every time you made a call your
phone number was automatically revealed to the person called?"

This offering, for which the phone company would charge a separate fee, changes
the nature of phone service by removing the control that callers have over
their phone numbers.  In other words, the service has consequences for the
person calling -- unlike other recent developments in phone service, such as
speed dialing or automatic redialing.

By technological fiat, the phone company takes personal information away from
the caller and sells it to the person called.  This is similar to the data
scavenging companies that sell credit and related information about individuals
without their consent.  Contrary to what most people believe, the phone
companies are saying they, not you, control your phone number.

Unblockable Caller ID is unlikely to become the standard in the United States.
California already has a law requiring that if the service is offered, it
should come with a free blocking option -- callers not wanting to reveal their
number can enter three digits and the called party will see a "P" for private
call.  Similar federal legislation has been introduced in Congress by Senator
Herbert H. Kohl (D-Wisc).

That is the compromise position.  Don't ban the service.  Don't offer it in an
unrestricted way as most phone companies propose.  Give callers limited control
over what is revealed - -their number, or the fact that they don't want to
reveal it.

While such a position is better than an unrestricted offering, it is far from
ideal.  Callers not wanting to reveal their number to the person called run the
risk of not getting through.  People receiving calls, seeing a "P" may decide
that if you won't identify yourself, they won't talk to you.  That is a
reasonable response on the part of the called person seeking to avoid unwanted
calls.  The caller appears suspect - -even though in most cases what callers
wish to keep to themselves is their phone number and perhaps location, not
their name.

The problem is that now, as proposed, the only form of identification the
technology delivers is the phone number.  If it were changed so that callers
had the option of delivering their names, most privacy problems would be
resolved.  In general it would also be more useful to the people called to see
a name rather than a phone number.  They needn't run the risk of refusing a
call from an unrecognized phone number that might in fact be a family member
calling from a service station to report the car has broken down, or a surprise
visit from a out-of-town friend.  This is also normal phone etiquette, which
begins with callers identifying themselves by name, not by telephone number.

One would hope that the phone companies, as publicly regulated monopolies would
feel an obligation to develop technical innovations that, beyond enhancing
profits, would further important social values such as privacy and equity.

At a minimum, their actions should not diminish these as unblockable Caller ID
will.  Investors, systems designers, and marketers need to consider how a
development might be misused, or have undesirable social consequences.

Services like Caller ID should be developed in consultation with citizen
advisory groups.  Consumers should not be put in the defensive position of
having to respond to whatever radical changes the local phone service proposes.

We live in a democracy, not a technocracy.  As networks become more important
and as invasive technologies more powerful, public utility commissions which
traditionally have focused on the economic aspects must look to broader social
aspects.  Too often, communications technology is seen only as something that
erodes, rather than enhances, privacy.  But that need not be the case.  Giving
callers the option of providing their name would serve the interests of both
the caller and the person called.

Just a couple of comments on this story.  These aren't criticisms but just
perspective observations; as professionals in all areas of life discover there
are frequently some differences of opinion about how matters of their field
should be presented to the general populace.  Recognising that these
differences spring up even between members of the field, these are my opinions.

   According to records, Clark is accused of running up more than
   $1000 in his use of the computer account.  Geyer is accused of
   running up more than $800 of computer time.

As a user of several systems that use pseudo-monetary accounting schemes, I
question whether any resources were really wasted at all, "computer time"-wise.
I do not know much about the systems in question, but if they parallel those
that I have had these experiences with then there were cycles to spare.  To me,
just handing out numbers with dollar signs attached seems to be attempting to
(either knowlingly or not; I do not know the author's experience, either)
garner a response of, "So much money!  The waste!  Clearly a terrible degree of
theft!"

   Among the systems accessed was Internet, a series of computers
   hooked to computer systems in industry, education and the military,
   according to records.

Everytime I see comment about the Internet like this it just makes me ponder
what the general public thinks.  Is it, "OH!  Some terribly important network!
Our national security might have been breached!"?  I do not mock the importance
of the Internet.  The reality of the Internet, though, is that access to it is
something that many people can get quite easily through their school or work
and the fact that the Internet was "Among the systems accessed" isn't a very
shocking thing.  Then again, perhaps it is shocking based on the system he was
coming from.  My comment, however, is based on what general reaction to the
above statement could be like -- the public won't know about the specifics of
that system either.

   Matt Crawford, technical contact in the University of Chicago
   computer department discovered someone had been using a computer
   account from Penn State to access the University of Chicago
   computer system.

Not to detract from Matt's work, but this paragraph essentially says nothing.
One of the reasons that these networks exist is so that people can do work at a
machine when they are half-way around the world from it.  There is nothing
especially surprising about someone from one university accessing a computer at
another university.  This is lacking in information and only makes me wonder
what we are supposed to infer from it.

In Risks 9.74, J. Eric Townsend writes, in part:

&gt;  "forecast crimes" -- could they have predicted the hit and run driver
&gt;  who totaled my car and didn't even stop to check if my passenger and
&gt;  I were injured?  Maybe they should try predicting crimes by politicians
&gt;  and federate [sic] employes [sic] first, just to get the bugs out of 
&gt;  the system....

I presume he meant "federal employees".  In any case, his statement is an
unwarranted defamation of the character of literally millions of public
employees who work honestly, cheerfully, and carefully to give the taxpayer's
an honest day's work for a fraction of an honest day's pay.  As an academic, Mr
(Dr?) Townsend should be a little more objective in his characterization of
folks who work in other domains.

  Subject: Evolutionary Software?

  I was wondering what people thought of the Darwinian software being created
  by the computer scientists at the University of California in Los Angeles?
  Their approach is pretty radical and they're creating more powerful and
  reliable software through self-evolution than their programmers can design by
  hand.

  I guess these small modular programs they have going interact and merge
  with each other to create new generations that can anticipate potential
  pitfalls that human programmers can't.  Just like we humans think about so
  many things at the same time in our head, the computer runs thousands of
  programs simultaneously and a master program picks out the ones that suits
  its' needs most efficiently, integrating it to produce following generations
  that are even more powerful.  Survival of the fittest?

  In Alameda and Orange Counties in California, an example of their Darwinian
  programming is helping the county to control their mosquito population.  Each
  of the individual program modules are able to successfully mimic the
  behavior of the mosquitoes to determine growth rate, etc., to find out
  precisely where and how much insecticide is necessary to kill itself and its'
  children.  Instead of the previous mass insecticide bombings at 20000 sites
  picked out by human programmers, this software is doing a near perfect job
  with only 3000 sites it picked out on its' own.  Pretty impressive, you think?

  The computer scientist who developed this approach to software design,
  Danny Hillis (Founder of Thinking Machines in Cambridge, Mass.) thinks
  because of its constant evolution that his software is eventually going to
  make itself so complex that even their designers won't be able to comprehend
  all of its' functions.  Kinda like becoming God?

  This guy even has software working like a biological parasite to wipe out
  incompetent programs and therefore forcing the master program to search for
  programs that are even better!  This parasite even looks around for viruses
  to kill.  Instead of taking the usual route, trying to simulate human
  qualities like vision and speech, Hallis' artificial intelligence is just
  trying to mimic unexpected behavior that all organisms exhibit and using a
  parallel supercomputer to accelerate the natural evolutionary process as
  defined by Darwin.

  Interesting, you think?  Rajnish

RISKS 9.74 had a statement about the NASA human-centered aviation safety
project.   I don't know if I am in that project, but

  1. Ed Hutchins and I have a grant with NASA-Ames on aviation safety.
  2. I have strongly argued for user-centered system design (UCSD) in general.
  3. We are working on the checklist problem and on the automation problem.

So a quick summary of our work might be appropriate: it certainly fits the
domain covered by RISKS.

Automation.  I have been concerned with the fact that too many automatic
devices are built not only to take over the jobs performed by humans, but with
no understanding of the issues that will arise when they fail.  A simple
example is the Air China incident in which the number 4 engine lost power, and
the autopilot compensated without notifying anyone.  If the 1st officer had
been flying instead of the autopilot, he might have said "hmm, I seem to be
compensating more and more. Wonder what's happening?"  But the autopilot was
silent, and when the problem finally exceeded the control authority of the
autopilot, the result was an uncontrolled aircraft that almost was a total
disaster.

I have analyzed this an other aviation incidents in a tech report that is
available upon request.  Abstract at the end of this note.

Checklists.  In our opinion, a checklist is an admission that humans fail.
After all, if we didn't we wouldn't need to check.  Therefore, appropriate
design of equipment and procedures can probably eliminate or at least
reduce the need for checklists.  

 We don't need a checklist to ensure that we open the door before passing
 through it -- unless it is a glass door.  We used to try to start our autos
 without first inserting the key in the ignition switch, but now that the
 starter key and the ignition key are the same, we no longer make that
 error.  Wiener and Asani point out that pilots sometimes take off without
 lowering their flaps (so there is a warning buzzer and it is a checklist
 item), but they never land without lowering flaps, so this condition need
 not be checked for. In similar fashion, the takeoff checklist has all sorts
 of items on it, but NOT to advance throttles.  Yes it seems obvious, but
 that is just the point.

Except for a study by Wiener and Asani that is just now being completed (for
NASA-Ames) there have been NO systematic analyses of the scientific/cognitive
bases of checklists.  They are now constructed by a combination of the
intuitions of chief pilots, experience, and the concerns of the legal staff.
Lists for the same aircraft in different airlines vary dramatically.  This is a
real safety hazard: read the NTSB reports on the Delta Dallas crash and the
Northwestern Detroit crash.

Hutchins and I are doing a cognitive analysis of checklists.  We will have
a paper "any month now."

Automated checklists can help, but

  1. They are not the final answer.
  2. Locating them on a front-panel CRT is probably the wrong way to go.
  3. They have to be designed with an understanding of human cognition.
  4. Checklists, procedures, and do-lists should probably be combined.

  Abstract of tech report

  The "Problem" of Automation: Inappropriate Feedback and Interaction, 
                               Not "Over-Automation"

As automation increasingly takes its place in industry, especially
high-risk industry, it is often blamed for causing harm and increasing the
chance of human error when failures occur.  I propose that the problem is
not the presence of automation, but rather its inappropriate design.  The
problem is that the operations under normal operating conditions are
performed appropriately, but there is inadequate feedback and interaction
with the humans who must control the overall conduct of the task.  When the
situations exceed the capabilities of the automatic equipment, then the
inadequate feedback leads to difficulties for the human controllers.

The problem, I suggest, is that the automation is at an intermediate level
of intelligence, powerful enough to take over control that used to be done
by people, but not powerful enough to handle all abnormalities.  Moreover,
its level of intelligence is insufficient to provide the continual,
appropriate feedback that occurs naturally among human operators.  This is
the source of the current difficulties.  To solve this problem, the
automation should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the
current level is quite inappropriate.

The overall message is that it is possible to reduce error through
appropriate design considerations.  Appropriate design should assume the
existence of error, it should continually provide feedback, it should
continually interact with operators in an effective manner, and it should
allow for the worst of situations.  What is needed is a soft, compliant
technology, not a rigid, formal one.

&gt;   A technical committee armed with comprehensive terms of reference
&gt;   began a probe into the whole Airbus affair last week.  ...

Interestingly enough, it looks like somebody in authority at least suspected
that the results would be embarrassing to the airline (i.e. mismaintenance or
pilot error rather than technical problems).  Normally, in such an accident
investigation, the airworthiness authorities of the aircraft's country of
origin -- i.e., the people who first certified the thing as flyable --
are involved, and the manufacturer is at least kept informed.  Aviation
Week reports that India refused European airworthiness authorities' request
to participate, and also refused information requests from them and from
Airbus Industrie.

When Time magazine was writing their 1988 cover story on viruses, I
sent them a copy of Ken Thompson's Turing lecture, which detailed an
early and particularly secretive and patient one (a computer "slow
virus"?)  that he had demonstrated but had not allowed to spread.  The
conclusion of the lecture was a strongly worded warning about the rise
of computer vandalism and worse, and advice to all who would listen
that "brilliant" is rarely the right adjective for such activities.

In the interview with Time, I had also discussed "Darwin", a game of
survival of the fittest among self-reproducing programs, which
Vyssotsky, Morris, and I had played sometime around 1962.  Darwin had
been described in the computer recreation column of Software -
Practice and Experience in 1972.  Rechristening it "core wars", Kee
Dewdney popularized it in Scientific American in 1984.

More interested in a good story than an accurate one, Time's writer
made up a wheeze about the Bell Labs folks having kept the awful
secret of self-reproducing programs to themselves, with the pact of
silence being broken by the Turing Lecture.  Probably because it didn't
fit with the thesis that Ken let the cat out of the bag, the Time
article was silent about Ken's admonitory message.

Now Ken McAfee, self-styled "leading expert" and principal in
the Computer Virus Industry Association, and Colin Hayes,
"investigative reporter", have enshrined Time's sensationalism in
their book on viruses.  They simplify the myth even further, implying
that Ken talked about core wars - a trifling subject compared to what
he really did describe.  Apparently McAfee and Hayes, having found a
good story in Time, never looked further, certainly not at the Turing
lecture, which is hardly an obscure reference.

The investigative reporter did eliminate some of Time's errors:  he
didn't misspell Vyssotsky's name and mine, but probably only because
he identified us merely as "young AT&amp;T programmers".  Instead, out of
nowhere, he decided that we were "engaged in the groundwork for
artificial intelligence."  Perhaps I underestimate his ability to
misread the record.  He may believe in Vyssotsky's chaostron.

Doug McIlroy, Bell Labs 

     [The 1959 Chaostron piece reappeared most recently in the Communications
     of the ACM, vol 27, no 4, April 1984, pp. 356-7, in a section entitled
     "An Anthology of Selections Spanning 25 Years", in an issue whose
     table of contents page mysteriously says "May 1984"!  For those of you
     who haven't seen it, this item is an absolute classic.  PGN]

Following on from recent discussions in RISKS about railway
signalling, I thought it appropriate to submit the attached article,
which appeared in the Financial Times on Thursday, 15 March 1990. (It
is reprinted in its entirety without permission.) I'm alarmed that
London Transport do not seem to have thought before of the sort of
situation described.  I'm also intrigued that the manner in which a
disaster was avoided is also implied to be novel - if this is really
so then the train driver showed amazing presence of mind.

Brian Randell

  RUSH HOUR TRAIN DRIVEN WRONG WAY UP TUNNEL
  
  By Roy Hodson
  
  An empty London underground train was driven along a tunnel in the
  wrong direction towards a train packed with passengers during last
  Monday evening's rush-hour at 6pm in an incident that London
  Underground is now giving the priority of a major disaster.
  
  The driver of the empty train became disoriented after being told to
  manoeuvre the train to a cross-over point.  The signalling system was
  unable to cope as he set off north instead of south on the Piccadilly
  Line from Kings Cross.
  
  The rogue train was stopped just 400 feet from a stationary train
  crammed with 800 passengers.
  
  Kings Cross was the scene of a fire disaster on November 18, 1987 in
  which 31 people were killed.
  
  Disaster was averted in this new incident by the prompt action of the
  driver of the stationary train.  He saw approaching train lights and
  reached through his window to seize some 12-volt telephone wires,
  shorting the circuit.
  
  A programme is now going on throughout the underground network to
  redesign parts of the signalling system.  Work will be completed by
  the weekend.  Fifty stationary red lights are being fitted at points
  identified as possible accident sites, of a similar accident.
  
  "The present signalling system cannot understand that a train is going
  backwards in a one-way tunnel", a London Underground manager said last
  night.  "The new lights will warn a driver in the remote possibility
  of this ever happening again".

Is TDD printed output Information or just paper?

&gt;From the Milwaukee Journal, 3/18/90.

A piece of TDD (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf) output was pried from
the clenched fist of a deaf man, resulting in a life prison sentence for
murder, according to an appeal being considered by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

The questions created by this case include: Was the paper obtained illegally?
Is the TDD output to be considered public information or as private as a phone
conversation?  Since the TDD was in the sheriff's department office in Pierce
County, Wisconsin, the paper is police property.  Is the information written on
it during normal use also police property?

The facts of the case: Robert Rewolinski was picked up on a traffic charge in
June 1987.  He used the TDD in the sheriff's office to call his common law
wife, Catherine Teeters, for a ride home.  During the TDD conversation Teeters
told Rewolinski "I am scared like hell you will do something to me or the kids.
I don't want the kids to have short lives or hurt... I can't stand you
anymore... You must understand that I don't want you and I don't love you."

Three hours later the sheriff's TDD received a call with the message "Robert
Rewolinski here.  Lost my mind.  Cathy's dead."  The TDD printout of the
earlier conversation was considered the critical evidence in convicting him of
first degree murder rather than manslaughter.  The prosecution contends that
the deputy was simply retaining custody and control of police property.  She
could not have been looking for evidence of a crime since no crime had yet been
committed.  The defense contends Rewolinski deserves a new trial because the
printout should not have been taken or used as evidence.

It is clear that the paper belonged to the sheriff.  Did the information on it
belong to them too?  The police do not monitor phone conversations in such
circumstances, how about TDD communication?

Thought you might be amused by my latest encounter with Bad Computer
Programming.  Last Saturday, I phone-ordered a selection of seeds from
Shepherd's Seeds in Connecticut.  I asked that the seeds be sent Second Day
Air, since planting season is coming fast.  The salesperson said "Sure, I'll
mark it FedEx; that'll be $5.00 extra.", and we parted with mutual expressions
of esteem.

Five days later, on Thursday, I called Shepherd's to enquire why the seeds
hadn't arrived.  After the order-taker had done some quick computer-sleuthing,
she came up with a shamefaced explanation.  Their computerized order-entry
system schedules orders to be filled based on the method of shipping; normally,
2nd Day Air orders are scheduled to be filled on the evening of arrival.
Unfortunately, my order-taker had marked the order "FedEx".  Since Shepherd's
never ships seeds by Federal Express (they use UPS exclusively), the
order-entry system never scheduled my order to be shipped.  Presumably, my
order would have languished unfilled until the Judgment Day, or until
Shepherd's switched delivery services.

 The Twentieth International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTCS-20)

                          26-28th June, 1990

    Newcastle Crest Hotel, New Bridge Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

Sponsored by: Computer Society of the IEEE, CSR, BCS, IEE, ESPRIT,
              University of Newcastle upon Tyne, IFIP Working Group 10.4.

FTCS is the international symposium on fault-tolerant systems. It is
devoted to state-of-the-art issues in fault tolerant computing and
encompasses all aspects of specifying, designing, modelling, implementing,
testing, diagnosing and evaluating dependable and fault-tolerant computing
systems and their components. In addition to a full programme of
contributed papers, invited talks will be given on two very significant
and interesting systems, each of which has extremely challenging
dependability requirements, in the areas of banking and air traffic
control, respectively.

The Association for Payment Clearing Service's CHAPS system provides
the UK same-day guaranteed electronic credit transfer service for 14
settlement banks and over 300 participant banks. The transaction value
often exceeds 80 billion pounds per day.  This system will be
described by Mr Eryl Thomas, who has overall responsibility for the
operation of CHAPS, together with Mr Jim Reeves, CHAPS Technical
Manager, and Mr Geoff Birks, a Senior Manager with the IT Planning
Department of the National Westminster Bank, which is a major CHAPS user.

Dr Flaviu Cristian, who is on the staff of the IBM Research Center,
Almaden, California, will describe plans for the Advanced Automation
System (AAS). The AAS system is being built for the US Federal
Aviation Authority, as a total replacement for the existing North
American air traffic control system. The AAS contract, whose total
value is 3.55 billion dollars, is the biggest single contract in IBM's
history, and the biggest non-military procurement by the US Government
ever. Dr Cristian has just received a Corporate Award (IBM's highest
technical award) for his key contributions to the design of the AAS.

Further information and enquires regarding registration should be made to:
FTCS-20 REGISTRATION, Keepers Lodge, Great Chart, Kent TN26 1JX, UK.,

An attempt to launch the $150M Intelsat 6 communications satellite from a Titan
3 rocket failed recently because of a wiring error in the booster.  The problem
was compounded by a human communications failure between the electricians and
the programmers.

The rocket was wired in a two-satellite configuration.  This was erroneous;
only one satellite was aboard that rocket.  The command to separate the
satellite from the booster rocket was generated by a computer; however, when
the computer people said that they would launch the ``first'' payload, they
meant the top one, while the the wiring people understood ``first'' to mean the
bottom payload compartment -- which wasn't used.  And -- if I attempt to
translate the newspaperese back into technical English -- it appears that the
separation signal had to travel through the satellite to reach the separation
device; given the faulty wiring, it didn't pass through.

  [Subsequent firing of liquid-fuled rocket thrusters has gotten the satellite
  into a higher orbit, where it may be safe (but still not usable) for a few
  extra months.  PGN]

SELF-PROCLAIMED `HACKER' SENDS MESSAGE TO CRITICS
By JOHN MARKOFF, c.1990 N.Y. Times News Service

   A man identifying himself as the intruder who illegally penetrated part of a
nationwide computer linkup said Tuesday that he had done so to taunt computer
security specialists who have denounced activities like his.  His assertion
came in a telephone call to The New York Times on Tuesday afternoon.  The man
identified himself only as an Australian named Dave, and his account could not
be confirmed.  But he offered a multitude of details about various electronic
break-ins in recent months that were corroborated by several targets of the
intruder.  He said he was calling from outside the United States, but that
could not be verified.
   Federal investigators have said that in recent months the intruder has
illegally entered computers at dozens of institutions in a nationwide network,
the Internet.  Once inside the computers, they said, the intruder stole lists
of the passwords that allow users to enter the system and then erased files to
conceal himself.   [...]
   Investigators in the new Internet case said the federal authorities in
Chicago were close to finding the intruder and several associates.  The U.S.
attorney's office in Chicago refused to confirm that assertion.  The
investigators said that in some cases the intruder might have used a program
that scanned the network for computers that were vulnerable.
   In his telephone call to The Times on Tuesday, the man said he had broad
access to U.S. computer systems because of security flaws in those machines.
As a self-proclaimed computer hacker, he said, he decided to break in to the
computer security experts' systems as a challenge.  Among the targets of the
recent attacks were Clifford Stoll, a computer system manager at the
Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory at Harvard University, and Eugene
Spafford, a computer scientist who specializes in computer security issues at
Purdue University.  The caller said he was upset by Stoll's portrayal of
intruders in a new book, ``The Cuckoo's Egg.''  ``I was angry at his
description of a lot of people,'' the caller said.  ``He was going on about how
he hates all hackers, and he gave pretty much of a one-sided view of who
hackers are.''
   Several days ago the intruder illegally entered a computer Stoll manages at
Harvard University and changed a standard welcome message to read: ``Have Cliff
read his mail. The cuckoo has egg on his face. Anonymous.''  The caller
explained in detail his techniques for illegally entering computer systems.  He
gave information about Stoll's and Spafford's computer systems that matched
details they were familiar with.
   And he described a break-in at an external computer that links different
networks at Digital Equipment Corp.  A spokeswoman for the company confirmed
that a machine had been entered in the manner the caller described.  But the
caller was not able to penetrate more secure Digital computers, she said.
   The caller said he had intended to tease the security experts but not to
damage the systems he entered.  ``It used to be the security guys chase the
hackers,'' he said. ``Now it's the hackers chase the security people.''
   Several managers of computer systems that were entered said that no
significant harm had been done but that the invader had wasted the time of
system administrators, who were forced to drop their normal duties to deal with
the breaches in security.
   Ordinary users were also inconvenienced, the managers said, because their
computers had to be temporarily removed from the system for security reasons.
   Investigators familiar with the break-ins said the intruder had entered
systems by using several well-known security flaws that have been widely
distributed in computerized mailing lists
circulated among systems managers.
   Stoll, who from 1986 to 1988 tracked a group of West Germans breaking into
U.S. corporate, university and nonclassified military computers, said the
intruders had not proved any point.  ``It's sad that people have these
gunslinger ethics,'' he said.  ``It shows how easy it is to break into even a
modestly secure system.''  Spafford, who has also written &lt;garbled&gt;, but added
that nothing significant had been compromised.  [...]
   As a result of the break-ins, the Smithsonian Astronomical disconnected its
computers from the Internet, a network that connects severs around the world.
   Among the institutions believed to have been penetrated by the intruder are
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Harvard, Digital Equipment, Livermore
Laboratories, Boston University and the University of Texas.
   Tuesday, the caller asserted that he had successfully entered dozens of
different computers by copying the password files to his machine and then
running a special program to decode the files.  That program was originally
written as a computer security experiment by a California-based computer
scientist and then distributed to other scientists.  [... reference to the
following CERT message...]
   Asked Tuesday whether he would continue his illegal activities, the caller
said he might lay low for a while.  ``It's getting a bit hot,'' he said, ``and
we went a bit berserk in the past week.''

CA-90:02
			    CERT Advisory
			    March 19, 1990
		      Internet Intruder Warning

There have been a number of media reports stemming from a March 19 New York
Times article entitled 'Computer System Intruder Plucks Passwords and
Avoids Detection.'  The article referred to a program that attempts to
get into computers around the Internet.

At this point, the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC) does not have hard evidence that there is such a program.  What we
have seen are several persistent attempts on systems using known security
vulnerabilities.  All of these vulnerabilities have been previously reported.
Some national news agencies have referred to a 'virus' on the Internet; the
information we have now indicates that this is NOT true.  What we have seen and
can confirm is an intruder making persistent attempts to get into Internet
systems.

It is possible that a program may be discovered.  However, all the techniques
used in these attempts have also been used, in the past, by intruders probing
systems manually.

As of the morning of March 19, we know of several systems that have been broken
into and several dozen more attempts made on Thursday and Friday, March 15 and
16.

Systems administrators should be aware that many systems around the Internet
may have these vulnerabilities, and intruders know how to exploit them.  To
avoid security breaches in the future, we recommend that all system
administrators check for the kinds of problems noted in this message.

The rest of this advisory describes problems with system configurations that we
have seen intruders using.  In particular, the intruders attempted to exploit
problems in Berkeley BSD derived UNIX systems and have attacked DEC VMS
systems.  In the advisory below, points 1 through 12 deal with Unix, points 13
and 14 deal with the VMS attacks.

If you have questions about a particular problem, please get in touch with your
vendor.

The CERT makes copies of past advisories available via anonymous FTP (see the
end of this message).  Administrators may wish to review these as well.

We've had reports of intruders attempting to exploit the following areas:

1) Use TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to steal password files.  

   To test your system for this vulnerability, connect to your system using
TFTP and try 'get /etc/motd'.  If you can do this, anyone else can get your
password file as well.  To avoid this problem, disable tftpd.

   In conjunction with this, encourage your users to choose passwords that are
difficult to guess (e.g. words that are not contained in any dictionary of
words of any language; no proper nouns, including names of "famous" real or
imaginary characters; no acronyms that are common to computer professionals; no
simple variations of first or last names, etc.)  Furthermore, inform your users
not to leave any clear text username/password information in files on any
system.

   If an intruder can get a password file, he/she will usually take it to
another machine and run password guessing programs on it. These programs
involve large dictionary searches and run quickly even on slow machines.  The
experience of many sites is that most systems that do not put any controls on
the types of passwords used probably have at least one password that can be
guessed.


2) Exploit accounts without passwords or known passwords (accounts with vendor
supplied default passwords are favorites).  Also uses finger to get account
names and then tries simple passwords.

   Scan your password file for extra UID 0 accounts, accounts with no password,
or new entries in the password file.  Always change vendor supplied default
passwords when you install new system software.


3) Exploit holes in sendmail.

   Make sure you are running the latest sendmail from your vendor.  BSD 5.61
fixes all known holes that the intruder is using.


4) Exploit bugs in old versions of FTP; exploit mis-configured anonymous FTP

   Make sure you are running the most recent version of FTP which is the
Berkeley version 4.163 of Nov.  8 1988.  Check with your vendor for information
on configuration upgrades.  Also check your anonymous FTP configuration.  It is
important to follow the instructions provided with the operating system to
properly configure the files available through anonymous ftp (e.g., file
permissions, ownership, group, etc.).  Note especially that you should not use
your system's standard password file as the password file for FTP.


5) Exploit the fingerd hole used by the Morris Internet worm.  

Make sure you're running a recent version of finger.  Numerous Berkeley BSD
derived versions of UNIX were vulnerable.


Some other things to check for:

6) Check user's .rhosts files and the /etc/hosts.equiv files for systems
outside your domain.  Make sure all hosts in these files are authorized and
that the files are not world-writable.

7) Examine all the files that are run by cron and at.  We've seen intruders
leave back doors in files run from cron or submitted to at.  These techniques
can let the intruder back on the system even after you've kicked him/her off.
Also, verify that all files/programs referenced (directly or indirectly) by the
cron and at jobs, and the job files themselves, are not world-writable.

8) If your machine supports uucp, check the L.cmds file to see if they've added
extra commands and that it is owned by root (not by uucp!)  and world-readable.
Also, the L.sys file should not be world-readable or world-writable.

9) Examine the /usr/lib/aliases (mail alias) file for unauthorized entries.
Some alias files include an alias named 'uudecode'; if this alias exists on
your system, and you are not explicitly using it, then it should be removed.

10) Look for hidden files (files that start with a period and are normally not
shown by ls) with odd names and/or setuid capabilities, as these can be used to
"hide" information or privileged (setuid root) programs, including /bin/sh.
Names such as '..  ' (dot dot space space), '...', and .xx have been used, as
have ordinary looking names such as '.mail'.  Places to look include especially
/tmp, /usr/tmp, and hidden directories (frequently within users' home
directories).

11) Check the integrity of critical system programs such as su, login, and
telnet.  Use a known, good copy of the program, such as the original
distribution media and compare it with the program you are running.

12) Older versions of systems often have security vulnerabilities that are well
known to intruders.  One of the best defenses against problems is to upgrade to
the latest version of your vendor's system.

VMS SYSTEM ATTACKS:

13) The intruder exploits system default passwords that have not been changed
since installation.  Make sure to change all default passwords when the
software is installed.  The intruder also guesses simple user passwords.  See
point 1 above for suggestions on choosing good passwords.

14) If the intruder gets into a system, often the programs
loginout.exe and show.exe are modified.  Check these programs against
the files found in your distribution media.

If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact CERT via
telephone or e-mail.

"Who *was* that bearded man?"

Just Peter Neumann, the RISKS moderator.  He was being interviewed on CNN
last night about the recent Internet breakins.

Now for the RISKS element:

The reporter, while talking about "hacker-this" and "virus-that", used screen
shots of a terminal.  The text was obviously from some BSD-like system, because
I recognized a listing of /etc.  A moment later, for at least two seconds on
the screen, I got a clear picture of /etc/passwd!  And a few moments later, an
entire login sequence (with hostname, username, and password)!  (I wasn't
taping it... sigh. :-)

When you let the press into your cube, be sure you aren't doing something
wonderful on your screen.

Does this qualify as an "out-of-band" transmission? :-)

It seems to me that the crux of this very disturbing story is whether or not
the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in using the Police
Dept.'s TDD.  That expectation is governed by the physical surroundings,
assuming there is no electronic monitoring of the telephone or TDD call.  Are
arrestees' telephone/TDD conversations that take place in the sheriff's office
understood to be off-limits to the police?

A telephone caller in an occupied room would risk at least his side of the
conversation being overheard; a TDD caller would risk a department employee
looking over his shoulder to read the printed dialogue.

The occupied-room situation seems to offer no expectation of privacy for either
type of call, less for the TDD than for phone.  If, however, the defendant had
a reasonable expectation of privacy, then it would seem to be basic
discrimination against deaf people to use physical evidence of a private
conversation (the printed text itself) to prove a more serious charge, since no
such physical evidence would exist for an ordinary phone conversation.  The
printout (paper + content) may be police property, but there are many cases
where certain police property or knowledge is not admitted as evidence.

Note that the US Supreme Court recently ruled that users of cordless telephones
have no reasonable expectation of privacy.  Thus if the conversation took place
over such a phone, the conversation, whether spoken or TDD, seemingly could
have been recorded and used as evidence.  -TW

A somewhat similar question has been settled and may perhaps provide some
guidance: who owns a (physical, not electronic) letter?  The issue comes up in
connection with publication of "collected letters of J. Doe" books and the
like.  The way this has generally been resolved is that the addressee owns the
physical copy of the letter, but the sender (or his heir) owns the copyright on
the contents.

     Several universities with computer-based phone systems here in MI have
announced that they have in place, or intend to have in place, call
tracking systems which will provide printouts for each employee's
phone of ALL LOCAL CALLS (as well as long distance) including listing
the number called, date and time of the call, and the duration thereof.
The privacy implications of all this, and the attendant threat ald
capacity for abuse, are obvious.

In August 1988 two RAF Tornado fighters collided over the village of Millburn
in Cumbria, UK, killing the four crewman.  Originating from different
airfields, each plane was using the SAME preprogrammed cassette to control its
on-board computer in low-altitude flight, which resulted in their both coming
together at the same height at the same location at the same time.  The MoD
report identified an "extraordinary" series of coincidences, and put the blame
on insufficient coordination among different RAF bases.  New rules have been
established.

Defence report.  Thanks to Dorothy R. Graham for clipping it.

I heard on a local radio station this afternoon that many Georgia Citizens are
being erroneously arrested out of state for possession of stolen vehicles.  It
seems that numbers in the new series license tags (issued since January)
sometimes :-) match numbers from the previous series.  Unfortunately for many
people, some match numbers belonging to vehicles stolen as long ago as 1983.
One elderly gentleman was arrested for riding his own motorcycle.  A couple
spent the night in an Indiana jail for driving their own car.  The state motor
vehicle people say they'll get NCIC information updated by September.  Adds new
meaning to the slogan "Stay and See Georgia," doesn't it?

The following items were forwarded to Usenet's soc.culture.britsh
by Bob Gray (bob@castle.ed.ac.uk), having originally appeared on Oracle.
For those who don't know, the term "poll tax" is used in Britain for
a new, flat "per head" tax, replacing what we call property taxes;
it has nothing to do with voting.

  [reformatted]
  
  Student Andrew Mursell, 19, of Ryde, Isle of Wight, expected to
  pay 70 pounds in poll tax but has just received a bill for nearly
  4,000,000 pounds.  Medina Council said it was a computing error.

  A man waiting for a bus at Maidstone, Kent, was stunned when
  a postman tried to force him to take a poll tax demand.
  The letter was addressed to The Occupier, Bus Stop, High Street.
  "The postman said he tried to give it to the man at the front of the
  bus queue, but he refused to take it, and I can't blame him," said a
  council official.  "It was all down to a computer error."''

I heard an interview with the driver of the train shortly after he had averted
the accident.  As I remember it, he said that he had seen the train approaching
him at speed from behind and had taken the action he was trained to take,
namely to short circuit a particular circuit.  It sounded, the way he put it,
as though it was an instinctive action and his presence of mind was in the
response to his training.  I hope he got a bonus.

Another interesting feature of the accident which I didn't get to the bottom
of was that one of the passengers, also interviewed afterwards, seemed to
suggest that passengers in the last carriage (ie the one about to be crushed)
scrambled through the connecting door into the preceding carriage, in response
to hearing the driver shouting at the signalling staff over his comms -
presumably he had switched on the PA so that passengers could be warned at the
same time.  I hope he got two bonuses!

&gt;Date: 28 Mar 90 04:01:24 GMT        [edited by PGN]

    Japanese technology is plumbing new depths -- it's created the intelligent
toilet.  Last october, Toto Ltd., Omron Corp. and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. (NTT) jointly developed the ultimate in information technology:
the fancy flusher.  Makers say a trip to this toilet may save you a trip to the
doctor.   The intelligent diagnostic system packs the latest state-of-the-art
goodies.  The toilet bowl has a sensor to perform urine analyses and then zaps
the data onto a display screen that shows the concentration levels of sugar,
protein, urobilinogen, and blood in the urine for the occupant's viewing.
Users can chart their blood pressure by sticking their left index finger into a
sensor-sensitive unit on the toilet.  The information then can be viewed on the
second screen of the diagnostic system.
    What goes in also comes out.  The diagnostic system has a printer and an
integrated circuit (IC) memory disk card drive that can store up to 130
examinations.  The IC card can also be inserted into a compatible computer
system for simple record updates.  [...]  NTT officials see the diagnostic
system eventually having on-line communications capabilities enabling users to
send information directly to hospitals or clinics.

MODERN HAZARDS DEMAND A `SAFETY CULTURE'

 At a time of increasing concern over both public safety and `green issues',
 an Authority for Risk Management would have a vital role as Britain's main
 source for scientific assessment of risks. As an independent umbrella
 organisation, taking in such agencies as the Food Safety Directorate and the
 Chief Medical and Veterinary Officers, Richard North argues it would help to
 ensure more public confidence in official information.
 
The British democracy is the most mature in the world. Perhaps, accordingly, it
has problems responding to a new desire in its citizens to be better informed.
 
An older generation accepts that the Government knows best, but this
comfortable assumption has been eroded fast. Last week, a local government
report described Britain's proneness to disaster as being more appropriate to a
third world country.
 
There has been an embarrassing plethora of major disasters - Piper Alpha, the
Bradford football fire, the King's Cross tube fire, the Zeebrugge ferry
sinking and several others - which suggest a failure to develop a proper
safety culture. 

There has also been a worrying series of insidious problems.
 
In 1988, South West Water allowed poison into the the drinking water at
Camelford; bovine spongiform encephalopathy, "mad cow disease", has invaded
domestic herds; eggs and poultry have been found to be pathogenic. Groups
have sprung up to complain about pesticide residues in food and veterinary
product residues in farm animals.
 
The Authority for Risk Management, ARM, would be the formal means by which such
risks - and those of nuclear power, public transport, environmental pollution,
food poisoning, even global warming - are scientifically assessed, brought to
public attention, rationally explained, and responses to them costed.
 
One of its jobs would be to develop a way of talking about the tolerability
of risks; almost all of us take huge risks every day with hardly a second
thought, yet get very nervous about much smaller - but involuntary - hazards. 
 
ARM would be a creature of Parliament, and report to it. Its advice would be
given in public, and ministers would have to respond in public. ARM would not
be directly democratic, but would be required to hold open meetings, in the
way the BBC has done in recent years. Indeed, it could develop a "roadshow"
approach, taking key issues to the public, and inviting comment.
 
ARM's rigorously independent scientists will not be allowed to become
purists. Their advice would have to be accompanied with the cost
implications of new policy. The minister, public and Parliament need to know
how much they are going to spend to live in a safer environment, and decide
if they want to pay the price.   ....
 
ARM would develop a culture of its own - both stricly regulatory and alert to
costs. It would look a little like the Office of Technology Assessment in the
USA. But OTA advises Congress, and only on specific matters drawn to its
attention by elected representatives. ARM would have a stronger statutory,
and innovatory, role. The creation of ARM could make Britain a world leader
in the "greening" of government.
 
 BOX: Catalogue of UK disaster and disease
 
 The following is a list of recent key events which have encouraged discussion
 on whether Britain is adequately able to manage risk, whether in terms of
 disaster or disease.
 
 1984 - May: 16 die in Abbeystead pumping station in Lancashire. November:
 Hundreds flee as fire breaks out in Oxford Circus Tube.
 
 1985 - May: Legionnaire's disease in Staffordshire kills 30 in a month.  May:
 Bradford City football stadium fire; 56 killed.
 
 1986 - November: BSE identified for first time (confirming first outbreak was
 in 1985). November: North Sea helicopter crash; 45 dead.
 
 1987 - March: Herald of Free Enterprise capsizes; 193 dead. October: Gale
 force winds lash Britain after low-key warning. November: King's Cross Fire;
 31 dead.
 
 1988 - April: Independent committee set up to investigate BSE. July: Piper
 Alpha explosion; 167 dead. August: Department of Health issues press release
 suggesting advoidance of raw eggs. October: In the year so far, 46
 egg-associated outbreaks of food poisoning involving 1,000 people. December:
 Clapham rail disaster; 35 dead. December: Lockerbie air disaster; 270 dead.
 December: 26 people are reported to have died in salmonella-linked deaths in
 the year so far. December: Edwina Currie says most egg production is infected
 with salmonella. December: Government announces increased controls on egg
 producers. 
 
 1989 - January; M1 Boeing 737 air crash; 47 dead. February: Department of
 Health announces that 61 people died of listeriosis in previous year. April:
 Hillborough stadium crush: 95 dead. July: 2 die, 80 ill in salmonella
 outbreak. August: Marchioness river boat sinks; 51 dead. December: Royal
 Oldham Hospital salmonella outbreak; 3 dead.
 
 1990 -January: 29,998 cases of salmonella in humans in past year, up from
 27,478 in the previous year.

More on Prodigy's Updating of a User's Disks
</A>

</i><PRE>

In a recent RISKS posting, I responded to Donald B. Weschler's
statement that Prodigy could update arbitrary files on the user's hard
disk by saying that it appeared that Prodigy only does cache management
of data in a single file, STAGE.DAT, via this method.

In response to my comment I received mail from Simson Garfinkel, who
wrote the recent Christian Science Monitor article on Prodigy.  He said
that Prodigy's manager of software services had told him that they could
indeed update other files, including .EXE files, thus avoiding the need
to send out update disks. 

Seeking an explanation, I asked what could be updated by this method on
Prodigy's technical service bulletin board about a week ago, and also
wrote to one of their technical support people asking for clarification. 
In response to this, Prodigy, who has always previously answered my
technical questions immediately, simply ignored the question altogether. 
It has now been deleted from the bulletin board by Prodigy's automatic
article-expiration software.  Harold Goldes, the Prodigy representative
who I asked about the updating, likewise did not reply. 

There were several messages by users who read my posting; they all said
the same thing -- that Prodigy could update .EXE files.  One person said
that he had expressed concerned about the problem, but that Prodigy had
replied "trust us, no one has the access needed to cause an unauthorized
update." None of the posters said where they obtained their information,
but all postings are screened by Prodigy's staff before appearing on the
board, and Prodigy did nothing to correct these statements.  Thus, I
tend to believe them, since they support the statement made by the
Prodigy manager.

Needless to say, this is not encouraging.  I re-checked my files in the
Prodigy directory this evening, and found that no file but STAGE.DAT has
been updated since I installed the software nearly a year ago.  I
examined the contents of STAGE.DAT with a disassembler, and it does not
seem to be 8086 code.  It has always been my belief that STAGE.DAT
contains code interpreted by the main Prodigy program, since Prodigy
also runs on the Macintosh and since STAGE.DAT seems from Prodigy's
previous descriptions to contain definitions of graphics screens and
windows displayed while the system is operating. 

If it is indeed an interpreted environment, it would be relatively easy
for Prodigy to prevent unauthorized updates of anything but STAGE.DAT. 

If, however, the claims are correct, the Prodigy updating mechanism
would seem to be a considerable risk to Prodigy and its users, as in the
case of a disgruntled employee who arranged for an "update" to occur
after leaving the company, or of someone who discovered a way to
circumvent Prodigy's access controls.  Prodigy acknowledges the
possibility of such unauthorized access by outsiders in its membership
agreement: "Unauthorized access to the PRODIGY service or to restricted
portions of the service is a breach of this agreement and a violation of
law."

This same agreement also tries (in capital letters) to limit Prodigy's
liability: "ANY LIABILITY OF PRODIGY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED OR ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY ANY FAILURE OF
PERFORMANCE, ...  DELETION, ...  THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, OR USE OF RECORDS ...  [including] TORTIOUS
BEHAVIOR ...  SHALL BE STRICTLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY OR ON
BEHALF OF THE MEMBER TO PRODIGY FOR THE PRODIGY SERVICE IN THE PRECEDING
12 MONTHS." At current service fees, this would be a maximum of $120 
liability on the part of Prodigy for damage to a user's data.

   A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers
 
Status of this Memo
 
   This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
   IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
   useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
   recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
 
Overview and Rational
 
   Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
   altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
   point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
   but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
   each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
   space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
   IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
   system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
   technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
   line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
   some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
 
Frame Format
 
   The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
   hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
   The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
   A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
   bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
   paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
   typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.
 
   Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
   datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
   form.
 
Discussion
 
   Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
   order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
   eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
   of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-
   regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause
   data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier
   drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be
   found on logs and cable trays.
 
Security Considerations
 
   Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
   measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
   are used in a tactical environment.

Went to the local Arby's today...

They don't have cash registers anymore.  Instead, they've got touch-screens
in the counter, and the customer is expected to navigate through a series
of menus, touching the items he wants.

Some notes:

- The screens are IBM PS/2 color monitors, with a "micro-touch" label
  stuck on them

- The menus are reasonably well designed, with large squares to push,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the screens are positioned such that the glare
  makes them hard to read.  I expect people with bad eyesight, or who
  forgot their glasses, would also have problems.

- There is a "delete" option for when you screw up, or have fat fingers

- The manager thought the system was the best thing since sliced bread
  and pop-top beer cans.  I unfortunately was there during the lunch
  hour, so didn't have time to engage him in conversation to find out
  just why he liked it so much, even in face of the obvious problems
  the system has.

- There is *no* way to do a special order from the customer screen.
  When I complained about this to the manager (who was standing there
  making noises about how great this system was), he said "yes you
  can, we do it from back here".  When I asked him what the point of
  me doing my own order was if he had to come over and adjust it for
  the special-ness, he just didn't seem to see the problem.  Sigh.

- After you enter your stuff and press "finished order", then the person
  behind the counter comes up and takes your money, just like before, and
  they get your order for you.  The whole time we were ordering, these
  folks were just standing around watching us.  So I'm not sure how these
  devices are supposed to save any money/time/whatever.

- It took me about three times as long to place my order and get my
  food as it did before, when I'd just say "super, no sauce, fries,
  large coke".  And I had to fill my own soft drink, too.

Another example of adding technology "becuase it is there", and taking
a giant step backwards as a result.

David C. Lawrence (<A HREF="/Risks/9.75.html">RISKS-9.75</A>) questions the validity of assigning amounts of
cash to computer time and other services allegedly 'stolen' by hackers.
Obviously, the sums quoted depend on what the services *could have* been sold
for *if* the owner of the system had been running a bureau service.

Where the service is charged for only in "funny money" for departmental 
accounting purposes, such figures should be regarded with suspicion.

Some years ago, I was working in a department which owned an ICL 1904S running
the GEORGE 3 operating system. This had an automatic accounting system which
calculated charges via a complex algorithm whose parameters were defined by
the system manager (so much per Kbyte of filestore space, so much per mill
second, etc.), and printed cash invoices to users every month.

Our system manager, a man not known for wasting resources, had been very
successfully augmenting the departmental budget by cross-charging for bureau
services provided to other departments.

One Friday afternoon, after the department had celebrated someone's imminent
departure in the traditional way at the pub, he noticed that the system was
clogged up by several very large core images whose size and mill consumption
could only indicate mass playing of Star-Trek. He therefore ran the accounting
package, traced the individuals by their account names, and duly presented
them with personal bills of several hundreds of pounds each for 'computing
services'.

Nobody paid up, but a few programmers got a nasty shock!

The following note is taken in its entirety from page 1 of CommUNIXque 1:1
(Second Quarter 1990), a quarterly newsletter put out by ASCAR Business
Systems, Glendale, CA.

                                UNIX Trix

        For those of you in the reseller business, here is a helpful tip that
        will save your support staff a few hours of precious time.  Before you
        send your next machine out to an untrained client, change the
        permissions on /etc/passwd to 666 and make sure there is a copy
        somewhere on the disk.  Now when they forget the root password, you can
        easily login as an ordinary user and correct the damage.  Having a
        bootable tape (for larger machines) is not a bad idea either.  If you
        need some help, give us a call.

I wonder how many UNIX machines have their security turned off this way?

The Albuquerque Journal, Thursday, April 5, 1990, ran the subject headline.
The article states that:

	A combination of errors erased thousands of computer docketing entries
last week at state District Court, requiring 14 clerks to work Saturday to
redocket the material at an estimated cost of $1,300 in overtime.  Court
Administrator Thomas Ruiz on Tuesday blamed the mishap on `human error' and
`system error', meaning `we allowed it to happen through the format of the
computer system', he said.  He added that steps have been taken to avoid a
repeat occurrence.  [...]

	Docketing is the process by which clerks enter into the computer system
summaries of all court documents filed, such as new cases, motions to dismiss,
judges' orders and defendants' formal responses to lawsuits.  Ruiz said every
court document docketed March 27 in all four divisions--civil, criminal,
domestic relations and Children's Court--was erased when an employee `went
through the wrong sequence of procedures' while intending to perform a `backup'
function.  [...]

Summarized from a story by Virginia Ellis in the Friday, March 30, 1990
'Los Angeles Times' and a small follow-up note on Saturday, March 31:

A computer failure on Thursday, March 29, forced a one day delay in payoffs
for the first time in the California Lottery's four-year history.  On an
average day, about 550,000 people redeem winning lottery game tickets which
depend on computer verification (that is, not the scratch-off game tickets,
but the Lotto and Decco games).

Joanne McNabb, communications manager for the California State Lottery,
said an equipment failure destroyed a small amount of the data on a
computer file used to validate winning tickets.  The problem was discovered
when they tried to reconcile ticket sales in the validation file with the
file in another computer.  The lost data was reconstructed overnight from a
master file that keeps duplicate information as a backup.

Just one week earlier, some Decco winners in Southern California were
unable for a few hours to cash their tickets because a computer file was
overloaded with winners and had to be quickly expanded.

[ From the San Francisco Chronicle, April 7 1990. ]

"Computer Glitch Cuts Off Decco Sales"

Sacramento - A computer programming glitch has cut off sales of certain Decco
tickets containing popular card combinations six times since the California
Lottery unveiled the new game last month, officials said yesterday.  The
problem was discovered two weeks ago when lottery computers rejected attempts
by some gamblers to buy Decco tickets containing four aces - the game's hottest
selling card combination, lottery director Chon Gutierrez said.

Technicians discovered that computer programmers had built an unauthorized
limit into the system that allowed only 8,000 tickets to be sold on any one
card combination, Gutierrez said.  The limit has been reached in six of the 28
draws since the game bagan March 5, preventing about 48,000 tickets from begin
sold - or 1 percent of total Decco plays in the half-dozen affected draws, said
lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb.

Because California schools get at least 34 cents of every $1 spent on the
lottery, the education system has been deprived of more than $16,300 in revenue
because of the computer problem.  Lottery officials are now studying ticket
sale patterns to determine how much they will raise the limit.  They do not
want to erase the limit completely, however. State law restricts annual Decco
prize payouts to 50 percent of ticket sales. If lottery officials were to
remove the limit entirely, prize payouts could rise over 50 percent of ticket
sales if a popular card combination were drawn several times in the game. [...]

I've just seen a segment on ABC News Tonight which has me worried.
It was about the use of computer animations in court testimony.
They showed animations of plane and car crashes which used solid
modelling and realistic rendering combined with animation to show
what "really" happened.  Nowhere in the segment did they suggest that
it represented a synthesis of various points of view.  One attorney
asserted that he doubted he would have won his client's case without
the animation of his client's ride on a roller coaster, which he claimed
caused a stroke.  Despite the fact that 8 million other people had
ridden the coaster without ill effects, because this guy had an animation
that looked like the real thing, showing g-forces on his client's head,
he won his case.  In another case, an animation of an accident claimed
to be unavoidable was said by a juror to be convincing, because you
could "really see what happened, and it was very colorful."

The RISKs are obvious; going from circumstantial evidence of, say,
a car crash, they animate the scene and necessarily make numerous
assumptions in order to be able to produce a viewable animation.
The jury is subliminally convinced that they are watching a video
reenactment of the scene, and if the other side doesn't have a 
video of their own... the animations are likely to be viewed by
jurors as direct evidence instead of indirect.  The segment started
with an animation of a plane crash married with the cockpit voice
recorder, and the flight recorder telemetry (?) was used as input
for the animation.  That's a whole lot more reliable than taking
evidence from casual witnesses to a car crash and translating it
to position and velocity data.

The Authority for Risk Management sounds like a good idea, but I can't
help being a little put off by one comment:

&gt; ARM's rigorously independent scientists will not be allowed to become
&gt; purists. Their advice would have to be accompanied with the cost
&gt; implications of new policy. The minister, public and Parliament need to know
&gt; how much they are going to spend to live in a safer environment, and decide
&gt; if they want to pay the price.   ....

This paragraph presents risk management as though it must necessarily cost
money, and the only issue is to decide whether to pay the price.  But it should
be obvious to any government, particularly one that runs a national health
service, that reducing a risk can SAVE it money!  If fewer people are poisoned
or hurt, health costs go down.  Governments lacking a national health service
or other direct connection to health costs should consider the savings to
society as a whole (that's theoretically why government does things, after
all).

Admittedly, once you start doing this, you often end up trying to decide just
how valuable it is to save or prolong a given life.  Not a great situation, but
"not to decide is to decide" anyway.

`Man fined $750 for computer trespass', by Geoff Winestock

A man who copied a confidential set of programs from the computer company where
he worked became the first person convicted under a new computer trespass law
yesterday.  Alexander Belkin, 31, of Latona Avenue, Knoxfield, was fined $750
in Prahran Magistrate's Court for gaining access to a computer without lawful
authority.  He was also fined $250 for unlawful possession of a library book.
On 1 April 1989, Belkin, who worked for GNA Computing Pty Ltd, copied some
business record systems without specific authorisation from his employer.

Mr David Bamber, for Belkin, said the computer trespass law should be viewed as
analogous to ordinary trespass, for which it was necessary not just to prove an
incident had occurred but that it was done with criminal intent.  Otherwise, he
said, the offence of computer trespass could extend to thousands of
schoolchildren operating computers without permission or employees going about
their business.

But the magistrate, Mrs Heather Spooner, said the facts of the case were
clearly covered by the legislation. The law applied not only to offences where
there was criminal intent, such as computer hacking and theft, but also to
regular users, such as employees.  Mrs Spooner said the law was a response to
calls from the computer industry and police to stop the harm caused by mere
access or "intellectual voyeurism". Prosecution was necessary in a case such as
this, which involved computer programs of great value.  She said the
application of the law would require considerable common sense. Schoolchildren
operating computers should not be in jeopardy.  Mrs Spooner said that Belkin's
evidence on matters such as the workstations he was authorised to use and the
copies he was allowed to make on floppy disks had been inconsistent with that
of his employer.  She concluded that he had not been honest.

Belkin would bear the cost of his mistake for the rest of his life, 
especially in his standing in the industry, and she had taken this 
into account in sentencing him.

CompuServe has had the ability to do this for at least 9 years. Their
L-Protocol was *specificly* designed so a user could enter a short 
BASIC program which would call in, download *and execute* a terminal
program. 

The B-protocol description includes this feature *explicitly* in the
protocol description, along with such features as "disable keyboard"
and disable video upddates". I *think* the older A protocol also had
these features.

All of these CIS protocols include a whoami string that sends an
identifier string that identifies the machine type, software version,
and protocols supported in response to a remote query. This response is
invisible to the user.

I know that some people used programs like CIS's VIDTEX for their
*only* terminal program. I once considered having a BBS check for such
people and do something to their machine... it would be rather easy.

This is not a new risk, but it is more widespread than some think.

Several posts in <A HREF="/Risks/9.78.html">RISKS-9.78</A> reminded me of a humorous incident down here in
Sugar Land, Texas, in the early 1970's ('73, I think).  A letter similar to the

    Congratulations, Mr. Christ!  Our computer has selected you as only

CEO summary:
The item from Yuri Rubinsky in RISKS 9.78 concerning the letter he 
received indicating that the letter he desired was backordered 
reminded me of a wonderful abuse of software I received several years 
ago.  I was still a "minor" as they say, or "underage", and my 
grandmother had set up a "custodial account" money market.  These 
accounts were addressed as:  Granny Smith, Cust
                             Joe Underage UGMA/NY
Or, in English: &lt;adult's name&gt;, Custodian
                &lt;minor's name&gt;  Uniform Gifts to Minors Act/&lt;state&gt;
Well, I'm sure some of you see this coming.  I received a letter one 
day, addressed as above, which started out:
      Dear Ms. Cust:
To make it even better, this letter ended like this:
      &lt;text of letter&gt;
      Sincerely,
      &lt;signed&gt;
      Shareholder Services
Yes, by &lt;signed&gt; I really do mean that a human being had picked up a 
ball-point pen and signed in cursive, "Shareholder Services".  And to
think they didn't understand when I called and asked for Ms. Services!

   [These tales continue to come out of the woodwork.  Please don't take
   this as a challenge to submit still more of them.  Thanks.  PGN!]

In RISKS Digest 9.78, Dave Curry (davy@itstd.sri.com) wrote about automation at
his local Arby's.  [...]  It seems to me that what he's actually seen is the
first phase of implementation and testing of this new system, and that the
management of Arby's is sensibly keeping the old system in place.  If this
touch-screen stuff can be made to work properly and is accepted, he will
probably not see staff members hanging around doing nothing for long: Arby's
outlets will reduce staff to the minimum required to cook, deliver hot food,
clean, and take money.

I have read that the largest overhead for the operation of a fast-food
restaurant (where they serve food which makes you feel that you might as well
fast) is the cost of personnel.  If this is true, then with increased
automation profits have the potential to rise a great deal.  Of course, there's
a risk to the management and to other members of US society in this kind of
change: not only may Arby's lose customers, due to decreased service quality,
but some low-income families will have their incomes reduced even further as
the pool of service jobs they've depended on dries up.

Not really. The reason to exclude the Europeans from the investigation is to
prevent doctoring or tampering with evidence. It is very surprising that the
French have started talking about carelessness of the pilot. If they do not
have access to the investigating teams report how can they talk about
carelessness of the pilots. I fly all the time in North America and quiet often
in Europe and India. In fact the quality of Indian pilots is very good and the
average may in fact be better than the europeans judging by smoothness of the
landings.

The A320 has a lot of software in it. Anybody who has any knowledge of large
software systems knows that it is often the source of many problems. A look 
at how many times the space shuttle launch had to be postponed due to some
software problem should shed some light. 

Considering that, if there is a (or many) technical problem and Indian Airlines
continues to fly the plane and there is another accident many more lives will
be lost. On the other hand, if all the planes are grounded and later on it is
found that there is no problem with the plane, then the cost to AIRBUS is at
most a possible loss of sales for a short period.  If this results in loss of
some jobs, I am sure the engineers can find another job or live on their
savings or welfare. Considering the alternative (1) few frenchmen losing jobs
to (2) several indians dying, I don't think there is anything wrong with
grounding. In fact if the airline had not grounded the rest of the planes I
would have been one of the first to protest.

The behavior of Airbus displays complete lack of concern for human life and
shows that they care only for profits at all costs. It also shows that they are
willing to introduce UNSUBSTANTIATED reports in an attempt to cover their ass.

It is interesting to note that not a single message of condolence was sent by
the airbus president to the families of those who died in the accident. If such
an accident took place in the US and AIRBUS behaved the way it did it would
loose credibility with the american public and it would suffer severe financial
loss due to lawsuits filed in US courts.

The following are from the February 21st and 28th issues of FLIGHT
INTERNATIONAL, and actually appear to be somewhat authoritative.  They clarify
various information/misinformation which has appeared on RISKS and
sci.aeronautics over the past month.  [I've interspersed my own comments
(brackets).  Take those with a grain of salt. :-)]

* The airfield had no ILS approach.  VOR/DME, NDB only.  Runway length was 
10850'.  Field elevation 2914'  No significant terrain nearby.  Visibility
was unlimited at the time.  The crash occurred at 1300 local time [1PM].

* The approach was being made manually.  There were no reported emergency 
communications between tower and aircraft.  The landing gear was down.

* Airplane collided with the ground approx. 500 meters from threshhold, in
a golf course, bounced, and came to rest 100 meters from the end of the 
runway.  FLIGHT characterizes the initial impact as "soft." [ note: bounces
are generally the result of the aircraft having too much velocity, and not,
as is often thought, testimony to the elastic characteristics of 
airplanes :-) ].

* There was no evidence of birdstrike on the engines [ V.2500's, a brand
new engine model ].  The aircraft had 366 hours, over some 300 trips.

* The article indicates that under 100', the automatic power-advance component
of the alpha-floor flight protection system is inhibited.  [ I am not convinced
this is accurate.  After the recent discussion with Pete Mellor, I have been
conducting research; the evidence supports his claim that protections last to 
the ground--but most of the material I've been able to find is fairly old.  
Losing automatic engine authority would remove much of the benefit of having 
protections in the first place. ]

* The entire India Airlines fleet was grounded.  

* Airbus is indicating India is withholding information from the manufacturer.
India responds that they want a "fair" examination of the evidence, by 
no parties with economic interest.  They're farming out analysis of the
flight data recorder to the Canadian Aviation Safety Board.

* Airbus has issued a safety bulletin, advising pilots not to fly too slow
during approaches.  The aircraft was reported to have had a "very steep"
approach path.  [ This may either reflect concern over the flight systems,
or improper technique--the article is not clear on that. ]

* The French flight technician's union has called for A320's to be grounded,
worldwide.

* The president of the union is specifically concerned about the lack of
uniform control laws on the aircraft, as well as the general human interface.

* The Mulhouse-Habsheim flight data recorder showed the aircraft hit the
trees at 32', with the engines idled for most of the trip.  After the crash,
the crew complained that there was delayed engine response when they commanded
full power.  The FDR, however, stated that there was a 0.5 second delay [ I
wonder, though--if the throttles are essentially electrical controls that
*request* a service from the flight management system, and the FDR gets its
inputs from said system, could it be possible that the FDR record only shows
the difference between the time the throttle "request" was *posted* by the 
system, and the time it was *serviced* by the system?  I.e., could the
levers be positioned and followed by a subtantial "notification" lag? 
(followed by a quick "servicing" interval)  Anyone know how the FDR works on 
the A320? ].

* There is a civil case on the A320 crash underway in France, which is 
expected to dispute the Mulhouse-Habsheim technical inquiry's findings (which
found in favor of the aircraft and systems).

One of the bigger problems in assessing the A320 is that almost everyone
has vested interests to protect.  Most European aircraft manufacturers
are involved in building it, so they (and their governments) want it to
be a commercial success.  Their US competitors (and their government)
would prefer it to be a commercial failure.  Pilots' unions often oppose
it because it is a 2-man-crew aircraft replacing 3-man-crew planes.  And
so on.  The relevance of this to the Indian crash is that India, lacking
its own facilities for reading modern crash recorders, sent the A320's
recorder to Canada for analysis.  They chose Canada specifically because
it has no vested interest in the A320!

Incidentally, the latest word in Flight International (21 March issue)
is that informal reports -- admittedly thirdhand -- claim the approach
was being flown at an excessively low speed, 106 knots as against a
recommended speed of about 130 at that point, just before the crash.

Flight International, 4-10 April 1990, page 6:

"Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and digital flight data recorder (DFDR)
information from the Bangalore accident made available to A320 operators
indicates that the cause was remarkably similar to that which the Investigation
Commission found for the A320 accident at Habsheim, France, in June 1988. The
CVR makes it clear that the right-hand-seat pilot intentionally selected "idle"
on the autothrottle as the aircraft decended through 500ft (150m) on Bangalore
final approach. This increased the aircraft's rate of descent as intended, but
reapplication of power came too late to arrest the vertical speed and prevent
the aircraft hitting the ground short of the runway.  According to the DFDR,
full power was tripped in automatically by the Alpha Floor protection mode as
the aircraft passed 135 ft. This implies that the handling pilot had selected
maximum angle of attack to arrest vertical speed, but at low indicated airspeed
(IAS). The IAE V2500 engines were not fast enough spooling up to full power to
provide the additional IAS needed to generate the increased wing load factor to
arrest the rate of descent. At Habsheim, the aircrew also selected power-up
from idle too late and, as a result, failed to clear trees at the airfield
edge."

With the time change a week ago, I personally experienced the results
of a programming error.  On Saturday, March 31, some friends and I
left Chicago on the Amtrak train Southwest Chief bound for Flagstaff,
AZ.  Because of the time change that occurred that night, the train
was automatically an hour late at 3am on the 1st.  This meant that we
would arrive in Flagstaff at 10:24pm Sunday instead of the 9:24pm
scheduled.  However, by Albuquerque due to some excellent train
handling by the Santa Fe Railroad, the train had made up most of that
hour, and by Winslow, the first stop in Arizona, we were on time.

Unfortunately the Amtrak ticket computer had not been programmed
correctly to deal with daylight savings time in Arizona (there isn't
any...it retains Mountain Standard Time == Pacific Daylight Time), and
the incorrect train departure time had been printed on the tickets.
The conductor decided we couldn't leave Winslow until the time on the
tickets, so we sat in the station for an hour and eventually arrived
in Flagstaff an hour late.

I was picking up a prescription at my local pharmacy when I was told by the
clerk that the order had not yet been phoned in by the doctor.  I was asked to
wait for a few minutes while the clerk rifled through a stack of FAXed
prescriptions.

After the clerk found the FAX from my doctor's office and passed it on to the
pharmacist, I began thinking how easy it would be to forge a prescription by
using your favorite desktop publishing software, a scanner, and a PC-FAX board.
This might have taken a little skill and a lot of ingenuity a few years ago,
but as extremely easy-to-use software proliferates into the general public,
this task becomes almost trivial.

I asked the clerk how they went about verifying that the FAX transmissions were
legitimate.  She said the Sending FAX transmits the name of the doctor's office
and its phone number; the clerks simply ensures that the phone number listed is
correct.  The obvious flaw in this system is that the FAX machine itself does
NO VERIFICATION of your name or phone number -- you simply "roll your own"
banner as you see fit!  The hopper holding the received documents was sitting
in plain sight so obtaining a "legitimate" banner wouldn't be at all difficult.

I point this out as an example that the only thing worse than *no*
verification of authenticity, is *assumed* authenticity.

The articles about automation in fast food restaurants brought to mind a recent
article in the New York Times about the McDonald's in Moscow.  It seems that
the Russians did not yet have the skills necessary to eat at McDonald's.  In
particular, though they all have extensive experience at waiting in line, they
were accustomed to lines parallel to the counter, not orthogonal to it.  And
they were entirely unaccustomed to the precise, stylized form of dialogue that
is involved in purchasing a meal at such a restaurant.  The exuberant managers
of the restaurant had taken this as a kind of challenge, it seems, and declared
their intention to "McDonaldsize" the Russians.  For the managers of
McDonald's, this wasn't just a matter of helping the poor Russians learn to
order a hamburger, nor was it simply a matter of running an efficient
restaurant.  It was symbolic, both for the people who own McDonald's and for
the New York Times -- the perspectives of the two of them were quite
indistinguishable throughout -- of the larger process of `converting' the
Russians to a capitalist way of life.  It was explicit in their explanations of
this process that living in a capitalist social and economic system is a
*skill*, something located not nearly so much in the mind as in the body, in a
cultivated habituation to the various forms and interfaces of efficient
consumption.  It would seem that these Russians are getting their remedial
lessons just in time, given that the process of buying fast food is about to
become even more of a skill.  The touch screens will be confusing at first,
given that everyone has been so reliant upon the small space of `slop' in the
human contact -- minimal, to be sure, but real -- between consumer and counter
attendant.  But soon we will all get used to it, and the skill of sorting one's
desires into the combinatorial space of a touch-screen menu will become part of
each new citizen's socialization, another technological boundary joining our
own bodies to the rational machinery of a system without a face or a meaning
beyond the pure excitation of standardized desires.

Franklin Resources of San Mateo CA was critized recently in the San Francisco
Chronicle over its sales commission policy. The company runs a family of
"loaded" mutual funds, meaning that customers pay an up-front commission charge
to invest. The criticism related to how Franklin charges an additional, hidden
commission on those dividends which are reinvested in the fund, rather than
paid out in cash. It turns out that the fine print contains a provision which
allows an investor to avoid this hidden commission by paying a minimum annual
fee of $50. However, Franklin doesn't promote this discount feature.

According to the Chronicle (April 7 1990), the company will soon kill the
special arrangement. Chuck Johnson, VP of corporate development, says "It was
never a deliberate policy, it was a data processing snafu which we ignored for
a while. But an increasing number of brokers caught on, and it's reached the
point where we have to address it."

Some points to ponder:

1) A prospectus is the legal document on which an investor is supposed
   to make financial decisions. But what's to stop Franklin, or anyone
   else, from arbitrarily ignoring ANY of its provisions, and blame a
   data processing snafu?

2) What sort of 'snafu' could possibly cause a variety of prospectuses
   to contain a complete description of a non-existent feature? A text
   processing error seems most likely, but that doesn't say much for
   Franklin's proof-readers.

Mr. Johnson makes Franklin seem particularly sleazy. The company waited
until "an increasing number" of brokers (not just one or two) drew
attention to the error, or "caught on" as he puts it. Then, instead of
sending out correction notices, the company just "ignored it for a while".

In any case, it seems that Franklin will no longer let you pay them to
avoid having to pay them for getting what you originally paid them to
do up-front in the first place!

The April issue of Locus, the major trade magazine of science fiction and
fantasy writing and publishing, contains an interesting news item.  Some
excerpts:

	_The_Fall_of_Hyperion_, the new book by Dan Simmons, appeared
	with a critical page missing.  All 20,000 copies of the hardcover
	and trade editions were shipped before bookseller and Locus
	reviewer Tom Whitemore called Bantam/Doubleday/Dell to point out
	that page 305 is missing, and page 306 appears twice.  Their
	initial statement is not printable...

	The page was correct in the advance galleys...  The mistake was
	in the film shooting at the printer.  Now that publishers and
	printers are computerized, there seem to be more mistakes, not
	less.  Last year, Tor's edition of _Angel_Station_ by Walter
	Jon Williams had several sections turned into gibberish by a
	computer glitch.  Again, the checked galleys were correct...

The piece goes on to mention that such problems, of course, are not new.
There have been some major disasters -- entire chapters or crucial scenes
omitted -- even in pre-computer days.

Yes, but in the interest of good science (and having a good laugh ;-) we

This is a call for such stories.  If you have a story, please send it to

"Letter story, first-hand."  If you just heard the story, the subject

Once the mailing slows down a little, I'll find away to make the

My mother-in-law is the President of a small synagogue, Congregation
Beth El in Potsdam, NY.  She frequently receives some very amusing
examples of this form, most notably ones that conclude from the "Beth"
that the recipient is female, e.g.:

Dear Miss. El,

Dear Beth,

And of course, they make frequent references to "the El family" which is
particularly amusing when you realize that "El" in this context means
nothing less than God Himself (Beth El is Hebrew for "House of God").

In a related matter, one of my relatives, whose last name is Glasser,
decided to throw away $17 on the "Glasser family newsletter".  This
turned out to be a 20 page Macintosh-generated newsletter that was
obviously completely generic -- globally replacing "Glasser" with
"Smith" would have yielded an equally reasonable Smith family
newsletter.  Anybody know how much money such companies manage to make
by selling such dubious computer-personalized products?

&gt;A look at how many times the space shuttle launch had to be postponed
&gt;due to some software problem should shed some light. 

I don't think you can validly compare the two systems, the shuttle software was
a generation or more of technology behind that of airbus.  I remember reading
an article in communications of the ACM about the shuttle software (1982 I
think), and in many ways it was a disaster waiting to happen. The method of
mutual exclusion used in the shuttle was called "alibies" and involved proving
that at the instant your process wanted to access a variable, no other process
would. This was dubious for a few processes, but when the system complexity
increased trying to calculate this n^2 problem for 10's to 100's of processes
was ridiculous. One of the reasons for delay was each time someone wanted to
change a process, they had to recalculate all its alibis.

When one of the first flights was delayed due to weather, and the crew went
back to base to practice more in the simulator. (Real shuttle software/hardware
attached to a enviroment simulator.)  They ran a senario called "Trans-Atlantic
Abort" in which something happens to thrust so that they are too high to return
to base, and too low to go into orbit. The idea was to glide to Spain. In the
middle of this, all CRTs went into an error mode indicating they had not
recieved any updated info from the computers in 5 seconds, and that there data
was invalid. The astronauts were understandably shaken, and the software
enginiers traced the problem to a bad "goto" into the middle of code without
reinitialising the data.

The shuttle software was written in a goto orientated sequential language on
redundent IBM computers of the same design.  The A320 has 3 or 4 separate
computers with CPU's from different manufactures each running software from
different companies written with different compilers for high level languages
that include process management and security. Goto's are forbidden in the
design.

This makes it likely that the problem (if any) in the airbus software is in the
problem specification/design rather than the implementation.

I have been appalled at Airbus' behaviour regarding the A320.  It is not
unlikely that there are some software errors, but until now Airbus has had an
excellent reputation for installing good saftey features not available on other
aircraft (e.g. completely fire retardent cabin materials with non toxic fumes
years ahead of other manufacturers). It seems silly to risk that reputation by
not being as open as possible.

(Continuing from RISKS 9.74)

Of the dozens of command and control system development projects that were
initiated by the U.S. Air Force in the early 1960s, none appeared to
perform its functions as well as the manual system that preceded it.
I expect that someone will be willing to argue that at least one such
system worked, but I suggest that any such claims not be accepted
uncritically.

All of the parties involved in the development of C3 systems knew that their
economic or power-acquisition success was tied to the popular belief that the
use of computers would substantially improve military command functions.  The
Defense Department management and the U.S. Congress must bear much of the
responsibility for the recurring fiascos because they consistently failed to
insist on setting rational goals.  Goals should have been specified in terms of
information quality or response time for planning and executing a given set of
tasks.  The performance of these systems should have been predicted in the
planning phase and measured after they were built so as to determine whether
the project was worthwhile.

Instead, the implicit goal became "to automate command and control," which
meant that these systems always "succeeded," even though they didn't work.
Despite a solid record of failure in C3 development, I know of just one such
project that was cancelled in the development phase.  That was Subsystem I,
which was intended to automate photo-interpretation and was developed for the
Air Force by Bunker Ramo, as I recall.

The "I" in the name of this project supposedly stood for "Intelligence" or
"Interpretation."  This cryptic name was apparently chosen to meet the needs of
the prospective users in the intelligence community, who liked to pretend that
nobody knew what they were doing.  This pretense occasionally led to odd
conduct, such as when they assigned code names to various devices and tried to
keep them secret from outsiders.  For example, a secret name was assigned to
one of the early U.S. spy satellites -- as I recall it was Samos -- but when
that name somehow showed up in the popular press they tried to pretend that no
such thing existed.  In support of this claim, everyone in the intelligence
community was directed to stop using that name immediately.

When I attended a meeting in the Pentagon a few days after this decree and
mentioned the forbidden word, the person operating the tape recorder
immediately said "Wait while I back up the tape to record over that!"  This was
a classified discussion, so there was no issue of public disclosure involved,
just the belief that there should be no record of the newly contaminated name.

Sometime in the 1981-82 period, the Air Force decided to terminate the
development of Subsystem I.  A group of about 30 people from various parts of
the defense establishment, including me, was invited to visit the facility in
suburban Los Angeles where the work was going on to see if any of it could be
used in other C3 systems.  We were given a two day briefing on the system and
its components, the principal one being a multiprocessor computer.

The conceptual design of this Polymorphic Computer, as they called it, was
attributed to Sy Ramo, who had earlier helped lead Hughes Aircraft and
Ramo-Wooldridge (later called TRW) to fame and fortune.  The architecture of
this new machine was an interesting bad idea.  The basic idea was to use many
small computers instead of one big one, so that the system could be scaled to
meet various needs simply by adjusting the number of processors.  The problem
was that these units were rather loosely coupled and each computer had a
ridiculously small memory -- just 1K words.  Each processor could also
sequentially access a 1K buffer.  Consequently it was very awkward to program
and had extremely poor performance.

I sought out the Subsystem I program manager while I was there and asked if our
group was the only one being offered this "free system."  He said that we were
just one of a number of groups that were being flown in over several months
time.  When I asked how much they were spending on trying to give it away, he
said about $9 million (which would be equivalent to about $38 million today).
The Air Force Systems Command seemed to be trying desparately to make this
program end up as a "success" no matter how much it cost.  When I asked why the
program was being cancelled, I got a very vague answer.

I did not recommend that my group acquire any of that equipment and as far as I
know nobody else did.  The question of why Subsystem I was cancelled remained
unresolved as far I was was concerned.  It is conceivable that it was because
they figured out that it wasn't going to work, but neither did the other C3
systems, so the reason must have been deeper (or shallower, depending on your
perspective).  My guess is that they got into some kind of political trouble,
but I will probably never know.

If you are wondering why you have not seen many issues lately, 

   1. I was travelling for almost two weeks, and have been utterly swamped 
      trying to recover since I returned.

   2. The SENDMAIL multiple-mailing problem has continued to bug us, hitting
      a DIFFERENT one of the six main SUBLISTS on the average of EVERY OTHER
      ISSUE.  Thus, to try to minimize your agony and my annoyance, I have
      favored fewer but larger issues.  (Yes, that could be a part of the
      problem, too.  However, in general, it appears that the trouble has
      usually been due to the combination of noncompliant remote hosts and
      nameserver problems.  I've also had to drop a few addresses that were
      hanging in a name server loop!

   3. At long last, we are about to install a new version of SENDMAIL for which
      claims are made that it improves some things, but also continues to
      handle awkward addresses properly and does some of the other things we
      need, preventing us from backing off to an earlier warhorse version.
      Perhaps some of the old problems will now go away, although I shudder at
      the thought that we may now have to discover some new problems.  At any
      rate, please bear with us.

   4. We still have a lot of .ARPA addresses, even though the ARPANET is
      essentially kaput.  I trust those of you will provide updated addresses
      before it is too late.  Let's not wait until the address grace period
      expires.

Thanks for your patience.  PGN

[an article by Dick Murray in the [London] Evening Standard under the above
title, 12 April 1990.]

The Runaway train went down the track -- leaving an embarrassed Victoria Line
Tube driver standing behind on the platform.  He had broken a golden rule and
left the cab of his fully-automated train to check a door which had failed to
close properly.  When the door did shut an electrical circuit was completed and
the train, with 20 passengers on board, moved off before the driver had time to
rush back to the controls.

A London Underground spokesman, stressing that there was no danger to any of
the passengers, said today: `He did not turn off the automatic-mode switch
before leaving the cab.'  The driver, whom Underground chiefs refused to name,
then had to wait on the platform for six minutes before he could get on the
Tube [train] behind to catch up with his own train.

Passengers did not know what had happened, except there was nobody to open the 
doors at Pimlico until the inspector let them out.

Now a full-scale inquiry into the incident, at 11.20pm on Tuesday, has been
launched by London Underground and the driver could face a disciplinary charge.

[ Readers who have visited London may sympathise with my own theory, which
  is that the train was so astonished to be less than 400% full that it
  bolted.  - S ]

    [Yes, the normal situation is "tuBe or not tuBe, that is congestion."  
    But he was certainly optimistic to think that he could CATCH UP with
    his train, since the automatic controls clearly are designed to prevent    
    that.  A better strategy would have been to call ahead.  But I presume that
    the supervisor commandeered a substitute driver anyway.  Actually, the
    train is not COMPLETELY automatic; the opening and closing of doors is
    controlled manually.  But perhaps there is an interlock that keeps the
    train from taking off again after a time-out without the doors having been
    opened?  Otherwise it might just have kept on going.  Seems like a good
    subject for the Kingston Trio.

As many people know, during the LDEF retrieval mission in January 1990, at one
point when the crew were asleep, a garbled "state vector" uploaded to Columbia
caused the orbiter to start rotating.  The extent of this has been somewhat
exaggerated -- maximum speed was half an RPM, and the crew didn't notice until
Mission Control woke them up -- but it was a bit startling that such a thing
could happen.  It could have been serious if it had happened at a worse time.

Most software people, on hearing about, react with "haven't those clods ever
heard of checksums?".  Well, it turns out they have.  In the latest issue of
World Spaceflight News (an excellent source for serious technical detail on
shuttle flights), the full story is given.  The telemetry channels were noisy
at the time, the state vector was garbled by several noise "hits", and Mission
Control's computers correctly announced that the copy sent back by the orbiter
for confirmation didn't match the original and the state vector should be
discarded.  The ground controller responsible for the matter examined the
detailed report, incorrectly decided that nothing important had been damaged --
and ordered the orbiter's computers to begin using the defective state vector!
The orbiter, naturally, obeyed.  In other words, this was ultimately operator
error.  The controller's action was "clearly outside the expected" procedures.
(The question of whether this sort of thing is routine practice was not
addressed, but I for one would suspect that the controller wouldn't have done
that if he hadn't had to use manual overrides before.)

Procedures have been changed as a stopgap, and various long-term fixes are
being considered, including the possibility of "inhibiting" the manual override
in such cases.  (It is not clear whether this means making it impossible, or
just requiring some degree of confirmation or authorization.)

Last week, I caught the end of an item on the BBC TV news where they were
talking about a software fault that had been found on British Airways' new
Boeing 747-400s.

Apparently, on more than one occasion, the flight control system had throttled
all four engines back to idling speed while the aircraft was climbing. On each
occasion, the pilot immediately intervened, and successfully rectified the
situation.

It was then stated that after investigation by BA and Boeing engineers, a fault
was corrected in the control software. Boeing was quoted as stating that they
could not absolutely guarantee that faults like this would not occur again.

Can anybody supply any further details ?

For the record, I'm not overly worried about the increasing computerisation of
aircraft systems. With today's software technology, I don't see how you can
avoid incidents like the one mentioned above, and I wouldn't be stupid enough
to claim that you could build a completely reliable system. 

However, on balance, I think that the automated systems are an improvement,
since they go some  way towards eliminating the main cause of accidents, which
is human error on behalf of the pilot. It may be that human error on behalf of
the software engineer causes a different class of fault than you expect a
pilot to make, but just because a fault is bizarre doesn't necessarily make it
more dangerous.

The only reason I wouldn't fly across the Atlantic in an A320 is because it
doesn't have enough engines !

Monday's Wall Street Journal carried a front page article about a new tactic
being used by some hard-core tax protesters against the IRS: the filing of
false 1099 forms. (IRS form 1099 is used to report miscellaneous payments to
individuals; anyone who has done independent consulting should be familiar with
them.)  The targets of the false 1099s were generally enemies of the tax
protesters: employees of the IRS, Federal judges, etc. The intent was
apparently to cause grief for the victim when the IRS inquires why he or she
didn't report the "income" on his or her tax return. The reported "amounts"
ranged from thousands to tens of millions of dollars.

Although in principle this type of attack does not require the involvement of a
computer, apparently the IRS has in recent years begun to conduct large scale
computerized cross-checks between 1099 reports and the tax returns of the
payees to see if miscellaneous income was properly reported. A sufficient
number of false 1099 forms might seriously diminish the cost-effectiveness of
this technique because of the need for manual verification of the forms. (The
article quoted a former IRS commissioner as saying that this type of attack had
the potential of becoming a "stick of dynamite" in the tax system.)

One wonders if there may be a fundamental limit on the degree to which
institutions that must be open to many sources of public input can rely
on a high degree of computerization to achieve cost-effectiveness,
especially when the institution or its policies are unpopular.  Local
police and fire departments have long faced the problem of false alarms
and malicious reports. They seem to deal with the problem by screening
calls with human operators and by resigning themselves to wasting a
certain percentage of their resources responding to crank calls. Credit
reporting systems must also be open to many sources of input, and they
too are often deliberately fed garbage.

Closer to home, computer networks such as Internet, phone BBSes and even
"Sneakernet" represent social institutions through which people can contribute
software, data and so forth, with the goal of increasing the cost-effectiveness
of computer systems in general. But the Internet worm and especially the PC
virus problem may mean that there is a fundamental limit on the degree of
sharing, because of the effort that each individual must spend to ensure that
he doesn't pick up an infected program or leave his computer open to network
attack.

Although privacy and authentication mechanisms do exist, so far they seem to be
workable only when the "community" within which the mechanisms are used to
grant trust is relatively small, and threat of sanctions are effective in
deterring abuses of that trust.

In the case of 1099 forms, anyone buying the services of an individual US
resident is apparently required to file them, and that takes in an awful lot of
corporations, small businesses and even individuals. Some may be in other
countries. Even if each filer of 1099 forms were given an authenticator of some
kind by the IRS, there would be little to keep someone from applying for such
an authenticator under a false name. (In the cases cited in the WSJ article, a
number of criminal prosecutions are underway, apparently because many of the
perpetrators used their own real names as the payers!)

In the computer field, I'll leave it to your imagination as to how easy it is
to find the author of a PC virus. Those few suspects that have been caught seem
to have been extraordinarily careless in leaving evidence and witnesses around.
I venture to guess that had Robert Morris developed his worm on his own
computer in complete secrecy, we'd still be wondering who did it.

One counter question, when did the railroads stop running on Standard Time?

(The transcontinental railways were the main reason we went to Standard in 
the first place.  The last time I rode a train (not recent I'll admit), they 
still ignored local vagaries like Daylight Saving, War, Victory, etc. Time.)

The railroads went (mostly) to daylight time in the 1960's as best I can tell.
I have some employee timetables that indicate that they go into effect at
12:01am (or 2:01am) Pacific Standard Time, on the Sunday of the time change,
yet seem to have times in them on daylight savings time.  I also looked at an
old Offical Guide from the 60's and it had some railroads showing their
schedules in DST and others in ST.  Amtrak, at least, publishes its schedules
according to local time (when the computer doesn't goof!)

Side note: most railroads today don't publish times in their employee
timetables (and they don't have public timetables since Amtrak).  The reason
for this is that with the increasing use of radios, it is typically more
efficient to run all trains as "extras" and let the dispatcher sort out which
train meets which train and where.  The capacity of the railroad is increased.
The exception is an Amtrak train, which always runs to a schedule.

I have been following the discussion on the RISKS Forum regarding the new UK
defense software standards, and it seems to me that the arguments about what
technology should be in the standards are irrelevant.  The standards as
described by Sean Matthews (RISKS-9.1) appear to address only technical
concerns (what programmers should do), and as such will never lead to higher
quality systems regardless of which technology they espouse.  Quality is first
and foremost a management problem, not a technical problem.  Long before we
worry about the technology, we need to learn some basic management principles
and apply them.  David Parnas recognizes this when he writes:

    I believe that organisations such as MoD would be better advised to
    introduce regulations requiring the use of certain good programming
    techniques, requiring the use of highly qualified people, requiring
    systematic, formal, and detailed documentation, requiring thorough
    inspection, requiring thorough testing, etc. than to introduce regulations
    forbidding out the use of perfectly reasonable techniques.   

Fred Brooks tried to make the importance of management clear in The Mythical
Man-Month.  For example, he noted "More software projects have gone awry for
lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined."  There is not even a
hint of a technical problem there.  He explains:

    I believe that large programming projects suffer management problems
    different in kind from small ones, due to division of labor.  I believe the
    critical need to be the preservation of the conceptual integrity of the
    product itself.

That book is almost 15 years old, and very few people seem to have taken it to
heart.  Marketing concerns still dominate schedule estimates on competitive
contracts.  Project managers still add more people to late projects.  It seems
like no one is listening.  Apparently, we still haven't gotten the attention of
top management.  Why not try something different, something so simple any CEO
can understand?

Henry Ford once recommended to Congress that all that was needed to solve the
water pollution problem was to require people who take water out of a river to
return it upstream from where they take it out.  I believe that a similar simple
but elegant solution to the "software problem" exists.  Only one quality
standard is required:  Any company bidding on a high risk project (or better
still, any project) must be able to demonstrate (and continue to demonstrate
during the life of the contract) that the quality of their software development
process is better this year than it was last year.

It does not do any good to try to tell people how to solve the problem, until
it is their problem.  Some people call this the 2-by-4 theory of how to get
someone's attention.  After they have been hit right between the eyes, they
will ask us for the technology we have been trying to give them for the last 20
years.

    Recent articles by davy@instd.sri.com and webber@psych.toronto.edu reminded
me of a story related to my by my girlfriend.

    For a time, she worked at a Hardees restaurant in North Carolina.  It is my
understanding that this was one of their "flagship" operations as it was
geographically close to the center of the Hardee's "empire" in Rocky Mount, NC.
 
    The events here took place a number of years ago. This food store had
regiesters installed that recorded all of the purchases, so that at the end of
the day the manager could get printouts of all the data and make sure the till
matched the sales reported and help keep inventory updated.
 
    These registers were "linked" and could "talk" to each other. At the end of
business each day, the manager would go to a register (it did not matter which
one), punch in a numeric code, and ALL of the registers would start printing
out ALL of the purchases they recorded that day.
 
    Once this process was triggered, from ANY register, there was NO way to
abort or stop it. The registers printed until they were finished, short of
pulling the plug on the whole system (which would cause data loss, obviously).
 
    One day, a recently discharged assistant manager went thru the drive thru
at the beginning of lunch "rush hour." When he got to the window, he made a
request of the person at the window which he knew would require them to leave
their station. While they were gone, he leaned in the window, typed in the
aformentioned code on the register, and drove off...leaving the registers at
the store paralyzed as they printed out the morning's sales at the height of
the lunch rush. The front line staff was reduced to taking orders on pads and
hand-calculating the cost and applicable tax, having to constantly refer to the
menus behind them.

The latest A320, um, news, from Flight International 14 March...

As most readers know, the official conclusion of the inquiry into the first
A320 crash (the airshow at Habsheim in 1988) was pilot error: they were flying
too low and too slowly with engines at very low power, and increased power too
late to avert the crash.  This was corroborated, in detail, by the flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

The pilots have recently been charging that the FDR and CVR recordings were
tampered with by the investigators.  The last straw, apparently, came when the
pilots' lawyer asked India's prime minister to keep the French investigators
away from data on the Bangalore crash on grounds that they might tamper with it
too...

The French Minister of Transport, his Director of Civil Aviation, and the head
of the accident-investigation office are suing the pilots for libel.

Recently, I saw an airbag malfunction.  I was with the Porsche Owners Club at
Willow Springs International Raceway.  A 1989 Porsche 944 turbo was braking,
going downhill, when a grey cloud of smoke came out of the passanger
compartment.  The airbags had gone off, but fortunatly the driver didn't loose
control.  The front windshield was broken from the passanger side airbag, and
the driver's arm was bruised.  The driver had the traditional safety equimpent
including, including 6 point harness, helmet, and fire-resistant gloves, suit,
and shoes.  I suggested that the sensors be tested or replaced, or that the
system be disabled.  The car had sticky, but street-legal tires.  The estimated
cost to repair was $1000.  The car was out of warranty, but the driver said he
hoped Porsche would pay for it.  The RISKS are obvious.

I wonder if I'm in mistake when I think that such things aren't essential
faults of computerization. This kind of mistakes depend, in my opinion, on
people using computers in a silly way, giving the machine unappropriate
responsibilities. If a publisher sets a book for publishing in a traditional
way, he double-checks the films before sending them to the printer; it seems
that computerized publisher do not. I think this is misunderstanding what a
computer can do.

&gt;From the "Weekly Federal Employees' News Digest":

The US Postal Service this month will begin checking its payroll records to
identify employees who are delinquent on government payments for various
reasons.  The computer matching will continue for 18 months.

USPS is combining its data banks for individuals who are late paying on Housing
and Urban Development Department loans (including housing assistance), certain
veterans benefits, student loans, Small Business Administration programs, loans
from the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services
and for exceeding salary limitations under the dual compensation law.

USPS published details of these and other USPS computer matching efforts in the
March 20 Federal Register.  USPS listed Betty Sheriff as a contact at:

I have noticed a recent upsurge in UK news reports of "Computer
Errors". Not of the major catastrophe kind, but of the "bill for
$0.00" sort. This seems to be intimately related to the introduction
of the Poll tax. I wonder if any other RISKS subscribers have noticed
this phenomenon (not the poll tax, the computer errors) ?

&gt; But he was certainly optimistic to think that he could CATCH UP with his
&gt; train, since the automatic controls clearly are designed to prevent that.

The following train would have been allowed to proceed up to about 100m behind
his train, which would be sitting at the next station (Pimlico). He could then
have walked along the track and boarded it (there is a door in the front of the
driver's cab). I hope the driver of the second train would have turned off the
automatics when he did this :-)

&gt; Actually, the train is not COMPLETELY automatic; the opening and closing of
&gt; doors is controlled manually.  But perhaps there is an interlock that keeps
&gt; the train from taking off again after a time-out without the doors having
&gt; been opened?  Otherwise it might just have kept on going.

Once the train has received an "at station" signal from the track, the
automatic system is turned off. To turn it back on again, the following must
hold simultaneously:

    - the cab windows are proved to be shut (microswitches, I presume)
    - the track is sending code 4200 (start train, accelerate to 80 km/h)
    - the driver is pressing both START buttons

It would appear from the above incident that "train doors shut" is tested
further down the logic, so there is a RISK here.

Recently there was a question in this forum regarding how much control the
operator of a train in the Underground has over the system.  This was in
regards to the near head-on collision that was avoided when the operator on one
train saw approaching headlights and "shut down" the train power locally.

This is actually accomplished through a wonderfully low-tech system.  If you
have ever ridden the Underground, you may have noticed a pair of bare wires
mounted on the wall of the tunnel that is always zipping by.  That pair of
low-voltage wires fulfills two functions.  First, it provides an emergency
communications path.  An operator can simply reach out of his window and clip a
lineman's test set phone (or similar device) onto each lead and be in
communications with a central point.

Secondly, if the wires are SHORTED together (there is enough slack in the
mounting to make it possible to do this easily with your hand through the
operator window), power is automatically cut to the section of track in the
area where the short was applied (the power is restored through manual
operations later).  Simple, and it WORKS!

The Underground is loaded with all sorts of nifty low-tech operational control
and safety systems that have been in use for many, many decades (remember that
the Underground was the first real subway system in the world) including some
wonderful old lifts.  When in London, be sure to check out the London Transport
Museum as well!

A woman in Kissimmee, Florida, sent me a dossier that she has compiled over the
past few months, carefully documenting an alarming sequence of problems.  It is
one of the most bizarre cases I have ever seen.  The problems are still
continuing, unresolved.

She runs a business out of her home, and has an 800 number that rings onto one
of her two home phones -- although the problems began BEFORE the 800 line was
connected.  Her local phone company is United Telephone Company.  The list of
anomalous events is somewhat incredible, but is supported by many witnesses,
including law enforcement people.  It includes the following types of
incidents.

   Calls billed to her 800 number from parties that never called her (in one
   case from a phone in Chicago that was not equipped for outgoing calls!).

   Calls billed to one of the home phones when there was no phone activity,
   that is, for calls that were never made to people who never received them.

These troubles with the phone company have resulted in huge bills for calls
that apparently were never made.  Even more fascinating incidents were these:

   Frequent incoming calls that were wrong numbers -- usually in large batches
   on the same day -- to similar 800 numbers, originally THREE numbers in 
   particular, and then suddenly TWO new numbers after some problem was 
   allegedly fixed.

   With alarming frequency, apparently crossed lines resulting in two parties
   BOTH getting ringing tones, answering, and finding themselves talking to
   each other.

   Crossed lines such that multiple conversations could be heard clearly at the
   same time.

   Repeated calls to 911 attributed to her phone, even when no one was home.

The most interesting and best documented single incident was probably this:

   On 27 Feb 90, a local Kissimmee police officer was in the house trying to
   make sense out of what was going on.  ``He picked up the phone and dialed
   the police department, however he reached Yellow Cab.  He put down the phone
   ... not understanding how he reached the Yellow Cab company when [about
   three minutes later] the telephone rang and [the officer] answered the phone
   only to be connected to a Howie, a dispatcher at the police department, 
   only neither of them had called one another...''

It's only a software problem?  With remotely reprogrammable call forwarding,
speed dial, redial, automatic dialing units, etc., in central offices, almost
anything seems possible these days, especially when you consider the possible
interactions among these features.  One could program up some of the above
incidents as combinations thereof.  However, she did not subscribe to any of
these features -- although the mechanism to turn them on is itself
programmable.

If these were the only problems, the logical choice would be a messed-up
central office and monumental incompetence on the part of the telephone company
in fixing the problems.  Apparently the telephone company has been baffled,
with even the trap-and-trace efforts seemly not having been consistent with
observed reality.  Some observed calls were not trapped, and some trapped calls
were never placed!  But compounding the situation have been a variety of
apparently genuine threatening and/or harassing phone calls.  From that we
consider the tentatative conclusion that there are either at least TWO
COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT PHENOMENA, telephone system problems plus malicious
human agents, or ONE SET OF INTERRELATED PHENOMENA caused by a malicious person
who has access to and knows the telephone hardware/software system, with any of
a variety of motives.  I have several (unpublished) reports about how easy it
is for outsiders to hack telephone switches, but it is obviously even easier
when an insider is involved.

The RISKS archives include quite a few cases of intentional hacking of
telephone systems, as well as numerous cases of accidental misbilling and other
screwups.  But above all, RISKS readers know how easy it is for things like
that to happen.

Is it possible that we might be able to provide some help for this person in
Kissimmee, who seems to be a victim of many problems -- including the "computer
is never wrong" syndrome on the part of the telephone company, whose employees
have had difficulty believing that any of these things could actually happen?
My main question to you all is this:

   Do you know of other cases of unintentional (or intentionally caused)
   rampant deviations from expected normal behavior that have been attributable
   to a telephone system and its operation, as a result of scrambled software,
   miswired switching gear, inept personnel, etc.?  Has anything like this 
   happened to you?

Please try to provide as much detail as possible.  Also, avoid speculation on
this particular case unless it is VERY WELL INFORMED.  The dossier is very
thoughtfully constructed, and the complexity of the case suggests that an
adequate explanation may be nontrivial, although -- as we all know by now -- a
small software flaw can go a long way.  PGN

   [P.S.  I have omitted her name and phone numbers, because that might only
   tend to worsen the problem for her, and for you -- were you to call her.]

Well, last month (Rich Neitzel, in <A HREF="/Risks/9.73.html">RISKS-9.73</A>) we read about Lakewood,
Colorado, where the computer controlling the town's traffic light system lost a
disk and all the traffic lights in town went to blink.

I said then I couldn't believe that not only did they not have a duplicate
machine they could quickly pull in for use, but that when the traffic signals
got confused, they didn't simply go to some "sane" cycle of green-yellow-red
even if it wasn't timed the way it should be for various intersections.

I spoke too soon.  On Good Friday (Friday the 13th, no less) we experienced the
same thing here in Austin.  Apparently some software was modified and the
changes were loaded without the proper testing.  The next day (Friday) at noon,
the system sent out incorrect information to about 60% of the traffic signals
in town (about 360 or so).  Apparently, when a traffic signal here get confused
(or receives bad information), it is supposed to go to a red/yellow blink (or
red/red depending on the intersection).  As long as only one signal gets bad
information from time to time, this works okay.  But when the bad information
originates at the controlling system, all hell breaks loose!  Of course,
traffic ground to a halt and there were accidents all over town (I never heard
a final count of accidents, but they were still counting the reports Saturday
afternoon).

I had the bad luck to have Friday off, so of course, I was out trying to run
errands and such.

City crews had to drive around town and manually reset the lights at the site.
It seems after a light gets bad information, it quites listening for any other
information and has to be manually reset!  Does this seem like a really BAD
idea to anybody else?

So I guess I should be more careful before I go pointing my finger and saying
"they" deserved what they got in Colorado!  Are all traffic signal systems
designed this poorly?  Maybe that's a good area to get into right now!

The official word was untested software.  It still seems REAL suspicious to me
that it happened almost exactly at noon on Friday the 13th.  I can't help but
wonder if there was a reason for that.

But my original point still stands.  We rely on computers too much to
simply "believe" that the answer they provide will always be right,
because just like anything else, computers fail.  The bigest danger we
face is people believing in them TOO MUCH.

This is a summary of an AP story from Jerusalem, from the Albuquerque Journal
(`about 3 weeks old', says David.  Stark abstracting by PGN)

        ISRAELI RABBIS ADAPT STRICT SABBATH LAWS TO HIGH TECHNOLOGY

For modern convenience, there is now a "Sabbath timer" to control lights, hot
plates, hot water heaters, and other devices that under strict laws should not
be touched on the Sabbath.

  ``Though most people use simple, inexpensive timers like those commonly
installed in video recorders, some Jerusalemites have now built elaborate,
computer-controlled timing systems into their homes.  In one luxury home built
by an American immigrant, the computer switches the hot-water supply from
electric-run boilers to solar heaters on Saturdays, thus avoiding trespassing
of custom.  Of course, there are those accused of abusing the system.  "I know
some guys who arrange for the TV to come on just in time for the ball game,"
said one American-born woman who restricts her timers to lights.''

The article also included some discussion on koshering a microwave, and on
interpreting old laws in terms of modern technology.

Since your Social Security number is quickly becoming our National
Identification Number (IRS wants one for 2-year-olds and up), they might as
well get used to hyphenated names, really long names, multiple name changes, and
one-word names.

      [... not to mention intermediate upper-case letters that change the
      parse, Swedish vowels, and perhaps eventually further nonalphabetic
      characters such as in some of the net addresses I have to put up with
      (":", "#", "^"), etc.  PGN]

  Dear Abby,
	When my husband and I were married, I chose to retain my last
  name.  When our son was born, we decided to give him a hyphenated last name,
  using both our names.  Came time for our son to get a Social Security number,
  we learned that there was no hyphen in his last name.  I called the Social
  Security office and was told, "Our computers cannot put hyphens in names".

	This was very frustrating.  If two names are seperated by a space
  instead of a hyphen, the name is alphabetized incorrectly; if two names are
  joined together, everyone mispronounces the resulting name.  Wouldn't you
  think that in the day of technological mircales, someone could make it
  possible for hyphenated names to be recorded correctly on our official
  documents?
				Barbara - Oakhurst, California

    Dear Barbara:  Someone has.  The symbol for the hyphen was programmed
    into the Social Security computer in August 1988.  Contact your local
    Social Security office and request your son's hyphen.

      [Perhaps they thought she wanted a Haifan?  Or `Und der Hyphisch?'  PGN]

I could not help smile at the two unrelated articles in Risks 9.81. These
are of course the London Tube train incident and the software failures on the
Boeing 747-400.

One wonders how long it will be before we read of an incident where a
passenger carrying aircraft takes off leaving the pilot on the ground !!!

Clive Walmsley

    [I try not to edit contributions too much, but I could not help (but)
    smile at the notion of a passenger carrying more than one aircraft 
    and thought that the passenger might deserve a hyphen.  But I resisted 
    inserting it.  Sorry.  PGN]

The ironic portion of the story of McDonald's new store in the Soviet Union is
that the Russians are right.  The most efficient way to process the large
queue of people is with one queue and multiple servers, not the way McDonald's
traditionally does it with multiple queues and multiple servers.

I just got done pouring a bunch of money into my car because the engine
computer died, and it got me thinking about the vulnerability of modern
car engines.

In the event of a nuclear explosion, the resulting EMP (electromagnetic pulse)
would not only wipe out a lot of semiconductor-based communications gear, it
would also kill the engine computers in every late model car.  And what about
the Military?  I used to work for a big-3 truck manufacturer, and the trucks we
built for the Army looked pretty much like our regular trucks (except for the
cammo paint jobs) and were build on the same assembly lines.  I wonder if they
used the same computer-based engines?  If a tactical nuclear strike could wipe
out all the vehicles in the area, that's a rather scary thought, eh?

This is all speculation on my part.  If anyone out there knows how real
this vulnerability is, I would be interested in hearing it.

The telephone system in Kissimmee sounds like the one in Moscow (the one in the
Soviet Union, not in Idaho).  Callers in Moscow are constantly getting wrong
numbers, and those who have telephones are constantly interrupted by the
telephone ringing, usually with someone who has reached the wrong number.  I
have heard people in Moscow say that the chance of getting the number that you
dialed is 50-50, and this is something that everyone has learned to live with.

As I discovered in my hotel in Moscow, the people who do ring through to your
telephone unintentionally are rarely surprised and never apologetic--in fact,
they are frequently quite chatty.  A strange form of social communication
between strangers.

Here's a story from Moscow, which is apparently fairly representative:

A man lives in an apartment building with only one telephone serving about a
hundred residents.  One day there is a fire in the building.  The man rushes to
the telephone to call the fire department.  He picks up the telephone and is
inexplicably connected to his workplace, and his boss is on the line.  The man
is momentarily flustered, the boss says, "How nice to hear from you."  The man
is a little stressed, trying to figure out how to get through to the fire
department before the fire gets out of control.

        Man:  "I'm sorry. . . "
        Boss:  "You sound upset.  What's wrong?"
        Man:  "We have a situation here."
        Boss:  "What do you want me to do?"
        Man:  "Nothing."
        Boss:  "Then why did you call me?"

I'm sure there are many more amusing (and not so amusing) effects of having a
telephone system that is so unpredictable.  The Soviet telephone system is
non-digital, of course, and still uses old cross-bar switching.  This is
unlikely to be the problem in Kissimmee, but the problems sound similar.

I had first-hand experience with a single instance of a very similar problem.
This occurred in the U S WEST Communications phone system for Eugene, Oregon,
around 1988.

A friend of mine called me from his home.  A little later I returned the call.
Instead of any normal response, the phone system responded with the
out-of-service message: three loud tones followed by "The number you have
called has been disconnected or is out of service..."  On a couple of
subsequent tries (motivated by suspicion that I made an error, followed by
disbelief), I always got the same message.  Eventually I called an operator to
complain.

It turns out that my friend's phone had been forwarded to another number,
despite the facts that (1) the other number was not a working number and (2) my
friend did not have call forwarding.  It seems to have been an internally
generated system error.  A disturbing aspect of this is that my friend could
always call out, so that his phone seemed to be working; it's just that no-one
ever seemed to call them.  It is unknown how long this state had existed.
Indeed, if the number to which the calls were being forwarded was a working
number that turned out to be either always busy or not answered, this situation
might have continued indefinitely.

Several years ago (1984) I worked as a summer student in Bell Northern Research
(which is the research arm of Northern Telecom and has nothing to do with Bell
in the states). At the time they decided to field test one of their new SL100
switches (hope I have the right number) by making the people who made it live
with it.

Anyway, for the first month or so after the introduction of the system we
experienced problems very similar to the ones mentioned. I personally
experienced the "match-making" phenomena of having the phone ring, hearing it
ring on the other end and then having someone else answer. Very weird.

Phone calls would not only fail, but were misdirected and at times switched.
Most of these glitches ended quite quickly but it took a month or two for
everything to settle down. This was the first phone system that I had dealt
with that had all those nice features which phone companies are starting to
offer: call forwarding, call park, speed dial directories stored off the
handset etc. I'm sure that interactions between these features contributed to
the problems.  Perhaps someone at BNR remembers this episode and actually knows
something about why it happened.  It may be worth trying to contact them,
especially if it is one of their switches.

P.S. This occurred in the first few months of 1984 and it did send a good
Orwellian shiver up my spine.

and 42, are sometimes close to impossible, with all the phenomena you
mentioned, especially cross-talk between lines.  The common explanation is that
this is an old exchange which is overloaded.  In any case, all this is caused
by bad hardware, mainly due to rain damage (when it rains, they have to wait
until the lines are dry before fixing anything; but then they don't know where
the cracks are!).

There are new and computerized exchanges too, but the only difference seems to
be that there such malfunctions are echoed into billing too, and of course,
they blame the computer for *everything*.

The note in Risks 9.83 about the Florida woman and her telephone `service'
sounded, remarkably like a failure I saw in a C-1 electronic exchange some
years ago.

Background: the C-1 was a very early electronic exchange. It was a hybrid, with
electromechanical line equipment and a digital computer for brains. The line
equipment came in large cabinets, with cables to route calls from one cabinet
to another and more cables for status information back to the processor.

The system went crazy one afternoon. You could pick up the phone and you would
get dial tone perhaps 10% of the time. The rest of the time you'd get a mixture
of other peoples' conversations, and busy and reorder signals. The phone would
ring randomly, and you would get the same mixture of garbage if you answered
it.

The problem turned out to be hardware. *One* wire had broken - one of those
signal wires, and, since the line equipment cabinets were daisy-chained, and
the broken wire was close to the processor, the whole thing went down. It was
buried deep inside a cable run, and took a couple of days to find.

Often when telephone installations are changed, not all wires which were
connected to the original installation are disconnected.  These residual
connections can be in a central office, on a pole, or in a building.  When a
new phone installation re-uses these apparently "dead" wires, trouble can
arise.

1.  A friend found a modular telephone jack in the basement of a house which he
just bought.  The jack had dial tone, so he used it as an extension phone.  A
couple of months later, his neighbor remarked that he had been getting billed
for long-distance calls which he had never made.  My friend recognized the
areas called as calls which he had made.  Explanation: the former occupant of
my friend's house had had two telephone numbers; the wire feeding the jack in
the basement was connected outside on the telephone pole to the same pair as
the neighbor's telephone.

2.  My parents had their telephone number changed.  They still got calls from
people dialing their old number.  The service rep at the phone company said
that was impossible -- the next call my parents got was from the service rep
dialing their old number (she was very embarassed, naturally).  Apparently a
jumper in the central office had not been disconnected so their phone rang
through two separate numbers.

3.  Many phones in my building at U.C. used to use 4-wire circuits.  When we
upgraded to 2-wire circuits (with the central office switch replacing a rack of
relays in our basement), many of the extra wires were not disconnected from the
telephones.  I've traced three problems with new phone and data line
installations to using pairs which were also connected somewhere else to a
telephone although the wires were not used for dial tone.

 I worked with a network security organization a few years ago.  While my job
did not directly involve phone phreak investigations (those individuals who
attempt to hack "telecommunications" rather than "computers"), I did overhear
some information that seems to fit in with the Kissimmee woman's phone
problems--that is:

	o some hackers were known to have infiltrated major telephone networks
          and set up their own trapdoors and Trojan Horses in the switching
          software.  The statement was made that "many telecommunications
          vendors are not in control of their own systems".

	o there was evidence that at least one phone phreak could do anything
          in a major phone system that the owners could--that is, grant
          services (call forwarding, etc.), disconnect or enable phone
          service, and change billing.  This included the ability to make
          "invisible" (non-charged and unrecorded) long-distance phone calls.

	o some of this ability was used for harassment: law-enforcement
	  officials and/or people the phone phreak personnally did not like
	  receive huge phone bills.  Friends of phone phreaks found their
	  bills greatly reduced.

 The one item that does not fit, however, is the visibility of this woman's
problems.  Typically the phone phreaks kept their activities quiet: advertising
them would spark an investigation and possible breakup of their access.  Such
harassment that did go on was minor and was not on a continuing scale such as
this woman described.  But maybe she antagonized a phone phreak in a major way:
could she be a prominent community activist on social or environment issues,
for example?

Missing details in the mysterious case of the Florida woman experiencing much
trouble with her telephone service make intelligent comment impossible.
Probably most the most important consideration would be the type of central
office switch involved. Since we are not dealing with an RBOC, it could be
anything; some of those off-the-wall switches are capable of some rather
bizzare behavior. Also, it is significant if this is rural service.

The "crossed line" problems sound like difficulties associated with "pair gain"
equipment. To make an outdated, undersized outside plant serviceable, telcos
sometimes resort to concentrators. These are devices that allow many
subscribers to have what appear to be private lines over a somewhat smaller
number of actual circuits. This is not to be confused with digital "remote"
offices, which actually provide the functional equivalent of private lines
(within their blocking factor limitations) over digital carrier back to the
host central office.  Concentrators are fraught with difficulty, most of it
similar to the "crossed wire" effect observed by our subject.

All in all, it sounds as if our hapless woman is plagued with problems
resulting from multiple causes: difficulty with the 800 carrier, possible CO
trouble, possible outside plant trouble, etc. In my library of telephone
experience, I have never had anything to compare with our Florida victim, but
my universal solution might be something to consider.

On several occasions, I have had difficulty of one sort or another that the
telco simply has not been able to correct. Either it has been of an
intermittant nature and not detectable by test personel or the solution has
just simply eluded the maintenance staff. When it appears that the difficulty
cannot be corrected in a timely manner, I order a new service. After the new
service is completely installed, the old (and troublesome) service is
disconnected. This ensures that no part of the old service remains; not the
cable pair, CO line equipment, nor any line conditioners or loop extenders.
This tactic has not failed to correct seemingly "insoluble" problems.

Another consideration: if this woman is the victim of someone's maliciousness
(a real possiblity) then the solution might be elusive.  This "someone"
obviously has software (and most likely hardware) access to the telco and could
be very hard to track down. A second, more likely but almost as difficult to
deal with, possiblity is that the telco is just plain messed up. In that case
my "universal solution" might correct her current problems and bring on others.

In any event, I would be very interested in getting further details. If her
area code/prefix could be revealed, I can determine what type of CO switch is
involved. Also, I can probably research what type of outside plant we are
dealing with. Solutions are not guaranteed, but the finger pointing might
become a little more educated.

Well, this may not be related to a phone company problem, but when I was an
undergrad, the university decided to go from party line rotary phones, to a
brand-spanking-new digital switch and give everyone their own private line.

No problem right? Well you know the answer to this one.  Not only did we get
our own phone lines, but all the neato features that come with a digital
switch such as call forwarding, speed dial, three way call, call waiting,
etc...And the ability to have a "secret" 5 digit code to bill your calls to.

Due to a "programming error" it was quickly discovered that you could use your
"secret" code from any telephone on campus.  And of course if you happened to
incorrectly enter your "secret" code at another phone, chances were that it was
someone elses "secret" code that you entered, and the call would go through!
Of course when that person's bill came, it showed up as a call from a phone
they werent at for a number they didnt call.  So of course the local telephone
people on campus got this bug fixed -- after about a month and an unknown # of
"misentered" secret codes...

After this fix, another neat thing would show up.  During the late hours of the
night (when all the CS hackers do their things and make avid use of all the
modem lines on campus), the digital switch would tend to "hang", and would not
produce a dial tone.  Sometimes it would actually connect you as an additional
party to a conversation in progress and although you could hear both sides of
the conversation -- they couldnt hear you no matter what tone you sent or how
loud you screamed.  After the two parties hung up, if you stayed on the line,
you would be connected to the next phone call which either of those two parties
made -- although they could hear you this time.  However they could not dial,
and until you hung up they couldnt dial.  Through some trial and error, a
friend of mine and I discovered that by hitting *99 (which would kill all of
your personal speed dial #'s), that the entire switch would reset -- loosing
all the speed dial #'s, and other pre-programmed goodies...

Needless to say, after reporting this occurance the university did nothing, so
we talked to the makers of the switch -- GTE, and they came out and fixed
it...  No problems since then.

Moral of the story: Software controls our lives, and is written by people who
are subject to sleeplessness, caffeine (or other drug addictions), or just
plain forgetfullness (how many times have you left out a { in some C code?).
We had all better be aware of the risks, and do the best we can...

&gt;From the Chicago Tribune, 25 April 1990

COMPUTER ERROR PARKS HUNDREDS ILLEGALLY

	At least 1,000 Illinois residents outside the metropolitan Chicago area
were flabbergasted Tuesday when they received dunning letters from the City of
Chicago for parking violations they didn't commit, according to police in
several of the towns.
	The Chicago Revenue Department mailed about 36,000 overdue 
parking notices, said John Holden, a Revenue Department spokesman.  He 
said up to 10 percent of them could go to people who did not commit 
parking violations, most of them in the Quad Cities area.
	Holden said the problem occurred because workers failed to
differentiate the types of license plate numbers that are fed into the city's
computerized system.  The city contracts with Cumputil Inc, a New Jersey-based
company, to feed license-plate numbers of overdue tickets into the computer,
which automatically sends out notices to parking violators.

&gt;From the Health column of the April 25th San Jose Mercury News evening edition:

"Such modern conveniences as personal computers and extension phones could
cause you to gain weight.  Psychologist Thomas Wadden of the University of
Pennsylvania attributes as much as seven pounds per year to using a computer
rather than a typewriter.  Keeping files stored in the computer means you don't
burn calories getting up to fetch them.  Ditto for extension phones, which save
about 70 miles of walking a year, thus adding two pounds annually."

This happened at a local (Lawrence, MA) municipal airport about 4 years ago. It
seems that a pilot was prop-starting a small 4-passenger plane. The propeller
spun, and the engine caught.  The throttle must have been set, and the plane
quickly took off, sans pilot. Luckily, it was also sans passengers. It got
about 250 yards, then crashed into a nearby store.

On the evening news, the airport manager expressed his surprise,
saying "this sort of thing rarely happens here."

I know, no computer risks, but it was relevant to the article.

This was reported in the Independent (a London paper) on 26 April.
It is the pilot's account (abridged at one point) of the end of
a flight from the Mediterranean to London. It was submitted to CHIRP,
which is a reporting system run by the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine
to allow pilots to report anonymously on things that worry them.

	"As we slowly descended through the stack, winds aloft were 70-80
knots with little or no turbulence. The Met continued to report strong
surface winds but gave no warning of any exceptional turbulence.
	"As we descended into the clouds, the situation deteriorated rapidly.
The wind and turbulence quickly increased. At 3,000 feet inbound on the
Instrument Landing System localiser we were experiencing westerly winds of
188 knots and we were encountering severe turbulence.
	"When the first officer reported the wind to Air Traffic Control
the reply was, `Roger, understand Westerly 88 knots.'
	"First officer: `Negative, ONE-eigthy-eight knots.'
	"ATC: `Good grief.'
	"At about this time, the aircraft's automatics started running for
cover. Both Flight Management Systems were repeatedly failing and recovering
and at various times both autopilot and the captain's Flight Director
(electronic artificiat horizon) were out of action. The first officer was
doing a great job in trying to round up the wayward systems while
simultaneously monitoring my approach and handling.
	"The ride down the Instrument Landing System was very wild with the
wind indicating 150-180 knots. At 700 feet, with violent turbulence and an
apparent 130 knots negative wind shear between that altitude and the ground
we commenced a go-around.
	"During the go-around virtually all the automatics failed again
and the turbulence became extreme.
	"Levelling at 3,000 feet, flaps and gear up but still in severe
turbulence we were now confronted with further problems. Our `bolt-holes'
(diversion airports) began to look suspect. We determined only one diversion
airfield was still just about okay, but now on the limit of our fuel reserves.
We elected to go, and ATC started vectoring us through the traffic, at low
level in heavy turbulence.
	"At last we were cleared up out of the cloud and back into clear and
relatively calm air. The automatics now started creeping out of the
woodwork but we were still extemely busy, the two-crew operation really
stretched to the limit.
	"En route to the diversion, [we had to cope] with a combination
of failed automatics, unfamiliar ATC clearances, monitoring the weather,
to say nothing of liaison with the cabin crew, and the very frightened
passengers. We had about 30 minutes fuel available and we *had* to make it
in, and with the weather deteriorating literally by the minute it had
to be the first time."

The Independent piece goes on to link this with the completed but as yet
unpublished report on the 737 crash at Kegworth, which is believed to
be critical of the design of electronic cockpits, and also reports from
British Airways of 6 incidents with their new 747-400s. In each of these,
the automatic systems closed all 4 throttles while the aircraft were
climbing. A previous report in the paper had suggested some sort of sensor
problem, I think concerning the flaps, as a cause of this problem

&gt; One wonders if there may be a fundamental limit on the degree to which
&gt; institutions that must be open to many sources of public input can rely
&gt; on a high degree of computerization to achieve cost-effectiveness,
&gt; especially when the institution or its policies are unpopular.

While sociologists/psychologists might argue that, based on certain predictable
human traits, there will but such a limit, I am inclined to disagree.  It seems
to me there are two basic approaches for dealing with risks:

        - modify/control the surrounding environment via automated systems,
          etc. in such a way as to reduce the risk posed to humans

        - modify/improve human skill and intelligence such that the
          surrounding environment poses as little risk as possible

If one takes the first approach and assumes a basic level of human carelessness
(both in the sense of error and in the sense of maleficence, as in the case of
the 1099 forms), and tries to compensate for or insulate from risk via external
controls, there will be such a limit, and it will be governed by the integrity
of those controls.  If on the other hand one attempts to reduce error and
maleficence via internal control (human education/training/self-discipline),
the limit will be governed by the human potential.

It seems to me that ideally what is needed is a combination of these two
approaches.  My fear is that presently many if not most systems are designed
with the assumption that the human operator is a worst case, and so these
systems provide little if any motivation/reinforcement for improving the human.
To approach the problem of the limit of the utility of a particular technology
by saying, Well, I guess we need to refine, we need bigger, better, faster is
IMHO a mistake in that it is in some sense self-destructive.  It tends to
remove responsibility from the human, and as such allows and possibly
encourages the atrophy of human skill and intelligence.

For me, this is what I think life is all about: impeccability is the task of
living, and should begin with the person.  From there it will move to the
things created or maintained by the person.  Unfortunately I don't think it
works in reverse (ie. an impeccable system begets a better user).  As a result
I am somewhat leery of any system which takes control away from me, especially
in light of the fact that I often have no way of knowing the integrity of
either the system or its designer, not to mention that it is likely the system
was designed with an idiot in mind.

&gt; I have noticed a recent upsurge in UK news reports of "Computer Errors".
&gt; Not of the major catastrophe kind, but of the "bill for $0.00" sort
&gt; This seems to be intimately related to the introduction of the Poll tax.

Note for non-UK readers: What is euphemistically described by the government as
the "Community Charge", and by everyone else is called the "poll tax" ("poll"
as in "head": the idea that paying the tax is connected with the right to vote
is a popular misconception) came into force in England and Wales in April this
year.  (Like many other things, it was tried out in Scotland first.)

In a nutshell, the previous system of "rates", an annual charge which was
geared to the value of an individual's real estate, and which provided part of
the funding for local government services (drains, emptying dustbins {sorry!
garbage collection :-}, etc.) has been replaced with an annual per capita
charge. Under the previous system, Lord Muck in his castle paid through the
nose, while Joe Public in his two-up/two-down paid comparatively little.  Under
the new scheme, Lord Muck and Joe Public pay the same. Joe Public is not too
pleased about it. So unpleased about it, in fact, that on 31st March a
demonstration in central London against the poll tax turned into a very ugly
riot.

&gt; I wonder if any other RISKS subscribers have noticed this phenomenon
&gt; (not the poll tax, the computer errors) ?
 
Try this one (Andrew Moncur's Diary column, Guardian, 4th April). I quote:

  "If any rioting breaks out in Tunbridge Wells you shouldn't be too surprised
   to see Amy Mercer somewhere in the background, making a great deal of noise.
   She's just received her poll tax demand (&amp;322-odd to pay). All very well.
   Except that Amy is eight months old - and, I would guess, fairly militant."

It will not surprise RISKS subscribers to learn that the changeover involves
a *massive* bureacratic exercise, registering, and sending demands to, every
person in the country over a certain age. Hardly surprising that someone
thought it might be a good idea to use computers to help with the work.

Presumably, these same computers will also be used to record people who do not
pay, and trigger the various steps taken to recover payment. (Not *registering*
is a criminal offence. Not *paying* is a civil matter between the individual 
and the local authority, who must take each individual case through a procedure
of which the final step is the magistrates' court.)

Huge and well-organised campaigns of non-payment are under way.

&gt; ... it would also kill the engine computers in every late model car.

 Actually it will stop and probably distroy all old cars too.  An EMP will arc
the points and fuse the alternator.  Everything looks like an antenna to an EMP

Following up on the contribution regarding hyphenated last names at the Social
Security Administration, when I did some consulting there years ago, we were
told of the incident where one person who was receiving checks insisted on
changing his surname to something like "*N" (not his real name).  You can
imagine the havoc this caused until the agency went and implemented something
like 25 patches in 25 different systems, which they did, on the humane grounds
that you can call yourself whatever you damn well please.

The Boulder [CO] Daily Camera (25 April 1990) reported that local police have
arrested a suspect in the jamming of police communications and the 911 system. 
According to the article,  he used radio devices to jam the police radio
frequencies and a computer to interfere with the 911 lines.  The newspaper
article gave no details on how he used the computer to jam 911 system.  Since
the local 911 system has ANI and it took the police a while to find the guy, he
presumably was doing something more sophisticated than just making multiple
calls to 911 with his modem.  No reports of any emergencies that received
delayed attention because of the jamming.

The motive:  The University of Colorado campus police issued this guy a warning
citation (no fine) for failing to leave the physics building during a fire
alarm test.  He then started messing with the campus police communications and
then moved on to harass the city police and jam 911.  Makes you worry about
what he will do now that they have arrested him and made him really mad!

Five New York futures markets went off the air Friday when the communications
line that delivers price quotes to brokers and others around the country
failed.  The cause of the failure is unclear as of this writing; exchange
officials blamed AT&amp;T lines, but AT&amp;T said that their lines were working and
that the problem appeared to be at the futures exchange.

And the traders -- most of them headed for home, a decision perhaps eased by
the fact that the weather here is gorgeous and it's Friday...

Another article about the A320 Habsheim crash appeared in the 11-17 April 1990
issue of Flight International. This includes transcripts of the voice and data
recorders of the flight.

  Time: seconds part of time; times are from 12:44:27 to 12:45:41.5.
  N1:   engine low-pressure compression ratio (%)
            (a good guide to engine power).
  CAS:  calibrated air speed, in knots.
  V:
    A = radio altimeter (heights are in feet)
    C = captain
    G = ground proximity warning system (GPWS)
    N = noises
    P = copilot
    T = tower

N1 and CAS values are interpolated from a graph in the article. This only
covers the time from 12:45:00 to 12:45:39.

Some other notes from the article:

Air France's approved overfly height is 100 feet, and only if the runway is
suitable for landing. Habsheim's runways are too short to land an A320.

The original plan was to overfly the hard runway, 02. The captain was clearly
having trouble finding the runway; when he finally saw the line of spectators
on the ground, he decided to overfly the grass runway 34R, without telling the
copilot.

The captain was used to major airports, with 2000-3000m runways and 30m high
control towers. Habsheim has a 800m grass strip and a 12m high tower. He may
have been misled by a scale effect; the steep attitude of the plane would have
enhanced this, and could also have made him think he was higher than the trees
(which first struck the rear fuselage).

It was suggested on RISKS that there may have been a software delay in the
engine controls which was not shown by the data recorder. From the voice tape,
it is clear that this is not the case. A CFM56-5 engine takes about 8 seconds
to spool up to full power, and the tapes are also consistent with this. N1
started to increase within half a second of TOGA (take-off go-around) power
being selected, and had reached 85% when the engines began to ingest branches.
Analysis of the soundtrack of a video shot from the control tower agrees with
this, and shows N1 reaching 91% with "massive ingestion of branches and
leaves".

Somewhere around 12:45:39 the captain's sidestick was pulled to full climb
position. At this point the CAS was 110 knots, beginning to respond to engine
thrust, and the height is 30 feet, steady and beginning to increase. Throttles
and sticks are hard against the stops.

The first data recorder transcription suffered a misreading in the region
12:45:24 to 12:45:32, of which 4 seconds was rejected by the data checking
software in the analyser. An example of errors produced was sign inversion of
the aileron positions. The official report states that this "was no doubt due
to an interruption of contact between the reading head and the recorded tape,
caused by a fold in the tape and/or dust. The following recordings, made after
cleaning and smoothing out of the tape, permitted correct reproduction of all
data". This problem has been used as grounds for alleging that the data was
tampered with, but it should be noted that (a) the affected area does not
cover any significant events, and (b) the final transcription is internally
consistent, and is consistent with videos taken by various people and air
traffic control tapes. The voice recorder analysis was made with the crew's
help.

Habsheim weather at 12:50:
    wind 330/6 knots;
    visibility 8km;
    cloud 1/8 Cu at 780m, 7/8 Sc at 1500m.  
The weather was unchanged since 12:20, except that the wind direction had 
backed from 010.

&gt;From FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL, April 11, 1990:

``British Airways (BA) Boeing 747-400's have experienced uncommanded inflight
closure of all four throttles on six separate flights between 6 October, 1989,
and 19 February, "several times" on one of these flights alone, according to
formal reports.  Several other airlines have suffered the same incident, 
Northwest reporting it first.

``Boeing believes that it has determined the cause, and appropriate
auto-throttle software modifications were made available to operators on 22
February.  Initial modifications to all new aircraft were reviewed in early
September.  Studies continue, however, in association with airlines and the UK
Civil Aviation Authority.

``Boeing and BA deny reports of serious unreliability, associated mainly with 
the 747-400's digital cockpit avionics and computerised systems management.
Boeing reports world fleet technical dispatch average in 1990 as 94.5%, and
gives a February 1991 target of 98%.  BA says that its fleet of seven achieved
100% technical dispatch reliability in the last week of March, and 96.5% for 
the last three months, quoting this as reasonable for a new type.  In most of 
the events the power levers retarded rapidly to idle, but sometimes the 
reduction was partial, followed by automatic reset.  Pilots reacted by dis-
engaging the autothrottle and resetting power manually.

``Boeing began a study of the problem as soon as reports confirmed that a
throttle closure on a Northwest 747-400 was not a freak event.  The manufac-
turer subsequently issued two service bulletins to -400 operators.

``All incidents have occurred in the climb or cruise, and an indicated airspeed
(IAS) of more than 280 kt is believed to be fundamental to the event.  If 
continuing experience confirms this, it means that stalling--even clean--is not
a risk.  Evidence indicates that the event is caused by a spurious signal to
the full-authority digital engine control from the stall-management module.  
The "single word" spurious command says that the undercarriage is down or 
the flaps are at setting 1, so if the IAS exceeds the maximum speed for these
configurations, the autothrottles close to reduce IAS to limiting speed, then
reset to maintain it.

``The modification assumes that the fault was in the processing logic of the 
appropriate unviersal logic card (a printed-circuit software unit), and adopts
a standard technique for reducing digital oversensitivity: there is now a delay
(a few microseconds) built into the software by requiring it to receive an 
"eight-word" command before acting.  Power spikes or other spurious commands
should not produce a reaction.

``So far the latest modification has proved effective.  Early corrections,
though, had assumed the reaction was associated only with main-gear selection,
so although software changes had reduced the incident rate, spurious flap
signals continued to set engines to idle.  BA has not reported any further
events since February.''

It's not a passenger-carrying plane, but Boeing's new Condor unmanned (note
sexist language) aerial vehicle (UAV) should be of interest to readers of this
newsgroup.

The Condor is a 10-ton, 200-ft wingspan (greater than that of a 747),
high-altitude (66,908 ft), long-duration (2.5 days), twin-engine,
piston-powered, autonomous (NOT remotely-piloted) plane.  Boeing hopes to find
buyers in the military and scientific communities interested in the plane as a
sensor platform, at $20 million a pop, not including payload.  DARPA has funded
some of the development.

The plane is "piloted" by two Delco Magic 3 flight control computers, using
inertial guidance for navigation, a microwave landing system (MLS) for takeoff
and landing, and about 60,000 lines of code, mostly Fortran, with some assembly
code.

  "All of Condor's mission functions from takeoff to landing are
  stored in its computers at the start of a mission....
  Communication links are provided so that the mission program
  can be altered in flight if necessary for safety or any other
  reason."

It operates autonomously within the air traffic control system (a contradiction
in terms, as I see it), which has caused some concern on the part of the FAA.
At its cruising altitude, it operates well above commercial traffic, but it
takes 4 to 6 hours to get up there or back down.  During flight tests, a chase
plane was present whenever the Condor was within an airport traffic pattern.
The article I read (Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, 132/6, April 23, 1990,
pp. 36 - 38) had no word on what the chase plane's pilot's instruction were in
the event of a computer malfunction, or what would happen if something failed
when the chase plane wasn't around.

Now that has some interesting possibilites -- If the Social Security
Administration still uses Univac/Sperry/Unisys computers, I ought to change my
name to @FIN (the end-of-job control card).  That would sure drop a large
monkey wrench into the works, as there is no way to read a card that starts
with those four characters.  Well, maybe if you switch the card reader
translation mode to EBCDIC or column binary...  (Assuming they still use cards,
of course, which wouldn't surprise me at all.)

There are, of course, other variations if they've switched computers.

Several years ago, we split our report-card-printing job into two
jobs.  Due to the way it was split, one program was 'cloned', rather
than modified to determine which set of report cards was to be printed.

The fact the both programs had to be kept 'in sync' wasn't clear in
the documentation.  I suspect that the interface between some of the
other procedures involved were also under-documented.

Some time after the job was split into two, the university got flooded
with calls complaining that some of the GPAs were truncated - 3.95 and
3.13 were both printed as 3.00.  The correct GPA could be determined
by dividing the quality points by the hours attempted, which were both
printed correctly on the report cards.

Apparently, some program maintenance affected the two clone programs.
One printed GPAs correctly, the other didn't.  During analysis, it
was determined that the database files were correct, the permanent
record reports were correct, and it was only half of the report cards
that were printed incorrectly.  It was necessary to reprint and remail
all of the report cards.

which includes a chapter entitled "The return of the hacker".  The
particular risks discussed in this chapter and of immediate interest
are in the use of spreadsheets by the computer less-than-adequately-literate.
	When I mentioned computerized spreadsheets to some of my colleagues,
they replyed with some stories involving incorrect spreadsheet packages and
also more stories of the hacking which occurs in the spreadsheet community.
	While the misuse of spreadsheets may be less dramatic than problems
with airplanes and autos, I suspect this spreadsheet hacking may be so
pervasive as to have a noticable and negative impact upon the economies of the
computerized world.  (Of course, the widespread and judicious use of
spreadsheet packages certainly has a noticable and positive effect as well.
But on RISKS we concentrate upon the negative impacts.)
	I would appreciate the readership of RISKS contributing a wide variety
of stories about spreadsheets.  These might include stories about the incorrect
implimentations of constraint programming which appears to occur in
all-too-many of the spreadsheet packages.  These stories would also ideally be
about the real-world impacts of trusting the conclusions obtained by the
spreadsheet packages.  (If you haven't any stories of your own, please just ask
the tradespeople in the community in which you reside.)

Seminar Speaker Says India Should Pass Anti-Virus Legislation

Those attending a seminar last week in New Delhi urged the Indian government to
consider a law to deter people from indiscriminately experimenting with
viruses.  A report in the Xinhua Chinese news service quoted an Indian scholar
identified only as "Mahabala, chairman of the department of electronics
committee on computer virus" as saying an alarming trend in the country is that
some academics are teaching software engineering by creating viruses for their
students to detect.  Said Xinhua, "This concept of glorifying viruses designers
(is) wholly destructive," adding Mahabala cited a wide variety of viruses
affecting computers in India, mainly variations of viruses such as "C-Brain."
Mahabala said that, instead of creating viruses as means of copy protection,
software designers should come out with access passwords that are difficult to
break.

Although this looks like a computer/operator glitch up front, it could also be
an example of using the old? cliche "computer error" to cover up some shady
fund raising.  There was a case a number of years ago when Philadelphia sent
out thousands of parking tickets also to people who had not even been in the
city.  The idea being if even 1% send in the money rather than fight the
ticket, they show a handsome profit.  My father received one and took it to the
local AAA office.  They were taking them to Harrisburg by the hundreds just
from the NE PA area.  Of course, they didn't have computers to blame so
uncovering the scam was pretty easy.

It seems that computers may be capable of providing a good audit trail when
desired but they are also capable of covering their tracks if that is the
desired result.

This is unrelated to the recent discussion of central office problems,
but definitely a computer-related phone RISK.

I tried to get an operator to make an emergency break-in to a friend's line
which was busy.  She reported that the line was out of order, and could not
break in.

I found out that he had been using a modem.  The hapless operator must have
listened in (prior to interrupting and asking if the emergency break-in should
be obeyed) and heard 1200 bd screeching.  To her, any non-voice signal must
have meant "out of order".  Of course, it wouldn't have helped to try to break
in to the "conversation", unless she could whistle real fast.  :-)

If she had told me that she heard "telecommunications" or something, I would
have logged in myself and located my friend on the computers...

In the Universite du Quebec a Montreal, where I work, the employees' union used
the call forwarding feature in a pressure tactic several years ago.  Employees
participating employees forwarded calls at random. Callers got busy signals and
of course many wrong numbers. At that time, calls could be forwarded to outside
numbers; people calling the university ended up at radio stations, at
newspapers or elsewhere. Since that incident, call forwarding to the outside is
only allowed by special permission of the telecommunications department.

This is not so much an example of technology gone wrong, but rather of
people using it for political purposes.

Another political example I remember is the spiffy direct-dial
international service that was in operation in Moscow during the Olympics
(can't remember which ones). The system was dismantled afterward because
the KGB couldn't keep up with the volume of calls (I wonder if this is
an authentic story, or just a joke.)

Subject: Weird phone bills - an unexplored possibility
To: Richard Busch

&gt;These troubles with the phone company have resulted in huge bills for
 calls that apparently were never made...It's only a software problem?&lt;

While I don't doubt that a software fault could have caused the complainant's
problems, and wouldn't read RISKS if I didn't think that such faults should be
investigated by folks like PGN, there is a possibility that no technical fault
is involved.

      [I should have had quotes around "It's only a software problem?".  This
      was intended to be reminiscent of the old SMOP yarns, "It's a Small
      Matter of Programming".  PGN]

Over the last ten years a number of public monopolies in Britain have been
'privatised' - sold to the private sector by the Government. One of them
was British Telecom. A 'competing' company, Mercury, was also set up, but
for technical reasons domestic and small business subscribers are now
dealing for their phone services with a single private monopoly.

A catalogue of the new British Telecom's crimes would exceed reasonable
bandwidth, but one noticeable trend seems to be the issuing of phone bills
for slightly unreasonable amounts, in the hope that people might simply pay
the bill without checking it (not all subscribers are willing to pay extra
for an itemised bill). Business subscribers seem particularly prone to
this. At home we have had to query every bill sent to us since
privatisation; the last one was for #44,000! Others involve fairly small
additions, however; three international calls here, a number of unusual
operator services there, and so forth. 

Could it be that the phone company involved in PGN's case are simply trying it
on in the same way? Since everyone is so concerned over 'computer errors', it
is easy to blame the unfortunate silicon idiot for everything.  The
unscrupulous might see an opportunity here. Perhaps the willingness of people
to accept 'computer error' as an excuse for what might well be deliberate is a
RISK in itself.

In Montreal, and possibly in all of Bell Canada's territory (Quebec and
Ontario), the phone rings briefly to notify the subscriber that a call
has been forwarded. Thus, the subscriber is reminded to cancel Call
Forwarding when he's home and a call comes in.

Note: If a subscriber has Call Waiting, and forwards to himself, the
caller gets a busy signal instead of a ringback, and the call in progress
is not disturbed at all. Very useful when a data call is in progress,
for our system doesn't allow the subscriber to temporarily disable Call
Waiting, except in certain areas. When the phone is back on hook, the
brief ring mentioned above is heard, the caller gets a busy signal and
incoming calls cannot be answered until Call Forwarding is cancelled.
(I've been told this, but have never tried it myself.)

Some systems automatically make a call to the forwarding number when
forwarding is requested. This makes it possible to check the number is
working, and is the right one. The disadvantage is the incurring of a
possible toll charge.

I have two inputs, one is pretty related and one is a bit further
away.  I remember Jerry Saltzer talking about a problem in his home
with an amazing number of wrong number calls received.  These were
ultimately traced down to a bad connection in a crossbar switch.  One
entry on the crossbar was connected to a busy signal or message.
Calls from other central offices were routed to that connection if the
destination was busy.  It happened that Jerry's home number was
connected adjacent to this "busy-signal" entry, which ultimately
turned out to have a bad contact or relay.  The result was that all
busy calls from outside the local office were converted into misrouted
calls to the Saltzer residence.  Jerry can probably give you a better
description of what it was (my memory is somewhat hazy).


The other bug is not a phone bug, but it fell into consciousness
because it had the same kind of random delaying action you mentioned.
I hope it is more of a help than a distraction. 

&gt; ... not understanding how he reached the Yellow Cab company when [about
&gt; three minutes later] the telephone rang and [the officer] answered the phone
&gt; only to be connected to a Howie, a dispatcher at the police department,

About 1981 or 1982 at MIT, Dave P. Reed (now at lotus) and I were
perusing the code that was then used for TCP-IP under Twenex (all that
code was subsequently replaced).  I had seen astonishing packet delays
when Twenex was used as a gateway.  In one case, a packet was delayed
for about 5 minutes.  I only detected it because I had forgotten to
turn off "etherwatch" while I got ready to leave the office.  As I
walked over to logout of the Alto, the final packet of 10 arrived
magically. 

My recollection is that the software had a kernel task with an input
queue that processed each packet by doing some simple processing and
enqueing it to the next task.  The assembly code was in the form of:

   more_packets:
	process first packet
	*goto more_packets
	deschedule task

The assembly line with the * was inadvertantly omitted, so only one
input packet was being processed for every time the task was
scheduled.  Thus in the rare case that two packets were both in the
queue, the second would be delayed until the next packet that arrived
at the interface, which could be arbitrarily later.

I don't recall why the software didn't eventually end up with all the
packets in that queue -- but it was pretty buggy software, so maybe
something like that did happen eventually.

Relationship to phone hacking...

What if the "call parking" feature is just a special case of the way
calls are always made, such that a queue exists that causes a call to
be placed when the line is free.  All calls are put into the queue,
and a flag on the subscriber line or queue entry indicates whether to
flush the attempt if the user doesn't wish to park the call.

In this case, a subtle modification of the system code or even a
hand-patched queue entry could sit in the queue for an arbitrary
amount of time.  Similarly, a daemon could queue calls randomly.

Just speculation.

CEO summary:
Owing to the vaguaries of the mail system, I never saw the Tale of Kissimmee,
though I bet I'll get it in a month or two...  The reactionary tales of 9.84
certainly rang a few bells, to coin a pun.

Back in my undergrad days, my university (RPI) also decided to go winto the
phone business.  They bought an Intecom switch (I think) and were promptly
christened "Tute Bell" after the school's nickname.

This switch had a unique feature.  You couldn't forward your phone to your own
phone DIRECTLY, such as "forward to 5555", but you could do so via an outside
line, such as "forward to 9-266-5555.  You could then call yourself via an
outside line, and the system would promptly forward your call back out from the
switch to the phone company who'd send it back, where, guess what...it would
happen again.  Each out-and-back loop used two trunk lines, and this would go
on indefinitely.  Each time the call came back through your phone, the phone
would emit a short ring, telling you that two more lines were tied up.
Although we never did it (honest!) we figured it would be quite easy to cripple
the institute by tying up all the lines, or at least crash the switch.  All
this from one phone!

I had a similar problem a couple of years ago.  My long distance carrier was
(and still is) US Sprint (lowest prices around!)  At any rate, I was in the
midst of moving, but still wanted a US Sprint calling card.  US Sprint would
not grant me a card without a home telephone number, so I used my sister's
phone number/address until I settled into a new place (which would have a
phone), the delta time between old place and new place was 45 days.  Once
I settled into the new place, I was set up with US Sprint "Dial 1" service
and an accompanying Calling Card.  Therefore, I stopped using the card assoc-
iated with my sister's address/phone and commenced using the new one.

Six months later, I moved a second time to a new address, and you guessed it,
a new phone.  I signed up for US Sprint "Dial 1" service and an accompanying
Calling Card.  Again, I stopped using the card associated with the previous
number.  At this point, I had three US Sprint calling card accounts but I was
only using the most recent one.  US Sprint customer service assured me that
my "accounts had been consolidated" and that all my calls would appear on one
bill, associated with my current address/phone number.  Just for grins, I
think (I'm not sure if this was exhaustive) I tried the two old calling card
access codes, and I was rejected.

This was late '86, early '87 and all took place in the 412 area code, the
greater Pittsburgh area.  Please be patient, I'm setting the stage as ac-
curately as I can.  In june/july of '87, my sister moved to San Fran w/
her husband.  Their long distance carrier was AT&amp;T or MCI (can't remember.)
Remember when I originally signed up with her phone for a US Sprint Card?
I only used her address/phone as a security blanket for the US Sprint billing
people, she still had another Long Distance carrier and I specified the
billing address, which can be different from the reference phone/address.

After my sister moved, I started to receive calls to Fort Lauderdale FL on
my monthly US Sprint bill.  To boot, some of them were person-to-person
collect to my Sister's old number.  SO I called the number that used to
be my sister's and spoke with the new owner of that number.  They were making/
receiving collect calls from Fort Lauderdale, FL. and they were being billed
for them, and at the same time, SO WAS I!

Next came the endless calls with Customer Service, Xerox copies of my phone
bills mailed to account managers, their boss and their boss' boss, etc.
Around this time, I had read that US Sprint was in a lot of red ink because
of their antiquated billing software (US SPrint was purchased from someone
else, can't remember the name).  All the people I talked to at US Sprint
insisted that there was nothing wrong, even after I described in detail what
was happening!  The same call appearing on two separate bills.  I simply
refused to pay the bills.

Now here comes the best part.  After they finally straightened out the problem,
I had held back on $114 and some change for those calls and it was appearing
as $114 Credit on my bill!  After I was assured that everything was OK, the
next bill came around and I was still being billed for calls from my sister's
old number.  By now it was Aug-Sep '87.  Finally, as a software engineer, I
realized how this problem could be fixed.  I cancelled any affiliation I had
with US Sprint (by now, several accounts, three calling cards etc. (also, the
older calling cards were still active, I think)) and waited until I received
that final check for $114 and some change.  At this point, I felt comfortable
enough that all the software including, rates, billing, accounts payable and
accounts receivable was reset.  And I started a new account.  By then it was
Nov-Dec '87.  Haven't had any problems since!  I think since then US Sprint
punted the old accounting system and has been through two revs of a new one.

In the fall/winter of 1983-84 my wife, Roma, and I were living in Family
Student Housing on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz.  On
3 separate occassions in a period of approx. 3 months, the telephone in our
apartment (serviced by what was then known as "Pacific Telephone", now "Pacific
Bell") was dead.  Each time the Pac Tel serviceman came out, he checked the
wires and eventually got the phone working again.  A few weeks after the third
event, a new person moved into our apartment complex a few apartments away.
One Sunday, my father-in-law called and at almost the same time I answered and
this new neighbor answered (the phone in her apartment rang).  I asked her name
(Marcy) and found out she lived in the same complex.  I then called Pac Tel and
another serviceman came out to fix the problem; he checked and changed the
wiring.  When the bill came, I found several calls listed that we had not made.
I contacted Pac Tel Billing who backtraced the phone numbers to the actual
locations.  I was then asked if I knew these people or businesses called (one
was a "Lyon's Restaurant" which I had never heard of at the time).  Since the
billing rep believed me (I related the whole story), she removed the calls from
my bill (I believe it was less than 5).  I may still have that bill buried deep
in my files.  I had no problems after that.  I hope this helps.

The stories of crossed lines remind me of the oldest RISK of all -- blaming
things on the computer that humans do.

Almost 20 years ago, when I was younger and less responsible, a "friend" had
two phone lines.  He hooked up a circuit to conference them and play the whole
thing through a loudspeaker with no mic on the line -- not hard to do.

Then he would go and call two parties and connect them, to listen to the fun.
Much more creative than plain prank calling.  When random parties got boring,
he tried connecting the only two people in the book with an unusual name,
hoping they would be related.  Sometimes they were, but the most amusing
exchange went on for several minutes between two unrelated Mr. Vandenbroeks.
Several times, they would say:
	"Who is calling?"
	"Mr. Vandenbroek."
	"Yes?"
Unaware that they had the same name.  On to the RISK... In all these cases,
the parties connected attributed the double call to crossed wires -- as
though it happened all the time.  Prior to this digest I had not heard
of actual switch defects ringing two people and connecting them for no
reason.  And not two relatives, or employee and boss.  Nobody thought to
attribute it to malicious youngsters.

Today, every yuppie kid has a house with a two line phone with a conference
button.  No knowledge of circuits required.  If my immature "friend" did it
then, it must be a regular event today.   Yet we jump to blaming the
equipment.

David Gursky may understand queues, but I think he misunderstands their
application in the USSR.  To make a typical purchase you have to wait in three
queues: the first to select your merchandise, the second to pay for it, and the
third to pick up your purchase.  By no stretch of the imagination should it be
considered efficient.  The only shortage of Qs in the USSR is in the Cryllic
alphabet.

A programmer from Waukesha Wisconsin (Name is in the article, I won't post it
here) is to be charged with "destroying computer data" and causing damage in
excess of $2,500.  If convicted, maximum penalties will be 5 years prison, and
$10,000 in fines.  The programmer wrote the code such that he could shut it off
at will in the future.  The client refused to pay, so he killed the software.

Toronto Star, May 1, 1990:

   Death rates in the St. Bruno school neighbourhood are not among the
highest in Toronto, as city records previously showed, and in some cases
are actually lower than the city-wide average.
   A study by city health officials says a "computer programming error"
incorrectly inflated death rates in the area by almost 100%, causing
widespread concern among residents....
   Corrected figures show that 12 to 13 people per 1,000 die in the
neighbourhood east of the school each year... Earlier statistics
claimed 22 of every 1,000 residents in that area die each year, a rate
almost three times as high as the city average....
   The new report said an age factor was incorrectly fed into the
computer calculations, lumping together all deaths of people over
age 65....
   St. Bruno was built on the site of a former steel plant.  The site
was also once occupied by the phototoxicology and radiation testing
laboratory operated by the environment ministry.
   St. Bruno has remained closed since March, when teachers and
students complained of unusual health problems, including six
teachers who had developed fibroid tumours and three who had
uterine cancer.
   Shortly after the school was closed, an incorrect report said
the two census districts immediately east of the school ... had the
second and third highest death rates in the city.

According to Aviation Week (April 30, 1990, pg. 24), a software problem caused
a three minute hold at T-31 during the launch countdown of the shuttle mission
that orbited the Hubble Space Telescope on April 24th.

At T-48 seconds, newly written software detected that the outboard external 
tank liquid oxygen fill and drain valve was open when it should have been
closed.  The ground launch sequencer (GLS) stopped the countdown clock at 
T-31 seconds.

George T. (Ted) Sasseen, director of shuttle engineering, said that the
software changes were made after an incident that occurred on April 2nd,
where a pipe burst and sprayed water over a 4,000 volt motor control
assembly, shorting it and causing the launch processing system (LPS)
control room to go down, prompting concern that the LPS could lose power
in the last few seconds of the countdown.  Sasseen said that unless oxygen
is drained within nine minutes after the flow is stopped, a phenomenon
called "geysering" could rupture plumbing and destroy the tank.

	"So the fix was to put a purge in that [liquid oxygen] line
	and to put a small gas pad in it.  We did that by hand after
	the inboard valve was closed and before the outboard valve
	was closed.  The GLS sent its 'close outboard' command at
	48 sec."

	He said that about 10 sec. after this happened, "everyone
	looked around and said, 'Oh boy.  We were dumb.'..."

	Sasseen said the processing team violated one of its own
	cardinal rules that says: Never make a software change
	unless you can run it many, many times in simulations and
	tests.  He said, "There are oddities about software changes
	that you don't always get the first time through.  And the
	basic rule we violated is that it wasn't tested enough."

	He said the purge/gas pad software may be removed because it 
	is unlikely that there would be a total launch processing
	system launch between T-31 sec. and T-0.  "But I want to
	emphasize that the software safed the system as it was
	supposed to."

To their credit, the system engineers were able to determine what the problem
was and fix it within three minutes.  A more cautious approach might have been
to scrub the launch until a more careful analysis and review was performed.

A leaked copy of the draft report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch into
the Jan 1989 737-400 crash at Kegworth, UK, criticises the ergonomics and
user-friendliness of the CRT and LED display systems and engine instruments,
according to Flight Int'l (May 2-8).  The crash occurred after the crew shut
down the wrong engine following vibration caused by a fan-blade failure.

Dr Roger Green, of the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, gave a lecture to
the Royal Aeronautical Society in late April 1990 in which he said that
operating in a digital "glass cockpit" increases the liklihood that pilots
will not maintain an independent mental picture of systems status and flight
profile - "always necessary for critical surveillance but also for dealing
with the unexpected" according to Flight Int'l (2-8 May 90).

This may have been a factor in the Korean Airlines KAL 007 navigation errors
which led to it being shot down by the USSR.

Green adds that cockpit ergonomics and instrument design are not subjected
to such exhaustive testing as are airframes: "The rigour with which these
things are evaluated leaves a lot to be desired".

The report in Flight Int'l (2-8 May 1990) on the Bangalore crash makes very
interesting reading. It is too detailed to summarise, and too long to post, but
the account of the number of "flight modes" which the A320 went through in the
two minutes before the crash, and the side-effects of each (which seem not to
have been understood properly by the pilots) makes operating an A320 appear
surprisingly complex and error-prone. It is certainly very different from
flying a fully manual airplane, and the secondary effects (such as selecting a
target altitude leading to the engines being retarded to idle, and needing
several seconds to develop full power again) need to be well understood by the
pilots.

I recommend the report in Flight, and I hope that someone who understands
the A320 systems is able to post an analysis of what went wrong to RISKS.

Andrew McKechnie, in a letter in Flight Int'l (May 2-8) reports that the
February issue of Log (the journal of the British Airline Pilots'
Association) contains two observations on the A320 systems by an A320 pilot.

"The author, who has experience of flying the A320, claims that the display
of airspeed is less than compelling and also that he has 'experienced an
occasion when the autothrottle made no attempt to hold a correct speed'."

Comment by MCT: the latter point could be a misunderstanding of the active
flight mode and therefore of the speed which the fly-by-wire system deemed to
be correct. In other words, if the incident reported really occurred, it could
be evidence of a technical malfuction OR it could be evidence of the pilot's
difficulty in understanding what speed he/she had caused the computers to
select as the target speed. In either case it is relevent to RISKS.

I saw the TV reports (on the local NBC affiliate, Channel 5).  I'd like to add
a bit to what's been said so far about the (allegedly) undeserved parking
tickets:
 
   1) According to the news reports, the city blames the incident on human
      error--on the part of the officer issuing the ticket, the operator
      keying in the information, or both.  This time (see below), they didn't
      try to call it a computer error; that designation came from those
      reporting on the story.
 
   2) Illinois license plates indicate a registration type and plate number.
      Taxis have Taxi plates; the plate numbers end in TX, as well (e.g.
      12345 TX).  Livery vehicles have livery plates, with numbers ending
      in LV.  State and local governments have their own plate types, as
      do some utilities.  So, the same series of digits can appear on a
      large number of plates; other plate information must be used to
      distinguish among them.  If the other information does not make it
      into the computer, for whatever reason, the ticket will be charged
      to the wrong plate; if the other information is garbled, the same
      will happen.  I've had the misfortune to examine a number of parking
      tickets over the years; from what I've seen, the quality of the input
      documents (written in ink by an officer standing by the car, possibly
      in high winds and freezing rain) makes errors in transcription rather
      likely.
 
   3) This is not the first time this has happened.  Last time, back in
      about 1985, the city switched over to a ticket tracking system that
      didn't allow for a distinction among plate types.  When the data from
      the old system was transferred to the new, information was lost; all
      Taxi, RV, Livery, etc. tickets were charged to the passenger plates
      with the same number.  (The firm that got the contract was not based
      in Illinois; they had no idea what our license plates look like.  If
      this sounds to the reader as though the contract should not have gone
      to this particular company, you are not alone; the FBI and several
      federal courts have agreed with you, if I recall correctly.)
 
 The details above are from memory; corrections and amplifications are most
welcome.  The opinions are mine; they do not necessarily correspond to those
held by my employer or by any organization who might happen to forward my

The recent postings about the woman in Florida and the (possibly malicious)
problems involved with her phones reminded me of problems of a decidedly
non-malicious problem I had involving the Census Bureau's toll free system.

Each census form sent by the Bureau of the Census was contained in an envelope
on which was printed a toll-free number to call in case of any questions
(800-999-1990).  I had a relatively simple question, and found that one of two
things happened on the 100 or so times I tried the number: either (1) a busy
signal (the usual result); or (2) a few rings, a few rings (pitched slightly
higher), then a click, and finally a connection, to another person with a
question!  The second case happened twice: both the other party and myself were
rather confused for half a minute or so.

I finally did get through to an actual Census employee, and I relayed my
problems with the phone system to her.  She replied that other callers had
relayed similar problems.  I wonder if the Bureau of the Census will fix its
phone system in the next ten years.

One particular scenario which is worth considering is that of intentional
sabotage by active insiders.  A few years back a new large telephone switch was
installed in a very high profile site to serve as a demonstration of
technological achievement and to garner additional sales.  The switch was
plagued for many months with severe problems, most along the line of partial or
complete service failure, and occasionally bizarre behaviour.  Made the papers
many times...  Rather embarassing to say the least.

Naturally, the service provider was concerned, and involved the switch
manufacturer who spent many months (and millions of dollars) analysing the
hardware and software, involving both the original R&amp;D organization and outside
consultants to try to establish a cause.  All to no avail.

It wasn't until the manufacturer slipped in one of their own personnel into the
on-site maintenance crew (the provider was refusing to permit this) that the
problem was resolved: one of the service provider's onsite people was
intentionally shorting out signals (amongst other things reasonably difficult
to pinpoint after the fact).

Sorry to be so cagey.  I understand that most of this has been documented in
the press, but I'm not absolutely certain of the precise details, nor wish to
subject the companies involved with further embarrassment.  Especially since I
don't know whether or not the person was charged, what with, nor whether it was
successful, nor why he was doing it in the first place.

You may wish to treat this story as totally apocryphal, that's up to you,
but a scenario of active inside sabotage is certainly possible and should
be investigated by your contact's phone service.

My recollection of this is fuzzy, but the recent discussion of telephone
switch problems eventually reminded me of some major problems experienced
in Ottawa at an early Bell Northern installation.  Large numbers of
telephone misfunctions developed at this showcase operation, but I
believe they were eventually traced to the actions of a disgruntled
former employee.

I believe he was entering the equipment room and shorting conductors
together.  I'm sure that some Bell Northern folk who read RISKS are
better informed than I on this matter; perhaps some of them could comment?

A new white paper from SRI International's Information and Telecommunication
Sciences and Technology Division is now available.

The paper, "Improving the Security of Your UNIX System," describes measures
that you as a system administrator can take to make your UNIX system(s) more
secure.  Oriented primarily at SunOS 4.x, most of the information covered
applies equally well to any Berkeley UNIX system with or without NFS and/or
Yellow Pages (NIS).  Some of the information can also be applied to System
V, although this is not a primary focus of the paper.

An abbreviated Table of Contents:

	1. INTRODUCTION
		The Internet Worm, the Wily Hacker, other break-ins
	2. IMPROVING SECURITY
	   2.1 Account Security
	   	Passwords, expiration dates, guest accounts, group accounts,
		Yellow Pages
	   2.2 Network Security
		Trusted hosts, secure terminals, NFS, FTP, TFTP, mail,
		finger, modems and terminal servers, firewalls
	   2.3 File System Security
		Setuid shell scripts, sticky bit on directories, setgid
		bit on directories, umask values, encrypting files,
		devices
	3. MONITORING SECURITY
	   3.1 Account Security
	   	lastlog, utmp, wtmp, acct
	   3.2 Network Security
	   	syslog, showmount
	   3.3 File System Security
	   	find, checklists, backups
	   3.4 Know Your System
	   	ps, who, w, ls
	4. SOFTWARE FOR IMPROVING SECURITY
	   4.1 Obtaining Fixes and New Versions
	  	Sun fixes on UUNET, Berkeley fixes, SIMTEL-20 and UUNET,
		vendors
	   4.2 The npasswd Command
	   4.3 The COPS Package
	   4.4 Sun C2 Security Features
	   4.5 Kerberos
	5. KEEPING ABREAST OF THE BUGS
	   5.1 CERT
	   5.2 DDN Management Bulletins
	   5.3 Security-related mailing lists
	6. SUGGESTED READING
	7. CONCLUSIONS
	REFERENCES
	APPENDIX A - SECURITY CHECKLIST

In order to format the paper, the "troff" text formatter and the "-ms" macro
package (available with any Sun or Berkeley UNIX system) are required.  You
*do not* need a PostScript printer, unless you want to print the cover page
with the SRI logo on it.

The paper is available via anonymous FTP from the host SPAM.ITSTD.SRI.COM
(128.18.4.3) as the file "pub/security-doc.tar.Z".  Be sure to remember to
set "image" mode on the transfer.  Sorry, UUCP access is not available - if
you don't have Internet access, find a friend who does.

    VIRUS FOUND IN A JAPANESE GAME SOFTWARE ON THE MARKET

                                          Yoshio Oyanagi
                                          University of Tsukuba, Japan

     Newspapers reported on April 24 that a virus was found in a simulation
game software "FAR SIDE MOON" (9500 yen) for Sharp personal computer X68000.
It has been sold by Artdink Inc. since April 13 in Japan.  The virus was
detected by Computer Virus Institute (Takao Yamamoto, director) of Federation
of Japanese Computer Clubs.

     According to Yamamoto, this virus is programmed so that it keeps
inactive until July and after that data on floppy or in the computer will
automatically be erased whenever one switches on the computer.

     So far 3000 sets have been sold, among which half are contaminated.
It is conjectured that the computers in Artdink Inc. are invaded by the
virus while developping the game software.

     Today (May 2) Asahi Shinbun (one of the major daily newspaper in
Japan) disclosed that it succeeded in making contact with one of the virus
makers.  According to the report, the maker is a high school boy of age 17,
who lives in Kagawa prefecture.  Forty people collaborated in making the
virus and got several tens of thousand yen (several hundred dollars) for
each from the client, who ordered through PC network for hackers.  The
virus program was completed in three months and distributed secretly
since last September.

     Federation of Japanese Computer Clubs told that there have been
two viruses (viri?) for X68000, named "Namba I" and "Namba II".
"Namba I" becomes active on July 4 this year and it deletes data on
the computer or foppy disks.  If the computer is contaminated with
both "Namba I" and "Namba II", some X68000 do not accept any floppy
after 0:00 May 2.  The federation has developped a vaccine and
distributing it among PC shops and users. If, however, a computer
is contaminated with both viruses, it does not even accept the floppy
disk of the vaccine.  In this case, user should bring the computer
to the maker and ask to change the parts.

I am not sure of the truth behind this article, but the possibilities scare me
a little. It is quoted from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, 3 May 1990.

When a man visited the Minnesota lottery office with a winning ticket worth
$1000, employees looked through his records and found he owed the state that
amount - and more.  So he was handed a cheque for $0.00 - and a tax form.

A 12-year old boy in Grosse Ile, Michigan, got into TRW's credit info system,
and BBoarded various credit card numbers -- which were subsequently widely
used.  His mother was stunned by his arrest, and ``said he spent four to five
hours each week night and up to 14 hours a day on weekends at his computer.
She said she was pleased her son stayed at home.''  [Source: Knight-Ridder News

If past experience is any indication, he probably found the TRW access

In case you were away from the media over the weekend, Federal District Judge
Howard G. Munson pronounced sentence last Friday, 4 May, on Robert T. Morris,
fining him $10,000, requiring 400 hours of community service, and placing him
on three-years' probation, plus some additional administrative expenses.
(Legal costs were undoubtably much greater than the fine, so the cost to Robert
is not insignificant.)

In the final analysis, the judge made a technically elaborate ruling that the
new Federal sentencing guidelines (which recommend a min-max jail-term range
based on a detailed point system) were NOT APPLICABLE in this case, in part
because the case did not really involve computer FRAUD, and in part because
there were no COMPARABLE cases on which to base the sentencing, as required
under the guidelines when there is any question as to their relevance.  In so
doing, the judge said he disagreed with both sides -- the prosecution, which
wanted to add more points primarily because of even greater consequential
(indirect) losses than had been explicitly identified during the trial, and the
defense, which sought to reduce the numbers on a variety of component points.
INTENT, which had been ruled largely irrelevant to the verdict, may actually
have been somewhat relevant in the sentencing.  [This is my own private
analysis, and may not be precise enough in the legalese department.]

I conclude that this case was actually not an appropriate test of either the
computer security laws or of the sentencing guidelines.  On the other hand, I
think that the Government will not be discouraged by the absence of a jail term
in this case, and can be expected to prosecute quite vigorously all acts of
more flagrant computer misuse (e.g., sabotage, intentional denials of service,
or theft of data or proprietary programs).  Although RTM's "experiment" was
certainly ill-conceived and flawed in its execution, his sentence is not
likely to encourage others to conduct similar experiments.  

I commend to you the report by Davy Curry (see his messages in <A HREF="/Risks/9.88.html">RISKS-9.88</A> and
again in this issue) on how to improve the security of your Unix systems (with
some implications for other computer systems as well).  It is high time people
with vulnerable systems did something more serious about protecting them, and
his report is a useful contribution, going well beyond the Internet Worm
articles of Eichin and Rochlis, Seeley, and Spafford in that it transcends the
particular flaws exercised by the Worm.  Remember, it may be YOUR privacy
rights that are being protected, which should make the increased security a
little more tolerable.  On the other hand, let me once again reinforce my hopes
that we can live in a less antagonistic, more open, and more ethical society in
which computer security is somewhat less critical!

PGN

P.S., PRIMARILY FOR RECIPIENTS OF MULTIPLE RISKS COPIES: Speaking of SENDMAIL
problems, for no apparent reason the last three previous RISKS issues have gone
out with NO DUPLICATE ISSUES attributable to our originating sendmail.  A few
recipient sites seem to have cleaned up their acts, almost all .arpa addresses
are gone, and a bunch of other problematic addresses have been relegated to a
potentially higher-risk sublist.  Because of the annual IEEE Oakland security
bash and other activities, RISKS issues will be sporadic at best this week, and
are likely to emerge at higher risk than the recent carefully-monitored issues
-- when you, me, and my wizards were able to watch the mailer in progress.
Perhaps on this issue the unwatched pot will boil over, but I am optimistic for
a change.  (The fascinating part was that the problem was hitting different
addresses in different sublists each time.)  [FOR THIS ISSUE ONLY, if you get
multiples, a few of you should send a message to root@csl.sri.com, although the
problem would not get taken care of until later today -- because it is too
early for wizards (only mad dogs and RISKS moderators).  On the other hand,
running sendmail in the wee hours seems to minimize the problem, because the
originating host and the network are livelier!  In any case, thanks for your
patience.]  By the way, I hope that there are no lawsuits against RISKS for
causing denials of service in overflowing your mailbox.  On the other hand, I
am surprised I haven't heard more complaints about my boring you with too many
messages about sendmail problems and telephone glitches (which seem to be dying
down).  But the risks are there...  PGN

Fri, 4 May 90 13:14:02 BST
</i><PRE>

Some fifteen months ago, in <A HREF="/Risks/8.21.html">RISKS-8.21</A>, I placed a request for information
on the possible health hazards of office Laser Printers.

I received a small flurry of replies, a significant proportion of which
were simply expressing similar concern.  Facts and figures were very thin
on the ground.

At the same time I attempted a literature search which illustrated just how
few studies on the subject had been made.

I wrote to Hewlett Packard seeking advice, but received no reply.

My own employers' Health &amp; Safety personnel found "no risk".

The data I had received did not amount to much, but a report in
The Guardian newspaper (UK), published on April 26th 1990, has added
further information that warrants some interest...

&gt;From my own efforts, I understood the possible hazards to be:

(a) mutagenic and/or carcinogenic compounds contained (and thereby released
into the atmosphere) in the toner;

(b) poisonous compounds on the drum; and

(c) toxic gasses generated by the high electrical discharges involved.


(A)  Jeffrey Mogul wrote that Digital supply printers, with Ricoh marking
engines, the replacement toner cartridge kits of which contain "Material
Safety Data Sheets".  These list under "hazardous ingredients" Ferrosoferric
oxide, Styrene Acryic resin, "dye" and carbon black.

The toxicity of the oxide is described as zero.  That of the resin as being
rendered biologically inert by the polymerisation process.  The "dye" is
not discussed.  Carbon black has been subject to toxicity and carcinogenic
exposure experiments.  One view is that while carbon black particulates
contain some molecules of carcinogenic materials, the carcinogens are
apparently held tightly and are not eluted by water, gastric juices or

suggest, is that compounds in the toners used are responsible for this
mutagenic activity.

carbon black with aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons and nitropyrenes,
thermoplastic resins) and the evidence for mutagenic and carcinogenic
effects of these toners, also covers the effects of ozone, selenium
and organic solvents on health.

&gt;From "The Guardian", April 26th, 1990:

A Science correspondent, Barry Fox, reported seeing a strange device
underneath a Laser Printer in a University in Denmark.  "Oh, that's an
ozone filter" was the explanation, "most laser printers in Denmark have
them".

Fox reported never having heard the suggestion that such a device was
required...

"Ozone is an unstable form of oxygen, O3, produced by high voltages and
electrical discharges...  So they (laser printers) generate ozone.  Despite
the tangy smell, best described as the smell of electricity, ozone is not
good for health:  just the opposite, in fact.

...Ozone soon breaks down into oxygen, but does so while attacking just
about anything except glass and some stainless steels.

...The Health and Safety Executive (UK body) recommends an exposure limit
of 0.1 parts ozone per million of air, averaged over an eight hour day, with
no 15 minute peak greater than 0.3ppm.  Even at 0.1ppm, premature ageing
may eventually result, and in the short term, 0.1ppm can cause eye, nose
and throat irritation.  At 0.5ppm nausea and headaches may occur.

Exposure for two hours at 1.5ppm typically results in coughs and excessive
sputum.  At 50ppm, a 30 minute exposure may be fatal.

 'Areas must be equipped with adequate ventilation and extraction
facilities' warns the HSE...

...Office equipment is usually fitted with filters, containing activated carbon
to break down ozone.  When factory fresh, these filters reduce ozone to well
below the HSE levels.  But filters are small and lose efficiency with time,
especially if clogged with dust (paper, toner etc), so clogging is faster
if ventilation is poor.  And ozone is more dangerous when ventilation is
poor.  Ozone can often be smelled while printing, especially near the outlet
of the machine's internal fan.

...When I (Barry Fox) started asking questions I was appalled at the lack
of interest among firms selling office equipment {mentions Hewlett-Packard
- see my experience of same, above, Apple and IBM}...

...Then I (Barry Fox) tracked down the firm which makes add-on filters...
Dansk Teknologi of Copenhagen started making its Minozon unit in the summer
of 1988 and sold 8000 in the first year.  (It) is a flat plate... containing
a large bed of activated carbon through which air from the printer
discharges...  (It) is around 50 times larger than (the inbuilt filters).

The Department of Environment Technology, at the Danish Institute of
Technology, tested the Minozon filter and found that it remained fully
effective even after continuously printing 10,000 A4 pages...  (They)
cost 300 to 400 pounds sterling in the UK.

At first sight it would seem cheaper and simpler ... to change the filters
built into (the) printers.  But, absurdly, built-in printer filters are often
not designed for do-it-yourself replacement.

After writing about the ozone problem in New Scientist I (Barry Fox) received
many enquiries...  IBM thought I had been 'wound up' by the firm selling the
add-on filters used in Denmark.  Apple remained dormant.  HP, however,
confirmed it had 'escalated the whole issue of ozone filters' and made
 'strong recommendations' that filter changing guidelines be incorporated in
user manuals.

...The short term advice is: if you smell ozone while printing, open the
windows."


Me: depends which way the wind is blowing :-) Since it is not possible to tell
when the in-built catalytic filter is exhausted, and identification of ozone's
characteristic smell is uncertain, *active* ventilation should be a requirement
before installation of laser printers is considered within habitually occupied
offices.

Any further comments, anyone?

&gt;At 3,000 feet inbound on the Instrument Landing System localiser we were
&gt;experiencing westerly winds of 188 knots

This just doesn't seem believable to me.  This is higher wind velocity than in
the strongest hurricanes.  Does anyone have any confirming information that
there really were winds like that?

When I read it, I assumed that it was another indication of a glitch in the
FMCS software.  Listening to Austin ATC, I've noticed a tendency for pilots
in glass cockpits to depend very heavily on the FMCS when giving such infor-
mation.  When the FMCS is down, they often reply "unable" to give the 
requested information.  In real life, all they have to do to get to their
destination is track a VOR station inbound; that provides an automatic 
wind correction.  Then it's just a case of guesstimating groundspeed and 
cross-checking that with the (computerized) flight plan, to judge the arrival 
time.  So there's not much incentive to keep basic nav skills, like 
determining the wind vector, alive.  

Now, as for whether it's POSSIBLE...  not likely, unless they were in a major
storm.  And if they were, why weren't upper-level wind speeds very high?  And
why would they have continued the approach?  At high altitudes, winds can
get up to that speed, with no major problems for aircraft flying through them,
(except in boundary regions), but near the surface, 188-knot winds would 
likely result in monstrous wind shear (as a result of the mechanical 
interaction of winds with the surface).  At 80 knots, there would be pretty 
bad wind shear.  And even 80 knots is beyond the crosswind capability
of jet transport category aircraft.

Nah, it was a glitch.  Adds more drama to the primary story of the avionics
going haywire on the go-around, though.  I would LIKE to think that the crew
was mentioning this as an event in a continuing sequence of failure, and
didn't actually believe it had 188 knot winds... :-)

&gt;The author, who has experience of flying the A320, claims that the display
&gt;of airspeed is less than compelling

It's noteworthy that the A320's airspeed display is a "tape" instrument, with
white letters set on a gray "tape," all mounted on a black background.  Current
airspeed is indicated by a single red "lubber line"; the speed tape scrolls 
behind that line.  This is in contrast to the tape airspeed displays on the 
747-400 and MD-11, which have a "window" in which the current airspeed is 
displayed, in a much larger font.  The latter approach is more in keeping with 
the results of real-life experience with analog tape (such as is used on the 
C-141 and C-5A) and drum digital counters.  I don't know what Airbus was 
thinking when it decided on a red lubber line: it's an intuitively bad design, 
and has earned criticism from many pilots.

It's probable that the use of tape displays, as a category of indicators, is
predicated entirely on the economics and desirability of having CRT flight
displays.  Screen real estate is at a premium.  There is no demonstrable UI
advantage to using tape instruments; in fact, at least some research suggests
the contrary.  Tape instruments are prone to misreadings.

I began my undergraduate education at a church-related college in Texas.  To
handle long distance calls from dorm phones the phone company issued everyone
"student billing cards."  The phone company waved the deposit because of
the reputation (?) of the school.  

Then I transferred and again decided to live in the dorm.  I contacted the 
phone company and explained how I had a "student" card in Texas.  They had a 
similar deal but required that a heftly deposit remain on account.  I 
explained that I had a card in Texas with no deposit.  The woman suggested 
that I write a letter about my previous account and include my card number 
if possible.  A few weeks later I was issued a "student" card without a 
deposit because the "the computer" showed that my Texas card was actually a 
"normal" billing card and I had a good payment history.  They could
not issue a "normal" card for a dorm resident.   

Each new school year I would call the phone company and confirm that my
card was still active.  Each year I had the same card number.

Well, my last year I got lazy.  I just began using it like usual and never 
got a complaint from an operator.  I was making calls during the day 
related to job hunting, so I expected horrible bills.  The months went by,
but no bills came.  I called the phone company in December.  Somehow I had 
visions of the university holding my diploma if I had outstanding bills.  
The phone person insisted that my account showed zero.  Then I talked to the 
supervisor, and he also stated that my account was entirely paid with no phone 
calls on record for my card or my dorm phone number.  I told him exactly where 
I had been calling and the charges I expected.  One week later a programmer 
called and congratulated me on beating the phone system.  Apparently my 
"student" card had some kind of odd designator on the number that merged it 
into the "normal" card database.  The phone company had actually terminated 
the "student" card program many months before.  My number had survived but 
with no connections into billing.  The employee informed me that my card had 
been terminated in good standing. 

So I got out into the real world and called to get a telephone hooked up.
I carefully gave them both "student" numbers.  They told me that no deposit
would be required because of my excellent payment history...

I don't know if these two stories shed any light on the problems,
but they're illustrative of system-level failures.

When I lived in Durham, NC, during the early 1970s, the local phone
system (GTE) did not have Automatic Number Identification (ANI) on
long-distance calls.  As a result, whenever you placed such a call
(and you could direct-dial), an operator would come online and ask
what number you were calling from.  The possibilities for error
and fraud are, of course, obvious, and it was always a subject
of much discussion what checking was done.  Did they at least have
information on your exchange?  Could they tell if the alleged calling
line was actually busy?  And most important, what happened to
misattributed calls?  One prevalent local rumor had it that such
calls, when challenged, were randomly assigned to other phone lines,
in proportion to the number of actual calls.  That theory always
seemed improbable, but...

One day, we receive a bill showing a call to %Fayetteville.  Now,
we knew that none of us had ever called Fayetteville, much less
%Fayetteville, so we went through the usual ritual of calling up
to complain.  The response this time was totally unexpected.  ``I'm
sorry, sir, but our records show that that charge has already been
investigated from a previous bill, and found to be justified.''
That was totally erroneous, and we could prove it -- we had all
of our phone bills going back for quite some time.  I told the
agent this; she relented, and took the charge off the bill.

We never did figure out where that call came from, what the % meant,
or why GTE tried to claim that it was a call we had previously
challenged.

The second incident happened several years later, in Chapel Hill,
after Southern Bell had (by order of the State Utilities Commission)
bought out the local university-owned phone system, but before they'd
had a chance to upgrade it to use a switch not seemingly hand-built
by Strowger himself.  They were running out of phone numbers on the
exchanges, and they didn't want to expand the old switch because
they were frantically trying to replace it with an ESS.  So new
customers, especially in the southern part of the service, were
assigned phone numbers on the university Centrex system, and hence
could abbreviate much of their dialing.  In particular, when I wanted
to call the port selector at the Comp Center, I'd dial 3-9911, instead
of 933-9911.  Now, I had one of the old mechanical, card-operated
autodialers that somehow the local phone company didn't know about.
This beast dialed quickly (for a pulse dialer), and sometimes the
switch couldn't keep up.  So, when the second digit arrived too
soon, it would reset, and give me dial tone again -- just in time
for the last three digits, 911...

The rest of the Chapel Hill phone system was on a par with the switch, but I'll
omit the details; they belong in Telecom Digest, or maybe the Museum of
Horrors.

This is in relation to phone company billing practices, both ATT and Sprint.
First an observation about AT&amp;T and "instant credit".

When one gets a bad international line, AT&amp;T does not expect payment for the
call.  One can just call the operator, tell them what happened, and forget
about it.  Well, this is incorrect: one must call twice.  The first call is
right after the problem occurs.  The operators cheerfully agree to immediate
credit.  At the end of the month, lo and behold, the call is still billed.
This gives rise to a second call which finally settles the matter.

It happened to me, and others I asked (I'm a graduate student, with lots of
foreign nationals in the department.)  I've once seen a friend's bill with a
dozen or so failed overseas calls.  All one minute long, all one right after
another.  All called in to the operator as soon as they were made.

It's enough to make one suspect that it's deliberate; corporate customers
especially might not keep accurate track of all short overseas calls.


Now the Sprint story.

A few months ago (Jan 20), I had occasion to make an international call to
Europe (Romania).  Not being up-to-date on the latest prices (I asked the
operators, and apparently prices are no longer distributed; I guess you're
expected to call every time you want to check.)  I called the long-distance
carriers I knew about, found that Sprint had the lowest rates by a fair
margin, so I called them through their access number (my primary carrier is
AT&amp;T).

When the bill arrived, it was about 50% higher than I expected.  I called
Sprint (Mar 2), and asked about their rates again, and they again quoted the
same numbers.  I then mentioned the bill.  The operator did some more
checking, then announced that yes, apparently they changed their rates at
the beginning of the year (Jan 1), and that billing was done based on the
new rates.  She was apologetic, and said she would call this to the company's
attention.

Apparently Sprint was still giving out the old rates, three months after new
rates were in effect!

	Some interesting but unimportant trivia about this case.  When I used
to work at Bell Northern Research (research arm of Northern Telecom) someone in
the know told me about this story.  Apparently it was known internally as the
gold ring problem.  A disgruntled employee would run his gold wedding ring
along the back of the Printed Circuit Boards and short the system, resetting
it.
	For a telephone switch provider, where down time called for in tenders
is one hour per 40 years, the damage to their reputation was enormous.
Apparently they lost millions tracking down this "bug" and even more in lost
sales from the bad reputation this flagship switch generated.  I believe they
tracked it down by matching operator logs with system resets.
	I heard that the operator was later found floating dead in the 
Ottawa river :-)

Due to the overwhelming demand (1000 FTP connections in 24 hours) for
my paper, "Improving the Security of Your UNIX System," I have made it
available via some other sources, listed below.

Thanks to the system administrators at these sites who've allowed me to
distribute the paper through their machines.

Dave Curry, SRI International

Last update: May 3, 1990

The SRI International white paper, "Improving the Security of Your UNIX
System," may be obtained via the following methods:

1. ANONYMOUS FTP
    The document is available via anonymous FTP from the following
    hosts:

	(West Coast)	Host: SPAM.ITSTD.SRI.COM
			Addr: 128.18.4.3
			File: pub/security-doc.tar.Z
	(West Coast)	Host: GATEKEEPER.DEC.COM
			Addr: 16.1.0.2
			File: pub/doc/sri-security-doc.tar.Z
	(East Coast)	Host: UUNET.UU.NET
			Addr: 192.48.96.2
			File: doc/security-doc.tar.Z
	(Midwest)	Host: TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU
			Addr: 128.146.8.60
			File: pub/security/security-doc.tar.Z
	(MILNET)	Host: WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
			Addr: 26.2.0.74
			File: pd2:&lt;unix-c.info&gt;security-doc.tar-z

    Transfer the file in "binary" mode from SPAM, TUT and UUNET, or 
    "tenex" mode from SIMTEL-20.  After you get the file, execute 
    the commands:

   	% uncompress security-doc.tar.Z
	% tar xf security-doc
	% cd security-doc

    And now consult the README file.

2. UUCP
    UUNET subscribers can obtain the document via UUCP from UUNET using a
    command of the form

	uucp uunet!~/doc/security-doc.tar.Z destination-filename

    UUCP sites that are not UUNET subscribers will not be able to get it
    directly through them, but may be able to find another UUCP neighbor
    who has the file.

    You can obtain the file via "anonymous" UUCP from Ohio State University
    by placing the following line in your L.sys file:

	#
	# Direct Trailblazer
	#
	osu-cis Any ACU 19200 1-614-292-5112 in:--in:--in: Uanon
	#
	# Micom port selector, at 1200, 2400, or 9600 bps.
	# Replace ##'s below with 12, 24, or 96 (both speed and phone number).
	#
	osu-cis Any ACU ##00 1-614-292-31## "" \r\c Name? osu-cis nected \c GO \d\r\d\r\d\r in:--in:--in: Uanon

    and then issue the command

	uucp osu-cis!~/security/security-doc.tar.Z destination-filename

3. BITNET
    BITNET users may obtain the document via the European TRICKLE servers
    from the UNIX-SW archives.  To do this, use the TELL command as follows:

	TELL TRICKLE AT SOMEHOST /PDGET &lt;UNIX-SW.INFO&gt;SECURITY-DOC.TAR-Z

    where SOMEHOST is one of:

	DKTC11		Denmark
	TREARN		Turkey
	IMIPOLI		Italy
	BANUFS11	Belgium
	AWIWUW11	Austria
	DB0FUB11	Germany
	EB0UB011	Spain

    There are no TRICKLE hosts in the U.S.; the Europeans are graciously
    allowing U.S. BITNET users to access their machines.  Please be kind
    to them.  Sorry, but the LISTSERV machines at RPIECS and NDSUVM do
    not provide access to the UNIX-SW repository.

    The file will arrive in BITSEND, NETDATA format.  You should use the
    BITRCV command from RDRList to get the file.  (I have no idea what
    this means -- go find an IBM guru if you don't know either.)

    This will be a BINARY file.  You won't be able to do much of anything
    with it on an IBM system.  Instead, transfer it to a UNIX system,
    and then uncompress it and extract the tar file, and then format
    things.  See above under "FTP" for how to do this.

4. ELECTRONIC MAIL
    The document may also be obtained from the SUN-SPOTS archive server
    located on host TITAN.RICE.EDU.  In order to request the document,
    send a note with the word

	help

    to "archive-server@titan.rice.edu" (uunet!rice!archive-server).

    I don't, as of this writing, know what the path to the document
    will be, so you'll have to use the "index" command to hunt around
    for it.  It will probably live in the "sun-source" directory, so
    you may want to just send "index sun-source" instead of "help".

5. DECNET
    DECNET users can obtain the file by copying

    	DECWRL::"/pub/doc/sri-security-doc.tar.Z"

    by using the COPY command, or whatever.

&gt;From the May, 1990 issue of Monitoring Times, Page 4:

Electronic Blizzard Brings Down U.S. Planes

The Scene is Libya, 1986. High in the sky, an armada of 33 high-tech U.S.
fighter planes begin their attack. But something is wrong. One plane, carrying
two crew members, crashes. Of the surviving 32 planes -- including five F-11's
-- seven are unable to get off even a single shot.  The probably reason: an
electronic blizard that, according to Pentagon officials, came not from the
Libyans but from high-powered U.S. military transmitters that filled the night
sky with electronic signals designed to jam Libya's anti-aircraft defenses,
hunt down targets, guide weapons and communicate.

According to Air Force Colonel Charles Quisenberry, during the Libran strike,
U.S. weapons "were interfering with each other." Numerous U.S.  weapons, some
of which were electronically guided, went astray during the attack, damaging
three foreign embassies and diplomatic residences, uncluding those of France
and Japan.

Further, says Quisenberry, some of this interference can "actually effect the
... aircraft's flight controls as well as its fuel controls," either putting a
plan into an uncontrolled turn or dive or turning off its fuel supply.

The Pentagon recently finished a classified seven-month investigation of the
prolem which led officials to order a more detailed three-year probe.
Preliminary studies of one war plan shows "thousands of [frequency] conflics"
among weapons. Says Quisenberry, "There are major, major problems out there..."

From The New York Times, May 4, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final
Section A; Page 12, Column 3.  

In Colorado, a Furor Over Computer Mail (By JOHN MARKOFF)

   For more than a year, the Mayor of Colorado Springs read the electronic
messages about city business that members of the City Council sent to one
another from computers at their homes.  The disclosure of the Mayor's mail
perusal has not only touched off a bitter political dispute in the city but has
also put a spotlight on problems in reconciling advances in computer technology
with laws on open meetings, public records and personal privacy.

   The Mayor, Robert Isaac, has defended his actions, saying he monitored the
council members' messages because he was concerned that they were using the
system to hold illegal caucuses. Under Colorado law, City Council business,
with a few exceptions, must be conducted at public forums.
 
'Public vs. Private Conflict'

''It's a good example of public versus private conflict in the face of new
technology,'' said Carol Gould, a professor at the Stevens Institute of
Technology, who has studied the ethical implications of computer networks.
''It's a problem that computer technology exacerbates, and it points to the
importance of designing systems that distinguish between private communications
and open public discussions.''

More broadly, the case has raised concern that actions like those of Mayor
Isaac could undermine public trust in computerized technology designed to
promote efficiency in civic affairs and to allow more residents to participate
in their local government.

''It's serious,'' said Marc Rotenberg, national director of the Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, an advocacy group.  ''Because users of
electronic mail systems should have a fundamental expectation of
confidentiality, when that expectation is breached, the value of the network is
undermined and a chilling effect on future use is likely to result.''

Some City Council members said that even if the Mayor's actions were legal,
they undermined the political system.  ''I did not know the Mayor was reviewing
our mail,'' said Mary Lou Makepeace, a Council member. ''At the very least,
it's bad manners.''  But at least two of the nine members said they had been
aware that the Mayor had access to computer printouts of messages stored in the
system. Only six members of the Council were using the computer system. $22,000
Computer System At the heart of the dispute is a computer system the Council
purchased in November 1988. The $22,000 system included portable computers for
Council members to permit them to send and receive electronic messages while
they were away from the city offices. The base computer in the city offices
also enabled officials to post public notices that city residents could see by
calling the system.
                                                                 
The Mayor's ability to monitor the messages was curtailed in February after
several members of the Council became curious about his knowledge of issues
that had been discussed on the computer. After they raised the issue, City
Manager Roy Pederson decided the messages were as private as telephone calls
and should therefore be read only by those to whom they were addressed. He
ordered that a city secretary stop making copies of the messages from the base
computer at the city offices.

The Mayor confirmed that he had been reading the messages by complaining to the
Council later that his access to them had been cut off.  Mayor Isaac, who will
become president of the United States Conference of Mayors in June, said he
thought the Council members understood that all the messages sent on the
computers could be read by anyone with access to the system.
 
He Seeks Public Access

Mayor Isaac told the Council that he had received copies so he would know what
everyone on the Council was talking about. He said he believed that each
Council member should see copies of the materials and that they should be open
to the news media as well to make sure the Council was complying with the state
law on conducting business in public. The Mayor also said he believed that the
information on the computer, including the Council members' messages, should be
accessible to the public.

''It's still an issue at this point,'' said Wayne Fisher, a Council member who
says he is considering filing a complaint with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation under the 1986 Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
''Several times on the system I sent messages to other Council members that
said, 'Boy, am I glad the Mayor can't read this.' ''

The law requires operators of public electronic communications systems to
protect the privacy of messages on their system. The law distinguishes betweeen
public systems and those that are for private use. But the law also places some
restrictions on privately maintained systems. Violations carry a maximum
penalty of five years in prison.

Until recently Mr. Isaac, a three-term Republican, was considering running
as a Republican candidate for governor, but he decided not to enter the
primary. He said his decision to withdraw was not related to the electronic
mail controversy.
                                                                 
Mayor Opposed the System

But Mayor Isaac said he believed the issue was being used for attacks by
Democratic politicians. ''I personally don't think we ought to be paying tax
money for private telecommunications,'' said Mr. Isaac, who had opposed
purchasing the computer system.

The City Attorney, James Colvin, who is now reviewing the city's policy
regarding the use of the electronic mail system, said he did not believe that
the Mayor's actions had violated the communications privacy law.  But legal
experts said it was possible the law had been violated.

''I think that he could be in some trouble,'' said John Podesta, a consultant
in the District of Columbia, who formerly served as legal counsel to Senator
Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the principal sponsor of the
communications law.  Mr. Podesta said he was concerned that the Colorado
Springs controversy would cause other cities to think twice about relying on
similar computer systems.  ''People are going to worry that if they plug into
these systems it will be like bringing Big Brother into their households,'' he
said.

There is a peculiar bug in the AppleLink application which, taking into
account the country in which I currently live (Chile) made me sit up
and grin.  (The AppleLink application is a nice front end for Apple
Computer's worldwide electronic mail and bulletin board system.)
 
This is the bug:
 
  1  Write a new memo and save it using the name "General".
  2  Quit to the Finder or switch to it if you're using MultiFinder.
  3  Now try to find the file "General".  It's not there!
 
This problem occurs in both AppleLink version 4 and version 5.  I don't
have a copy of version 5.1, so I can't tell if it happens there as well.
The problem is repeatable 100%.  A document that is supposedly saved as
"General" will cause some disk activity as if it is being saved, but
you will never find anything on your disk.  As far as I only it only
happens with documents saved as "General".
 
You can imagine how baffled I was the first time it happened to me, just
after finishing a lengthy letter.  I looked all over the place using
disk utilities, searching utilities, etc. (no, you hackers out there:
the file is not "invisible" either).  It was gone.
 
However, after a while the logic behind the "General's disappearing act"
dawned on me: some of you may remember that only two months ago, Chile's
former dictatorial regime, headed by General Augusto Pinochet, was
replaced by the democratically elected president Patricio Aylwin.
 
So remember from now on: General will always disappear :)

The Spring, 1990, issue of Visions, the Oregon Graduate Institute's
quarterly magazine, has an interesting article on a man who broke into
telephone computers, creating the kinds of disruptions that have been
discussed lately on RISKS.  The programmer, named Corey Lindsly, lives
in Portland, OR.  He was eventually arrested and pled guilty to a
felony count of stealing long-distance phone service.
Here is an excerpt.

--David

	Confessions of a Computer Hacker
	by Michael Rose
	Visions (Oregon Graduate Institute quarterly magazine)
	Spring, 1990

...

Perhaps the most disturbing part of Lindsly's adventures was his
penetration of AT&amp;T Switching Control Center Systems.  These sensitive
computers support long distance telephone service.  System
administrators for 17 of these computers spent over 520 hours mopping
up Lindsly's damages.

According to [AT&amp;T New Jersey manager of corporate security Allen]
Thompson, Lindsly could have "severely disrupted" the nations's
telephone service.

Lindsly, however, bristles at the suggestion of his doing potentially
dangerous stunts.  Anything beyond harmless pranks is "beneath the
hacker ethic and uncouth," he says.

He does admit to disconnecting phones, changing billing status, and
adding custom calling features.  He also likes to convert residential
lines to coin class service, so when the unwitting homeowner picked up
his phone, a recorded voice would tell him to deposit 25 cents.

"Swapping people's phone numbers ... now that was great trick," he
recalls, with obvious amusement.  "You would have your next door
neighbor's number and he would have yours, and people would call you
and and ask for your neighbor, and vice versa, and everyone's getting
totally confused."

&gt;When a man visited the Minnesota lottery office with a winning ticket worth
&gt;$1000, employees looked through his records and found he owed the state that
&gt;amount - and more.  So he was handed a cheque for $0.00 - and a tax form.

Completely true, and has happened a number of times already.  The amounts
mentioned in local papers range up to the maximum $5,000 prize.

Quite a lot of controversy about introducing a state lottery here -- a
columnist made an interesting observation: this is the first time the
state of Minnesota (known as a very high-tax state) has ever offered a
tax break based on intelligence.  I guess I agree -- the payout is
something like 12.5 cents on the dollar.  With a max of 5 grand, it
takes a real dweeb to blow anything on a ticket.  Of course, they are
selling millions per week . . . .  Innumeracy runs rampant.

This is true.  If you win any lottery amount for which you must go to the
lottery office to collect (usually $1,000 and up) they will check you records
for:
	1) Outstanding Taxes Owed.
	2) Gov't supported loans which are in arrears
	   (i.e. delinquent or defaulted STUDENT loans)
	3) Any fines (parking, traffic, etc) owed.
	4) Basically any outstanding money owed to the gov't.
	   (Provided it is in collections)

and take that out of your winnings.  I had a friend who had won $1,000
in the Virginia lottery but had several thousand dollars in delinquent
student loans, so he had to find a very good friend, who didn't owe
the gov't money, and whom he trusted ALOT to go pick up the money.

	Ever wonder how TRW access information gets "discovered"?

	TRW dialup access is still notoriously unsecure, and any employee
in the credit office of a legitimate TRW subscriber (like a major retail
store) can obtain in a matter of minutes access information which would
allow any third party with a PC to spoof the legitimate TRW subscriber.

	During the 1970's when many TRW subscribers were still using ASR-33
teletype machines to access the TRW database, the lack of security was
appalling.  Typically, a TRW subscriber would encode credit request information
for one or more customers while the ASR-33 was offline; i.e., they would punch
a paper tape.  The TRW access code (common to a local area) and subscriber
identification number was encoded in the answerback drum of the ASR-33.  The
first part of the paper tape consisted of this punched information when the
answerback was triggered by the operator entering a CTRL-E, which was the first
step in preparing the paper tape.  A measly two-character "security check" was
then entered by hand.  This two-character "security check" often remained the
same for the better part of a year.  After the tape was prepared it was placed
in the ASR-33 reader and the local access number dialed.  Following printing of
the reports, the paper tape was discarded - usually without regard to security.
Anyone rummaging through a dumpster who got their hands on even ONE paper tape
would obtain all the access information necessary to spoof the target store.

	But wait... it gets *worse*...  The two-character "security check"
code was also openly printed on any resultant credit report!  And any
customer who asked to see their credit report (a not unusual or
unreasonable request, if made under appropriate circumstances), and
who knew where to look could obtain the subscriber identification and
security check code for the target store.

	Short of implementing a hardware encryption or other security
device whose physical presence is necessary and whose encryption and/or
authentication keys cannot be readily extracted, the risk of unauthorized
access to the TRW Credit Database will remain significant.

As I was driving through York last night, I came to a set of traffic lights
which were red-amber (for non-British readers, the British traffic lights work
on a sequence of red, red-amber, green, amber, red).  A driver in front of us
had stopped at these lights (which is slightly unusual, most UK drivers seem to
take red-amber as meaning 'go', although you are supposed to wait until the
lights go green).  After waiting at the lights for twenty seconds or so, it
became apparent that the lights weren't going to change (they normally stay
red-green for 1.2 seconds, if my memory serves me correctly), so the driver
drove on, and we followed him.

Traffic controllers in the UK are based around a microprocessor controlling
up to 16 or 32 'phases' (i.e. different sets of lights).  In addition to
software protections, a hardware interlock is provided to ensure that no
two conflicting phases go green at the same time.  However there is only
software preventing other failures.  In York there is also a traffic control
centre, which can alter traffic light timings, and other parameters (the
controller software cannot, however, be altered).

A possible scenario of what happened is that the register containing the time 
of the red-amber state became altered from 6 to some larger time step (the 
timings go up in steps of 0.2 seconds).  The implications of this are slightly
worrying: green lights on one phase with red-amber on a conflicting phase.

The above information is based on my employment with a company who makes 
traffic controllers, and may be incorrect in places, but is mostly correct.

     I posted a news about two kinds of virus Namba I and Namba II on Sharp
X68000.  During the long vacation of Japan (so called Golden Week, until May 6)
the story of a high school boy about making the virus with fourty people
according to the request of a client turned to be a fake.  Asahi Shinbun
newspaper on its May 4 issue printed an apology for making trouble to many
people with the unfounded story.

     It remains a mystery who made the two viruses and how the game
software was contaminated by them.

     Artdink Inc. is now distributing the vaccine against the virus which was
contained in the simulation game software "FAR SIDE MOON".  It says that the
virus in question is attached to the battery backed-up area of the SRAM of
X68000 and if the system is booted by a floppy without the protect seal, the
floppy is contaminated.  It is named "NX68K IPL V1.02".  The effect of the
virus is it will destroy the data on the floppy after July this year.  This
virus started to prevail among X68000 users last December.

     Artdink started to sell "FAR SIDE MOON" for X68000 on April 13 (Friday
!!!!).  3200 sets have been sold before calling back due to the virus.  Not all
the articles are contaminated, only those in limited lots.  This software
consists of three floppies, among which only game disk is contaminated while
system and data disks are not.  If a user boots the dirty floppy according to
the manual, the virus is not transfered to the SRAM.

    The vaccine, named "DOCTOR" was written by the editorial office of the
journal "Oh! X" for X68000 users.  It initializes the SRAM and make it immune
and it kills the virus on the floppy.  However, it is effective only to two
viri V1.02 and V1.05.

The Boulder, CO Sunday Camera for May 6, 1990 reports [in a box of "National
Briefs" attributed to unnamed "Camera wire services"]

Army considers computer virus as weapon:

The U.S. Army is looking for help to develop the seeds of new-age germ warfare:

It wants business to help it turn computer "viruses" into military weapons.
Experts predict the viruses, if successfully developed, could be used to wreak
havor on the increasing number of computers in the battlefield.  The
destructive computer programs, which have increasingly damaged commercial and
research computer systems in the past four years, could be used to disrupt
military communications, impede the control of weapons and feed misleading data
to enemy commanders.

The viruses could also be used to alter the programming of crucial
communications satellites serving combat units, the experts said.  The Army is
soliciting bids from small businesses to determine the feasibility of using
computer viruses in warfare.  And it is willing to pay as much as $550,000 to a
company that comes up with a plan for creating the programs -- and figures out
how to use military radio systems to introduce them into enemy computers.

[No mention of a comparable RFP to protect the Army's computers against the
same fate.]

An Associated Press story in the May 7 St. Paul Pioneer Press says that
Northwest Airlines is having recurring problems with its A-320 flight
control systems. "Northwest has sent pilots a bulletin advising them of
possible problems following 'a recent series of events related to suspected
failures' in the cockpit computer system."  Northwest is reportedly
involved in discussions with the FAA and Airbus to prevent and correct the
problems.  The rest of the report contains quotes and so forth maintaining
that none of the failures has endangered passengers, and that such failures
are normal "when you're breaking in an aircraft".  No explanation of
exactly what types of failures or anomalies have been observed.

[excerpted from the San Francisco Chronicle, 10 May 1990]

   ... Jean Olivier, NASA's deputy manager of the Hubble project, said that
  when they designed pointing instructions for the telescope, astronomers
  relied on star charts made in the 1950s.  But the stars have moved since
  then from Earth's vantage point.  The mistake was made when the scientists
  factored in the extent of that movement.
    They corrected in the wrong direction and "instead of subtracting it they
  added it or vice versa," Olivier said. ...

[end of excerpt]

However, I've heard that the Daily Telegraph attributed the miscalculation
to programmer error; a programmer mistyped the addition as a subtraction.

I'm more likely to believe the Chronicle's report, as the media nowadays prefer
to attribute errors to "computer error" if they can; otherwise they'll try to
attribute it to "programmer error".  Saying that the scientists messed up is
much less exciting-sounding and doesn't sell as many papers.

FEDS PULL PLUG ON HACKERS
Computer-fraud raid hits two homes in Michigan

By Joel J. Smith, Detroit News Staff Writer

Secret Service agents got a big surprise when they raided a Jackson-area home
as part of an investigation of a nationwide computer credit card and telephone
fraud scheme.  They found a manual that details how almost anybody can use a
computer to steal.  It also describes how to avoid detection by federal agents.
On Wednesday, James G. Huse, Jr., special agent in charge of the Secret Service
office in Detroit, said the manual was discovered when his agents and Michigan
State Police detectives broke into a home in Clark Lake, near Jackson, on
Tuesday.  Agents, who also raided a home in Temperance, Mich., near the Ohio
border, confiscated thousands of dollars in computer equipment suspected of
being used by computer buffs -- known as hackers -- in the scheme.

The raids were part of a national computer fraud investigation called Operation
Sundevil in which 150 agents simultaneously executed 28 search warrants in 16
U.S. cities.  Forty-two computer systems and 23,000 computer disks were seized
across the country.  The nationwide network reportedly has bilked phone
companies of $50 million.  Huse said the Secret Service has evidence that
computers in both of the Michigan homes were used to obtain merchandise with
illegally obtained credit card numbers.  He said long-distance telephone calls
from the homes also were billed to unsuspecting third parties.
 
There were no arrests, because it was not known exactly who was using the
computers at the homes.  Huse also said there was no evidence that the suspects
were working together.  Rather, they probably were sharing information someone
had put into a national computer "bulletin board".  [...]

Narrative in a nutshell:

Requirement: Fly to Toulouse from London late on Sunday 6th May (but not
too late to get a good French meal!). Install and check software for demo at
workshop in 2 weeks' time.  Return afternoon of Monday 7th May.

Implementation: Travel agent books Dan-Air flight. Sends tickets in folder
with "6/5/90" scribbled on cover (no proper itinerary provided). Understand
from secretary flight is 1430 from Gatwick.

Bug: Check ticket at 0530 Sunday morning. (Academic life isn't as relaxed as it
used to be pre-Thatcher :-) Flight actually booked for 1430 Saturday 5th May.
Ring travel agent in panic. Agent apologises for cock-up. Promises no problem:
rebook flight for 1430 Sunday, flight nowhere near full. Grateful relief. Begin
to feel sorry I woke his wife up so early.

Operation: Uneventful flight out. Nice dinner. Software works (!! :-). Arrive
Toulouse airport for return flight.

Another bug: "You don't seem to be booked on this flight, monsieur! But I see
that your ticket is valid. No problem! The flight is not full. We can book you
a seat."

"But how the..."

"Mais oui! If you did not show up for the outward flight, your return booking
would be automatically cancelled. But as it happens, we have spare seats, so
do not worry!"

Diagnosis: Minor communications problem, aggravated by Dan-Air's natural
assumption that someone who hadn't bothered to turn up to fly *out* to Toulouse
wouldn't be turning up *in* Toulouse to fly *back*.

But wait...

In-depth diagnosis (Courtesy of Ralph Adam, offering consultancy at the usual
City University rate in the Saddlers' Bar, Thursday 11th May, late):

Dan-Air use the Texas Air Services airline booking system "System 1". (This is
one of the 'big four', all based in the US, and is owned by US Airlines.)
Built into this database is a requirement that a return flight be reconfirmed
after departure on the outward leg of the journey. The reason is to prevent
passengers in the US buying a return ticket (cheaper than a single in some
cases) and using the return half only. My problem on return had nothing to do
with Dan-Air. It was a side-effect of an attempt to close a loophole in the
ticket price structure of various US airlines.

The database is physically situated in the US. On-line access for seat booking
is, well, on-line. Any other information retrieval requires 3 to 4 weeks of 
bureaucratic delay. If the flight had been full, if I had been stuck in
Toulouse for a couple of days, and if I had raised hell (Oh, no! Not another
hot oysters in champagne and steak tartare at the Brasserie des Beaux Arts!
'Allo, 'allo! C'est moi encore! Il n'y avait plus de places sur l'avion.
Ah, ton mari! Quelle bonne surprise! :-), it might have taken a month to answer
my query about why the return flight had been cancelled (assuming the travel
agent and airline didn't already know!).

I am assured by Ralph that this sort of thing is old hat to veteran readers
of RISKS, but if anyone is interested in the economics of airline booking
systems, the following should be a good read:

The following is extracted from a front page article in today's DAILY MIRROR.
The 2 inch high headline reads:

			F R E E P H O N E
			T H E   W O R L D


"BRITISH TELECOM is being conned out of millions by fiddlers making free
international calls ... using a BT gadget.

Shocked Telecom chiefs secretly tried to withdraw the GBP 9.95 "magic box"
which is supposed to be used with phone answering machines -- a month ago.

But the DAILY MIRROR can disclose they are still on sale in BT stores."

...

"And there is a thriving black market for them on street corners and in pubs
where they are changing hands for up to GBP 1000.  The 3in x 2in device, known
as a remote interrogator, is designed to enable people to phone home and pick
up messages from their answering machines.  But cheats have discovered that by
using it in some phone boxes and pressing two vital numbers, they can call
anywhere in Britain or the world without charge."

				---

There's a full colour photograph of the "device" on the front-page. It 
appears to be a simple 12-key DTMF tone dialler. I seriously doubt that they
are changing hands for GBP 1000, but if they are, I have this bridge that
their purchasers might also be interested in ....

The risk management (or utter lack of it) in this case is so obvious that I'll 
refrain from adding any further comment.

I recently had an unpleasant taste of the disadvantages of the caller
identification that may be more widespread soon.  

A few weeks ago I called the university police's business line from my
office phone and asked a few minutes of questions about how to find
out about outstanding warrants (I had heard of someone getting
arrested while renewing his driver's liscence).  I informed the
officer that I spoke with that this was entirely moot. After receiving
my replies, I thought that was the end of it. 

Thus you can imagine my surprise and annoyance to find that two
uniformed, armed officers and their sargeant came to my workplace
(having located that using the campus centrex's caller-id ability on
phones with appropriate displays), spoke with my coworkers, knocked on
my office door, and via suprise and intimidation verified my ID. This
permitted them to run a warrant check on me.  I was clean, which was
no surprise to me.  They skulked away shortly thereafter. 

Conversations with the chief of police indicated that the rather
zealous instigating officer's behavior was within "acceptable" bounds,
and if you raise "enough" suspicion (on a slow day?), this constitutes
justification for nosing about your workplace.  

The RISK is that the officer wouldn't have been able to easily trace
the number except for the abilities of the private exchange.

Summary of report on All Things Considered (NPR), Friday, May 11, 1990:

Private LInes, Inc. of Beverly Hills provides a telephone service for those
wanting to avoid automatic number indentification.  You simply call a 900
number which then lets you call out through Private Lines WATS numbers.  ANI at
the receiving end of course then displays only the Beverly Hills number of
Private Lines.  NPR interviewed president of Private LInes who defended need
for such a service.  He of course said that the service was not intended to
help obscene callers and their rates would make obscene calling through Private
LInes a very expensive habit ($2/minute, I think).  (NPR noted that ANI had
already resulted in several arrests of obscene callers in the Atlantic Southern
area where ANI is heavily promoted for that purpose.)  He cited the following
legitimate reasons for avoiding ANI and any billing record of the numbers
called.  (1) Boss is quietly working on a merger deal and doesn't want
secretaries and accountants in the firm noticing a sudden increase in calls to
a particular other firm. (2) Separated spouse wants to call kids but doesn't
want spouse to know from where he or she is calling.  (3) Caller to crisis
line or crime tip line wants to guarantee annonymity.

    [The above problem was clearly a BITNET problem.  Later news indicates the
    surprise discovery of a lurking CHRON problem that forced another pass
    over a random sublist when a time-out occurred.  The resulting cleanup --

                    Second IFIP Working Conference on
              DEPENDABLE COMPUTING FOR CRITICAL APPLICATIONS
                        Can we rely on computers?

                 Hotel Park Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA
                          February 18-20, 1991
Organized by
    IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance

This is the second Working Conference on this topic, following a successful
initial conference held in August, 1989, on the campus of the University of
California at Santa Barbara (USA). As evidenced by papers that were presented
and discussed at that meeting, critical applications of computing systems are
concerned with differing service properties, relating to both the nature of
proper service and the system's ability to deliver it. These include thresholds
of performance and real-time responsiveness that demark loss of proper service
(failure), continuity of proper service, ability to avoid catastrophic
failures, and prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions. The notion of
dependability, defined as the trustworthiness of computer service such that
reliance can justifiably be placed on this service, enables these various
concerns to be subsumed within a single conceptual framework.  Dependability
thus includes as special cases such attributes as reliability, availability,
safety, and security. In keeping with the goals of the previous conference, the
aim of this meeting is to encourage further integration of theory, techniques,
and tools for specifying, designing, implementing, assessing, validating,
operating, and maintaining computer systems that are dependable in the broad
sense.  Of particular, but not exclusive, interest are presentations that
address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g., safety and security,
through studies of either a theoretical or an applied nature.

Submitting a Paper: Five copies (in English) of original work should be
submitted by August 13, 1990, to the Program Chair:

The following dialog occurred in hearings before the U.S. Congress' House
Appropriations Committee in March, 1989:

Mr. (Martin Olav) Sabo (Rep. from Minnesota): I am curious about robotics 
and what you see as its future.  I forget particular programs as we go along, 
but I was involved in discussions last year with the other body on a program.
They seemed very negative on robotics research, which struck me as something we
should be aggressively pursuing.

Mr. (George T.) Singley (Director of Army Research and Technology):  We have a
problem about restrictions placed on us, but not on the Marine Corps, relative
to Army robotic vehicles, so our robotics program does not include weapons on
unmanned ground vehicles. ...

Mr. (John P.) Murtha (Rep. from Pennsylvania): Restrictions by whom? 

Mr. Singley: By Congress.

Mr. Murtha: We put restrictions ---

(Lt.) General (Donald S.) Pihl (Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army 
for R&amp;D):  To put a weapon on a robot vehicle.  We were told to restrict our
robotic vehicle work to reconnaissance and surveillance.

Mr. Sabo: Generated by the other body?  

General Pihl: Yes, sir.

Mr. Murtha: Staff tells me that in the conference last year, that the Senate
wanted to go forward with robotics research and make sure you got the bugs
worked out before you started working out systems with weapons; does that make
sense?

General Pihl: Yes, sir.  It is a logical approach as long as you don't have a
restriction on weaponizing the unmanned ground vehicle forever.

Mr. Murtha: What would you recommend we do this year?

General Pihl: Sir, I think you should allow the Army to proceed with a
roboticized look at a ground-launched Hellfire system in conjunction with the
Marine Corps.  I think that would be a good thing to do.

Mr. Murtha: Let's move on ... [ to other topics...]

Regarding Stephen Page's contribution of 16 Apr 90...

This incident was used as an example at a colloquium on Systems Engineering
which I attended yesterday, where it was referred to as the handbag problem.
It seems that the system designers had succeeded in optimising the controls on
the train to two buttons: one to close the doors and another to start the
train.  An interlock prevented the train starting until the doors were indeed
closed.

The driver of the train in question decided to optimise the system design
further (to one button) by taping the second of these buttons permanently
down so that (s)he only had to press the button to close the doors.  The
train would then go once they had closed as the second button was always
depressed.  This worked satisfactorily until a handbag became trapped in
the doors and, as reported, the driver (following his training) went to
the doors and prised them apart, freeing the handbag, allowing the doors
to close and completing the set of events required for the train to
depart (without the driver).

The driver had failed to realise and/or take into account that the second
button (for making the train go) was implementing the requirement that the
driver should be in the cab before the train could go.

In retrospect, perhaps the action of depressing the second button (rather than
the state of depression) should have been required to start the train; but such
statements are easy to make with hindsight.

A brief report in Aviation Week (May 14, 1990, page 42) says that the first
test pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope are being delayed until ground
controllers can conduct optical system focusing exercises.

Hubble engineers have been trying to determine why the telescope's guidance
sensors were not properly locking onto "guide stars."  They have since
determined that there was an error in the pointing data provided to the
telescope by the Space Telescope Science Institute.

	The error occurred because someone several years ago inserted
	a plus sign instead of a minus sign in a computer program
	being prepared to aid in early telescope checkout.

	The star data being used came from a 1954 star survey.
	Engineers realized the Earth's precession in relation to
	the 30-year-old star data would have to be accounted for
	in the Hubble checkout data.

	The precession equated to an 18 arc minute reduction in the
	coordinates of the star field, but a programmer accidentally
	added 18 arc minutes instead.

	That resulted in the telescope being a full 0.5 degrees off
	target in the initial pattern recognition tests.

Engineers are also working to solve a .1 Hz jitter problem the telescope has
for 20 to 30 minutes whenever it passes from the dark side of its orbit into
sunlight.  They believe the problem is related to thermal effects from the
telescope's solar arrays, but they doubt the problem will seriously affect
the telescope's mission.

The following article appeared in clari.tw.telecom, and I thought it was
appropriate for RISKS.  Reprinted with permission, for use within the RISKS
digest only.  (For more information on the ClariNet news service, write to
info@clarinet.com.)  While I have no sympathy for drug dealers, I don't feel
that this is a negative aspect of ANI.  I myself would like to know if a call
comes from the Police, Government or other enforcement agency, even if I have
done nothing wrong.

&gt;Subject: Drug dealers find uses for Caller ID equipment
&gt;Keywords: illegal drugs, legal, telecom, media

	BALTIMORE (UPI) -- Like telephone pagers and mobile cellular phones
before it, the latest in telephone technology, the Caller ID machine, is
proving a valuable tool for drug traffickers.
	Drug enforcement officials in Baltimore say that the Caller ID
machines are starting to turn up in drug raids, which may be proof that
once again, dealers find benefits in the communications revolution.
	Caller ID, which has been on the market for several months, has
been advertised as a means of crime prevention -- giving people receiving
harrassing calls a chance to see the phone number the call is being made
from even before they pick up the receiver.
	But such a service apparently also means that drug dealers, eager
to protect their business from undercover police operations, can screen
the phone calls they receive and refuse to answer a suspicious call.
	``It's frightening,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Katharine
Armentrout, who has seen Caller ID equipment confiscated in drug raids.
	Even though an undercover police operation would have a different
phone number than a police station, dealers could worry about calls from
an unfamiliar exchange.
	``The question then becomes, `Where are you calling from?''' a
federal surveillance expert told the Baltimore Sun, in an article
printed in Sunday's editions. ``Or more to the point, `Why aren't you
calling me from your usual pay phone?'''
	The problem has been much the same with other recent progress made
in the telecommunications industry. Pagers were developed for doctors,
lawyers and other professionals, but dealers have found them useful. And
mobile cellular telephones have created a myriad of surveillance
problems for police tracking drug dealers.
	Phone company officials in the Baltimore and Washington areas say
they are looking for ways to solve the problems law enforcement agencies
have with the Caller ID equipment.
	``We're committed to finding solutions,'' said Al Burman, a
spokesman for C&amp;P Telephone Co. ``There are a number of things that can
be done that aren't being done.''
	One solution may be to block certain numbers from being picked up
by the machines. Burman said there are enough numbers in the Baltimore
area not linked to the Caller ID system currently to avoid arousing any
suspicions.
	Police officials pointed out, however, that as more telephone
numbers become linked with the system, blocked numbers will become more
suspicious to traffickers.

There has been some discussion in the media and the net lately about the
Department of Defense sponsoring research into computer viruses.  Here is the
solicitation in question.  It is part of the government's Small Business
Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The SBIR program is designed to help small
companies develop advanced technologies.  Up to $50,000 can be awarded in Phase
I and up to $500,000 can be awarded in Phase II.


Title:  Computer Virus Electronic Counter Measure (ECM)

Objective:  The objective shall be to determine the potential for using 
"computer viruses" as an ECM technique against generic military communications
systems/nets and analyzing its effects on various subsystem components.

Description:  The purpose of this research shall be to investigate potential
use of computer viruses to achieve traditional communications ECM effects in 
targeted communications systems.  These effects can include data (information)
disruption, denial, and deception, but other effects should also be researched
such as effects on executable code in processors, memory, storage management,
etc.  Research in effective methods or strategies to remotely introduce such
viruses shall also be conducted.  Efforts in this area should be focused on
RF atmospheric signal transmission such as performed in tactical military
data communications.

Phase I:  Phase I shall analyze the feasibility of using viruses as an ECM
technique.  Analysis shall include validity studies of the concept, types
of viruses suitable to be employed in this concept, strategies for virus
injection, and/or simulated predictions of effects.  Phase I shall culminate
with the submission of a final report that details the above analysis and
outlines a method that can validate the concept.

Phase II:  Based on analysis performed under Phase I, develop a demonstration
method that can validate the virus ECM concept and demonstrate various ECM
techniques or strategies.  Phase II shall culminate with this demonstration
and a final report describing demonstration methodology, results, and
analysis of effects compared with predicted effects from the Phase I effort.
The final report shall also summarize or make conclusions as to the future
potential of using virus ECM techniques or strategies.

   ...[the Secret Service agent] also said there was no evidence that
   the suspects were working together.  Rather, they probably were
   sharing information someone had put into a national computer
   "bulletin board".  [...]

Does our law enforcement community really think that "working together"
requires physical presence?  Don't they recognize that sharing information via
a cracker bulletin board is collaboration?  Isn't this the whole point of a
computer security case?

Boy, do I hate sensationalism in journalism.

Does anyone besides me find it difficult to believe these 42 computers ran
up over a million dollars apiece in unpaid phone time?  You *could* do it in
a month or two if you had connect time 24 hours a day (very) long distance,
or a couple hours a day for two years. So, its possible, but I don't believe
it for all 42 systems.

It's also pretty colorful to refer to a "nationwide network" of people for
which "there was no evidence that [they] were working together".

Date:    Thu, 10 May 90 13:43:15 -0500
From:    "Mr. J. Vavrina" &lt;SDSV@MELPAR-EMH1.ARMY.MIL&gt;
Subject: RE: Military Viruses (THE FACTS)
     
After reading, in astonishment, Nick DiGionanni's input regarding Military
Viruses, (VIRUS-L 3-90 8 May 90) the phone lines were burning up from my office
to the DOD Information Systems Security Management Office checking on the
validity of the story. No one had even heard of such a project being
undertaken. A few more phone calls later generated a FAX to my desk of an
article from the Phildelphia Inquirer titled, "Army Searches for new weapon:
Computer Virus", written by Rory J. O'Connor.  The article quoted an individual
as being the adminstrator of the project. Now the hunt started to locate her.
Within a few hours I had her on the phone.  Needless to say, the reporter
identified himself as a small businessman and was interested in this program.
The information given to him was completely turn around so that he could make a
big story out of nothing.
     
HERE ARE THE FACTS:  The Department of Defense published a booklet titled,
"PROGRAM SOLICITATION 90.2  FY-1990 SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH
(SBIR) PROGRAM".  On page 45 can be found the following:
A90-217  TITLE: Computer Virus Electronic Counter Measure (ECM)
CATEGORY:  Exploratory Development
OBJECTIVE: The objective shall be to determine the potential for using
"computer viruses" as an ECM technique against generic military
communications systems/nets.  The goal shall be to determine the
feasibility of remotely introducing a virus into a system/net and
analyzing its effects on various subsystem components.
DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this research shall be to investigate
potential use of computer viruses to achieve traditional
communications ECM effects in targeted communications systems.  These
effects can include data (information) disruption, denial, and
deception, but other effects should also be researched such as
executable code in processors, memory storage mamagement, etc.
Research in effective methods or strategies to remotely introduce such
viruses shall also be conducted.  Efforts in this area should be
focused on RF atmospheric signal transmission shch as performed in
tactical military data communications.
     
It continues on to explain what needs to be accomplished in each phase.
     
As you can see, this is nothing more than a feasability study to
answer the famous "WHAT IF WE COULD ?????" question.  Admittedly,
myself and many of my collegues are quite suprised that something of
this nature would be put on the streets for research and not using the
expertise internally available.

&gt;The Director-General of the Ministry of the Interior announced yesterday
&gt;that within 3 months all Israeli citizens will be issued magnetic id
&gt;cards.  He stated that with the new cards it will take only 10 minutes
&gt;to issue a new passport and that all future elections will no longer have

Though the current method of balloting is very cumbersome and wasteful,

In the New England Journal of Medicine dated May 3, 1990, there is a letter to
the editor titled: 'Laser-Printer Rhinitis' on page 1323. In this letter, the 
authors report on a  single recent patient case.

     "A 51-year-old man was seen for nasal and systemic symptoms that developed 
repeatedly after he handled documents from a laser printer. He had worked for 
the same insurance company for 21, years spending an average of three to four 
hours per day on computer and clerical work. In April of 1987 a new computer 
system with a laser printer was installed at his work station. During the next 
six weeks he had increasing intermittent nasal congestion, with a burning 
sensation on his skin, headache, and diffuse retrosternal and epigastric 
discomfort. He had no history of asthma, allergies, hay fever or eczema, 
although his mother did." ...

     "Two substance-specific challenges were performed, each preceded and 
followed by " [a computerized test] "On one occasion he shuffled laser-printed 
paper for 10 minutes, when nasal and other symptoms developed. The " [test] 
"demonstrated an increase of more than fourfold in nasal airflow resistance."
[The second test demonstrated a three-fold increase in nasal airflow resistance 
when sitting next to an operating laser printer.]

At 2:42am on Thursday, 17 May, a Number 1A ESS switch (vintage 1973) in
Stamford, Connecticut, broke down and for 18 hours blocked all residential and
most business local calls (affecting 27,000 subscribers in exchanges 324, 326,
348, 351, 356, 358, 896, 964, 965, 969, 977, 979).  (The same switch had broken
down on 19-20 December 1985 for five hours, affecting 34,000 subscribers.  Two
such outages on the same switch is a very rare occurrence indeed.)

The outage occurred while technicians were doing routine maintenance to update
the database of phones served by that switch (12 of Stamford's 17 exchanges).
The switch computer rejected the update and shut itself down.  The backup
system also failed.  The eventual return to service followed extensive remote
diagnostics from the AT&amp;T Technology Center in Indian Hill, Illinois.  However,
the cause still remains unknown as of this afternoon (Monday).

May 1990, plus phone conversations.]

In a masterpiece of overendowing mathematical precision, the UPI reported that
East Lake High School in north Pinellas County, Florida, had computed the
grade-point averages of three graduating seniors as 4.2857142.  The headline
"Scholastic Tie -- to the Seventh Decimal" suggests that no one along the way
recognized 4 and two sevenths in disguise.    Straight A records at that.

This morning CNN had a story on the federal government in the US and how they
plan to `crackdown' on 1-900 toll phone services. One such service,
1-900-STOPPER was said to allow callers to make unidentified phone calls. Of
course, the callers to 1-900 could be identified by the government by date and
time, but it would require a court order or consent of the 1-900 company.

   [... whose entire reason for existence is providing the service of
   anonymity/nonidentifiability!  PGN]

               Announcing the formation of P.T.U.U.I.
   (the Programmers and Technical Underdogs Union International)

This organization was formed in response to the alarming proliferation of flaky
employers.

Have you ever poured your heart and soul into an exciting project only to have
the company go under the day its ready for market?

Have any of your previous employers pulled a `Midnight Move'?

Have you worked diligently until the end of the month only to find the payroll
isn't covered?

Have you ever given your `Life's Work' to an employer only to have it stolen
and marketed behind your back?

We invite you to share your experiences and to co-operate in identifying and
disseminating the names of `non-professional' employers.

If one of our members has a bad experience, we would like to make it difficult
if not impossible to find a competent replacement.

We would like to act as an `Ombudsman' to mediate desputes.

This group is open to all competent `Hardware' and `Software' independent
contractors.

P.T.U.U.I. reminds me of Tom Lehrer's ``Subway Song'', written while he was
riding the Boston subway in the late 1940s or very early 1950s, but
unfortunately never recorded.  Particularly for those who know and love the
`T', I recite it from memory (it is sung to the tune of ``Mother''), with
apologies to Tom if I didn't remember it correctly, and apologies in advance to
those purists who think it is irrelevant to RISKS.  (Indeed, it is much too
relevant to the foregoing contribution NOT to be included.)  Cheers!  PGN

     H is for my alma mater, Harvard,
     C is Central, next upon the line,
     K is for the cosy Kendall Station,
     C is Charles, across the foamy brine,

     P is Park Street, Boston's busy center,
     W is Washington, you see,

     Put them all together, they spell HCKC PW,      [sung with great emphasis]
     And that's just what Boston means to me.

I'm the reporter at the San Jose Mercury News who wrote the story on the Army's
SBIR proposal regarding computer viruses. I feel I must respond to the charge
made by Mr. Jim Vavrina of the Army Information Systems Software Center that I
mis-identified myself while researching the story. That assertion is false.

At all times, as is standard practice among professional journalists, I made it
clear to everyone I called or interviewed that I was a newspaper reporter
working on a story about this proposal. When I reached a woman named Joyce
Crisci at Ft. Monmouth, NJ, who identified herself as the project
administrator, I identified myself as a reporter. When she attempted to tell me
how to apply for the available funds, I felt she might have failed to
understand that, so I again told her I was a reporter working on a story for my
newspaper. She then answered most of my questions, but made it clear she would
not discuss any technical details nor provide me with the names of the
engineers who had written the project. The reason, she said, was that if such
information appeared in my story, it could prejudice the bidding process.

Indeed, at the conclusion of our interview, she verified the spelling of her
name and gave me her (rather complicated) mailing address and requested I send
her a copy of the article when it appeared in the newspaper.

I'm sorry Mr. Vavrina never called me to ask my side of the story about this
interview. If Mr. Vavrina thinks my story about the virus was in some way
factually incorrect, or did not fully describe the Army's project or reasoning,
I'd be happy to talk to him about it. I can be reached at (408) 920-5019, or at
MCI Mail mailbox 361-2192, or at the San Jose Mercury News, 750 Ridder Park
Drive, San Jose, CA 95190. Anyone else who would  like to discuss this story,
or the topic of computer viruses in general, may also contact me there.

Not very surprising, considering that laser printers pump out gobs of ozone.

The old DEC LN03 laser printer had an ozone filter on it that was supposed to
be replaced at regular intervals.  The ozone filter consisted of a granulated
carbon filter.  But this is the only laser printer that I have ever seen with
such a filter.

                             July 28, 1990

Computer technology significantly affects most segments of society, including
education, business, medicine, and the military.  Current and emerging computer
technology will exert strong influences on our lives, in areas ranging from
work to civil liberties.  The DIAC symposium considers these influences in a
broad social context - ethical, economic, political - as well as a technical
context seeking to address directly the relationship between technology and
policy.

KEYNOTE ADDRESS: Dr. Michael Rabin, Computer Security and Privacy
                             
  Computer security is essential not just for the protection of valuable assets
  but also for safeguarding privacy. To this end technical tools are needed for
  correctly specifying who will access what personal data and for enforcing and
  monitoring the specified regime.  These new technical tools as well as a new
  legal framework for defining the status of personal data will be presented.

  Michael Rabin is a Turing Award winner who is T.J. Watson Sr. Professor of
  Computer Science at Harvard.  He teaches and conducts research in the fields
  of computer algorithms and computer security.

Congress Expected to Pursue Stricter Computer Virus Laws

By ROBERT SMITHMIDFORD

In  the  wake  of  Robert  Morris  Jr.'s  conviction  for unleashing the
Internet worm in 1988, both the House and Senate are expected to take up
bills that would  make computer viruses  and other intentional  sabotage
specifically illegal.

  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) recently introduced the latest virus  bill,
S2476.  The bill would make it a federal felony to gain access to compu-
ters intentionally  and to  introduce distructive  programs that cause a
$1,000 loss  over the course  of a year.   Sabotage that effects medical
records would  also be illegal.   The bill  also would  allow people who
suffer  losses from a virus  or other  malicious  program to  file civil
suits to get compensation.

  According to Ron Palenski,  general counsel  for the trade association
Adapso,  Leahy's bill is stronger than pending  legislation in the House
because it expands what might  be considered a virus.   "The strength of
the Leahy  proposal  is that it takes  an interstate  commerce approach.
Since  virtually  anything is in  interstate commerce,  it covers almost
anything,"  Palenski said.   Current law covers  only computers owned by
the government or a  financial institution or cases in which viruses are
spread across  state lines,  he said.   Leahy's bill  also adds  viruses
embedded in software to its definition  of gaining access  to computers.
"The current statute is really written in terms of networks.  It assumes
that the vandalism  will occur  in networks,  but it can also  occure in
distributed software," Palenski said.

  However,  the bill might  be open  to modification.   In proposing the
bill, Leahy said,  "I want to ensure that in creating a private cause of
action to boost  deterrence we do  not open the  floodgates to frivolous
litigation.  I also look forward to tesimony from prosecutors and compu-
ter experts on the scope of the access definition, to be sure that it is
technically sound and a useful tool from prosecuting computer crimes."

  The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association applaud-
ed the legislation for focusing on criminal behavior by individuals, not
by restricting technology.

  "It's completely proper that we  make it clear that what we thought of
as a prank  isn't a game  anymore,"  said Jude Franklin,  a senior  vice
president for  technology at  Planning  Research Corp.   But finding the
source of viruses can be difficult.  "There are going to be problems en-
forcing it because third parties aren't aware they're carrying them," he
said.

  Hearings are expected in June.

  The Morris  sentencing also  is likely  to dislodge  two similar bills
awaiting action on  the House side.   HR 55 and 287,  sponsored by  Rep.
Wally Herger (R-Calif.) and Rep Tom McMillen (D-Md.) respectively,  were
on hold in the House Judiciary Committee pending comments from Justice.

Subj:   Secure UNIX Infected? 

If you read between the lines you will note that a development version of AT&amp;T
UNIX was infected.  The message is that the "NCSC" is more concerned about
"confidentiality" then, say, integrity.  The sooner we get a counter balance to
the NCSC critical mass within POSIX P1003.6 (security) the better our future.

it's been done.  at the Winter '89 Usenex conference in san diego, Tom Duff
presented a paper entitled "Viral Attacks on UNIX System Security".  he built a
virus somewhat weaker than the one described above; it would only insert itself
in the extra space at the end of an executable, if there was sufficient space
between the end of the executable and the next 512 byte block boundary.  if
would only infect files in the current directory.

he loosed the thing inside AT&amp;T as an experiment to see how well such a weak
virus would spread, and how it could be started.  (he started the infection by
adding an infected copy of "echo" to some public directories he had write
access too).

the most interesting aspect of this was that it got picked up in an automated
distribution of a new version of "wc" to 45 local machines, at which time the
infection really took off.  it caused some particular problems on a "secure"
unix that was being developed, since the kernel detected the attempts of the
virus to propagate, and killed the virus.  unfortunately, it had by then gotten
imbedded in cc, as, and all the other important utilites as a result of "big
make" performed with the security checks turned off.

it's an interesting paper; one worth reading, since it talks about means of
prevention, and generally good security practice on Unix machines.

THE FOLLOWING TWO ARTICLES ARE FROM THE JUST-RELEASED SPRING EDITION OF
2600 MAGAZINE, THE HACKER QUARTERLY. WE FEEL THAT THE CURRENT HAPPENINGS
IN THE COMPUTER WORLD ARE EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS ANY
INTEREST IN COMMUNICATIONS AND/OR TECHNOLOGY. WE'D BE MOST INTERESTED IN
ANY FEEDBACK ON THIS TOPIC.   [See the end of this message.]

                      ************************
                      ARTICLE ONE: AN OVERVIEW
                      ************************

A year ago, we told the stories of Kevin Mitnick and Herbert Zinn, two hackers
who had been sent to prison. It was then, and still is today, a very disturbing
chain of events: mischief makers and explorers imprisoned for playing with the
wrong toys and for asking too many questions. We said at the time that it was
important for all hackers to stand up to such gross injustices. After all, they
couldn't lock us all up.

It now appears that such an endeavor may indeed be on the agendas of some very
powerful U.S. governmental agencies. And even more frightening is the
realization that these agencies don't particularly care who or what gets swept
up along with the hackers, as long as all of the hackers get swept up.
Apparently, we're considered even more of a threat than we had previously
supposed.

In retrospect, this doesn't come as a great deal of a surprise. In fact, it now
seems to make all too much sense. You no longer have to be paranoid or of a
particular political mindset to point to the many parallels that we've all been
witnesses to. Censorship, clampdowns, "voluntary" urine tests, lie detectors,
handwriting analysis, surveillance cameras, exaggerated crises that invariably
lead to curtailed freedoms.... All of this together with the overall view that
if you're innocent, you've got nothing to hide. And all made so much more
effective through the magic of high tech. Who would you target as the biggest
potential roadblock if not the people who understand the technology at work? It
appears the biggest threats to the system are those capable of manipulating it.

What we're about to tell you is frightening, plain and simple. You don't have
to be a hacker to understand this. The words and ideas are easily translatable
to any time and any culture.

Crackdown

"We can now expect a crackdown...I just hope that I can pull through this one
and that my friends can also. This is the time to watch yourself. No matter
what you are into.... Apparently the government has seen the last straw in
their point of view.... I think they are going after all the 'teachers'...and
so that is where their energies will be put: to stop all hackers, and stop
people before they can become threats."

This was one of the reactions on a computer bulletin board to a series of raids
on hackers, raids that had started in 1989 and spread rapidly into early 1990.
Atlanta, St. Louis, and New York were major targets in what was then an
undetermined investigation.

This in itself wouldn't have been especially alarming, since raids on hackers
can almost be defined as commonplace. But this one was different. For the very
first time, a hacker newsletter had also been shut down.

Phrack was an electronic newsletter published out of St. Louis and distributed
worldwide. It dealt with hacker and phone phreak matters and could be found on
nearly all hacker bulletin boards. While dealing with sensitive material, the
editors were very careful not to publish anything illegal (credit card
numbers, passwords, Sprint codes, etc.). We described "Phrack World News" (a
regular column of Phrack) in our Summer 1989 edition as "a must-read for many
hackers". In many ways Phrack resembled 2600, with the exception of being sent
via electronic mail instead of U.S. Mail. That distinction would prove to be
Phrack's undoing.

It now turns out that all incoming and outgoing electronic mail used by Phrack
was being monitored by the authorities. Every piece of mail going in and every
piece of mail coming out. These were not pirated mailboxes that were being
used by a couple of hackers. These had been obtained legally through the
school the two Phrack editors were attending. Privacy on such mailboxes,
though not guaranteed, could always be assumed. Never again.

It's fairly obvious that none of this would have happened, none of this could
have happened had Phrack been a non-electronic magazine. A printed magazine
would not be intimidated into giving up its mailing list as Phrack was. Had a
printed magazine been shut down in this fashion after having all of their mail
opened and read, even the most thick-headed sensationalist media types would
have caught on: hey, isn't that a violation of the First Amendment?

Those media people who understood what was happening and saw the implications
were very quickly drowned out in the hysteria that followed. Indictments were
being handed out. Publisher/editor Craig Neidorf, known in the hacker world as
Knight Lightning, was hit with a seven count indictment accusing him of
participating in a scheme to steal information about the enhanced 911 system
run by Bell South. Quickly, headlines screamed that hackers had broken into
the 911 system and were interfering with emergency telephone calls to the
police. One newspaper report said there were no indications that anyone had
died or been injured as a result of the intrusions. What a relief. Too bad it
wasn't true.

In actuality there have been very grievous injuries suffered as a result of
these intrusions. The intrusions we're referring to are those of the
government and the media. The injuries have been suffered by the defendants
who will have great difficulty resuming normal lives even if all of this is
forgotten tomorrow.

And if it's not forgotten, Craig Neidorf could go to jail for more than 30
years and be fined $122,000. And for what? Let's look at the indictment:

"It was... part of the scheme that defendant Neidorf, utilizing a computer at
the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri would and did receive a copy
of the stolen E911 text file from defendant [Robert J.] Riggs [located in
Atlanta and known in the hacker world as Prophet] through the Lockport
[Illinois] computer bulletin board system through the use of an interstate
computer data network.

"It was further part of the scheme that defendant Neidorf would and did edit
and retype the E911 Practice text file at the request of the defendant Riggs
in order to conceal the source of the E911 Practice text file and to prepare
it for publication in a computer hacker newsletter.

"It was further part of the scheme that defendant Neidorf would and did
transfer the stolen E911 Practice text file through the use of an interstate
computer bulletin board system used by defendant Riggs in Lockport, Illinois.

"It was further part of the scheme that the defendants Riggs and Neidorf would
publish information to other computer hackers which could be used to gain
unauthorized access to emergency 911 computer systems in the United States and
thereby disrupt or halt 911 service in portions of the United States."

Basically, Neidorf is being charged with receiving a stolen document. There is
nothing anywhere in the indictment that even suggests he entered any computer
illegally. So his crimes are receiving, editing, and transmitting.

Now what is contained in this document? Information about how to gain
unauthorized access to, disrupt, or halt 911 service? Hardly. The document
(erroneously referred to as "911 software" by the media which caused all kinds
of misunderstandings) is quoted in Phrack Volume 2, Number 24 and makes for
one of the dullest articles ever to appear in the newsletter. According to the
indictment, the value of this 20k document is $79,449. [See story that follows this one]

Shortly after the indictments were handed down, a member of the Legion of Doom
known as Erik Bloodaxe issued a public statement. "[A group of three hackers]
ended up pulling files off [a Southern Bell system] for them to look at. This
is usually standard procedure: you get on a system, look around for
interesting text, buffer it, and maybe print it out for posterity. No member
of LOD has ever (to my knowledge) broken into another system and used any
information gained from it for personal gain of any kind...with the exception
of maybe a big boost in his reputation around the underground. [A hacker] took
the documentation to the system and wrote a file about it. There are actually
two files, one is an overview, the other is a glossary. The information is
hardly something anyone could possibly gain anything from except knowledge
about how a certain aspect of the telephone company works."

He went on to say that Neidorf would have had no way of knowing whether or not
the file contained proprietary information.

Prosecutors refused to say how hackers could benefit from the information, nor
would they cite a motive or reveal any actual damage. In addition, it's widely
speculated that much of this information is readily available as reference
material.

In all of the indictments, the Legion of Doom is defined as "a closely knit
group of computer hackers involved in: a) disrupting telecommunications by
entering computerized telephone switches and changing the routing on the
circuits of the computerized switches; b) stealing proprietary computer source
code and information from companies and individuals that owned the code and
information; c) stealing and modifying credit information on individuals
maintained in credit bureau computers; d) fraudulently obtaining money and
property from companies by altering the computerized information used by the
companies; e) disseminating information with respect to their methods of
attacking computers to other computer hackers in an effort to avoid the focus
of law enforcement agencies and telecommunication security experts."

Ironically, since the Legion of Doom isn't a closely knit group, it's unlikely
that anyone will be able to defend the group's name against these charges --
any defendants will naturally be preoccupied with their own defenses.
(Incidentally, Neidorf was not a part of the Legion of Doom, nor was Phrack
a publication of LOD, as has been reported.)

The Hunt Intensifies

After learning of the Phrack electronic mail surveillance, one of the system
operators of The Phoenix Project, a computer bulletin board in Austin, Texas,
decided to take action to protect the privacy of his users. "I will be adding
a secure encryption routine into the e-mail in the next 2 weeks - I haven't
decided exactly how to implement it, but it'll let two people exchange mail
encrypted by a password only known to the two of them.... Anyway, I do not
think I am due to be busted...I don't do anything but run a board. Still,
there is that possibility. I assume that my lines are all tapped until proven
otherwise. There is some question to the wisdom of leaving the board up at
all, but I have personally phoned several government investigators and invited
them to join us here on the board. If I begin to feel that the board is
putting me in any kind of danger, I'll pull it down with no notice - I hope
everyone understands. It looks like it's sweeps-time again for the feds. Let's
hope all of us are still around in 6 months to talk about it."

The new security was never implemented. The Phoenix Project was seized within
days.

And the clampdown intensified still further. On March 1, the offices of Steve
Jackson Games, a publishing company in Austin, were raided by the Secret
Service. According to the Associated Press, the home of the managing editor
was also searched. The police and Secret Service seized books, manuals,
computers, technical equipment, and other documents. Agents also seized the
final draft of a science fiction game written by the company. According to the
Austin American-Statesman, the authorities were trying to determine whether
the game was being used as a handbook for computer crime.

Callers to the Illuminati bulletin board (run by Steve Jackson Games), received
the following message:

"Before the start of work on March 1, Steve Jackson Games was visited by agents
of the United States Secret Service. They searched the building thoroughly,
tore open several boxes in the warehouse, broke a few locks, and damaged a
couple of filing cabinets (which we would gladly have let them examine, had
they let us into the building), answered the phone discourteously at best, and
confiscated some computer equipment, including the computer that the BBS was
running on at the time.

"So far we have not received a clear explanation of what the Secret Service was
looking for, what they expected to find, or much of anything else. We are
fairly certain that Steve Jackson Games is not the target of whatever
investigation is being conducted; in any case, we have done nothing illegal
and have nothing whatsoever to hide. However, the equipment that was seized is
apparently considered to be evidence in whatever they're investigating, so we
aren't likely to get it back any time soon. It could be a month, it could be
never.

"To minimize the possibility that this system will be confiscated as well, we
have set it up to display this bulletin, and that's all. There is no message
base at present. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we wish we dared do
more than this."

Apparently, one of the system operators of The Phoenix Project was also
affiliated with Steve Jackson Games. And that was all the authorities needed.

Raids continued throughout the country with reports of more than a dozen
bulletin boards being shut down. In Atlanta, the papers reported that three
local LOD hackers faced 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine.

Another statement from a Legion of Doom member (The Mentor, also a system
operator of The Phoenix Project) attempted to explain the situation:

"LOD was formed to bring together the best minds from the computer underground
- not to do any damage or for personal profit, but to share experiences and
discuss computing. The group has always maintained the highest ethical
standards.... On many occasions, we have acted to prevent abuse of systems....
I have known the people involved in this 911 case for many years, and there
was absolutely no intent to interfere with or molest the 911 system in any
manner. While we have occasionally entered a computer that we weren't supposed
to be in, it is grounds for expulsion from the group and social ostracism to
do any damage to a system or to attempt to commit fraud for personal profit.

"The biggest crime that has been committed is that of curiosity.... We have
been instrumental in closing many security holes in the past, and had hoped to
continue to do so in the future. The list of computer security people who
count us as allies is long, but must remain anonymous. If any of them choose
to identify themselves, we would appreciate the support."

And The Plot Thickens

Meanwhile, in Lockport, Illinois, a strange tale was unfolding. The public UNIX
system known as Jolnet that had been used to transmit the 911 files had also
been seized. What's particularly odd here is that, according to the electronic
newsletter Telecom Digest, the system operator, Rich Andrews, had been
cooperating with federal authorities for over a year. Andrews found the files
on his system nearly two years ago, forwarded them to AT&amp;T, and was
subsequently contacted by the authorities. He cooperated fully. Why, then, was
his system seized as well? Andrews claimed it was all part of the
investigation, but added, "One way to get [hackers] is by shutting down the
sites they use to distribute stuff."

The Jolnet raid caused outrage in the bulletin board world, particularly among
administrators and users of public UNIX systems.

Cliff Figallo, system administrator for The Well, a public UNIX system in
California, voiced his concern. "The assumption that federal agents can seize
a system owner's equipment as evidence in spite of the owner's lack of proven
involvement in the alleged illegal activities (and regardless of the
possibility that the system is part of the owner's livelihood) is scary to me
and should be to anyone responsible for running a system such as this."

Here is a sampling of some of the comments seen around the country after the
Jolnet seizure:

"As administrator for Zygot, should I start reading my users' mail to make
sure they aren't saying anything naughty? Should I snoop through all the files
to make sure everyone is being good? This whole affair is rather chilling."

"From what I have noted with respect to Jolnet, there was a serious crime
committed there -- by the [federal authorities]. If they busted a system with
email on it, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act comes into play.
Everyone who had email dated less than 180 days old on the system is entitled
to sue each of the people involved in the seizure for at least $1,000 plus
legal fees and court costs. Unless, of course, the [authorities] did it by the
book, and got warrants to interfere with the email of all who had accounts on
the systems. If they did, there are strict limits on how long they have to
inform the users."

"Intimidation, threats, disruption of work and school, 'hit lists', and
serious legal charges are all part of the tactics being used in this
'witch-hunt'. That ought to indicate that perhaps the use of pseudonyms wasn't
such a bad idea after all."

"There are civil rights and civil liberties issues here that have yet to be
addressed. And they probably won't even be raised so long as everyone acts on
the assumption that all hackers are criminals and vandals and need to be
squashed, at whatever cost...."

"I am disturbed, on principle, at the conduct of at least some of the federal
investigations now going on. I know several people who've taken their systems
out of public access just because they can't risk the seizure of their
equipment (as evidence or for any other reason). If you're a Usenet site, you
may receive megabytes of new data every day, but you have no common carrier
protection in the event that someone puts illegal information onto the Net and
thence into your system."

Increased Restrictions

But despite the outpourings of concern for what had happened, many system
administrators and bulletin board operators felt compelled to tighten the
control of their systems and to make free speech a little more difficult, for
their own protection.

Bill Kuykendall, system administrator for The Point, a public UNIX system in
Chicago, made the following announcement to the users of his system:

"Today, there is no law or precedent which affords me... the same legal rights
that other common carriers have against prosecution should some other party
(you) use my property (The Point) for illegal activities. That worries me....

"I fully intend to explore the legal questions raised here. In my opinion, the
rights to free assembly and free speech would be threatened if the owners of
public meeting places were charged with the responsibility of policing all
conversations held in the hallways and lavatories of their facilities for
references to illegal activities.

"Under such laws, all privately owned meeting places would be forced out of
existence, and the right to meet and speak freely would vanish with them. The
common sense of this reasoning has not yet been applied to electronic meeting
places by the legislature. This issue must be forced, or electronic bulletin
boards will cease to exist.

"In the meantime, I intend to continue to operate The Point with as little risk
to myself as possible. Therefore, I am implementing a few new policies:

"No user will be allowed to post any message, public or private, until his name
and address has been adequately verified. Most users in the metropolitan
Chicago area have already been validated through the telephone number
directory service provided by Illinois Bell. Those of you who received
validation notices stating that your information had not been checked due to a
lack of time on my part will now have to wait until I get time before being
allowed to post.

"Out of state addresses cannot be validated in the manner above.... The short
term solution for users outside the Chicago area is to find a system closer to
home than The Point.

"Some of the planned enhancements to The Point are simply not going to happen
until the legal issues are resolved. There will be no shell access and no file
upload/download facility for now.

"My apologies to all who feel inconvenienced by these policies, but under the
circumstances, I think your complaints would be most effective if made to your
state and federal legislators. Please do so!"

These restrictions were echoed on other large systems, while a number of
smaller hacker bulletin boards disappeared altogether. We've been told by some
in the hacker world that this is only a phase, that the hacker boards will be
back and that users will once again be able to speak without having their words
and identities "registered". But there's also a nagging suspicion, the feeling
that something is very different now. A publication has been shut down.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of names have been seized from mailing lists and
will, no doubt, be investigated. The facts in the 911 story have been twisted
and misrepresented beyond recognition, thanks to ignorance and sensationalism.
People and organizations that have had contact with any of the suspects are
open to investigation themselves. And, around the country, computer operators
and users are becoming more paranoid and less willing to allow free speech. In
the face of all of this, the belief that democracy will triumph in the end
seems hopelessly naive. Yet, it's something we dare not stop believing in. Mere
faith in the system, however, is not enough.

We hope that someday we'll be able to laugh at the absurdities of today. But,
for now, let's concentrate on the facts and make sure they stay in the
forefront.

==&gt; Were there break-ins involving the E911 system? If so, the entire story
must be revealed. How did the hackers get in? What did they have access to?
What could they have done? What did they actually do? Any security holes that
were revealed should already have been closed. If there are more, why do they
still exist? Could the original holes have been closed earlier and, if so, why
weren't they? Any hacker who caused damage to the system should be held
accountable. Period. Almost every hacker around seems to agree with this. So
what is the problem? The glaring fact that there doesn't appear to have been
any actual damage. Just the usual assortment of gaping security holes that
never seem to get fixed. Shoddiness in design is something that shouldn't be
overlooked in a system as important as E911. Yet that aspect of the case is
being side-stepped. Putting the blame on the hackers for finding the flaws is
another way of saying the flaws should remain undetected.

==&gt; Under no circumstance should the Phrack newsletter or any of its editors be
held as criminals for printing material leaked to them. Every publication of
any value has had documents given to them that were not originally intended
for public consumption. That's how news stories are made. Shutting down Phrack
sends a very ominous message to publishers and editors across the nation.

==&gt; Finally, the privacy of computer users must be respected by the government.
It's ironic that hackers are portrayed as the ones who break into systems,
read private mail, and screw up innocent people. Yet it's the federal
authorities who seem to have carte blanche in that department. Just what did
the Secret Service do on these computer systems? What did they gain access to?
Whose mail did they read? And what allowed them to do this?

Take Exception

It's very easy to throw up your hands and say it's all too much. But the facts
indicate to us that we've come face to face with a very critical moment in
history. What comes out of this could be a trend-setting precedent, not only
for computer users, but for the free press and every citizen of the United
States. Complacency at this stage will be most detrimental.

We also realize that one of the quickest ways of losing credibility is to be
shrill and conspiracy-minded. We hope we're not coming across in this way
because we truly believe there is a significant threat here. If Phrack is
successfully shut down and its editors sent to prison for writing an article,
2600 could easily be next. And so could scores of other publications whose
existence ruffles some feathers. We cannot allow this to happen.

In the past, we've called for people to spread the word on various issues. More
times than not, the results have been felt. Never has it been more important
than now. To be silent at this stage is to accept a very grim and dark future.

             ARTICLE TWO: A REVIEW OF THE E911 DOCUMENT ITSELF
             *************************************************

Documentation on the E911 System
March 1988
$79,449, 6 pages
Bell South Standard Practice 
660-225-104SV
Review by Emmanuel Goldstein

It otherwise would have been a quickly forgotten text published in a hacker
newsletter. But due to all of the commotion, the Bell South E911 document is
now very much in the public eye. Copies are extremely easy to come by, despite
Bell South's assertion that the whole thing is worth $79,449.

While we can't publish the actual document, we can report on its contents since
it's become a news story in itself. But don't get excited. There really isn't
all that much here.

Certain acronyms are introduced, among them Public Safety Answering Point
(PSAP), also known as Emergency Service Bureau (ESB). This is what you get (in
telco lingo) when you dial 911. The importance of close coordination between
these agencies is stressed. Selective routing allows the 911 call to be routed
to the proper PSAP. The 1A ESS is used as the tandem office for this routing.
Certain services made available with E911 include Forced Disconnect,
Alternative Routing, Selective Routing, Selective Transfer, Default Routing,
Night Service, Automatic Number Identification, and Automatic Location
Identification.

We learn of the existence of the E911 Implementation Team, the brave men and
women from Network Marketing who help with configuration in the difficult
cutover period. This team is in charge of forming an ongoing maintenance
subcommittee. We wouldn't want that juicy tidbit to get out, now would we?

We learn that the Switching Control Center (SCC) "is responsible for E911/1AESS
translations in tandem central offices". We're not exactly shocked by this
revelation.

We also find out what is considered a "priority one" trouble report. Any link
down to the PSAP fits this definition. We also learn that when ANI fails, the
screens will display all zeroes.

We could go on but we really don't want to bore you. None of this information
would allow a hacker to gain access to such a system. All it affords is a
chance to understand the administrative functions a little better. We'd like to
assume that any outside interference to a 911 system is impossible. Does Bell
South know otherwise? In light of their touchiness on the matter, we have to
wonder.

We'd be most interested in hearing from people with more technical knowledge on
the subject. What does this whole escapade tell us? Please write or call so the
facts can be brought forward.

Crypto '90 is the tenth in a series of workshops on cryptography, and is
sponsored by the international Association for Cryptologic Research, in
cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and
Privacy, and the Computer Science Department of the University of California,
Santa Barbara.  The program for the workshop wil cover all aspects of
cryptology.  Extended abstracts of the papers presented at the conference will
be distributed to all attendees at the conference, and formal proceedings will
be published at a later date.

....more info from the brochure skipped...

Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance at the workshop
is limited, and pre-registration is required (*there will be no registration at
the door!*).  Campus accomodations will be available for participants who
register by July 6, 1990.  Cost for regular attendance is $160, for Eurocrypt
attendees $120, for students $100.  Room and board runs $260 for a single room
or $215/ea to split a double, or you can use a hotel and restaurants if you
bring a car.

To get full info and registration form, talk to
Sherry McMahan, Crypto '90, CYLINK, 130B Kifer Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 USA.

I went to this conference last year and had a very good time.  I learned a lot,
met a number of interesting people, and did some fun beachcombing.  The story
on no-at-the-door-registration last year was that they have to commit to
exactly what facilities they'll use too early, since it's held in a campus
rather than a hotel.  Before I got there I figured it was so the spooks could
check up on everybody :-(.

ACE News is the official newsletter of The American Coaster Enthusiasts.  The
following article appeared in ACE News, Volume XII, Issue 6, May 1990:

Worlds of Fun _Timber_Wolf_ Incident Blamed on Computer

The 1990 season began inauspiciously for Worlds of Fun (Kansas City, MO) when
two trains on the one-year-old _Timber_Wolf_ (world class woodie) collided on
opening day.

No one was seriously hurt in the March 31 crash, but nine of the 28 passengers
sent to the hospital were admitted, one with a broken leg.  The ride was closed
immediately after the incident.

The accident occurred when the computerized control system allowed one train to
rear-end another on the first set of station brakes.

Beginning April 2, the $3-million wooden coaster was subjected to an exhaustive
investigation by Worlds of Fun, the Dinn Corporation (which built the coaster),
the engineering firm Burns &amp; McDonnell, and TechnoMation, an electronic systems
integration design company.

Before _Timber_Wolf_ reopened to the public on April 27, the trains, structure,
track and braking and computer systems were all thoroughly inspected.  The ride
also went through an extensive series of test runs with park executives aboard.

_Timber_Wolf_ is currently running with only one train.  Two-train operation
will begin as soon as a new, co-processing computerized control system is
installed.  With four times as many sensors as the original system (many of
them redundant) and two computer controls instead of one, Worlds of Fun
officials are confident that a similar accident will not occur.

_The Philadelphia Inquirer_, in a story from Monday, 21 May 1990 by Maureen 
Graham and Mike Schurman headlined SHORE ATM TAPPED FOR $100,000 reported 
that an automatic teller machine located in Trump Castle Casino Resort in 
Atlantic City, NJ (and owned by National Westminster Bank) was missing 
about $100,000 which was apparently taken the previous week.  The FBI was 
reportedly on the case, and was considering embezzlement, inaccurate or 
inadequate record keeping or theft by someone outside the bank.  

There was no forced entry into the macine.  The article indirectly quoted
the bank's CEO L. Douglas O'Brien, reporting that "Bank officials said they
believed that the thief had access to the bank's security system."  The
funds were discovered during a weekly audit of the machines.  Two ATMs at
other casino hotels had amounts of $10,000 and $20,000 stolen.

Some of the nitty gritty details:

"According to O'Brien, the money is delivered by bank employees, as needed, 
to the Trump Castle lobby MAC [Money Access Center] machine and placed in a 
vault inside the machine.

"The money from the vault is then transferred to canisters inside the 
machine by two employees -- from the bank or from a Philadelphia security 
firm that services the bank on weekends and during non-banking hours.

"O'Brien said the $100,000 was determined to be missing from the vault 
section of the MAC machine.

"To provide security, a dual-access system is used to service a MAC machine 
-- each employee has access to only half the security information required 
to enter the system.

"However, officials said they suspected one person bypassed the security 
system.

"'It was a legal access.  It was not forced open.  The system was 
compromised,' O'Brien said."

CoreState Financial Corp. operates the computer system for the machines.

****** End of article synopsis *****

In what may be a related development, I heard on the news this weekend of
ATMs in New York city that had money stolen, again with no signs of
tampering. There is no hard evidence that a computer RISK is involved in
any of these thefts; other security breeches are as likely.  The Inquirer
article doesn't make clear what the "security system" consists of --
computer system or not?  The tone of the article makes it sound as if the
reporters suspected a computer RISK, but I can't always trust reporters' 
suspicions.

I thought this personal story might be of interest to RISKS readers:

In mid 1988 I had an interesting experience with my bank account - I had had
$87,889,984 (or some such random value in the $87 million range!) added to my
account!! On asking the bank concerned if they could fix the problem they
blamed me for "Keying in the amount at an ATM!" Of course I protested my
innocence - where would I get that sort of money from?! :-) Now I would have
thought that surely:

        a) The ATM software would check for such obvious erroneous
           data if I had in fact entered such an amount as a
           deposit. (ever heard of range checking?!)
        b) With such large sums of money would the computer not
           alert an operator to check to see that it was valid
           (considering that I do not hold a corporate account).

The problem was fixed after several weeks (!) and although rather amusing {and
if only I got the interest on that money :-( } to do an account balance and see
a nice amount for a change :-) but it still leaves me wondering just what
happened and why they should blame *me* for such an obvious computer error!
Maybe it was because I am a student! I wonder if this kind of error has
occurred to anyone else.

In response to your volume 9, Issue 94 observations regarding the security
of "secure" documents, I offer some comments:

1) The best defense is naivety.  Diamond brokers (at least used to) 
   ship quantities of product via 1st class mail because it was 
   reliable (in the States) and anonymous.

   Perhaps our most secure documents should be published in the Consumer
   Information Catalog (available free from Pueblo, CO).  Or perhaps they
   are; suitably encrypted to look like regular documents.  

2) The congressional register, if it is difficult to analyse, possibly
   represents a chaotic system and models noise very well.  Political
   statements excluded.

On other topics...

Another interesting thing.  We had our building "fire alert" system go
off the other day, fortunately a minor problem, and as we were watching
the fire department do their thing (very well) a cohort asked about the
policy regarding shutting down the machines in an emergency.  I said that
(in so many words) I thought the idea was to preserve human (not machine)
lives.  My workmate responded that his previous job was with a company 
whose policy was that machines must be safely shut down before humans 
could respond to such an emergency and insure personal safety.

Whether winding thread, sewing shirts or making steel, the organization has
life greater than human's; still.

After entertaining many explanations for misrouted telephone calls, RISKS
should consider another possibility.  Last week, the Houston Post reported that
Ginger was in the dog house with the Arlington, Texas, police department.  The
Post continued:

     That's because the Lhasa apso twice managed to place
     911 emergency calls from an Arlington home.  At least,
     police can think of no other explanation for the calls.
     Police said they found the dog beside a telephone when
     they entered the place after receiving the second call.
     No one else was home.

     Ginger's owner, Jane Shumaker, said she hadn't
     programmed 911 into her telephone's automatic dialing
     system, and she finds it hard to believe her pet made
     the call.  But she added, "I'm beginning to think she's
     smarter than I thought.  Maybe she was lonesome."

Dare I mention it? It seems our phone system is going to the dogs.

&gt; Computer Gaming World (Golden Empire Publications)
&gt; June, 1990, Number 72, Page 8
&gt; Editorial by Johnny L. Wilson

                        It CAN Happen Here

  Although Nobel Prize-winning novelist Sinclair Lewis is probably best known
for 'Main Street', 'Babbitt', 'Elmer Gantry', and 'Arrowsmith', my personal
favorites are 'It Can't Happen Here' and 'Kingsblood Royal'.  The latter is an
ironic narrative in which who suffers from racial prejudice toward the black
population discovers, through genealogical research, that he himself has black
ancestors.  The protagonist experienced a life-challenging discovery that
enabled Lewis to preach a gospel of civil rights to his readership.

  The former is, perhaps, Lewis' most lengthy novel and it tells how a radio
evangelist was able to use the issues of morality and national security to form
a national mandate and create a fascist dictatorship in the United States.  As
Lewis showed how patriotic symbolism could be distorted by power-hungry elite
and religious fervor channeled into a political movement, I was personally
shaken.  As a highschool student, reading this novel, for the first time, I
suddenly realized what lewis intended for his readers to realize.  "It" (a
dictatorship) really CAN happen here,  There is an infinitesimally fine line
between protecting the interests of society and encumbering the freedoms of the
self-same society in the name of protection.

  Now it appears that the civil liberties of game designers and gamers
themselves are to be assaulted in the name of protecting society.  In recent
months two unrelated events have taken place which must make us pause: the
raiding of Steve Jackson Games' offices by the United States Secret Service,
and the introduction of A.B. 3280 into the California State Assembly by
Assemblyperson Tanner.

  On March 1, 1990, Steve Jackson Games (a small pen and paper game company)
was raided by agents of the United States Secret Service.  The raid was
allegedly part of an investigation into data piracy and was, apparently,
related  to the latest supplement from SJG entitled, GURPS Cyberpunk (GURPS
stands for Generic Universal Role-Playing System).  GURPS Cyberpunk features
rules for a game universe analogous to the dark futures of George Alec Effinger
('When Gravity Fails'), William Gibson ('Neuromancer'), Norman Spinrad ('Little
Heroes'), Bruce Sterling ('Islands in the Net'), and Walter Jon Williams
('Hardwired').

  GURPS Cyberpunk features character related to breaking into networks and
phreaking (abusing the telephone system).Hence, certain federal agents are
reported to have made several disparaging remarks about the game rules being a
"handbook for computer crime".  In the course of the raid (reported to have
been conducted under the authority of an unsigned photocopy of a warrant; at
least, such was the only warrant showed to the employees at SJG) significant
destruction allegedly occurred.  A footlocker, as well as exterior storage
units and cartons, were deliberately forced open even though an employee with
appropriate keys was present and available to lend assistance.  In addition,
the materials confiscated included: two computers, an HP Laserjet II printer, a
variety of computer cards and parts, and an assortment of commercial software. 
In all, SJG estimates that approximately $10,000 worth of computer hardware and
software was confiscated.

  The amorphous nature of the raid is what is most frightening to me.  Does
this raid indicate that those who operate bulletin board systems as individuals
are at risk for similar raids if someone posts "hacking" information on their
computer?  Or does it indicate that games which involve "hacking" are subject
to searches and seizures by the federal government?  Does it indicate that
writing about "hacking" exposes one to the risk of a raid?  It seems that this
raid goes over the line of protecting society and has, instead, violated the
freedom of its citizenry.  Further facts may indicate that this is not the
case, but the first impression strongly indicates an abuse of freedom.

  Then there is the case of California's A.B 3280 which would forbid the
depiction of any alcohol or tobacco package or container in any video game
intended primarily for use by minors.  The bill makes no distinction between
positive or negative depiction of alcohol or tobacco, does not specify what
"primarily designed for" means, and defines 'video game' in such a way that
coin-ops, dedicated game machines, and computer games can all fit within the
category.

  Now the law is, admittedly, intended to help curb the use and abuse of
alcohol and tobacco among minors.  Yet the broad stroke of the brush with which
it is written limits the dramatic license which can be used to make even
desirable points in computer games.  For example, Chris Crawford's 'Balance of
the Planet' depicts a liquor bottle on a trash heap as part of a screen talking
about the garbage problem.  Does this encourage alcohol abuse?  In 'Wasteland',
one of the encounters involves two winos in an alley.  Does their use of
homemade white lightening commend it to any minors that might be playing the
game?

  One of the problems with legislating art is that art is designed to both
reflect and cast new light and new perspectives on life.  As such, depiction of
any aspect of life may be appropriate, in context.  Unfortunately for those who
want to use the law as a means of enforcing morality, laws cannot be written to
cover every context.

  We urge our California readers to oppose A.B. 3280 and help defend our basic
freedoms.  We urge all of our readers to be on the alert for any governmental
intervention that threatens our freedom of expression.  "It" not only CAN
happen here, but "it" is very likely to if we are not careful.

	 If you read between the lines you will note that a development
	 version of AT&amp;T UNIX was infected.  The message is that the
	 "NCSC" is more concerned about "confidentiality" then, say,
	 integrity.  The sooner we get a counter balance to the NCSC
	 critical mass within POSIX P1003.6 (security) the better our
	 future.

	 [description of Duff's virus deleted]

	 he loosed the thing inside AT&amp;T as an experiment to see how
	 well such a weak virus would spread, and how it could be
	 started.  (he started the infection by adding an infected copy
	 of "echo" to some public directories he had write access
	 too).

	 [more deletions]

	 it caused some particular problems on a "secure" unix that was
	 being developed, since the kernel detected the attempts of the
	 virus to propagate, and killed the virus.

I think there's a serious misconception here about Duff's virus, where it
spread, and ``AT&amp;T UNIX''.  There are no lines to read between; what was said
is literally and completely true, with no hidden messages.  Tom's virus was
developed on 9th Edition UNIX systems, a research version that bears little
relation to System V or anything else in the product line.  No ``development
version'' of the UNIX system was affected.  This is doubly true of AT&amp;T's
secure UNIX system product (System V/MLS), which has been certified at the B1
level.  The ``secure unix'' affected was an experimental implementation of
mandatory access controls, using a modified 9th Edition kernel.  And, as noted,
even the affected system was still under development at the time -- hardly a
fair criticism of any finished system.

All that aside, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the NCSC's efforts as focused
on confidentiality rather than integrity.  While there certainly is that bias,
there's a lot to be said for maintaining confidentiality even in the commercial
world (as numerous stories in RISKS attest, of course).  And, at least for some
programs, the mandatory access controls can be used to maintain integrity: mark
any critical program as being in the lowest-possible security level, lower than
any user process.  That way, any attempt to modify the program appears to be an
access-control violation.

And there's one more point that shouldn't be ignored.  The Orange Book does not
simply list a set of features.  It describes a development process, an attitude
towards software management, and (to some extent) an enforced modularity.  All
of these contribute to reliable -- and hence secure -- software.  Furthermore,
the certification process itself is quite stringent.  There's a world of
difference between, say, ``B1- certifiable'' -- which generally means a feature
list -- and ``B1 certified.''

If there are specific features you'd like to see added to POSIX for better
integrity maintenance, by all means propose them.  But as far as I can tell,
the NCSC -- and its sponsor, DoD -- are among the few groups that not only take
security seriously, but are prepared to put their money where their mouth is.

&gt;If you read between the lines you will note that a development version of AT&amp;T
&gt;UNIX was infected.  The message is that the "NCSC" is more concerned about
&gt;"confidentiality" then, say, integrity.  The sooner we get a counter balance to
&gt;the NCSC critical mass within POSIX P1003.6 (security) the better our future.

If you read the Usenix paper referred to, you will find out that (a) the secure
Unix in question is a research system, not a product or potential product, and
(b) as mentioned in the Risks posting, the virus infected it at a time when
much of the security had not yet been turned on.  I would urge people to read
the paper before jumping to unwarranted conclusions.

When Tim first wrote about his problems I thought that they were
related to the fact that zipcodes don't provide a functional dependency
for city and state.  That is, more than one city (well wide spot in the
road) can be in one zip code.  This problem has bitten my father who
now has subscriptions with a 4 line address of the form:
	Doc Kuder
	3 Elm St.
	Brownsville
	Emmittburg, PA 18888
Because there is an Elm Street in both Brownsville and Emmittburg and
they've got nothing to do with each other, but the Post Office insists
that 18888 is Emmittburg.

I also thought that Tim's problem might be that the zip code he's using is only
for the dorms at Caltech.  The rest of campus has its own zip code, and the box
number Tim uses doesn't match dorm practice.  It shouldn't matter since both
zip codes go to the same campus Post Office.  When I first moved off campus, I
used the campus zip code and had my delivered even slower than normal since it
was sent to campus first then bounced.  That house has since become part of
campus -- I wonder what it's zip code is now?

Tim's problem is actually "Box".  A quick scan of the zip code directory shows
that only post office boxes in Pasadena can be found in zip code 91102.  I
suggest that Tim use something like "Building" or "Mailstop".  The campus Post
Office may be able to give him the definitive answer.

I apologize to Stan Shebs and to RISKS readers for not having sufficiently
exerted my responsibility as moderator regarding the Shebs/D'Ippolito
exchange.  Sorry.  Occasionally one slips by.  Rich D'Ippolito's message was
less than circumspect.  I probably should have let them try to agree on a
counterposition and a rebuttal before troubling you all.  However, there are
some important issues raised.

A response from Stan Shebs follows, along with four other commentaries.

I didn't expect such a violent reaction to my comments on cruise missile
software that appeared in <A HREF="/Risks/8.86.html">RISKS-8.86</A>, but several of my remarks really ought
to be clarified.  First off, I worked on ALCM 1981-82, fresh out of Texas
A&amp;M, with no programming experience outside of research projects, and my
only education in software engineering having been to read "The Mythical
Man-Month".  Boeing did not require any training in their software
methodology (they probably offered some, but I don't remember), we just
learned on-the-job.  (Friends who are still there tell me that things have
improved in the past several years.)  My original article was written as
personal impressions, for a non-expert audience, and unfortunately Jon's
quoting couldn't make it into more of a learned treatise.

&gt;  From: rsd@SEI.CMU.EDU
  
&gt;  In RISKS 8.86, Jon Jacky quotes Stan Shebs:
  
&gt;&gt;    We supposedly had a "model" software engineering methodology; what I
&gt;&gt;    remember most clearly is that half the work was done on one flavor of IBM
&gt;&gt;    OS, and the other half done on a different flavor, and file transfer
&gt;&gt;    between the two was tricky and time-consuming.
  
&gt;  The coupled clauses are unrelated, a compositional practice Mr. Shebs is
&gt;  apparently quite fond of.

In this case, it was a subtle (clearly too subtle) literary device; there was
almost no relation between the official methodology and daily practice.  The
process of conforming to the DoD's requirements resulted in a fanatical
adherence to the letter of the standards, with almost no concern for actual
quality.  I had written some tricky code and proved its correctness; it got
thrown away because it was "too general".  We had an independent auditor that
checked over the documentation and found missing commas, while completely
ignoring the parts of the program design that parroted Fortran code without
saying anything about its structure.  I could go on, but this is supposed to be
a clarification, not an independent message.

&gt;  [...]
&gt;  Of course the program design should have been documented beforehand, but
&gt;  recognizing that it is necessary to have for testing and maintenance
&gt;  purposes is not stupid.  I have seen many systems where the software is very
&gt;  old (or inhereted) and must be re-documented to current standards.  What was
&gt;  the case here?
  
The software was about a year old I believe; probably the same standards
were in effect then, but I can't say for sure.  It was written under
considerable time pressure and almost entirely free of comments.  The
experience of trying to puzzle out the workings of 30k lines of mixed
Fortran, Cobol, and assembler was truly horrible.  Management knew it was
all a sham, but they just asked us to go along with it.  (Funny, 30k lines
doesn't seem like a lot anymore - times change...)
  
&gt;&gt;    (Regarding) statistics on software quality, the closest thing we had was
&gt;&gt;    maybe a count of problem reports (hundreds, but each report ranged from
&gt;&gt;    one-liners to one-monthers in terms of effort required).
  
&gt;  Sigh.  There is no mention here whether this applies to _delivered_ product
&gt;  or corrected production errors.  Is this his view of what constitutes
&gt;  quality?
  
I believe the numbering of software problem reports started after delivery
of the first version, but I don't know for sure. The whole setup seemed pretty
disorganized; for instance, there was no formal system for module-level
testing, before or after delivery, and regression testing was limited to
rerunning a set of standard flight paths, which weren't complicated enough
even to test all the paths in the program code, let alone boundary cases.

&gt;  This article was posted to illuminate "the accuracy/quality of strategic
&gt;  weapons guidance systems", presumably by offering a coherent and reasoned
&gt;  exposition.  Instead, it presents jokes, innuendo, and unsubstantiated
&gt;  charges and conclusions in indefinite (and sloppy, such as the 1/2 inch
&gt;  diameter missile) language such as:

It never occurred to me that anybody could possibly misinterpret
"6 meters long and 1/2 in diameter", but it must be possible.  For the
record, it's 1/2 *meter* (actually more like 2/3, but who cares).

&gt;&gt;    The difficulty of all this apparently didn't occur to anybody until after
&gt;&gt;    the missile was working...

This was what I heard from the people who were there at the time.  They may
not have been entirely accurate, but the objective evidence and the history
of the ALCM program support this.  Old documents seem to assume that laying
out a mission by hand in the traditional way is good enough.  In actuality,
the missile is so sluggish that it has to begin climbing long before it
reaches a hill, or it will end up plowing into the side (this actually
happened during testing).

&gt;&gt;    ...error accumulation over 2000 km is immense,... 

We had graphs of just how bad inertial navigation gets over long distances.
The actual numbers are probably classified, but in general an inertially
guided missile would be useful only against cities; silos and other hardened
sites require much more accurate navigation techniques.

I found the comments of Rich D'Ippolito in RISKS 9.1 ("A 'model' software
engineering methodology") to be unconvincing and ill mannered.  Mr. D'Ippolito
is offended by a some anecdotes posted in RISKS 8.86 which reflect poorly on
the design and implementation of a cruise missile ( John Jacky, quoting Stan
Shebs).  The points which Mr. D'Ippolito references are:
	1) The development was carried out on 2 incompatible 
	development platforms --- file transfer between the 2
	systems was ``tricky and time consuming".
	2)  The "Program Design" was written after the program 
	was written.
	3) There failure conditions of the program seemed to have
	been poorly planned for, e.g, error accummulation over a long
	flight path, and the effects of snowfall on topography.
	4) Program quality was measured by raw count of problem reports
	without reference to the complexity of the reported problems.	

These are all significant problems, which cannot be dismissed by the ad
hominem arguments presented by Mr. D'Ippolito. Mr. Shebs is not the first
person to point out instances of sloppy software engineering in D.O.D.
projects, but I found his story interesting and informative. Mr. D'Ippolito
argues in the mode of a press secretary, rather than as a scientist.
Comments such as:	

&gt;Really, if Mr. Shebs's rambling demonstrates anything, it shows that the
&gt;greatest risk is hiring inarticulate and confused programmers like himself
&gt;who don't have the faintest idea what software engineering is.

are out of place and offensive.

In the 6 July Risks Mr. D'Ippolito somewhat justifiably takes Mr. Shebs to task
about his criticisms of the Cruise Missile project Mr. Shebs was a part of.

However, one comment relating to producing the design specification after
coding was completed brought back my memories of being one of the senior staff
during the mid-80s for the Navy's version of this missile, called Tomahawk.

In the view of the project's mangement, the required documentation was an
unnecessary burden placed on us hardworking developers by government
bureaucrats.  An example was the spec. which provided an English description fo
the guidance software line-by-line.  It was essentially useless.  The guidance
software had been developed in the usual atmosphere of intense deadline
pressure, with the highest priority given to making the thing work.  As a
result, the code was not a textbook example of modularity and
understandability.  In fact, the documentation probably was irrelevant, since
the engineers and computer scientists used simulations of the guidance system
and software models of the guidance equations to develop the system.

My point is that these projects are examples of the fact that industry is just
beginning to recognize the size of the investment they are making in software,
and the technologies needed.  Most defense contractors (there is a
Carnegie-Mellon survey on this) are only now coming out of the Stone Age of
focusing on coding in marathon sessions to produce software while producing
reams of documentation.

However, it is by no means clear that applying what we think of as
state-of-the-art that we will do much better.

In RISKS Digest 9.1 a certain gentlemen responds and quotes liberally from
another gentleman's experiences in software engineering for missile
guidance systems.  The jist of the article seemed to be that the original
poster was incompetent and that his remarks were irrelevant, derogatory, and
totally without merit.  Ahem, Isn't this just possibly another example of
shooting the messenger because of the message???

I once worked for a defense contractor who manufactured submarines for the U.S.
Navy (There are only two in this country, take your pick.)  Quite often there
was a tremendous difference between The Way It Is and The Way It Is Supposed To
Be. Sometimes design and manufacturing errors were found.  Sometimes they were
buried.  But usually, the reputation (of the company and the Navy) was more
important that the viability of the product.

The RISKS involved are probably as old as engineering itself; that is, creating
an absurd or impossible situation, and then deriding the first person who
brings attention to the problem.  Where would the Emperor be today if someone
had not pointed out the 'design flaw' in his new clothes?

If we cannot learn from our mistakes, we just rename them; "Success". (1/2 :-)

Sean Mathews brings back shades of when I was working on flight projects.
Dicey stuff.  All examples he documents (starting with no dynamic memory [I was
amused by starting with this]) are all standard operating procedure (so
believed in the defense and aerospace arenas).  These ideas date back decades
(not just years).  Since NASA was mentioned (and projects differ), I should
mention that the policy of explicitly reading machine code is from the days of
smaller memories.  The Agency is trying to get away from this.  The code is
still generated (I know where this example comes from) by HAL/S computers for
the shuttle (HAL, BTW does not have dynamic memory, or any of the features [no
multiprocessor support, etc.]).

Sean's posting does raise quite a few other questions:

	Is there explicit range checking?
	Are there comments on performance?
	Are there specifications on clocks and interrupt handling?
	Etc.

For the classic summary to Sean's misgivings of the merchants of killing and
mayhem.  It was Andy Mickel at U. Minn. who in the early days of Ada published:
"Reliable software must kill people reliably." [Pascal News].
                                                                 --eugene miya

Here are some comments on Sean Matthews's posting:

&gt;1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
&gt;recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).

As a practical matter, this requirement rules out all real software systems.
Also, I do not see why this makes software safer.  I think this will result in
less safe software, since there will be arbitrary limits on the length of
everything.  All last names must be 30 chars or less, all place names must be
40 chars or less, etc.  Long buffer sizes will lessen the impact, but take up
more space.

&gt;2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.
&gt;3. There should not be any distributed processing 
&gt;4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

As a practical matter, these requirements rule out most (all?) real systems.
Also, I do not see why software which does none of these things is safer than
software which does all of them.  These requirements seems to be designed to
compensate for the (huge) limitations of current program verification
techniques.

&gt;10. No optimising compilers will be used.

What is an optimising compiler?  This is a serious question.  GCC with no
arguments provides better code than PCC or Sun's CC, does that make it an
optimized compiler?  What if you give it a -O1 option, or a -O3 option (which
turns on more optimization).  All compilers do some optimization. Point 10
should say something like "All compilers used must be verified to the same
level of certainty as the programs they are compiling."  It is kind of useless
to verify a program and then run it through a compiler which is not verified.
Of course writing a compiler which does not use dynamic memory (see point 1)
would be an interesting exercise!

Overall, I found these standards funny, not useful.  My conclusion is that no
safety critical software can not be written in the UK since points 1 and 2 will
mean that none of it will be up to standard.

Sean Matthews writes of the UK safety-critical software standard:

&gt; 2-4 seem to leave no option but polling.  This is impractical,
&gt; especially in embedded systems.  No one is going to build a fly by
&gt; wire system with those sorts of restrictions.

Polling is absolutely the safest and most-used method for programming embedded
systems for saftey-critical applications.  It is a commonly held fallacy that
the essence of a real-time embedded system is FAST response to external stimuli
-- that interrupts are therefore important.  The essence of real-time embedded
systems is a GUARANTEE of a specified, finite response time to EACH stimulus.

Many embedded systems divide real time into a hierarchy of time slots, and
execute fixed subroutines in each time slot (i.e. "polling").  This makes it
relatively easy to verify that the program can meet all response time
requirements.  Stimuli requiring slower responses are handled by routines that
run less often, and routines running more often handle stimuli requiring faster
response.  Every routine can be proven to run in less time than the length of
one time slot.

Additional advantages:  The trivial scheduling algorithm makes the interaction
between the routines vastly easier to write and verify than is the case in a
system that can switch tasks at random times.  Response time bottlenecks can be
identified and addressed early in the development cycle.  It is easy to match
the requirements of the sources/sinks of stimuli/responses and the capabilities
of the embedded computer.  And on and on ...

In short, when a life depends on your system ...

While the previous posting in RISKS didn't mention this, the "destroyed
files" regarding the Exxon oil spill were apparently actually simply
the routine recycling of a month-old (or older) backup dump tape.

Exxon has continued to state that they believe all files are still online or in
paper form.  Obviously the correct procedure would have been to explicitly
order the preservation of those dumps, and nobody wants to condone Exxon's
handling of this whole affair, but it is worth noting that the deletion in
question was apparently the result of routine computer center operations common
to many environments, not some "explicit" act of destruction.

Today's (09 July 89) Washington Post has several articles about the latest
trend in foods:  Frequent Shoppers Programs.  For those of you not aware of
this, it is similar to Frequent Flyer Programs used by the airlines.  When you
buy an item at your local mega-chain supermarket, your purchase is noted in a
large customer database and you are given a credit on your account, and when
your account reaches certain defined levels, you receive coupons for various
foodstuffs.  Simple right?  Wrong.

First, the markets are proposing to record more than a purchase of so many
dollars and cents.  They intend to record the specific brands and items you
bought.  Based on this information and your address information, markets want
to start targetting mailings of flyers and coupons to you.  If their records
show you have started to buy baby food recently, the AI routines that examine
the data base will note this, and flag your record to be sent coupons on other
baby products, such as diapers and lotions.

This is in fact not a terrible thing.  If markets want to spend money send
paper in the mail to people who may or may not use them, there are far more
useless ways to spend money.  The problem is the second application.

It seems that the markets want to sell this information to the manufacturers
(the Campbell Soups, the Nabiscos, the General Foods, and so on) for use by
their own marketing people.  This also raises the traditional right to privacy
issues.

I wonder how much longer it will be till I will not be able to go into my local
Giant Food and buy a bag of flour, because their demographic survey shows that
no one eats in my apartment building.

Welcome to VOLUME 10.  RISKS will be beginning its SIXTH year on 1 August 90,
although it will soon go into a first-month-of-the-summer sporadic mode until
then.

For FTPers who previously complained about the unfriendly sort order produced
by the directory commands, you probably noticed that we recently switched the
archive issue-number file name extensions to double digits (e.g., <A HREF="/Risks/9.01.html">RISKS-9.01</A>,
02, 03, etc.)  and the volume summaries to RISKS-i.00, for i=1 to 9.  Beginning
with this issue we now have double-digit volume numbers for volume 10 and
beyond, but the original single-digit volume numbers remain for the first 9
volumes.  Beginning with this issue, ALL issue numbers will appear as two-digit
numbers, even in the headers.  (No volume has exceeded or will exceed 99
issues, a decision that ensures that the volume summary issues will be not much
larger than <A HREF="/Risks/9.98.html">RISKS-9.98</A> = <A HREF="/Risks/9.00.html">RISKS-9.00</A>, which was the largest yet.)

Astoundingly, there is always someone going back to get the early issues, which
affords an interesting chronological perspective of where we've been and how we
got to where we are now.  The historical archive also gives lots of clues as to
what we need to do better in the future...

Thanks for your patience through the multiple-copy ordeal.  The various
manifestations of it all seem to have been rectified on my end, although I
still hear reports of problems elsewhere.  PGN

&gt;From an Infoworld article on Word Perfect ("Leader of the Pack,"
pp. 45-6, May 23, 1990):

"When [Word Perfect] 5.0 shipped in May 1988, the company underestimated
the demand for telephone support.  Although it bought additional phone
lines, traffic was so heavy that calls to the support department brought
down the toll-free systems for the state of Utah, including phone systems
for American Express, Delta Airlines, and the Latter Day Saints Church."

                     [More details on this item, first noted in <A HREF="/Risks/9.90.html">RISKS-9.90</A>.]

Here are excerpts from a page 1 story in MILITARY AND AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS,
vol 1 no 5, May 1990:

VIRUSES COULD CRASH U.S. BATTLE SYSTEM by Lisa Burgess and Tobias Naegele

WASHINGTON - Computer viruses could crash critical battlefield command and
control computers,  according to a draft version of the Army's new Command
and Control Master Plan.  The report says the Army's Maneuver Control 
System, touted by developer TRW Inc. as the "integrating node" of the Army's 
command and control battle plan, is vulnerable to sabotaged software 
designed to undermine and disrupt operations.

... The four-page subsection, titled "Subversive Software" and buried 10
items deep in a section on camouflage, warns that "contractor-developed
non-developmental item (NDI) and `homegrown' software each present unique
[software surity] problems that must be addressed."

Generated by the Army's Combined Arms Combat Developments Activity at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., the report raises three questions about the potential for
software sabotage to damage the $1.3 billion MCS battle management network:

- Could virus software implanted in the system during the design phase attack
  MCS at a later date?

- Could an agent introduce a virus during combat by surreptitious access to a
  workstation?

- Could an enemy use a captured workstation to introduce a virus over the radio 
  network?

"Under its present configuration," the report states, "the answer is yes with
regards to MCS."

... Defense contractors say any system using the sort of off-the-shelf hardware
and software utilized in MCS and ATCCS --- the Army Tactical Command and
Control System --- is potentially vulnerable to virus attacks. ...

&gt;From the Los Angeles Times, May 31, 1990, p. D2:

Court Rules Against Caller I.D.: Bell of Pennsylvania's caller-identification
service is an invasion of privacy and violates the state's wiretap law, a state
court ruled.  The decision reverses an order by the state Public Utility
Commission allowing Bell to offer the service.  The service would let people
know who is calling before they pick up the phone, even if the caller's number
is unlisted.  Several other regional phone companies already offer the service.

Services Identifying Caller Held Illegal In Pennsylvania,   By Keith Bradsher

A Pennsylvania court ruled yesterday that services that identify the telephone
numbers of callers represent an illegal invasion of privacy.

The verdict was the first in the nation on the legality of such services.  The
five judges of the Commonwealth Court, a mid-level state appellate court, ruled
unanimously that caller identification services ... violate Pennsylvania's
wiretap law.

All five judges found that the services violate the law even when telephone
companies allow some customers to block the release of their telephone numbers.
And the court ruled by a 3-2 vote that the services violate privacy protections
offered by the Pennsylvania Constitution.

"In the framework of a democratic society, the privacy rights concept is much
too fundamental to be compromised or abridged by permitting Caller*ID," Judge
Doris A. Smith wrote in the majority opinion....

But Bell of Pennsylvania criticized the ruling.  "Because of this decision,
Pennsylvanians are being deined a service they eagerly want and badly need -
a weapon against harassing, threatening or obscene calls," [a spokesman said].

	Three Options for Panel

The Commonwealth Court hears appeals of decisions by state and local
administrative bodies in Pennsylvania, and its decisions may be appealed to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  John F. Povilaitis, the chief counsel of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, said his office would review
yesterday's decision and make a recommendation to the commissioners within a
few days.

[He] said the commission had three options:  to ask [for a rehearing], to file
an appeal before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, or to allow the decision to
stand.

Bell of Pennsylvania was not named as a defendent in the case.  But [it] said
it qualified as a party [and could appeal if the PUC chose not to].

Bell ... filed with the commission on June 18, 1989 for permission to offer
caller identification.  The commission approved the filing on Nov. 9 and the
company scheduled service to begin Jan. 9.  But a Commonwealth Court judge
blocked the service pending judicial review.

The suit was filed against the P.U.C. by the state's Office of the Consumer
Advocate, the [ACLU], the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.

[Caller id is now] widely available in [five states] and on a limited basis in
[three others] ... according to ... a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Corporation,
the parent of Bell of Pennsylvania.  Phone companies in nine other states and
Washington are seeking to introduce caller identification.

Long-distance companies, including [AT&amp;T], also offer caller identification to
some businesses with 800 and 900 numbers.  Yesterday's decision ...  did not
address whether long-distance companies should stop providing information for
Pennsylvania callers.

"We have to see how, if at all, this ruling affects AT&amp;T," said ... a spokesman
for the company.

	Privacy Issue Cited

Bell Atlantic and other defenders of caller identification have argued that
the services discourage obscene callers and protect the privacy of people
receiving calls by allowing them the choice of not answering.  But the court
ruled explicitly that the privacy of people making calls is more important.

The court found that caller identification services function as call-tracing
devices, which under the Pennsylvania wiretap statute may be used only under
certain circumstances.  The court noted that Pennsylvania requires the consent
of all parties before a telephone conversation may be recorded.

As of December, there were 15 other states with similar requirements.  The
remaining states and Federal law allow taping with the consent of one party.
But [FCC] rules require that all parties to an interstate or international call
be aware they are being taped.

The Pennsylvania wiretap statute contains wording similar to the Federal
wiretap statute.  Bills are pending in the House and Senate that would amend
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 to make caller identification
explicitly legal while requiring that telephone companies give customers the
option of blocking release of their telephone numbers.  A subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for June 7 on caller
identification.

                 [Because of the remarkably complex tradeoffs between 
                 defensive functionality and offensive violations of rights,
                 this item seems worth including in its entirety for its
                 intense educational value.  PGN]

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs its own 5ESS switch to provide
telephone service on campus.  This has significant benefits, including many
different telephone classifications (office, dormitory, etc), a modem pool, and
ISDN phones in the offices which pay for them (most do).

This week, I discovered what I consider a serious problem, however.  A friend
was at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for surgery.  (I'll save you
the suspense: the surgery went well.)  I wanted to call and check on him to see
how the surgery went.  I called the hospital's main number, and was transferred
to his room, except the phone was busy, so the operator gave me his phone
number.

The next day, I attempted to call his room, only to be greeted with "I'm sorry,
but your call cannot be completed as dialed...."  I thought about the
situation, and after placing a call to the MGH operator, discovered that my
friend was in a brand new building with a brand new exchange all its own.  I
called the MIT operator, who told me that the number I was trying to reach was
in Petersburg, over a half hour away (I can see MGH from my room).  I finally
convinced her that this was a number at MGH, but she told me that she couldn't
connect me.  My phone is only able to make local calls, so I called a friend
who works in the same office as the people who run the switch.  They couldn't
make the call.  In other words, neither the operator nor the top class of phone
could make the call.

Today, I called MIT's help line, and described my problem.  Within several
hours, my theory was confirmed.  The switch simply didn't know the new exchange
existed.  It turns out, that as a "client," MIT doesn't get automatic updates
when new exchanges are created.  Without this information, the switch has no
clue how to bill the caller, or even if it should let the caller make the call.
So it assumes the worst case, and disallows anyone from making the call.  The
switch had to be manually programmed with the necessary information about the
new exchange.

This worries me, as someone who isn't as familiar with telephone switching
equipment might not have known what caused it, assumed it was his/her fault,
and been denied service because of it.  It is surprising, to me that our switch
is not configured to take updates of this kind of information automatically
from the New England Telephone switches it talks to.  I was trying to call a
hospital; fortunately it was not an emergency.  My workstation has dynamic
nameservice; my doesn't my telephone switch?

Some little while ago, Risks published the report of a flight crew landing an
airliner in Britain after a very difficult time with wind readings of 100+
knots and repeated equipment failures (in a "glass" [computerized] cockpit).
There is an interesting sidelight on this in the May 2 issue of Flight
International:

	CAA appeals for CHIRP pilot to step forward

	The UK Civil Aviation Authority is publicly appealing to
	an unknown pilot to file a Mandatory Occurrence Report
	about a serious digital cockpit systems failure which it
	is unable to investigate, because the airline pilot
	involved reported it through a confidential reporting system.

	Investigators and airline maintenance staff have no access
	to details of the apparently first-time incident.  The MOR
	would allow the aircraft to be identified and its cockpit
	systems failures identified...

	[Recap of incident, as reported by pilot.]

	The confidential human factors incident reporting program
	(CHIRP) was designed to encourage pilots who have experienced
	a potentially dangerous incident because of human error to
	report it without fear of any disciplinary repercussions.

	It is unclear why this pilot used CHIRP, because there is no
	indication of human error -- only bad weather and systems failure...

	[More recap.]

One really has to wonder just what really went on on that flight.  Use of CHIRP
might seem appropriate to a pilot fearful of management reaction to criticism
of electronic aircraft, but as a result the people who want to investigate the
problem are hamstrung, doubts are cast on the accuracy of the report, and if it
*is* factual, that aircraft is still in service and potentially a lethal hazard
to crews and passengers.

Subject: Re: Debate on SJG raid in comp.risks

Re: Sherwood, <A HREF="/Risks/9.96.html">RISKS-9.96</A>:

To the best of my understanding, this account is correct except for trivial
details (not a footlocker, but some filing cabinets were broken open in the
account SJ himself wrote).

Re: Von Rospach, <A HREF="/Risks/9.97.html">RISKS-9.97</A>

&gt; the person working on for Jackson Games was a former Legion of Doom member...

This first part of this also appears to be true -- Loyd was apparently
associated with some bunch of crackers sometime in the past, and apparently
discussed some of the stuff he was doing with Cyberpunk with them, in the way
of reality-checking.  However, Cyberpunk was certainly *not* a "manual on
hacking" -- I haven't read my copy yet, but I'm quite certain the game rules
don't go into details of breaking computer security -- it just has abstract
security programs and "cracking" programs as things that exist in the game
world.  These things also exist in cyberpunk novels, which is why they're in
the book.

&gt;If you're running a BBS that's supporting a group of system crackers, you are,
&gt;at least, contributory to felony crimes... 

The problem was that SJG *was* clean, as far as I know -- the Secret
Service just went overboard in their search for "contamination".  I
believe guilt-by-association is not a tenable legal theory in the US.
Grounds for some amount of suspicion, yes.  But search and seizure?

&gt;&gt;Or does it indicate that games which involve "hacking" are subject to ...
&gt;Not if the Legion of Doom angle is true.... 

The Legion of Doom connection appears to have been there, but very tenuous.
The Feds seem to have been unable to draw the line between fantasy and reality,
and appear to have been operating under a "guilty until proven innocent"
premise as far as the seizure of equipment went.  As far as I know, the Secret
Service had no direct evidence that SJG or the BBS had *anything* to do with
their case -- mere proximity to the principals seems to have triggered the
raid.  I would expect that they would have done more research before swooping
down and carting off someone's business equipment.

I can understand how the raid happened, and even sympathize somewhat with the
motivations of the Secret Service, but I think that they definitely stepped
over the line here.  One of the principles of the law in this country is that
the innocent shouldn't be harmed in the pursuit of the guilty.
                                                                  ---Walter

The chance of GURPS Cyperpunk being used as a manual for computer crime is very
slight indeed.  In Cyperpunk fiction, a hacker's interface with the computer
network he or she is trying to operate in is an actual physical connection with
the computer.  This connection is usually in the form of a direct link to a
person's brain through jacks surgically implanted in their skull.  It is my
understanding that Steve Jackson Games used the same method of interfacing with
computers in GURPS Cyperpunk.  This would make it a little difficult for a
person to use the game rules a handbook for crime.  Unless they had a friend
real handy with tools...:-).

 In RISKS 9.96, Richard Muirden writes of his experience with $89m showing up
in his bank account; his bank blamed him for keying in the amount at the ATM.
He went on to wonder about the range checking that might or might not be
employed at the ATM to catch "such obvious erroneous data".  It is my
experience that there is, indeed, NO such checking performed--at least at one
institution, at one time.
 A few years back, my credit union installed an ATM machine; as part of the
hoopla surrounding the event, they had a demonstration where members could
"practice" on the machine, using a card provided by the demonstator.  I, being
the obnoxious sort, made use of the opportunity to determine an empirical
answer to the question of range checks.  I cheerfully deposited the amount of
$99,999,999 in the account.  The demonstrator was rather worried when I showed
him the receipt (oops--I meant "transaction record"); it seems that they were
using a live account for the demo, which meant that all these phoney
transactions would show up on the balance sheets at the end of the day!  I did
hear later that the trouble caused was minimal, but they did have to jump
through some hoops to make sure there were no ripple effects caused by that
$99m.
 P.S.--My personal feeling is that any non-zero deposit is an "obviously
erroneous value"; I don't like giving my money to a machine in exchange
for a worthless transaction record.                                    Andy

I was given this article by some colleagues who bought the magazine while
visiting France for a research project meeting. Having had a quick look at
it, I decided that it was *very* interesting. It contains chapter and verse
on a couple of hair-raising incidents on board the A320, and the author
obviously had access to the dossier of OEB's, from which he draws some 
fascinating conclusions regarding the general state of readiness of the A320
on entry into service and the possible causes of the Habsheim accident. He
also includes an excellent summary of the legal wrangle surrounding the
investigation into Habsheim. So, because of:

a) the technical quality of the article,
b) the fact that it presents a French (and therefore not negatively biased?)
   view, and
c) the fact that it is not readily accessible to the majority of UK and US
   readers,

I decided, at *enormous* cost in time and effort :-), to make a careful
translation of the whole article, and send it complete to RISKS and to
Aeronautics Digest. [...]

                       LES CRISES DE NERFS DE L'A320

Translation of article by Bertrand Bonneau: Aeronautique, April 1990, pp. 94-101
        [Translator's comments and additions are in square brackets.]

                       THE A320'S ATTACKS OF NERVES 

- The first aircraft in the history of the world to be totally "managed" by 
- computer; has the A320 been put into service before it is ready?
- The excessive number of incidents during its first year of use can only make
- one think so. How could the willingness to declare the pilots responsible for
- major accidents, even before the judges have returned their verdict, appear
- other than suspect? Even so, as everyone wished, the verdict whitewashed the
- aircraft.

At the start of 1988, the French authorities and Airbus Industrie congratulated
themselves on the certification of the A320 only one year after the first flight
of the prototype. In less than one year, the manufacturer had demonstrated the
reliability of this new generation aircraft to the authorities of four of the
States of the European Community.

However, controversy surrounding the aircraft would not be slow to surface at
the time of the inaugural flight of the Air France A320, on 28th March 1988
over Paris, with the Prime Minister of the time on board. This flight was
marked by a series of technical incidents, notably by the untimely setting off
of alarms. New controversies were to arise when an aircraft was destroyed in
the forest of Habsheim in Alsace (26th June 1988), and when an Indian Airlines
A320 crashed before reaching the runway in Bangalore last February. In both of
the last two cases, the aircraft was whitewashed as far as public opinion was
concerned before the slightest preliminary accident report was published...

Although what have come to be called the "Chirac flight" and the "Habsheim
affair" are the two facts most known to the public, the first year of operation
of the A320 has been marked by numerous incidents which have directly called
into question certain systems on the aeroplane. Often badly received by the
first crews qualified on this aircraft, and sometimes vigorously denied by the
technical directors of the launching companies, these incidents lead one to ask if the manufacturers and the certification authorities have not proceeded a
little too quickly.

*Twelve times more incidents than were foreseen.* In his statement on the first
year of operation of the A320 in the Air France fleet, a statement addressed to
the general department of civil aviation (Direction Generale de l'Aviation
Civile - DGAC) on the 11th July 1989, the technical sub-director of operations
management of the national company remarks that the first exercise has been
marked by "a greatly increased number of technical incidents altogether"
(page 12). Whereas the target set was one incident per thousand hours of flight,
the year 1988 ended with an incident rate of twelve per thousand hours of
flight. For comparison, this rate was 5/1 000 at the time of the first year of
operation of the Airbus A300.

The frequency of these incidents which have marked the A320 going into service
within Air France, Air Inter and British Airways has forced the manufacturer to
publish no fewer than 52 provisional flight notices (OEB, Operations Engineering
Bulletin) between April 1988 and April 1989. The launch of a new aircraft
requires on average four times fewer. OEB's are temporary notices sent out by
the manufacturer to the users. They form a list of anomalies or simply
functional features of the aircraft, which do not appear in the users' manual
for the equipment (FCOM, Flight Crew Operation Manual): they are only revealed
in the course of operation. In the case of Air France, these provisional
records are provided to the crews in the form of a volume of supplementary
technical information notices (Renseignements Complementaires Techniques
 - RCT's).

For the A320, the number of OEB's alone gives an account of the problems of 
putting the aircraft into service. At the technical level, around twenty of the
fifty main computers of the first A320's coming off the production lines in
Toulouse have had to undergo modifications. For the A320 is the first aircraft
in the world to be completely computerised. Computers control the function of 
all the systems of the aeroplane (motors, ailerons, but also the cabin
lighting, etc); it [sic] processes raw data, converts them, and 
transmits them to the pilot. Now, the application of numerous modifications
defined by the manufacturer in order to correct defects in the systems or to
enhance them, has been the origin of new breakdowns. These new problems have
obliged the manufacturer to publish new OEB's before drawing up final
modifications.

During service, companies have had to modify once or several times certain
procedures for operating their aircraft. Also, with the exception of Air Inter,
which reported only good results, the increased number of incidents was the 
origin of poor availability and bad technical readiness of the first A320's
delivered. "Of 7 334 stop-overs [landing + take-off's (?)] carried
out up to April 1989," states the report of the technical sub-director of
Air-France, "one lists on technical grounds [i.e. something went wrong (?)]:
4 accelerations-stops on take-off, 36 about-turns on the ground,
10 about-turns in the air, 1 emergency descent procedure, the cabin altitude
being on the increase (without violent decompression), 1 engine stop in flight."
[If you think this lot is confusing, you should see the original French!
 I think an about-turn on the ground is an aborted take-off, and an about-turn
 in the air is a return to the departure port. I'm not sure what the difference
 is between an about-turn on the ground and an acceleration-stop. Presumably
 the latter means the engines raced or cut-out during approach to take-off.
 'Cabin *altitude* being on the increase' is a literal translation: I think it
 means the cabin atmosphere was below pressure, since they came *down*.
 Anyone with access to a dictionary of French avionic terms, or who knows the
 correct English avionic terms is welcome to correct me!]
It is advisable to add to these outcomes the grounding of aircraft due to
suspect behaviour, and 74 cancellations of flight before even starting up the
engines.

*Reliability in question*. For the aviation companies, the most serious problem
would seem to have been that of the reliability of the information given to the
crew by the various systems of the A320. The operating assessment by the
technical sub-director of Air France is edifying on this subject. One discovers
there, for example, that: "certain inconsistencies of piloting information
have led to certain confused and very distracting situations, where the 
information presented to the pilots on the control screens, during flight, was
in contradiction to the physical reality of the equipment, not always
verifiable in flight", (report already cited, page 18).
[Presumably this means: "The instruments were lying, but the pilots couldn't
 get out and walk around to check this at 30 000 feet!" Nice to know that
 French technical officialese is as obscure as British or American! ;-}]

Without a doubt, Captain Claude Dalloz and First Officer Patrick Vacquand share
the views of the technical sub-director of Air France. On the 25th August 1988,
while taking off from Roissy on a flight to Amsterdam (flight AF 914), they had
the disagreeable surprise of seeing the message "Man pitch trim only" appear in
red on their control screens. In plain terms, this message informed the pilots 
that the controls activating the pitch control mechanism were no longer in a
functional state. In this case, the only means of ensuring the longitudinal
stability of the aircraft is to manually move the trimmable horizontal 
stabiliser by means of the pitch trim wheels.

Meanwhile, the copilot who was at the controls felt not the slightest difficulty
in controlling the aircraft. Then the crew witnessed a display of imaginary
alarms ("fire in the toilets", for example), and noticed new signalling
anomalies on the screens concerning the flight control systems, the position of
the landing gear, and also the situation of the automatic pilot.

It was therefore decided to return, but, during the approach, the gear at first
refused to come down normally. Given the uncertainty, three passes at low
altitude were made in front of the control tower to ascertain the real position
of the gear after having carried out safety manoeuvres. As the information
provided to the crew ("gear partially down") did not correspond to the
observations of the controllers at Roissy (gear down), the passenger cabin was
prepared for an eventual crash, which did not, very fortunately, occur. The
same incident recurred on another plane on 29th November 1988. It finally 
required nine months of operation before a new, more reliable, version of the 
Flight Warning Computer (FWC) called into question by these two cases was made
available to users.

*A temperamental altimeter*. A good many problems due to the design of
certain systems have revealed themselves since the start of operation. The
most spectacular, for the passengers, would have been the vagaries of the
integrated cabin communication system (CIDS), which modified explanations or
illuminating announcements in an eccentric fashion. More seriously, the crews
discovered that the temperature regulation of the passenger cabin could
interfere with the functioning of the engine power control computers (FADEC),
generating breakdowns and alarms. To avoid these interferences, crews were
asked not to "reinitialise" the cabin temperature regulation system while the
engines were running.

However, the most worrying phenomenon for the crews has been the untimely
alterations to the setting of the altimeters during flight. Having reached
a certain altitude, the pilots set their altimeters in a standard way,
calculated in relation to the theoretical atmospheric pressure at sea level
(1 013 hPa), in order that all aircraft using the airspace should have the same
reference for altitude (QNH base). Relative to this base, the altimeter
indicates a pressure altitude, which is a "QNE" altitude. While the aircraft
is descending, at a predetermined height the crew must set their altimeters
in relation to the altitude of the destination airport (QFE base). Apart from
some very rare landing strips situated below sea-level, airports are above this
[sea-] level. Since pressure diminishes with altitude, the value of QFE is
generally less than 1 013 hPa. The sudden alteration of the altimeter setting
by the flight programming computer (FCU, Flight Control Unit) sometimes occurs
in uncomfortable conditions. So, in July 1988, during an approach to Roissy,
the untimely alteration of the altimetric setting, which conveyed itself as
a reversal of the altimeter reading, provoked an automatic delivery of fuel in
order to compensate for the false deviation in altitude generated by the
defaulting computer and detected automatically by the safety systems of the
aircraft. This delivery of fuel occurred while the aircraft was being flown
manually on its descent. The rapid intervention of the pilot could not avoid
the aircraft going into overdrive for several seconds.

Untimely alterations of altimetric settings showed up on at least the first
three planes delivered to Air France, among them the aircraft which crashed at 
Habsheim. The commission of enquiry has revealed in its final report that such
an incident had taken place on the plane several hours before its crash,
concluding immediately that this anomaly due to a design error had played no
part at all in the accident. Moreover, the flight report (CRM, compte-rendu
materiel) of a crew, concerning a third aircraft of Air France, made mention of
vagaries of the altimeter.

It is therefore surprising that the report of the technical sub-director of
Air France limits this type of incident to a single A320 of his fleet (the
aircraft registered F-GFKB), when it has also occurred on at least two other
planes (registered F-GFKA and F-GFKC). But the most amazing thing remains that
this functional anomaly should cease without anyone being able to identify its
origin!

*Recording of parameters*. In an indirect manner, these two types of incidents
have revealed another potential source of problems in the level of the 
recording of parameters by the "black box recorder" (DFDR, Digital Flight Data
Recorder). In effect, each piece of information given to the pilot is handled
by a cascade of computers. Now, this "black box" records the majority of its
information on the intermediate computers and not at the start
or end of the processing chain. When examining this data, therefore, there
is nothing that allows one to know precisely what the pilots had for
information, since there is no recording at the output of the symbol generator
[DMC] for their screens.

The problems posed by the flight data recording system can be illustrated by
referring to the two incidents mentioned. If the Paris/Amsterdam flight
recalled above had ended in a crash, the "black box recorder", which captures
a large part of its information from the flight warning computer (FWC), would
have revealed that the crew no longer had pitch control available. In fact,
all the flight controls were functioning, but the flight warning computer,
which is one of the principal sources of information of the "black box
recorder", had failed (diagram, p.98).

Equally, if the untimely alterations of the altimeter readings had ended in
a crash, the "black box recorder" would have revealed no malfunction of the
altimeter assembly, since the recording of pressure altitudes (QNE), which was
correct, is effected by equipment located upstream of the failing computer.
This computer (FCU) incorrectly processed the information which had been sent
to it, and an erroneous indication of altitude was sent to the control screens
(diagram above, p. 99).

*Modification Campaigns*. Before the A320's went into service, the launch
companies' instructors - who cannot be accused of bias since
they were all volunteers - complained of having had no contact with the 
test pilots of Airbus Industrie. The report of the technical subdirector of
Air France, for its part, confirms this worry by revealing that it had at last
been possible to establish a "frank relationship" (page 17) after six 
months. The adaptation of failing systems has been progressively integrated 
in the course of several modification campaigns begun at the start and
middle of 1989 as problems were found and listed. It was necessary
to wait until the end of last year to obtain the definitive version of certain
pieces of equipment, that is to say, eighteen months after the certification
and entry into commercial service of the A320.

At the end of last year, the dossier of supplementary technical notices (RCT's)
distributed to A320 crews already comprised eleven pages, whereas the RCT's of
other aircraft in the Air France fleet rarely got beyond three pages.

Contrary to the fears expressed many times in the course of these last years,
not only by certain pilots' unions, but also by the American certification
authorities (FAA, Federal Aviation Authority), the electrical flight controls
and the electronic engine control system, which constitute the two great
technological innovations of the A320, would never be the direct cause
of any significant incident, notably in stormy conditions. During test
just as in service, the A320 was struck by lightning several times without the
least influence on the flight controls.

The majority of the teething troubles and design faults of the A320 
therefore concern more classical systems. The report of the technical 
sub-director of Air France is once again definitive: "Pressurisation, 
management of cabin communications (CIDS), pneumatic generation, auxiliary 
power units (APU)... have been for a long time of an unacceptable reliability.
Everything is still not under control to this day (NDLR: 11th July 1989)."
(Report already cited, page 17).

*Industrial secret*. It could therefore be thought that the certificator has 
turned his attention above all to the innovative elements (flight controls, 
FADEC, etc.) of the A320. However, this explanation, although not completely 
without foundation, does not take into account the fact that the systems called
classical are also subject to major innovations, since they practically all
require computer automation.

Without invoking the young demons of computing, the embedding of numerous 
pieces of software on board aircraft of the new generation (A320, but also 
McDonnell-Douglas MD 11, Boeing 747-400, among others) can pose problems for
the official agencies. Up until then, the certificators were confronted by
much more simple systems (cabling, for example) and by perfectly mastered
technologies (electricity, for example). With the A320, the certificator
found himself before a gigantic interactive data processing system, made up
of "boxes" which consisted of inputs and outputs. No-one having foreseen
such a rapid installation of computers on board service aircraft, it was not
possible to find, in the international regulations, standards directly
applicable to this domain.

Furthermore, the certificator came up against protection of embedded software
by industrial secret. The official agencies were finally forced sometimes to 
give their agreement to a piece of equipment, on a simple demonstration of the 
required result, without being able to know precisely the organisation of the
system which allowed it to be reached. In such a context, only a more thorough
programme of tests would have permitted the major design faults of certain
systems to be revealed with certainty and would have avoided certain launch 
companies having to proceed with the modification of nearly half of the main
computers of their first A320's.

The protection of software by industrial secret constitutes a source of 
problems also for the users' maintenance services, who must leave it to the
manufacturer to understand the reasons for its failure. For the time being,
the best equipped companies are provided with certain software test sets, but 
eventually the users will have to be able to test their systems directly on
the battery of test sets of the manufacturer through data transmission networks.

*The dead-ends of certification*. It is interesting to note that use has 
revealed several loopholes in certification. A provisional information bulletin
dating from the month of May 1988 (OEB no. 06/2) reveals for example that the 
single information source for the pilot's and copilot's altimeters on the A320,
is not compatible with certification standards [i.e. it makes a single point
failure possible?].

Another provisional information bulletin sent out in August 1988 (OEB no. 33/1)
indicates that the safety lighting system of the floor of the passenger cabin
does not conform to certification standards. This system would not 
automatically illuminate when one of the emergency evacuation devices of the
aircraft was activated, in the case of the loss of the normal electricity
supply. Now, this lighting system provides an illuminated pathway in the
central aisle of the cabin, which must allow passengers to find the safety 
exits or doors during an evacuation in the dark or in smoke. This design
defect was underlined by the final report of the commission of enquiry into
the Habsheim accident.

"To be the launch client of a new aircraft is sometimes a painful task,"
one of the directors of Air France confided last year, before adding that "the
A320 would attain the level of reliability of the fleet (of Air France) by the
start of 1990." This would be practically two years after the certification of 
the aircraft. A last example: it has been necessary to wait until the month of
July 1989 for it to be noticed, in the course of a test flight, that the
landing gear could, in certain cases, not retract fully in case of a shut-down
of engine no. 1 during take-off (OEB no. 62/1). (1)

The totality of these elements, then, could allow one to believe that speed and
haste had been confused.

*Up to the customer to complete the tests.* The standards and certification
procedures of civil aircraft are not adapted to the A320, an aircraft which,
for the first time in the history of civil aviation, is massively equipped
with data processing systems. For example, the software in the flight warning
computer [FWC] included a fault which a good computer scientist could have
repaired without a doubt. But this software is protected by industrial secret,
and as luck would have it the fault did not show itself at the time of the
certification campaign. Result: an aircraft has been sold with a certain
number of latent defects, which the first customers have discovered bit by bit.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL LEAPS OF THE AIRBUS

The A320 (1) is the first aircraft whose cockpit panel is entirely equipped
with cathode tube screens [CRT's]. Only three traditional instruments are still
found there, in case of failure of the former [i.e. CRT's]. The new screens
display more synthetic and more complete information to the crew. So, the whole
navigation of the flight is directly visible to one of them, and the image
evolves in real time along with the movement of the aircraft, whereas on
traditional aircraft, this tracking is effected by the pilot on a piece of
paper on which he reports the successive positions given by the on-board
equipment (radiobeacon receiver, radiocompass, inertial platform [IRS?], etc.).
But these screens can also, unfortunately, deliver erroneous information if
one of the systems that supplies them is failing; and the irony is that often
this information cannot be verified by the pilots in flight (see diagrams,
p.98). An aircraft of the preceding generation, the A310 (2), was already
equipped with some screens, whereas the A300 (3), which was developed at the
start of the 70's, is only equipped with classical electromechanical
instruments.

BREAKDOWNS AND DANGERS INVENTED BY THE COMPUTER

*A. Alarmist computers.* This simplified diagram [p. 98] of the A320 systems
(which takes no account of the actual location of the computers) shows how the
crew of flight AF 914 of 25th August 1988 found themselves confronted by 
nonsensical information generated by the flight warning computer (FWC). This
sent the erroneous message "manual pitch trim only" to the piloting screen
(PFD) and to the "black box recorder" (DFDR), a message informing of a loss of
control of the pitch control surfaces (red arrows). [Sorry. Colour diagrams are
difficult over e-mail ;-)] Put simply, the pilot can no longer control the
climb or descent of his aircraft with the stick (but only by means of a manual
back-up control). In fact (green arrows), this control [i.e. the electronic one]
was functioning perfectly.

*B. Imaginary altitude.* The second diagram [p. 99] shows how the pilots had
on their screens an untimely alteration to their altimetric setting, generated
by the flight control unit (FCU), whereas the altitude data in the air data
inertial reference unit (ADIRU) was correct. The FCU prompted an inversion
between the pressure altitude (QNE) and the altitude of the destination landing
strip (QFE). As the QFE was giving an altitude below the QNE altitude (which
would allow one to believe that the aircraft was flying dangerously lower than
it was in reality), the safety systems of the aircraft demanded an automatic
delivery of fuel to regain height.

                  HABSHEIM ACCIDENT: CFMI ASSESSES CFMI

On the 26th June 1988, the air show organised by the little flying club of 
Habsheim, in the Haut-Rhin, turned to drama when an Air France A320 crashed 
with 130 passengers in the forest which bordered the landing field, in the
course of its display flight. In a few minutes, the aircraft was almost 
completely burned. Toll: 3 dead, 34 injured, the other 93 occupants unhurt.

Nearly 18 months after the accident, the Commission of enquiry delivered its 
report. Contrary to what it had been possible to affirm, this document (called
the "Bechet report" after the name of the president of that commission) does 
not establish any responsibility, but limits itself to stating the facts and 
suggesting some measures. After all, only judges are entitled to decide blame
and responsibility. Now, this decision has not taken place. The investigating
magistrate has even requested recently the reopening of the inquiry for
supplementary information.

No-one knows, then, what the Mulhouse magistrate thinks, but the context in 
which the enquiry into this accident was begun could be marked by certain
irregularities. Indeed, on the evening of the drama, the director general of
Civil Aviation was filmed by a television crew as he took charge of the 
transport of the two "black boxes" (CVR and DFDR). Now these two recorders
are the essential elements for the enquiry. The presence of the director 
general of civil Aviation at the scene of the accident and the particularly
active role that he played that evening seem hardly compatible with the
ministerial directive of the 3rd January 1953 relating to the coordination
of the judicial inquiry and the technical investigation and with
directive no. 300 IGAC/SA of the 3rd June 1957 concerning the steps to be
taken in case of irregularity, incident or accident in aviation. The General
Directorate of Civil Aviation having had the responsibility of certifying the
aircraft and having authorised the holding of the meeting, it is legitimate
to ask oneself if its director is not simultaneously judge and party to the 
case. Moreover, the authority designated by the regulations as being competent
in the matter of enquiries is not the DGAC but the General Inspectorate of
Civil Aviation (IGAC), placed under the direct authority of the Minister of
Transport.

A second factor, which follows from the first, could leave one to suspect
that the concern of the only technical enquiry had overridden that of
the judicial enquiry. First, it was necessary to wait two days for an 
investigating judge to be appointed, whereas that is generally done in half a
day for major accidents; and this is one of them [i.e. major], with, moreover,
a considerable amount at stake. Furthermore, the two black boxes were left for
nine days without any judicial control, since the placing under seal was only
done on the 5th July (let us recall that the accident took place on 26th June).
In the meantime, parts of the recording of the conversations held in the cockpit
during the flight were published in the press, in defiance of the secrecy
required by the directive [i.e. no. 300 IGAC/SA of 3rd June 1957(?)].

Reading of the Bechet report (page 41) reveals that the assessment of the 
damaged aircraft engines was entrusted to their own manufacturer (CFMI), on the
SNECMA premises at Melun-Villaroche. Without casting doubt on the quality of
the assessment achieved by the manufacturer on the premises of one of his
partners with the participation of the Commission of Enquiry, it seems
astonishing that the manufacturer should have had control over a procedure
which concerned him so directly. As one knows, in the case of an enquiry
relating to an accident, an assessment is always likely to have judicial 
consequences.

That is all the more surprising since the engines had been directly implicated
by the statements of the crew immediately after the accident. One can therefore
ask oneself why the assessment of the two CFM56-5A1's was not entrusted to the 
experts of the Propeller Test Centre of Saclay, which comes under the Flight
Test Centre. Indeed, this centre does not have any judicial, industrial or
commercial links with the equipment in question.

Even if the conclusions of the commission of enquiry, based on that assessment
and on the recording of the "black box recorder" [DFDR], categorically 
rule out the two engines, that will not cut short some of the objections which
some of the lawyers would have been able to try to set out before the judges 
of Mulhouse. Such would not have been the case if that investigation had been
entrusted to an organisation which was not also an interested party.

If the defects of acceleration of the CFM56-5A1 engines of the Air France A320,
noticed sometimes in certain cases of low altitude flight, did not exhibit
themselves at the time of the accident, why, then, was a provisional information
bulletin (OEB 19/1) sent out in May 1988, modified in the following August
(OEB 19/2)? Moreover, the adjustment of the stator blades (counterbalancing [?]
of the jacks which modify their pitch [?]) of these engines, which has a direct
link with their efficiency at low speed and at low altitude, was also modified
a short time after the accident. There again, why?

This is a summary of an article in the Guardian for 1st June:
`Computer hitch stalls GP budgets', any inaccuracies are mine.

At the moment UK family doctors are funded according to the size of their
practice and various overheads. As part of changes to the National Health
Service, doctors may be required to maintain their own budgets and buy
 treatment from local hospitals. To do this doctors will require specialist
software to interface with hospital databases as well as doing their own
accounting. The first stage of the scheme involving several hundred doctors was
to start next April. The changes are unpopular and doctors are dropping out,
software firms working in the area claim that developing the software is not
worthwhile given the number of sales to those doctors participating. It was
stated that even if the government funded the development there is not enough
time to produce and test the software in time.

Although it is not stated in the article, I believe that one problem may be
that different hospitals run different (and incompatible) accounting software.

Recent raids on suspected hackers and the likelihood of anti-virus legislation
in the US (RISKS 9.95) should not make us forget what is happening in the UK.

The story so far:

In September 1988, the English Law Commission (ELC) issued a consultative
document, "Computer Misuse".

In April '89, Emma Nicholson, MP, proposed a private member's bill to make
various hacking activities illegal. This was generally thought to be poorly
researched, and too hastily drafted. It was roundly attacked in the Guardian
by, among others, Peter Sommer (aka Hugo Cornwall, author of "The Hacker's
Handbook). The bill failed for lack of time. (A frequent fate of private
members' bills.) [1]

In October 1989, the ELC published its final report on "Computer Misuse" [2].
This suggested three new offences. I quote from a summary by Peter Casey
of the DTI [3]:

- a basic offence which will apply to anyone who seeks to enter a computer
  system knowing that the entry is unauthorised. This would be punishable by
  up to three months imprisonment.

- a more serious offence of unauthorised entry into a computer system with
  intent to commit or assist the commission of a serious crime. This would
  be punishable by up to five years imprisonment.

- a further offence of intentionally and without authority altering computer
  held data or programs, punishable with up to five years imprisonment.

Because of the international nature of computer misuse the Commission also
proposes reform of the jurisdiction rules to remedy a gap in the current law 
whereby an offender initiating or furthering a crime completed abroad may
escape prosecution in any country. [End of quote.]

Another private member's bill implementing these proposals was introduced by
Michael Colvin, MP, and received its 2nd reading in the Commons on May 4th 1990.
Called the "Computer Misuse Bill", it has been amended to allow powers of search
and entry of suspected hackers' premises by police armed with a magistrate's
warrant. It passed its second reading with the amendment, but without stronger
amendments proposed by Emma Nicholson "to give magistrates powers to sign
warrants that extended that extended the police powers of search and seizure,
and for judges to sign warrants that allowed the police to intercept computer
communications....She pressed for an amendment that would oblige British
Telecom and Mercury, on the instructions of a magistrate, to begin surveillance
of designated communications traffic."[4]

The bill was attacked by Harry Cohen, MP. "The first major problem raised by
Cohen was that the bill doesn't define the term 'computer'. He also questioned
how the offence of 'unauthorised access' would be applied in practice. Cohen
pointed out that the lack of a definition raises the spectre of unauthorised
access to the microchip computers found in 'domestic appliances such as a
sewing machine with a programmable pattern, or a washing machine, video
recorder or compact disc player that can be programmed'. Even fax machines or
photocopiers would lead to some 'farcical prosecutions', he asserted.
However, other anomalies would arise if a defintion of 'computer' were
included. For example, if a computer were described in precise and exacting
terms, would the next technological development produce a computer that
was not a computer as defined by the Computer Misuse Bill?...In the end, it
was decided not to include a definition of computer in the bill, as this
would let the courts decide in each case." [4]

Cohen's second attack was more interesting. "...Cohen drafted three amendments
to ensure that the security procedures adopted by a computer owner could be 
examined by the courts....if computer owners did not have security procedures
that sufficiently protected their computers from unauthorised access, the
hacker could get off. [From the basic charge of unauthorised access.]
Cohen's other two attempts were variants aimed at extending the Data Protection
Act to all computer operations. The MP argued that any individual who suffered
damage because computers, software or data were insecure or unreliable, should
be able to seek compensation from the owner via the courts or the data
protection registrar. The owners would have one main defence: to show that they
'had taken such care in all circumstances as was reasonably required' to
maintain the reliability and security of the computer, data or program in
question."[4]

(His amendments failed.)

The main arguments can be summarised as:

Cohen (quoting Francis Aldhouse, deputy data protection registrar) [4] :
"You've only yourself to blame if your neighbour's cattle get into your
unfenced field.", and:
"Logic dictates that computer owners should be legally responsible for the
security of their computers just as gun owners are responsible for their guns."

Nicholson [4]: "If a madman with a knife attacks another person in the street,
would the victim be responsible for not taking reasonable care to prevent the
attack?"

Sommer (arguing against Nicholson) [1]: "In fact, most of the computer-related
activities most people would think ought to be criminally sactioned already
are."

It will come as no surprise to UK readers to learn that Colvin and Nicholson
are Conservative, and Cohen is Labour, and that the government are being
supportive in such little matters as parliamentary time.

Interestingly, Colvin seems to favour some of Cohen's arguments. Speaking at
a contingency planning and disaster recovery seminar, he said: "If companies
do not invest in their own computer security strategy, then they cannot expect
the sympathy of the courts when people are charged under the provisions
proposed in my Bill." [5]

Also, Nicholson "plans to introduce a Computer Usage Bill in the autumn, which
will lay down rules for the use of computers covering maintenance, support and
upgrades." [5]

The truth of Sommer's argument is illustrated by the case of one Nicholas
Whiteley, appearing before Southwark Crown Court last week on seven charges
of criminal damage arising from hacks carried out during six months in 1988.
He admits the hacks, but claims he did no damage. (My private information is
that he overwrote files with joke messages, and the amount of damage was
estimated as &amp;25 000. I also believe he was convicted, but haven't seen a
report of his sentence.) He hacked ICL series 39 machines at Queen Mary College,
Hull University, and Glasgow University. He told the court: "My messages weren't
a threat, they were just a wind-up." [6]

The Computer Misuse Bill, in the meantime, goes on to committee and then to the
Lords, then back to the Commons. If it succeeds, we should start worrying
about just how 'authorised' we are around September.

It's pretty clear that different banks have different practices, as well as
diverse equipment.  My bank (Wells Fargo) advertises that they will credit you
with an extra $10 if the ATM makes any mistake on a deposit (and, indeed, I've
never detected one).  They also do some range-checking.  I haven't conducted
extensive experiments, but I recently deposited a check for an order of
magnitude more than my usual deposit, and was asked to confirm an extra time
before the transaction was completed.  I thought that this was a very sensible
precaution.

In a related vein: When I first got my ATM card it was limited to $200/day of
cash withdrawal, which is not unreasonable.  However, after a decade of modest
inflation, there were times (like just before trips) when a larger sum would
have been convenient.  One day it occurred to me to try to withdraw more, and
what do you know?  It disbursed $300 without complaint.  So my trips to the ATM
became less frequent.  Some time later, I noticed that years of carrying the
card in my wallet had cracked it, right across the magnetic stripe.  So I asked
for a new one.  Now I'm limited to $200/day again.  I infer that it was a fault
on the stripe that let me withdraw more.  I would have hoped that the limit was
enforced by something less subject to decay and/or tampering.

Just to clarify one thing:

&gt;&gt;If you're running a BBS that's supporting a group of system crackers, you are,
&gt;&gt;at least, contributory to felony crimes... 

&gt;The problem was that SJG *was* clean, as far as I know -- the Secret
&gt;Service just went overboard in their search for "contamination".  I
&gt;believe guilt-by-association is not a tenable legal theory in the US.

A couple of people have taken my comment above  as implying I think
that SJG was running a cracker board. Not true. From everything I've
heard they are definitely in the "innocent bystander" category. Why
haven't they got their stuff back? Very good question. All I"m hearing
on my side is variations of "it ain't over until it's over" -- which to
me sounds silly based on what I know.

I am definitely NOT trying to justify the impounding of SJG stuff, nor
attempting to imply guilt or anything else at them. I was simply pointing
out that the situation was more complex than some were making it out to be.
The Secret Service seems to have good cause to talk to SJG about this stuff?
Yes? Did they need to go in and grab all the gear? From what I know, no --
but I don't know all the details of the case. The details I do know indicate
they over-reacted, however.

Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's a Catch 22 here.

The evidence suggests that I can be arrested based on the contents/usage of my
BBS, even when I'm unaware of that usage.  (It remains to be seen whether I can
be convicted, but frankly, if my equipment gets confiscated for a couple years,
I hardly care.)

However, it seems to me that the Electronic Privacy Act prevents me from taking
any actions which would let me prevent the misuse of my board.  Namely, I can't
read people's mail/files to see if they are doing something illegal.

Is this really the case?

 By law?  Why?  We don't hold a package delivery service like UPS liable

if they happen to deliver burglary tools; why is the owner/operator of a
BBS treated differently for what seems to me an equivalent offense?
 Von Rospach goes on to say:
 
  A BBS that's on the up-and-up should have no worries, though.
 
 That seems to be the central issue; it shouldn't be tossed off so casually.
The Bill of Rights is predicated on the assumption that the innocent have a
legitimate reason to worry about the effects of actions taken by their
government; governments to that point (and since) had not been terribly
worried about who got chewed up by the wheels of justice, so long as some
"guilty" party was convicted.  Human nature has not changed much in the
intervening years--there are still those who hold to the creed of "Kill 'em
all; let God sort them out".  We the innocent still need protection from
those who would elevate expedience over justice; if ease of implementation
and administration becomes the primary criterion by which we judge our laws,
we are in deep trouble.
 I have noticed a disturbing trend in society, towards a belief that it is
better that 100 innocents should suffer than one guilty critter should go
free; it is difficult to reconcile this notion with that of "innocent until
proven guilty".

By now, most readers of moderated newsgroups on the internet have had
the pleasure of reading the semi-literate ramblings of "THE BIFFSTER".
As best I can tell, the following has been shown by this exercise:

1) Moderated newsgroups are not particularly secure (did anyone think
   otherwise?).

2) You can make something foolproof, but you can't make it damn
   foolproof.

3) The perpetrator may have reached a new world record in the irr/eff
   ratio (irr = number of people irritated, eff = effort expended).

4) Gone forever are the days when breakins were conducted by individuals
   with above-average intelligence and sense of humor (remember

The following is excerpted from a UPI newswire story:

	   BOSTON (UPI) -- Tens of thousands of illegally uninsured drivers in
   Massachusetts will be tracked down and hunted when the Registry of Motor
   Vehicles implements a new computer-based system beginning Friday [6/1/90].
	   The new system, which allows insurance companies to electronically
   send the Registry's computer a list of uninsured motorists whose
   policies have been revoked for nonpayment, aims at cracking down on the
   estimated 300,000 Massachusetts drivers who take to the roads without
   insurance.
	   ``Hopefully with automation, deadbeats who don't have the money or
   those who try to beat they system won't be on the road,'' said Robert
   Hutchinson, Massachusetts registrar of motor vehicles.
	   Police will pursue those individuals who fail to obtain insurance
   after being discovered.
	[Generic filler about the costs of uninsured motorists - sky-high -
   and the hope that the computer will do what the people are unable to do:
   keep up with the workload.]

The significance of this is that there is a new law in MA: get caught
driving without insurance and the cops can take away your license plates on
the spot.  You then get to call a tow truck, since you can't drive without
plates.  Get caught driving without plates and you get to call a cab, since
the cops can have your car towed on the spot.

The problem is that insurance companies in this state are notoriously slow
in processing paperwork.  That's a major reason why so many uninsured
motorists get away with it; the paperwork just hasn't caught up with them.

The companies take this long with *all* their paperwork.  My company took four
months to send me a reinstatement notice after they (erroneously) suspended my
insurance for not having the car inspected (though they continued to bill me
every month).  I shudder to think what would have happened had I been stopped
during those four months...

The following is by definition going into the Public Domain. (If RISKS
posts it.)  If that costs me any chance to make a fortune from AT&amp;T,
maybe it also raises the possibility that the solution will come sooner.

Problem: Some of us want to know "who is calling."
         BUT some of us don't want others to know when WE call.

Solution: Put the smarts for "who are you?" and "none of your business"
          [or, "I'm 555-1234"] in the handsets, at each end, 
          NOT in the switch [or switches, for long distance calls].

Old handsets would automatically neither request caller ID, nor give it.
Folks who want to know would buy new handsets; when they get calls from
old handsets, the reply to the "who are you?" query would be, "service
not available" [as opposed to "none of your business"].  Yes, a smart
switch would have to provide that, probably after a time-out of sorts;
and yes, that could be spoofed.  Nothing is perfect.
(But wait.  Could even an old handset, touchtone or rotary, reply manually
to a ring, while the line was open?  That is, I call you, and you want to
know who I am; your query is forwarded to my old handset as a ring; to send
you my number, I dial it; the intermediate switch aborts the call, with an
appropriate message to you, if it detects my attempt to falsify my ID.)

It is then up to the callee to accept or decline the incoming call; and,
it is up to the caller to risk losing the connection.  That effectively
takes the decisions out of the hands of big brother, and puts them back
with us, where they belong.

In every PBX I have ever dealt with, there have been foulups of some sort when
dealing with new telephone prefixes and area codes.  In one memorable case, I
was trying to straighten out a problem with my mortgage, and the person at the
bank never, ever, returned my calls.  I was about ready to call in the bank
regulators.  After leaving quite a few tartly worded messages, I finally
managed to get her on the phone, and discovered that every time she called me,
she'd gotten an error recording of some sort and had assumed that the number
she had was wrong or my phone was out of order.  In fact, I had just started
to work at a job with a new PBX with a new set of DID numbers in a new prefix,
and the PBX at the bank hadn't heard about my prefix yet.  I told her to dial
9-0 and ask the telco operator to place the call in the future.

Even PBXes with class of service restrictions frequently get it wrong.  At one
place where I consult they forbid international dialing for most lines except
for some speed dial codes programmed into the PBX.  At least, they think they
do.  If I dial 011-code-number, I get a fast busy from the PBX.  If I dial
01-code-number and make it person to person, it works.  If I dial
10288-011-code-number or 10222-011-code number or 10333-code-number, it works.
(If only I had some friends in foreign countries to call.)

The local telco has a newsletter that they send out to advise PBX customers of
new prefixes, upgrades to CO equipment (which always cause some problems since
if nothing else, call progress sounds and the timing of calls change.)  There
are a lot of changes.  As far as I can tell, every PBX that does least cost
routing needs to know all of the prefixes in its local area code, and in most
cases the updates are typed in by hand using some decidedly user hostile
interfaces.  If anything, I'm surprised that they get them right as often as
they do.  In many cases, I suspect that the PBX manager only updates the
prefix table when somebody complains.

Telephone calls are routed by what is in effect a tremendous distributed data
base that maps numbers to trunks and routes.  At least near the fringes, the
data base is usually updated by methods that to me at least seem laughably
obsolete.

Well, I rushed out and bought GURPS Cyberpunk, in the hopes that my
money will help SJG with legal fees.  (Plus, I collect game stuff.)

On the front cover, in the SJG Illuminatus logo, it says:
"The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service! (see p. 4)"

Anyway...
(Assuming I know *nothing* about cracking/phreaking.  I won't comment
on my real knowledge.)  The following is a summary of text from the
GURPS Cyberpunk supplement, with a few direct quotes.

How Much Hacking Can I Do Based on the C-word manual:
(From the section entitled "Netrunning".)

0.  People use handles to hide their real identity (p62).

1.  You can uses sensitive devices to listen in on the signals being
sent to a computer monitor, and redisplay the image on your own screen
(p62).

2.  General info on ISDN.  (p64-64)

3.  Computer accounts can come in various levels, from specialty logins
(uucp) to "superuser" who has access to everything.  Some programs can
give you a higher level of access, equivalent to a "better" account (p68).

4.  General info on back doors (p69).

5.  General info on chat systems (p69).

6.  A list of network names from around the world.  No clues as to which
are real.  For the US, the following are listed:
WUT, UDTS 2, Datel I &amp; II, Telenet, Tymnet, ARPAnet, Infomaster, GraphNet,
TRT, FTCC, UniNet, Autonet, CompuServer, GENIE, AlaskaNet, JANET, Internet
(p 71).

7.  Passwords can be really obvious, or hard to remember random text strings
(p 72.)

8.  A program could possibly cause physical damage (p 72.)

9.  General Phreaking Info:
-  Diverters:  go through a bunch of systems so that tracing takes
a long time;
-  Junction Boxing:  Just go down to the local junction box and tie in
(p 76).

10.  Lots of networks use different protocols that are sometimes
incompatible (p 77).

11.  Ma Bell stuff:
-  Existence of CN/A, and that Ma Bell can look you up in any way;
-  Line Routing: "With access to the main phone switch computer,
a hacker can control everything about a specific phone line.";
-  Monitoring: a person could monitor calls with the right access;
-  After Billing:  A person could change bills;
(p 82).

12.  Trashing:  Go through somebody's trash to find out all sorts
of interesting info about their computing equipment (p 86,87).
(13 and 14 are from the section "Attack and Defense Programs".  The
programs are obviously s-f software, but...):

13.  Promote:  "This program is executed from a normal user account on a
system.  If successful, the account is 'upgraded' to a superuser account."

14.  Webster: "This is the standard icebreaker for use against Password
programs (see p 93.).  It acts as an extremely fast 'brute-force' hacker."
(p 92).

15. Credcard Crime:  A false balance could be entered in an account.
A device could be used to access somebody else's card without having
the correct password to get into the credcard (p 105).  [note:  a credcard

 &gt; From an Infoworld article on Word Perfect ("Leader of the Pack,"
 &gt; pp. 45-6, May 23, 1990):
 &gt; 
 &gt; "When [Word Perfect] 5.0 shipped in May 1988, the company underestimated
 &gt; the demand for telephone support.  Although it bought additional phone
 &gt; lines, traffic was so heavy that calls to the support department brought
 &gt; down the toll-free systems for the state of Utah, including phone systems
 &gt; for American Express, Delta Airlines, and the Latter Day Saints Church."

This reminds me of something that happened in my own neck of the woods.

One night I was watching a program on channel 35 when a message flashed on the
screen.  The message said that the Xth caller would win concert tickets or some
such.  Since the phone was right beside me, I decided what the hey, and picked
up the phone to call.  I didn't get a dial tone for the long time.  Odd.
Finally I heard the tone and dialed the number.  I waited.  And waited.  And
waited.  No connection, no ringing, no click, nothing.

Thinking I'd misdialed somehow, I depressed the switchhook to try again.  I
waited for the dial tone.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited!  Suddenly it
occurred to me, the number began with 358-...  my exchange, augh.  Apparently
the massive influx of calls to the TV station completely hosed whatever gateway
there was for my exchange, so I couldn't get a call in edgewise.  (Does this
sound right to you folks who know something about the phone system?)

Whatever the reason, I'm glad the house wasn't on fire. :-/

  [ the following is extracted/translated from the Swiss press agency ELSA ]

   Lausanne, June 2 (sda)  Police may not keep any unimportant data captured
on a fiche or file for longer than five years on any person.  Disrespecting
this rule shall be considered contrary to the constitutional right of personal
freedom and the right of a person to respect of privacy. This basic ruling
was published on Saturday by the Swiss Supreme Court.

[ Re:  unimportant;  don't ask me.  no further explanation was given.]
[ Re: fiche or file; the German words used were "Fiche oder Dossier".
      I think that they could better have used an expression like "any form
      of information storage" - and I assume that using more than one word
      indicates the intended meaning of "any" rather than limiting the appli-
      cability of the law - but naming just these 2 forms of data storage
      may, no doubt, lead to some lawyer to bicker over this "detail".]

I have read Les Earnest's contributions on U.S. experience with interest.

In 1970 I found myself employed on Linesman, a massive UK military command and
control system. A year later I moved to a nearby university and ended up
assessing Master's degree dissertations carried out by "students" working on
Linesman.

At the time the project was in deep trouble - in that questions were being
asked in Parliament because it was clear that things were going wrong. The
basic problem was that there was no comprehension of sunk costs. The cheapest,
common sense option of scraping the tons of equipment that had become obsolete
before it was ever used was politically unacceptable to the Ministry of
Defence. To do this they would have to admit their incompetent management of
the project. Perhaps they could escape by throwing even more money to try and
buy their way out of the trouble they had got themselves into.

The civilian contractors were paid on a costs plus basis - and the more money
the MOD threw at the project the better. In fact they could make even more by
cutting back on secretarial staff and getting expensive professional staff to
collate the tons of documents the project "required".

Another problem was excessive secrecy - and the "need to know" attitude. For
instance, at one time the application design team wanted to know the typical
number of Russion bear bombers flying off-shore at any one time. That's too
secret to tell you can the reply - until the figure was given on a BBC TV
program, having been cleared for public release by a different arm of the Royal
Air Force! In fact asking questions was taboo. As a mere minion you did what
you were told and no more. I was considered a maverick because I pointed out
that the throughput of a particular device would be an order of magnitude less
than the design document required. (The design had been based on the maximum
hardware timings theoretically possible - and implicitly assumed, for example,
that a human could respond to a twin light signal by pressing a heavy duty key
in less time than it would take for the filiment in the bulb to cool
sufficiently to be visually detectable.) On another occasion I pointed out that
programming and systems staff were repeating earlier errors because the results
of assessment trials were considered too sensitive to tell them where they had
gone wrong. (For this impudence I was was denied an annual increment!)

The effect of the quality of staff was interesting. The salaries paid were
above the odds - after all the MOD were desperate and the civilian contractors
got a percentage.  People being interviewed were not give a fair picture for
fear of putting them off. (No one ever though to tell me that I was being
interviewed to work on a military project!)

Good staff (and those with a professional concience) quickly realised that they
had made a mistake and moved on. This left a residue of unimaginative plodders
who couldn't possibly get a better paid job elsewhere, and mecinaries who would
do anything for money. This was particularly obvious in their project work at
the nearby university, when it was clear that working on the project was
teaching them bad obsolete techniques and a belief that staff didn't need to
know anything outside their immediate work environment.

But this isn't the end of the affair. When one military project ends the team
of out-of-date and inward-looking programmers and systems analysts is not
disbanded. Other military projects are out to tender, and the civilian
contractor has a ready made team of staff who have security clearance and know
how to work to military specifications ....

Of course my experience is now nearly twenty years out of date - but I still
meet people who say that there has been little change.

The April 30 issue of Aviation Week has a couple of interesting small
items about computerized airliners and "glass cockpits".

The first is a news item:  Airbus Industrie is considering alterations
to the A320's flight software to help guard against "overconfidence
syndrome", which they consider a significant factor in the Habsheim
and Bangalore crashes.  One possible change is upgrading the automatic
throttle management of the "alpha floor" protection mode to guard
against descents with inadequate thrust.  "Alpha floor" already runs
the throttles up automatically in emergencies like encounters with
serious windshear or maneuvers to avoid collisions.  Says Bernard
Ziegler (Airbus VP Engineering):  "The alpha floor was never designed
to save a crew that had been improperly managing a normal approach,
but we now are thinking of modifying it to serve as one more safeguard.
Such a modification will not make it a 100% safeguard, but it could
offer an additional safety margin."

The second is a background piece on the poor state of research in glass-cockpit
human factors (for example, NASA Ames, a major center of work on such things,
has no simulator representative of modern cockpits).  Hart A. Langer (United
Airlines VP flight operations) says that flight-management-system CRTs act as
"cockpit vacuum cleaners -- they suck eyeballs and fingertips right into them.
I have given check rides on these aircraft and seen four eyeballs and ten
fingertips caught in two [displays] at the same time.  This is bad enough at
cruise altitude, but it can be lethal in the low-altitude terminal area..."

In Risks-10.02 Pete Mellor inadvertently gives us a good example of the risks
of muddy thinking.

Writing of a translated article, he recommends it to us on several ground,
one of which is

&gt; b) the fact that it presents a French (and therefore not negatively biased?)
&gt;    view,

The two problems with this are, first, Airbus is not exclusively a French
aeroplane.  It is a joint venture between several European countries.

Secondly, there has been quite a lot of negative comment about Airbus from
French sources, mainly from pilots' unions.

The risk here is that of giving one source extra credence on specious grounds.

This week's Flight International reports:

"British Airways (BA) Boeing 747-400s have experienced uncommanded inflight
closure of all four throttles on six separate flights between 6 October 1989
and 19 February 1990, 'several times' on one of those flights alone, according
to formal reports. Several other airlines have suffered the same incident,
Northwest reporting it first. ...

In most of the events the power levers retarded rapidly to idle, but
sometimes the reduction was partial, followed by automatic reset. ...

All incidents have occurred in the climb or cruise, and an IAS of more than
280 Knots is believed to be fundamental to the event. ...

Evidence indicates that the event is caused by a spurious signal to the
full authority digital engine control from the stall-management module. The
'single-word' spurious command says that the undercarriage [gear] is down or
the flaps are at setting 1, so if the IAS exceeds the maximum speed for these
configurations, the autothrottles close to reduce IAS to limiting speed, then
reset to maintain it.

The modification [to correct the problem - issued on February 22nd] assumes
that the fault was in the processing logic of the appropriate universal logic
card (a printed-circuit software unit [sic]) and adopts a standard technique
for reducing digital oversensitivity: there is now a delay (a few miroseconds)
built into the software by requiring it to receive an 'eight-word' command
before acting. Power spikes of other spurious commands should not produce a
reaction.

So far the latest modification has proved effective. Early corrections, though,
had assumed the reaction was associated only with main-gear selection, so
although software changes had reduced the incident rate, spurious flap signals
continued to set engines to idle. BA has not reported any further events since
February."

[end of quote]

This looks like a useful warning of inability to get complex systems right -
luckily it only occured at high IAS and was sub-critical for flight safety.  I
hope that appropriate lessons are learnt by both developers and certification
authorities, and that they start to question their ability to assure the safety
of such systems.

Notice that the partial fix, reported in the last paragraph, implies that the
Flight Data Recorder either was not used to diagnose the fault, or contained
insufficient information to point the finger at both the gear and flap signals.
This seems ominous for future accident cause analysis. The apparent action of
fixing symptoms until no further errors are reported, rather than analysing the
cause and then looking for all possible classes of the same error, seems
ill-judged, too.

I wonder what re-certification was undertaken following the modification.

Henry Spencer wonders if the failure of the pilot who had problems
with the `glass cockpit' to come forth means that something more
was going on than meets the eye.

It's possible, of course, but if the UK Civil Aviation Authority
is anything like the FAA, I'm not surprised the pilot is keeping
quiet.  It's rather amazing how nasty the FAA can be if it
decides to go after someone.

&gt;Some little while ago, Risks published the report of a flight crew landing an
&gt;airliner in Britain after a very difficult time with wind readings of 100+
...
&gt;problem are hamstrung, doubts are cast on the accuracy of the report, and if it
&gt;*is* factual, that aircraft is still in service and potentially a lethal hazard
&gt;to crews and passengers.

They aren't the only ones. Here is an excerpt from "Tales from the TRACON: a
controller's view of emergencies" in June 1990 "IFR" 6(6).  Belvoir
Publications, 75 Holly Hill Lane, Greenwich, CT 06836 (all typos mine):

	It's frequently the same for controllers. We're sometimes
	reluctant to take any action that invites scrutiny of our
	routine work. An experience I had last year shows what can
	happen. During one shift on a typical hectic IFR day in the
	TRACON, my frequency died three times.  Technicians reviewed
	the problem, only to find the "bad" frequency had started
	working again. After three such outages (with no repairs) I
	filed an unsatisfactory condition report (UCR) which goes
	straight to Washington and requires an answer to the complaint
	in writing.  Not surprisingly, facility managers aren't too
	fond of UCRs.

	When my complaint was checked out, my tapes were "dumped"
	(supposedly to discover whether the outage reqallly happened)
	on *every* position and frequency I had worked that day, not
	just the "bad" frequency. The tapes showed that I had really
	had a problem.  But in the process, management had my
	supervisor "counsel" me for bad phraseology and improper land
	line usage. The experience hardly encourages one to draw
	attention to malfunctions or emergencies.

A few days ago I posted to rec.aviation a white paper by an ARTCC controller
detailing how certain kinds of targets could be eliminated from the
controller's scope by the computer, roughly because it didn't like the targets.
Washington's response to his UCR was that they didn't see a problem.

&gt;The chance of GURPS Cyperpunk being used as a manual for computer crime is very
&gt;slight indeed.

I don't see where this is relevant.  Its perfectly legal to buy books on how
to make illegal stuff like explosives, check out the warnings section(s) in
college chemistry books, not to mention stuff like The Poor Mans James Bond.
There are some very good cookbooks on committing murder (see the mystery section
of Waldenbooks).  Should we have thrown Agatha Christi in the slammer?  So what
would make it illegal to give even a step by step list of instructions for
breaking into a computer?

It seems to me that the act of commiting a crime is illegal, but the knowledge
of how to commit that crime isn't.  I think we can all figure out on our own
how to stick a gun into a cashiers face to get money, but we haven't done
anything wrong until we actually do it.  Nor have I done anything wrong by
offering a suggestion on improving your monthly income :-) Of course, if I
suspect that you did use my suggestion then by not finking on you I am breaking
the law.

It is a general problem that NYNEX has not been automatically distributing
routing updates to people who own their own switches.  This is one of the
things that NYNEX does to discourage companies from owning their own switches
and encourage them to use Centrex.

The law enforcment community in FL is upset over Bell South's plan to offer
Caller ID without subscriber blocking. While the telco has offered blocking to
law enforcement officers, and a few select others, they are still worried
because:

	1. The utility will need to have a list of all those
	eligible, including undercover officers.

	2. The fact the CID is blocked is a sure pointer that
	the caller is a cop, sure death to an informant.

I soon thought of a third. The blocking is done in the terminating CO.  What
happens if the expected block fails, for whatever reason? There is no feedback
to the caller that such has happened.

Given the level of violence within the general population around here, the CID
block seems to made a classic RISKS mistake. A system designed for less
critical use has been thrust beyond its design parameters into a life-dependent
role. This strikes me as no different than using unproven software for
designing bridges or buildings.

<A HREF="/Risks/10.02.html">RISKS-10.02</A> when the system automatically rebooted.  This is of course Standard
Sendmail Problem Number 1.  (Unfortunately the log tapes do not explain the
crash!)  This problem reinforces the need for a more robust algorithm that more
often deletes nonNACKed sendings periodically from the queue during the first
pass over the long list, rather than waiting (hopefully) for the end of the
list.  Private hacks of sendmail exist to do that, but each privately hacked
version of sendmail seems to introduce its own set of new problems or else does
not provide the services of other hacked versions.  At any rate, mailing to
very large lists remains a tricky business.

Ironically, I had just prepared a bunch of slides for the talk on my COMPASS
paper at the end of the month, The Risk of the Year: Distributed Control, which
(among other things) relates the 15 Jan 90 AT&amp;T problem to the 1980 ARPANET
collapse, and throws in a section on sendmail woes for good measure.

	The following appeared in an article by Tim Considine in the June 4,
1990 issue of Autoweek. It concerned the use of a new computerized scoring
system manufactured by Dorian Industries, an Autralian electronics firm for use
in the recent Indianapolis 500 race.

	"Data-1, as the system is known is arguably the most advanced and
	foolproof scoring system in the world. Well almost foolproof." [...]

	"...all monitors went blank on Lap 130 of the race.
	  The cause of such a catastrophe: A laser printer ran out of paper
	and the system froze. A simple problem, but one that hadn't been
	simulated during testing.
	  However, while the monitors were blank, Data-1's computer kept
	collecting scoring and timing information, even though those in
	the tower couldn't gain access to it for a while.
	  Thus the last third of the Indianapolis 500 ended up being scored
	by 33 people with clipboards - the system used for the last nine years
	anyway and which USAC director of scoring and timing Art Graham
	had the foresight to retain as backup."

[ All was not lost though...the computer eventually saved the day :-) ...]

	  "Ironically, a mistake was made. In provisional results released
	immediately after the race, Eddie Cheever was seventh and Scott
	Brayton eight. But a half-hour later, the positions were reversed
	when Data-1's complete scoring data was fed back into the computer and
	the error was found and corrected - Brayton hadn't been credited with
	a lap he'd completed.
	  And not only had the new technology proven itself, but for the
	first time in memory, Graham and his crew finished in time for dinner."

On June 4, 1990, Soviet premier Gorbachev told a Stanford audience that the
cold war was behind us.  On the same day, Stanford computer manager Clifford
Johnson filed his appeal brief in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco, case 90-15276, arguing that he had "standing" to sue General Chain,
the Commander-In-Chief of the Strategic Air Command, to reduce the risk of
accidental launch of Minuteman and MX missiles.

The appeal is from a District Court dismissal of the lawsuit Johnson v. Chain,
et al., case C-89-20265-SW, filed May 1, 1989.  The suit challenges "standing
orders" that assure the immediate launch of Minuteman and MX missiles, at all
times.  Missile launch crews and their commanders are on perpetual alert, at
DEFCON (DEFense CONdition code) 4, instead of the peacetime level of DEFCON 5.
Johnson contends that this nuclear alert gives rise an ongoing risk of
accidental nuclear launch due to computer-related error, a charge endorsed by
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.

Ultimately, Johnson seeks a declaration that the standing orders are illegal
under constitutional, statutory, and international law, as follows:
    (a) in peacetime, based on Congress' required power to declare
        war, and on prohibitions against jeopardizing the peace;
    (b) prior to an actual first nuclear use and without express
        congressional authorization, based on the required power
        of Congress to qualitatively expand war, and on prohibitions
        against disproportionate response;
    (c) at any time, on grounds that they surrender to computers
        all-important war powers, and so constitute an unrepublican
        form of government; and
    (d) at any time, as they require subdelegation to military
        commanders of the decision to launch a nuclear strike,
        which is barred by the Atomic Energy Act and by the
        republican principle of the civilian supremacy.

Taking as true all the factual allegations of risk, the trial court dismissed
the action on the ground that Johnson lacked "standing" to sue the government.
The issues raised in the brief are as follows:

                   THE ISSUES ON APPEAL

    GIVEN present and continuing computer-related risks of
    sudden accidental death to millions, and to the Plaintiff in
    particular, due to the Defendants' standing orders re the
    launch of nuclear missiles;

    WHERE said standing orders are challenged as inherently
    reckless and in excess of authority under constitutional,
    statutory, treaty, and international law;

    WHETHER, under Article III of the Constitution, the
    Plaintiff has standing to sue Defendants, either in their
    official capacities or as individuals, on the grounds that
    Defendants' conduct:

    1.  immediately endangers Plaintiff's life, and diminishes
    its daily quality, without due process, in violation of
    Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; and/or

    2.  is heedless of the dictate of the public conscience
    and/or constitutes a crime against the peace, which
    Plaintiff is specially qualified to complain of, so that his
    standing is assured, respectively, by the Martens clause of
    the Hague Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War
    on Land (1907) 36 Stat. 2277 and/or by Article 6(a) of the
    Treaty of London (1945) 59 Stat 1544; and/or

    3.  delegates to error-prone, computer-governed military
    drills ultimate political judgments, imposing upon the
    Plaintiff a here-and-now subservience to unrepublican
    government, in violation of Article IV z 4 of the
    Constitution.

The brief is 50-pages long, and dense with footnotes.  It claims that the
immediate threat of harm, imposed without due process, is an injury sufficient
for standing, even though it is "pervasively shared."  It also argues that
Johnson's injury is particular, in that he works close to a top-priority
target, namely, Sunnyvale's Satellite Control Facility, and in that, as a
British citizen, he has no remedy through the ballot box.  Besides, as an
expert on the relevant technology, he has standing to complain of crimes
against the peace under international law, even if he himself were not injured.
Finally, the case is novel in asserting that the de facto delegation of
political decisions to computers amounts to unrepublican government, and is
actionable.

The government has thirty days in which to respond.

For reasons known only to them, the folks who run the MILNET/Arpanet gateways
decided to sever the connections at about 9:00am Monday, and reconnect them at
about 4:00pm Tuesday (both times PDT).  Naturally, they gave no advance (or
following) notice of these actions.  (At least, neither our users nor our
system administrators received such notice...)

It is unfortunate that the gateway administrators act with such
apparent disregard for the users and such apparent capriciousness.

		   About the A320'S ATTACKS OF NERVES

Mr. Bertrand Bonneau (the translator to English) did a terrific job of
translation, given his knowledge of the subject area.  Too bad that the
original writer is not more knowledgeable of aviation.

For example, I was very surprised by the total absence of any reference
to the B767/B767 with their glass cockpits and computers.

The main point of this article is that the procedures were bad, and that
the French FAA was conducting the investigation rather than the French
Department of Justice.  Even if the French judges are only ten times
technically-smarter than ours and if the French-FAA is only ten times
more corrupted than ours, I'd still rather see their FAA, not their DoJ
conduct the investigation.

The article asks (in the sub-headline): "How could the willingness to
declare the pilots responsible for major accidents, EVEN BEFORE THE
JUDGES HAVE RETURNED THEIR VERDICT, appear other than suspect?"  Sure
sounds like a good question.  Well, in the US the NTSB (and the FAA)
typically have "probable cause" within a day, even though investigations
take many months or even years.  Is it suspect, too?

For example, the Aloha B737 experienced an explosive decompression on
28-Apr-88, and the NTSB report about it was submitted only on Jun-14-89,
nearly 14 months later.  However, within a day or two after accident
everyone was told what happened.  Was this suspect, too?  Neither Boeing
nor RISKS complained about it.  I couldn't find the contribution in RISKS
saying that:
		How could the willingness to declare the
		aircraft responsible for this accidents,
		even before the judges have returned
		their verdict, appear other than suspect?

Another example, closer to our hearts: the article says "For example,
the software in the flight warning computer [FWC] included a fault which
a good computer scientist could have repaired without a doubt".

I take it to imply that this shows that because of "*Industrial
Secrets*" (which cover the software) the operating airlines could not
use any "good computer scientist" to simply go ahead and fix that fault.
If this is the case -- how about all the regression testing that ANY
change in operational flight software must go through?  who would be
responsible for the modified code? etc., etc.

To sum it up: opinionated reporting may leave something to be desired.

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.04.html">RISKS-10.04</A>, livesey@Eng.Sun.COM criticises my recommendation of the
Aeronautique article, as follows:

&gt; Writing of a translated article, he recommends it to us on several ground,
&gt; one of which is
&gt;
&gt;&gt; b) the fact that it presents a French (and therefore not negatively biased?)
&gt;&gt;    view,
&gt;
&gt; The two problems with this are, first, Airbus is not exclusively a French
&gt; aeroplane.  It is a joint venture between several European countries.
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, there has been quite a lot of negative comment about Airbus from
&gt; French sources, mainly from pilots' unions.

Quite correct on both counts! The umbrella company, Airbus Industrie, is,
however, based in France, and the company responsible for the EFCS, at which
much of the criticism has been levelled, is Aerospatiale, also French. The
representatives of these companies have made extravagant claims for the safety
and reliability of the A320 EFCS in TV interviews (see quotes from the Equinox
programme on fly-by-wire in <A HREF="/Risks/9.42.html">RISKS-9.42</A>). I am very well aware of some of the
criticisms from French sources, but when I wrote the above, I was thinking of
this fairly vociferous defence of the FBW concept in general, and A320 in 
particular.

(On the other hand, criticism emanating from the vicinity of Boeing, for 
example, *might* be expected to be a little bit biased. :-)

&gt; The risk here is that of giving one source extra credence on specious grounds.

Yes, it is only one source, but *did* seem to be fairly well informed. If any
RISKS or Aeronatics digest readers can fault the article technically, I would
be very glad to hear from them.

One thing in my recommendation which *was* misleading was my carelessly worded
statement that the author had drawn some fascinating conclusions about the
cause of the Mulhouse-Habsheim accident. He had not, of course. He merely
raised a few fascinating questions.

Other than that, please judge for yourselves, and read again my disclaimer :-).

	BOSTON (UPI) -- Tens of thousands of illegally uninsured drivers in
Massachusetts will be tracked down and hunted when the Registry of Motor
Vehicles implements a new computer-based system beginning Friday.
	The new system, which allows insurance companies to electronically
send the Registry's computer a list of uninsured motorists whose
policies have been revoked for nonpayment, aims at cracking down on the
estimated 300,000 Massachusetts drivers who take to the roads without
insurance.  [...] Police will pursue those individuals who fail to obtain o
insurance after being discovered.

Reprinted from the June 3rd 1990 Seattle Times:

"Computer-data program to link student with prospective boss"
Newhouse News Service
Lawrence Township, N.J.

Imagine if an employer could find out how many times a prospective employee
had been late for school, or if a business could tap into a pool of high school
graduates and find the model employee.

Those are among the possible uses of an information system being developed by
the Educational Testing Services, the nonprofit institution that administers the
college entrance exams.

Called Worklink, the program is designed to connect education and business by
gathering information from student records and providing it to employers
through a computer data bank.

The idea, according to George Elford of ETS, is to improve the work force by
motivating students, particularly those who might lack the contacts to land a
good job.

Ideally, cost for the program would be shared by schools and businesses - not
the students.  Elford says, since it aims to help students who lack traditional
means of "getting a foot in the door".

"Because the advantages of social networks and family influences are reduced
with Worklink, the socially disadvantaged will gain real benefits," Elford
says.

"Students will be competing on their record, not on their ability to create an
impressive resume.  And because the data bank will include teacher ratings,
letters of recommendation and previous work experience, Wordlink will avoid
the problems of standardized tests that often compare the disadvantaged with
the advantaged."

Under the voluntary program, everything from prose reading and document reading
to punctuality would be assessed and, subject to student approval, entered into
the student's record.  Such control would be exercised in order to build on an
individual's strengths, says Elford.

The absence of criteria like punctuality might be noticed, however, just as
vital information omitted from a resume would be, he adds.

If the system is successful, says Elford, it would provide an incentive for
apathetic students to do well.

"Worklink, when widely used by employers, is likely to motivate students to
develop and demonstrate their proficiency in a number of areas," he says.
"This increased motivation is likely to lead students to view teachers and
class work as a means to help them build a strong record.  Now, kids (who are
not applying to colleges) know nobody cares what they're doing in high school,
so why work hard? ... Hopefully this would serve as an incentive."

While the reward for the student would be a good job, employers would benefit
by having a competent work force at their fingertips.

Pilot projects for Worklink will be launched in Tampa, Fla., and Spokane, Wa.
this fall if business leaders in those communities agree to cooperate, says
Elford.

It will be at least a couple of years before the results of the pilot are
known, but Elford hopes Worklink will eventually catch on throughout the
country.

"I'd like to see this kind of record system used in most localities in 10
years," he says.  "Our hope is this will raise the whole level of attainment
in schools and in the workplace."

[Now let's see... ETS's standardized tests are no good, so they want to add
an even MORE intrusive system.  Is it just me, or does anyone else have a
problem with this?]

From: David Lesher &lt;wb8foz@mthvax.cs.miami.edu&gt;
&gt; Given the level of violence within the general population around
&gt; here, the CID block seems to made a classic RISKS mistake. A system
&gt; designed for less critical use has been thrust beyond its design
&gt; parameters into a life-dependent role.

   I think you are misplacing the blame.  Anyone who chooses to have
their life depend on call blocking deserves what they get.  (As you
point out, the call blocking isn't useful for those trying to conceal
their law-enforcement relationship in any case.)
   If you walk up to my door and knock, I can find out who you are (by taking a
photograph through my peephole).  So logically police informants don't expect
to be able to walk up to doors anonymously.  Neither should they expect to be
able to enter homes via telephone anonymously.

&gt;        It turns out, that as a "client," MIT doesn't get automatic updates

&gt;clue how to bill the caller, or even if it should let the caller make the call.
&gt;So it assumes the worst case, and disallows anyone from making the call.  The
&gt;switch had to be manually programmed with the necessary information about the
&gt;new exchange.

This problem is not restricted to organizations which run their own switch,
or those with an ESS.  There are *lots* of plain ordinary PBX's in this
divested world which have automatic "route selection" to decide whether to
send that outbound call over normal or WATS circuits, and in my experience
these often don't get updated with new exchange codes, so calls simply
cannot be made in the absence of routing information.  In at least one
of these cases the PBX was one maintained by AT&amp;T, which apparently did
not have good communications with its former child, New England Telephone.

But wait, there's more...

I had a problem when I first got a cellular phone (as soon as they were
offered in Boston).  Well, there was the aforementioned problem that PBX's
had not been loaded with information about the new cellular exchange codes.
But also, I found that I could not forward calls from a residential phone
to the new exchange.  Sure enough, the ESS run by New England Telephone
had not been updated with information on how to forward to exchanges run by
a "different" company, NYNEX Mobile Communications (both companies are owned
by NYNEX).

In Risks 10.03, nazgul@alphalpha.com (Kee Hinckley) poses some questions on
handling private mail on BBSes that deal with illegal activities (the messages
that is, not the BBSes in general).

It is true that as a Sysop, you can't legally read private mail to others.  The
loophole is you can read public mail.  What many BBSes here in the Washington
area do is (1) prohibit private mail, except to and from the Sysop or (2) put up
up a public notice announcing there is no private mail on the BBS, only
public and semi-private, and the Sysop reserves the right to inspect (read)
all messages. Should a prospective used not be willing to abide by either (1)
or (2), they need not use the BBS.

&gt;...suggests that I can be arrested based on the contents/usage of my
&gt;BBS, even when I'm unaware of that usage...
&gt;...it seems to me that the Electronic Privacy Act prevents me from taking
&gt;any actions which would let me prevent the misuse of my board...

The real problem here is that the courts are still fumbling with the question
of whether electronic media are publishers or common carriers.

A publisher, e.g. of a newspaper, is very definitely responsible for what he
prints, and cannot claim innocence just because he wasn't paying attention to
what the reporters were writing that day.  A common carrier, e.g. the phone
company, merely provides communication services and bears no responsibility for
the content of messages.  Most electronic media fall in a vast gray area in
between, and nobody can really predict how a major court case would go.

Eventually, precedents and legislation will settle things.  Meanwhile, one
should not be surprised if law-enforcement people assume the worst.  Deciding
who is guilty and who is innocent is the courts' job, not theirs.  In the
absence of solid rules (nonexistent as yet) and informed judgement (unlikely,
given that most of them are computer-illiterate), they have few options.  When
they don't understand what's going on and the rulebook doesn't help, but there
are definitely people being victimized, all they can do is arrest those who
appear to be involved and hope they aren't too far wrong.

Sorry for the GermanoRussian pun, but the two Soviet cosmonauts aboard the
space station Mir (= peace) for the past three months have been waiting for
supplies to be brought up by the module Kristall, launched on 31 May, so that
they may attempt to stay in space to attempt repairs of their Soyuz spacecraft
(whose insulation was damaged on launch on 11 February).  The conputer
controlling the docking of Kristall with Mir shut down the docking operation
two hours ahead of schedule yesterday.  A Tass report speculates that the
computer system might have detected a malfunction in one of the Kristall's
orientation system engines.  Keep an eye out for further details.  [Source: San

I'm sure someone must have already replied to you about this, but what they
probably were doing were reconfiguring to deal with the fact that the Arpanet
was decommissioned on June 1.  There is no more Arpanet.  You were probably
rerouted to your local regional net, which in turn is gatewayed to other
networks, thereby making it apparent that the Arpanet is "back".  But rest
assured, the Arpanet is dead.

At last I have discovered a way to get back issues of RISKS-Forum via
BITNET. I think it could be interesting for you: BITFTP at PUCC is the
e-mail address to get FTP-BITNET redirection. You shuld send a message
like this to BITFTP:

ftp CRVAX.sri.com
login anonymous
cd sys$user2:[risks]
get risks-i.j               [for some legitimate values of i and j, obviously]
quit

Please note that connection to CRVAX.sri.com is allowed only after 7 PM.  After
a while, BITFTP replies with a session log and, if the file has been
succesfully retrieved, will send the file itself.

At a briefing today, we were given information about the ATF (advanced
tactical fighter) reported to be "tip-top secret."  

(ATF is a highly automated plane that will eventually -- one is told --
house the Pilot's Assistant, an AI package that can fly, land, and fight
the plane under every circumstance.  Right.  Anyway...)

	The ATF has two cockpits.  In the front one is a man.  In the
	back one is a dog.  The responsibility of the man is to turn
	around periodically and feed the dog.  The responsibility of the
	dog is to bite the man if he ever tries to touch any of the
	controls.

Well, it seemed funny at the time.

&gt; Mr. Bertrand Bonneau (the translator to English) 

Actually, Mr. Mellor did the translation.   
                               [Yes, that's what he said in <A HREF="/Risks/10.02.html">RISKS-10.02</A>.  PGN]

&gt;For example, I was very surprised by the total absence of any reference
&gt;to the B7[5]7/B767 with their glass cockpits and computers.

The B757/767 and A320 are two different generations of aircraft.  And nobody's 
crashed a 757/767 yet.  The airplanes could certainly come in for criticism
(for the way Boeing's addressed the general man-machine problems of glass 
cockpits), but the *critical* issue of the day is the A320.


Looks like it's time for some refresher background:

757, 767, and A310: introduced in '82 and '83: characterized by *conventional* 
  flight controls, glass artificial horizons and nav displays (EFIS), and 
  performance management systems (PMS).  These airplanes are referred to as
  "classical glass" by at least one magazine (Flight International).

  The 757 and 767 have identical cockpits.  They have conventional (analog
  dial) airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and VOR/ADF indicators.  These
  surround the two glass EFIS CRT's to form the "classic T."  Engine monitoring
  is accomplished through an Engine Indication Control Advisory (EICAS) system,
  which is comprised of a primary flight instrumentation display (engine 
  power, temperature, etc) and a secondary advisory display (checklists, hints,
  systems info, etc. pop up).  These are stacked on top of each other on the 
  center console.  Boeing's operational cockpit philosophy, since the early
  1970's, has been "need to know."  The 757/767 represent the most extreme
  manifestation of this philosophy, by any manufacturer, to date.  The im-
  plementation has resulted in the *necessity* of pilots having to work around 
  system obstacles, by pulling circuit breakers (one source claims that on a 
  typical 767 flight, sixty CB's are set and reset).  Data from an 
  (unpublished?) survey by Earl Wiener indicates that pilots are neatly 
  divided in their opinions of the 757/767 cockpit.

  The A310 is similar, except it packs more info into the EFIS displays, and
  it has conventional dial engine instruments.  However, it also has two EICAS
  displays, to handle a multitude of system and advisory information.  Airbus's
  philosophy (on the A310) was "nice to know."  The cockpit is not, however,
  popular with pilots, because of a variety of environmental factors (too
  cold, for one).  There is a retrofit which gives the A300-600 more or less
  the A310's cockpit.  The A320 design leans more in the 757/767 direction.


Next generation: the A320 (introduced in 1988).
  The A320 did away with most dials (except for backup instrumentation)
  and combined airspeed and altitude information into the primary flight
  display.  These bracket (left and right, respectively) the artificial
  horizon display.  The display is quite small (7.25") , and, in my opinion, 
  poorly designed (this was recently discussed ad nauseum on RISKS and 
  sci.aeronautics).  The nav display (beneath it) is more or less a typical 
  nav display.  Nothing revolutionary there.

  The flight controls on the A320 are non-standard.  The aircraft is controlled
  through sidesticks, which map pilot commands into aircraft action.  There 
  are a multitude of control modes available (for instance, "direct" mode, in 
  which the sidestick deflections map to surface deflections), "autopilot" (in 
  which the sidestick controls the autopilot), "C*" (which provides an 
  unconventional method of flight guidance), etc.  There are also many 
  "protections" built into the various modes, such as automatic engine spool-
  up if the angle of attack gets too high (alpha floor--but it doesn't work 
  under 100' radio altitude, hence the Habsheim crash), preventing excessive
  bank or pitch, etc.  The two sidesticks do not provide "active" artificial 
  feel (although they do have a spring to prevent excessive deflection), and 
  are not interconnected.

  There are manual backups to the flight control system, but they're not
  intended for normal use.  The "manual" backups amount to electric trim, a
  manual rudder, and, according to at least one source, a manually settable
  horizontal stabilizer.  At least one source has claimed that Airbus isn't
  advocating training for the "manual" flight mode, despite it being the
  only way that a test flight (which Bev Littlewood recently mentioned) could
  have been landed.

Latest generation: MD-11/747-400.
  The MD-11 (1990) and 747-400 (1989) feature six large color CRT displays, 
  and provide data in a manner similar to that of the A320 and 757/767.  
  The MD-11 features a "fly-by-wire" system (without any changes in control 
  laws and no protections), with a fully "manual" hydraulic backup.  The 
  747-400 features a standard hydraulic-based control system.  Both airplanes 
  are two-man ships, though, and include significantly reworked electrical and 
  systems design. 

  Note, though, that both Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas have opted for 
  *conventional* flight laws.  Boeing is reportedly continuing the trend
  with the 767-X (777), which, if launched, will have fiber-optic "fly-by-
  light" systems.

In essence, these airplanes share (a) similar nav displays, (b) similar 
PMS/FMCS systems, (c) similar (unknown) problems relating to the consequences 
of using digital electronics for flight-critical systems (these range from 
static problems to temperature to solar radiation), (d) the unknown effects of 
"hiding" a lot of information in two little CRT's, and (e) a propensity to 
encourage "heads-down" behavior.  Only the A320, however, has a fly-by-wire
system with "unconventional" control laws, and only the A320 has been sold
on the basis of preventing the pilot from making fatal errors.

As you note, though,

&gt;The main point of this article is that the procedures were bad, 

which brings us back to ERGONOMICS.  The point of the article was to draw
attention to the questionable workmanship of the aircraft, and the poor
man-machine interface.  In my opinion, the A320 is the real loser in the
crop of digital airplanes, with the 747-400/MD-11 coming a distant second (for
the idiotic decision to introduce long-range aircraft with only two pilots).

&gt;the French FAA was conducting the investigation rather than the French
&gt;Department of Justice.  

Actually, both the DGCA and a local magistrate were conducting an 
investigation.  The DGCA has released its report, which white-washed the 
aircraft and systems.  The magistrate's report is still to be released (?).


&gt;Even if the French judges are only ten times
&gt;technically-smarter than ours and if the French-FAA is only ten times
&gt;more corrupted than ours, I'd still rather see their FAA, not their DoJ
&gt;conduct the investigation.

But there's an explicit conflict of interest there: Airbus Industrie is
essentially a public-works project for the aerospace sector in Europe.  It
is HEAVILY financed by the French government, and is a major employer in
France.  French prestige is on the line, and we all know how "weird" the
French government can get, when protecting its interests (remember
the Rainbow Warrior? :-)).  The behavior of both the French government after
Habsheim, and Airbus Industrie after Bangalore, are certainly bases for 
skepticism.


&gt;Well, in the US the NTSB (and the FAA)
&gt;typically have "probable cause" within a day, even though investigations
&gt;take many months or even years.  Is it suspect, too?

There are numerous cases when the NTSB has not been able to issue a probable
cause, and numerous more where the probable cause has turned out to be in-
correct.  What the French government did, however, was state--in a definitive
manner--that the Habsheim crash was a result of pilot error.  The FORM their
statement took would certainly not be acceptable coming from the NTSB.  It
must be very awkward to have a supposedly objective government agency im-
mediately *defending* an airplane of which many hard questions can be asked.  
It's my impression that what irked many people was this very sight of their 
government playing the role of apologist.

To the best of my knowledge, the FAA does not issue probable-cause statements.
Its options are limited to emergency regulatory action, based upon preliminary
crash assessments from the NTSB (cf. the AAL DC-10 at O'Hare).  It, too,
has been known to reverse its decisions.


&gt;To sum it up: opinionated reporting may leave something to be desired.

The style of the article was somewhat clumsy, but it has a number of good
points.  It is not appropriate to discount it sorely because of its
feeble attempts at rhetoric.  A number of people seem to have been thrown
off by the assumption that it represents the epitome of the debate in France.
It doesn't, as Pete Mellor has noted.  But it certainly contains enough 
(apocryphal) anecdotes to stimulate serious discussion.

In RISKS 10.05, Danny Cohen &lt;COHEN@ISI.EDU&gt; made some statements
   regarding accident investigation in the US that are not correct.

&gt; [...] Well, in the US the NTSB (and the FAA)
&gt;typically have "probable cause" within a day, even though investigations
&gt;take many months or even years.  Is it suspect, too?

   The FAA *never* issues statements of probable cause -- it is 
outside its jurisdiction.  The NTSB has primary jurisdiction.  The
role of the FAA in accident investigation is to collect facts and
assist the NTSB in their investigation of accidents.  Probable cause
statements are issued by the NTSB in accident reports that typically
are released about six months after the accident.  NTSB board members
will on occasion issue statements about the focus of investigation,
and about preliminary findings, but official statements are not made
until exhaustive study is complete and the accident report is completed.
Safety recommendations can be made more expeditiously when an urgent
need is perceived, but this is not equivalent to a statement of probable
cause.  There would be a tremendous negative response to a Board member
if he/she made such a statement within a day, and indeed, such a
statement would be suspect.  Just for fun, I challenge all RISKS readers
to find a single case wherein such a statement was made "within a day".

   In the case of the Aloha accident certain facts were known fairly
quickly.  Recommendations were made to the FAA to address perceived
safety problems, but no statement of probable cause was issued until
the official report was released.

&gt;To sum it up: opinionated reporting may leave something to be desired.


   Granted.  The same can be said of misinformed reporting.

I don't have definitive answers, but I think I can clarify the terms
a bit.  "About-turn on the ground" is an abort before the beginning of
the takeoff roll, that is, a decision to return during the pre-takeoff
taxiing, whereas an "acceleration-stop" is an abort after the beginning
of the takeoff roll but before V1 (the velocity at which the plane is
committed to a takeoff) is attained.  The latter is an aborted takeoff;
beyond V1 the plane is committed to a takeoff though once airborne the
crew could immediately turn back and land.

As for the matter of "cabin altitude being on the increase", pressure
in the cabin is measured in terms of altitude rather than PSI or bars
or some other unit.  Typically, the cabin of a commercial aircraft is
pressurized to a pressure equal to that at an altitude of 8,000 feet
above mean sea level.  A failure of the pressurization system would
cause the pressure to decrease such that the effective cabin altitude
would increase from nominal, approaching the actual altitude of the
aircraft.  Often this occurs due to a rupture of the pressure cabin
and a consequent violent decompression, but in this case it appears
the decompression was gradual, presumably due to a failure of the
regulation systems.  No matter, the pilots still must descend to an
altitude at which the cabin altitude is within acceptable limits.

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.05.html">RISKS-10.05</A>, Danny Cohen &lt;COHEN@ISI.EDU&gt; writes:

&gt;            About the A320'S ATTACKS OF NERVES
 
&gt; Mr. Bertrand Bonneau (the translator to English) did a terrific job of
&gt; translation, given his knowledge of the subject area.  Too bad that the
&gt; original writer is not more knowledgeable of aviation.

If this is a joke about the translation, it's a bit too subtle for me!
My Collins-Robert French Dictionary gives:

        "crise de nerfs - attack of nerves, fit of hysterics;"

Mmm...perhaps the second alternative might be better :-)
Assuming from the lack of smiley that Danny Cohen is serious, then he can't
have read my disclaimer.

He goes on:

&gt; For example, I was very surprised by the total absence of any reference
&gt; to the B767/B767 with their glass cockpits and computers.

Maybe, but M. Bonneau *does* say "...the embedding of numerous
pieces of software on board aircraft of the new generation (A320, but also
McDonnell-Douglas MD 11, Boeing 747-400, among others) can pose problems for
the official agencies.", so he is obviously aware that the A320 is not the
only computerised civil aircraft.

&gt; The main point of this article...

[Actually the main point of the subsection on the enquiry into the 
 Mulhouse-Habsheim crash: the main article is far more concerned with technical
 problems of FBW and glass cockpits.]

&gt;                                ...is that the procedures were bad, and that
&gt; the French FAA was conducting the investigation rather than the French
&gt; Department of Justice.

Err..not *quite*. Bonneau's point is that French government regulations
(to which he gives precise references) place the responsibility for
conducting such investigations on the Inspection Generale de l'Aviation
Civile (IGAC), under the direct authority of the Minister of Transport
[note: *not* the "French Department of Justice"], and not on the Direction
Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the French equivalent of the FAA.

The only information I previously had on alleged procedural irregularities came
from some slightly confused accounts in the UK and US press (Herald Tribune
11th July 1988, Financial Times 11th July 1988, Guardian 12th July 1988,
New Scientist 21st July 1988). It was Germain Sengelin, senior examining
magistrate at Mulhouse, who complained at the DFDR and CVR being handed over
to the DGAC without being placed under judicial seal to "guarantee their
authenticity and integrity" until the enquiry. He was taken off the case.

&gt;  Well, in the US the NTSB (and the FAA)
&gt; typically have "probable cause" within a day, even though investigations
&gt; take many months or even years.  Is it suspect, too?

Depends. The pilot and copilot survived the Mulhouse crash, and immediately
made statements implicating delays in engine acceleration (Times 27th June
1988). The engines are controlled by FADEC, and this in turn responds to the
EFCS. The question about exactly *what* goes onto the DFDR, and from *where*
it is captured in the processing chain, had previously occurred to several
people (including myself) who take an interest in the A320. If Bonneau's claims
about this are correct, it confirms our suspicions: even *with* the information
from the DFDR, it would not be possible to identify "pilot error" as the sole
cause without other evidence. Metal fatigue in antique airframes (Aloha B737
28-Apr-88) is well understood as a cause of accident. Systematic failure of
a complex FBW system is not. That, together with the statement of an experienced
pilot that the engines did not respond to commands, make the following timetable
look a bit like a "rush to judgement":

26th June, 1245: Mulhouse crash. DGAC takes control of DFDR and CVR.

26th June, evening: Air France and BA A320's grounded.

27th June: Louis Mermaz, French Minister of Transport, announces that analysis
           had shown the plane suffered no technical problems.
           (Guardian, 28th June)

Same day: Jean Volff, local public prosecutor at Mulhouse, announces that
          "The inquiry points towards pilot error." and that "he could not
           exclude prosecution of the pilots for manslaughter if error is 
           proved". (Guardian, 28th June, same article)

Same day: BA reverses grounding decision after "it had discussed the situation
          with both the Civil Aviation Authority and manufacturers Airbus
          Industrie". (Evening Standard, 27th June)

28th June: A320's back in service.

The last event is the one that matters, of course. Bonneau's speculation that
"... the concern of the only technical enquiry had overridden that of the
judicial enquiry." may be true. The concern that overrode everything was to get
the A320 back in the air.

&gt;From the New Scientist, 21st July 1988:

"...the day after the accident, the DGAC announced a preliminary conclusion that
the pilots, and not the aircraft, were to blame for the disaster. According to 
the French press, details of the flight records were given to Aerospatiale,
which announced that it had confirmation that the aircraft was not at fault in
the crash. Several days later, the DGAC exonerated the mechanical performance
of the Airbus. The head of the DGAC, Daniel Tenenbaum, said that if this had
not been the case, it would have been necessary to ground the A320 for tests."

(And we couldn't have that, now, could we? :-)

[In fairness, I should add that I have spoken to a number of people in the
CAA and elsewhere who know a lot about flight certification and about the
Mulhouse accident in particular, who have assured me that it *was* pilot
error, but, as always, confidentiality prevented them from saying *how* they
knew that.]

&gt; I take it to imply that this shows that because of "*Industrial
&gt; Secrets*" (which cover the software) the operating airlines could not
&gt; use any "good computer scientist" to simply go ahead and fix that fault.
&gt; If this is the case -- how about all the regression testing ...

I agree. If Bonneau thinks that each user could hack together his own patches,
then he's WRONG. He is, however, quite right to point out elsewhere that
it's not possible to certify a system containing embedded software to any
high degree of reliability (and certainly not to 10^-9) by treating it as a
black box, and the industrial secrecy protecting the A320 software means that
it is possible to do little else.

In fact the regulations (FAR 25.1309 plus AC 25.1309-1) require a "critical"
*system* to be demonstrated to have 10^-9 max. probability of failure, but
specifically 'cop out' when it comes to the *software* in those systems, and
refer to RTCA/DO-178A, "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and
Equipment Certification", which is essentially a set of guidelines for good
development practice, and requires that certain documents (specifications,
test plans and results, etc.) be made available to the certification authority.
There are 3 levels of software, of which level 1 is for "critical" systems
(those which can crash the aircraft if they fail). (However, note that by
"using appropriate design and/or implementation techniques" it may be possible
to put lower level software in a critical system.) Even at level 1, source
code and object code are *not* required, and a source listing is only required
for a re-certification following modification! Only the vendor of the software
and the customer (i.e. the airframe manufacturer) are required to test the
software.

A320 EFCS software was rated as level 1. Heaven knows what's in the FADEC! 
(The European regulations are almost identical to the US.)

As a modest proposal for improving our certification of flight-critical
software, may I suggest:

- Access to source and object code by certification authority.

- Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) by 3rd party.

Danny Cohen ends:

&gt; To sum it up: opinionated reporting may leave something to be desired.

To which I say: so may our certification procedures for flight-critical
software!

Also in <A HREF="/Risks/10.05.html">RISKS-10.05</A>, Atkielski.TDS-ASF@SYSTEM-M.PHX.BULL.COM points out that
the actual magazine is "Science &amp; Vie", and that the article was in the 
"Aeronautique" section. Sorry, my fault. Serves me right for working from a
photocopy of only the relevant pages.

He also points out that:

&gt; A rebuttal from Bernard Ziegler, technical director
&gt; of Airbus Industrie, may be found in the following May issue.

My thanks for this information. Perhaps in the interests of balance, RISKS
should carry a translation of that, too. Are you offering, Bernard? Come on,
it's someone else's turn! :-)

My thanks also to Steven Philipson, Karl Swartz and Jordan Brown for answers
to my queries about the terms "acceleration-stop", etc. Since Karl copied his
reply to RISKS, I assume it will be appearing shortly.

With regard to David Gursky's points about BBS mail that deals with "illegal"
activities, what if Airbus Industrie decides the Bertrand Bonneau's article
is libellous. Do they sue the publishers of "Science &amp; Vie", M. Bonneau, me,
Peter G. Neumann, or all of us?

OK, RISKS is a moderated forum, so I suppose the buck ought to stop with the
moderator. :-)

This problem reminds me, however, of the case of Goldsmith v. Pressdram
(publishers of the UK magazine "Private Eye") a few years ago. Sir James
Goldsmith sued Private Eye for libel. As part of his action, he also tried to
sue the distributors and retailers of the magazine. This was thrown out, since
if the precedent had been established, it would have meant that every newsagent
and magazine stall-holder in the land would be expected to read every
publication he sold from cover to cover, and be liable if he failed to
withhold any issue that was libellous.

Doesn't a similar common-sense principle apply to (non-moderated) BBS's?

Software protection debate in European Parliament in deadlock?


      "If builders built houses the way programmers write programs,
       the first woodpecker coming along would destroy civilization"

                                   (Anonymous, attributed to Murphy)


Following the proposed Community Directive on Software Protection of 1988 to
which legislation in all twelve member states of the European Community should
adhere, various committees in the European Parliament have occupied themselves
with the proposed regulations.  Today, June 7, 1990, is a renewed and delayed
deadline for submission of amendments to the Committee on Legal Affairs and
Citizen's Rights who hope to come to an agreement on 18 and 19 June 1990.  If
agreement is reached, the final proposal will be submitted to the plenary
meeting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to be voted upon
during July 1990.  However, there appears to be considerable disagreement on
the proposed copyright exemptions under Article 5.

In the final report by the parliamentory Committee on Financial and Monetary
Affairs and Industrial Policy (Draftsman: Mr K. Pinxten M.E.P., 22 March 1990,
PE 134.05/fin.) to the Committee on Legal Affairs, the following copyright
exemptions were proposed:

   Article 5(1).  Where a computer program has been made available to the
   public IN A LEGAL MANNER, the acts enumerated in Article 4(a) and (b)
   shall not require the authorization of the rightholder, in so far as they
   are necessary for the use OR SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OR TESTING of the program.

   Article 5(2).  Where a computer program has been made available to the
   public IN A LEGAL MANNER, THE RIGHTHOLDER MAY NOT PREVENT THE NORMAL USE
   OF THE PROGRAM BY THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

   Article 5(3).  A LICENCE AGREEMENT OR OTHER WRITTEN AGREEMENT MUST NOT
   CONTAIN ANY CLAUSES WHICH CONFLICT WITH THE PROVISIONS LAID DOWN IN
   PARAGRAPHS 1 AND 2.

The acts in Article 4 refer to copying, translation (assembling/compiling),
viewing and running for normal operation of a `program' in, presumably, source,
object, or executable form.  Interestingly, the explanatory notes to these
amendments dwell extensively on normal use, library exemptions, and the
mandatory nature of these conditions, but not at all on the `scientific
analysis and testing' provision as proposed for Article 5(1).

Under the Berne Author's Rights (`Copyright') Convention upon which the
European Community wishes to base its Directive, personal CREATIVITY rather
than engineering / corporate EFFORT determines whether a work is protected.  It
is in this respect that software quality and safety are at stake.  Any creative
activity is bound to be error prone (and especially so under competition-based
time constraints), and it has only been since recently that this is being
recognized by legislative and regulating bodies.  In a recent U.S.  report BUGS
IN THE PROGRAM (*), a serious lack of testing norms for safety-critical
software is apparent (e.g., aircraft control, medical equip ment),

   "At the present level of understanding in software engineering, Federal
    agencies cannot be assured the software they oversee and use is correct;
    they CAN determine whether the software developer understands good
    practices that are necessary to produce quality software.  Further,
    review and analysis and test results are useful, though this offers
    no safety guarantee."

If legislative and regulating bodies in a major software producing country
like the U.S.A. recognize their limitations to assert software quality, it
would seem that new regulations should provide room for such validation and
testing by others.  One such a regulation might be the proposed amendment on
analysis and testing, insofar it cannot be excluded by contract, AND insofar
it extends to third parties like consumer societies and other investigating
entities, including the right to publish the findings from such (scientific)
endeavor.

       university computer centers that software can be borrowed by staff
       and students for exclusive use on local PC's]

[From the _Wall Street Journal_; June 1, 1990, p. B1.]

COMPUTER AIDS MAY HURT IN DECISION MAKING

Computer programs designed to assist managers in making decisions don't always
help, and sometimes can hamper performance, a team of researchers finds.

Jeffrey E Kottemann, assistant professor of computer information systems at
the University of Michigan, simulated a manufacturing-production process in
a growth industry.  He had M.B.A. students decide on output and staffing, given
uncertain demand, over 24 mock quarters. One group used a spreadsheet-oriented
computer aid that helped members evaluate alternatives.  The other group was
on its own, relying on intuition and experience.  

Contrary to Mr. Kottemann's expectations, the computer-assisted people
significantly underperformed unaided, in the initial experiment as well as two
follow-ups.  With the computer aids, he says, people appear to have sought
short-term results by understaffing and underproducing.  But those decisions,
over time, meant lost sales and extra costs.

Oddly, the computer-aided group didn't recognize that using the programs
led to poor decisions.  "They were significantly more confident in their 
performance than the unaided group," Mr. Kottermann says.  He and two 
colleagues, Fred D. Davis Jr. and William Remus, plan further work to help 
explain when and how computer aids affect actual and perceived performance.

Mark Anacker (marka@dsinet.UUCP) writes about "Another egregious database".

   The database that Mark reported on is not merely "egregious", but is
excessively intrusive and constitutes a massive invasion of privacy as well.

   The inventors of this scheme posit that closely kept records would motivate
disadvantaged students to attend classes more regularly and strive harder to
perform.  There seems to be no basis for these claims.  A more effective
argument could be made such that such record keeping would discourage students
-- any minor slip would be recorded and permanently held against them.  The
system would appear to be designed to hold them back, thus further alienating
them from the school and society as a whole.

  The data collected in this system could be used as a basis to disqualify or
downgrade students for jobs and college acceptance based on their
well-documented poor attendance, lack of motivation, and poor performance.
Standardized tests provide some objective measure of skills and capabilities of
students.  This new system seems to provide a mechanism for rejecting students
on more subjective grounds.

&gt;If the system is successful, says Elford, it would provide an incentive for
&gt;apathetic students to do well.

   This logic is backwards.  The success of a tracking/incentive system should
be judged on how well it motivates students and effects their learning.  A
perfectly implemented system that negatively effects the students cannot be
considered a success.

&gt;Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem with this?

   It's not just you.  This proposal is offensive, and the article is amazingly
blind to its problems.  Hopefully the communities involved will do better.  If
not, perhaps they'll give it an appropriate name and slogan: Long Live Big
Brother!

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.05.html">RISKS-10.05</A>, from the June 3rd 1990 Seattle Times, courtesy of Mark Anacker:

&gt; Imagine if an employer could find out how many times a prospective employee
&gt; had been late for school, or if a business could tap into a pool of high 
&gt; school graduates and find the model employee.

(Article about "Worklink, the program designed to connect education and
business")

Who *wants* to employ these paragons? An article in New Society many years ago
carried an article about how research grants were awarded. The discussions of
an imaginary committee were reported, considering the following two cases:

Student A had hypochondriac tendencies, and a noted aversion to serious work.
A completely undistinguished undergraduate career at Cambridge had been spent
mainly indulging in drink and sport, apart from his hobby of collecting insects.
He now wanted to go on a round-the-world cruise on some research ship with no
well-defined research objectives whatsoever in mind.

Student B was rather withdrawn and given to boughts of introspection on obscure
and irrelevant topics understood only by himself. His medical records reveal
that he did not speak until the age of four. His habits were eccentric: he
sometimes wore no socks, and had been caught wearing his landlady's
tablecloth as a scarf. This general neurotic impression was confirmed by the
fact that examinations reduced him to a state of nervous collapse for several
months before and after. Since graduation, he had been employed as a clerk in
a patents office.

Needless to say, the committee did consider either student worthy of an grant.
Unfortunately, the first was Charles Darwin, and the second was Albert Einstein.

Still, we can't all be eccentric geniuses. If you want a reliable guy to serve
on a burger stand, try Worklink! :-)

	Yes, I too had a problem with this, until I ran across
	the following paragraph...

  &gt;Under the voluntary program, everything from prose reading and document 
  	     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  &gt;reading to punctuality would be assessed and, subject to student approval,
  		   		                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  &gt;entered into the student's record.

Since the program is voluntary, and the information in it is "subject to
student approval", I have fewer problems with the database itself.  Yes,
unscrupulous school administrations could indeed enter data that the student
had not aproved, but discovering this should be as easy as getting a copy of
your school transcript is now.  (It's VERY easy for me.)

However, all it has done is moved the 'disadvantage' from the "post-school"
period (i.e. writing impressive resumes), to the "in-school" period (i.e.
getting sufficient counseling to have 'impressive' data in your records).  At
my high school, this would have been something of a lost cause.  There were
only two counselors for the entire school.  Fortunately, I was well motivated
and already knew what I wanted, so I didn't need much counseling.

Youth has such an ability to disregard unpleasant consequences....

&gt; If you walk up to my door and knock, I can find out who you are (by taking a
&gt; photograph through my peephole).  So logically police informants don't expect
&gt; to be able to walk up to doors anonymously.  Neither should they expect to be
&gt; able to enter homes via telephone anonymously.

Let us be clear about who Caller ID benefits and who it does not benefit.

As far as residential phone users are concerned, Caller ID is not much
better than receiving anonymous calls.  That is, having the number of
the calling phone is *not* sufficient information to decide how to
handle the call, since the vast majority of calls will be from
unrecognized numbers, which could just as easily be from a spouse
stranded with a broken-down car as from a stranger.  A real name -- a
simple ascii string -- typed by the caller at call time or sent from a
card that the caller placed in the calling phone, would be be far more
useful to the callee for call screening purposes.

For businesses on the other hand, Caller ID is *much* better than
receiving anonymous calls.  That is because businesses want the number
for a *different* reason than residential customers do:  they aren't
trying to screen calls; they are trying to collect marketing
information.  Thus, they need an ID that can serve as a link back to
the caller.  Phone numbers -- via reverse directories that are readilly
accessible -- serve this purpose.  For businesses, a simple string like
"John" or even "Mergatroyd D. Fitzsimmons" wouldn't be useful because
it can't serve as a unique link back to the caller.

My preference would be to hold out for a solution that provides real benefits
for residential users, and that does *not* provide benefits for businesses.

In a recent RISKS, Jim Harkins (correctly) writes that we consider books con-
taining all sorts of details about how to commit crimes to be legal.  He then
says:
	I [haven't] done anything wrong by offering a suggestion on improving
	your monthly income [by holding up gas stations] :-) Of course, if I
	suspect that you did use my suggestion then by not finking on you I am
	breaking the law.

This last sentence is FALSE.  You have, in general, no positive duty to report
your knowledge of a crime, much less your suspicions.  There are some special
cases, mainly having to do with "officers of the court" or police; if you fall
into one of these special categories, you should know.  In fact, under some
conditions your reports, if false, MIGHT be actionable as libel or slander.
(There's a fine balance of interests here - society's interest in seeing
crimes punished and, if possible prevented; and individuals' interest in
seeing their privacy and "good name" protected.  As an analogy - one where the
"damage" is considered more severe - anyone has the right to make a "citizen's
arrest" of the committer of a felony.  But beware:  If you exercise this
right, you MUST be right in your claims!  If the person you "arrest" did not
in fact commit the felony you "arrested" him for, he can successfully sue you
(probably for battery).  That you BELIEVED he had committed a felony, even had
very good reason for such a belief, is insufficient.  This is one place where
police officers have much, much broader lattitude than the average person.)

On the other side, one thing you have to watch out for in this context is
conspiracy laws.  These were great favorites for going after people unpopular
with the authorities back during the anti-Vietnam-war protests of the '60's,
since they are so broadly drafted.  As I recall, if 2 (3?) or more people
discuss an illegal act, and at least one of them then goes out and performs
any concrete action in furtherance of that act, all can be found guilty of
conspiracy, a crime for which the penalty can be more severe than that for the
underlying act.  (In fact, I believe conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor can be
a felony!)  The example a lawyer friend of mine came up with was:  He says to
two of us "Why don't we get together and monopolize sales of used cars in this
state."  One of us later goes to a used-car dealership and looks around.  The-
oretically, all three of us are guilty of conspiracy.  Fortunately, conspiracy
laws are used mainly as "add-ons" to provide bargaining chips for plea bargin-
ing in cases where crimes really have occurred.  If they were abused, they
might very well be tossed out as unconstitutional - though given the tenor of
the times and today's court system, even that is hard to be sure of.

And you thought programming hard real-time systems was hairy!

Disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer, though I sometimes talk a bit like one. :-)
The above is what I've gleaned from many discussions with lawyers over the
years.  (My wife's a lawyer.  Many of her friends are lawyers.  Many of MY
friends are lawyers.  A consulting contract I had not long ago was reviewed
by no less than 5 lawyers on my side; had they all been charging me at their
full rates, I would likely have gotten nothing out of the contract. Arrgh....)
It is based on American law, and probably applies in more or less the same way
under any system based on the Common Law - but who can tell.

   In RISKS 10.04 Henry Spencer (henry@zoo.toronto.edu) reports on
an article in the April 30 issue of Aviation Week.  In commenting on
the article, Henry writes:

&gt;(for example, NASA Ames, a major center of work on such things,
&gt;has no simulator representative of modern cockpits).  

   This is not quite what appeared in the article.  Hart A. Langer
(United Airlines VP flight operations) was reported to have said that
"the center has no research simulator based on the glass cockpits that
are in use today".  [The quote is of Aviation Week paraphrasing Langer].
This is in fact true, however the Center does have a simulator on which
the glass cockpits of today are based.  This is the Advanced Concepts
Flight Simulator (ACFS) at the Man-Vehicle Systems Research Facility
(MVSRF) at NASA Ames.

   This simulator had its origins about 10 years ago.  It's display
technology had definitely fallen behind the times, but was upgraded
about a year ago with current technology computer graphics workstations
which drive its displays.  The displays are "representative of modern
cockpits".  My knowledge of this is first hand -- I designed and
implemented the displays and software that drive the primary flight
displays in the ACFS.  They were intended to model prototype displays
that Boeing was working on for the 747-400.  NASA has now upgraded all
of the displays and is actively performing human factors research on
electronic flight instrumentation systems.

   The general point of the article is correct however -- the technology
is moving very fast, and it is difficult for the research institutions
to keep up, let alone forge ahead.  Thus new technologies are being
fielded before their impact can be adequately assessed.

Back in March (shortly before the "Poll Tax" was introduced in England) I was
having a little trouble persuading my local district council that I am a
student, and as such need only pay 20 percent of the charge.  During one of my
many telephone calls to their offices, I was informed that their computer
system (with all the data storage) was being upgraded, and I would therefore
have to wait a long time while they tried to find my "real" file.  I was given
the distinct impression that it would be better if I rang back once the upgrade
was finished, in a few weeks!  Since this was only 4 weeks from the
introduction of the Tax and I had no desire to pay 400 percent too much, I
was quite prepared to wait and did so.  My student status was eventually sorted
out.

I don't believe for a second that my district council was trying anything
clever, or that the situation was in any way other than as stated.  However, it
now seems to me that this would be an effective stalling measure for someone
who wished to deny clients access to their records -- imagine a company in
financial trouble stalling enquiries about outstanding orders with tales of an
unavailable computer system (and hence unavailable records), while they quietly
fled the country with the bank balance.  This is something new (to me), and
while it is not all *that* chilling in its implications, it's a thought.

A woman identifying herself as Lisa Flowers used the secret code for Liz
Taylor's answering service to set herself up as a cryptopublicist, returning
telephone calls and giving out bogus interviews.  She told reporters about a
fabricated relationship with a 23-year Detroit man, Julian Lee Hobbs, and gave
out false medical reports.  The hoax included intercepting requests from UPI
and AP for confirmation of earlier (phony) information, and providing
confirmation!  So much for "secret" codes.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

This week, EEC sent the draft of the 'harmonized' Information Technology
Security Criteria (ITSEC) to some people (I don't know the adress list) for
comment. Based on the German `Green Book', an expert group with French, German,
Dutch and English contribution prepared a (greyly-white covered) booklet of
125 pages covering (after a short introduction: (1)scope) the functionality (2)
and the assurance of correctness (3: 55 pages) as well as the assurance of
effectiveness(4). The functionality chapter (2) refers, among others, to the 
Green Book's functionality classes F1..F5 (derived from Orange Book) and 
F6..F10 (adding availability and integrity of systems and networks to the
well-known Orange Book functionality). The assurance part (3) elaborates the 
Green Books' quality Q0..Q7 into the more detailed `levels' E1..E6 (from 
'inadequate assurance'=E0 equivalent to Orange Book 'D', towards E6 where 
correctness is formally proven (essentially A1, but not `beyond A1!);
as in Orange Book and Green Book, each higher level encomprises the lower ones.
For each level, specific features must be evaluated for the (4) 'phases' of the
development process as well as for different `aspects' of the system and user
documentation. Moreover, the effectiveness of the assured features is roughly
described under aspects such as: suitability, binding of functionality, 
strength of mechanism, assessment of vulnerability (consstruction, operation),
or ease of use.

EEC plans a conference in Brussels to happen on September 25-26, 1990. Accord-
ing to their letter, they welcome critical comments (if received by July 6th)
which might be discussed in this conference.

Klaus Brunnstein    University of Hamburg

PS: based on our analysis of the benefits and shortcomings of `Trusted Computer
Evaluation Criteria' which we contributed to the IFIP SEC'90 conference, re-
cently in Helsinki, I plan to analyse this new Criteria catalog in more detail. 
I would strongly appreciate any critical comments, as well on our paper on
'Risk Analysis of Trusted Computer Systems' (which I e-mail upon request) as
well as on the above draft.

     [The copy I have says that Der Bundesminister des Innern, Bonn, West
     Germany (Minister of the Interior) is der Herausgeber, so presumably
     copies can be obtained from there or from the other three governments.  
     The ITSEC is a very deft merging of the earlier German criteria and the
     British claims language.  PGN]

        I posted the 2600 magazine excerpts on some local BBSs, and I have the
following comment from a user and sysop:

What does the entire 911/Steve Jackson Games escapade tell us?  Well, it's not
all that new that the government (like most such things) requires careful
watching, and I'm not too happy about how the last I'd heard, an agent had told
SJ games they wouldn't get all of their hardware back, even though no charges
had been filed (can you say legalized thievery boys and girls?  I knew you
could.)

But the main thing that moves me to write this missive is the indications from
the published article that the authors, and thus quite likely also the party
responsible for copying that document and circulating it still do not quite
understand what the individual responsible did. Accordingly, and in the hopes
that if this circulates widely enough he or she will see it, the following
message:

OK - all you did was get into Bell South's computer system (mostly proving that
their security sucks rocks) to prove what a hotshot hacker you were, then made
a copy of something harmless to prove it.  Sheer innocence; nothing to get
upset about, right?

Bull****, my friend.  Want to know what you did wrong?  Well, for starters, you
scared the US Government and pointed it in the direction of computer hobbyists.
There are enough control freaks in the government casting wary eyes on free
enterprises like BBS systems without you having to give them ammunition like
that.  Bad move, friend, bad move.  You see, the fact that you didn't damage
anything, and only took a file that would do no harm to Bell South OR the 911
system if it were spread all over the country is beside the point.  What really
counts is what you COULD have done.  You know that you only took one file; Bell
South only knows that one file from their system turned up all over the place.
What else might have been taken from the same system, without their happening
to see it?  You know that you didn't damage their system (you THINK that you
didn't damage their system); all Bell South knows is that somebody got into the
system to swipe that file, and could have done any number of much nastier
things.  Result - the entire computer you took that file from and its contents
are compromised, and possibly anything else that was connected with that
computer (we know it can be dialed into from another computer - that's how you
got on, after all!)  is also compromised.  And all of it has now got to be
checked.  Even if it's just a batch of text files never used on the 911 system
itself, they all have to be investigated for modifications or deletions.  Heck
- just bringing it down and reloading from backup from before you got in (if
they KNOW when you got in) even if no new things were added since would take a
lot of time.  If this is the sort of thing that $79,449 refered to I think they
were underestimating.

You cost somebody a lot of time/money; you almost cost Steve 
Jackson Games their existance; you got several folks arrested for 
receiving stolen goods (in essence); you endangered a lot of 
bulletin boards and maybe even BBS nets in general.  Please find 
some other way to prove how great you are, OK?

This is a personal report, eye-witnesses are available.  On Thursday, 7 June
1990, at about 1500 hrs EDT, it was conclusively demonstrated that it is
possible for self-replicating bugs to replicate themselves in floppies (5-1/4"
DSDD) _outside_ of a computer!

There is a stash of scratch disks, in boxes, on top of a file cabinet next to
my desk.  Mostly, they are old backups awaiting degaussing and reformatting.
At the back of the row of six or seven boxes, I found an open box of disks,
with nine new, never-used disks.  This minor treasure would have come in handy
if I hadn't noticed visible evidence of the self-replication (and defecation)
of the bugs, commonly known as "cockroaches".

A cursory examination, conducted after dropping the box in the trash bag,
revealed at least five live beasties.  Droppings/eggs everywhere in the box.  I
checked each disk envelope, and found spoor in all nine.  Witnesses were drawn
to the scene like flies... er, spectators.  The was a certain amount of noise
associated with the discovery, and the air in my cubicle is reported by some to
have turned blue.  This may be an exaggeration.

The droppings/eggs seemed large enough to have caused a head crash.  I have
enough bits loose in my PCs without adding more.  I checked every other box,
and found no evidence of infestation.  Three of the boxes came from the same
carton as the infested box.

I will not report the name of the manufacturer, as it does not seem important.
TechReps of several computer manufacturers have told me that "tower" style
cases regularly attract cockroaches.  They are thought to come in for warmth,
or to eat the lacquer used on certain components.  Incidentally, _real_ lacquer
is the processed shells of the lac beetle, which is remarkably like a cockroach
in appearance.  (_cannabilistic self-replicating bugs?)

This may be yet another Risk of computing - or another Risk of working in an
old five-sided building on the west side of the Potomac.

The people who claim Caller ID is useful for preventing crank calls are
somewhere between misguided and dishonest.  Consider: do you *never* receive a
call from someone you know from a phone number you don't recognize?  Has you
*never* had a friend call you from a pay phone?  Of course not!  So that means
that a general strategy of refusing to answer calls from unknown sources will
cut you off from some calls you would have wanted to receive.

Suppose, then, that you answer all calls.  You are assured of getting a crank
call from time to time.  Why doesn't Caller ID avert that by making it known to
the caller that you will identify the source?

It does, of course, but it's much more than you need for that purpose.  For
example, the following facility has been available in my calling area for some
time: if after receiving a call I hang up, pick up the phone again, and dial
*51, then a copy of the identity of the last call I received will be logged in
the central office and I will be charged $1.00 .  I can then call the police
and tell them that I received a crank call that was recorded in the central
office.  They can find out who called and act appropriately.

So: even if I have Caller ID, I cannot avoid crank calls unless I also cut
myself off from some legitimate calls.  Once I have received a crank call, I
can report the origin to the authorities even without Caller ID.  How, then, is
Caller ID useful for that purpose?

Re: Whom Caller ID benefits and whom it does not 

&gt; As far as residential phone users are concerned, Caller ID is not much
&gt; better than receiving anonymous calls.  [ the message goes on to bring
  up "member of family at phone booth" considerations. ]

I take it you have never been the target of telephone harrassment. I have.
It's not a lot of fun, but unless it goes on for a long time it's just not
possible to get the authorities to do anything about it. I have been called by
my wife's ex-boyfriend (from his place of work!), by some bozo who three-
way-called me to a third party, and by someone who calls and hangs up, we
assume to call-wait my wife off a chat system (not knowing we have another line
for the modem). In all of these cases caller-ID would be a deterrent, a channel
of recourse, or a signal to ignore that call. Even when you know the harasser,
there's not much you can do currently: when I called the ex back at work, he
convinced his boss that *I* was harassing *him* (he'd called dozens of times...
I'd called back once, then again when he hung up). If I'd had Caller- ID I
could have just ignored calls from that number (the numbers handy to his place
of work would have become quickly obvious).

In none of these cases was SWBell at all interested. In all of these cases
Caller-ID would let me stop it in the bud. Calls from pay-phones just wouldn't
have been possible for any of them (pay-phones don't have 3-way calling, and
in the other two cases the opportunity wouldn't arise).

No system is perfect, but I'm not going to leave my door unlocked just because
someone is capable of breaking a window. Making casual harassment less
convenient is by itself a good thing.

in RISKS DIGEST 10.07, Edwin Wiles comments that the `egregious database' is
less troublesome because of the voluntary nature of data submission.  This
ignores the risks of bureaucratization, in which the fact that one has not
`voluntarily' submitted data to a database is held against one.  (There is also
the risk of inexperience, in that a student may not appreciate the consequences
of putting personal data in a such a database, but this should always be
considered.)

In the Columbia Public Schools, of Columbia, Missouri, such a system
has been installed in the last few years-- it can keep track of
basically _everything_ that can be recorded textually that has
happened during a students K-12 academic career.  Not only grades, but
personality profiles, any comments by teachers, and just about
anything that is even remotely associated with 'school' -- including
incidences that don't appear on the 'permanent' record and incidences
involving the police.

Apparently, the goal is to be able to track a student through the public
education system and then store that data permanently ... and it is all at the
fingertips (though, at many different security levels, of various random
secrataries, counselors, etc.)...

In Risks 10.07 Edwin Wiles, NetExpress, Inc., misses the point entirely.  He
seems pleased that the system is voluntary [...]  But the next part of the
quote is missing.  Reading it from Risks 10.05 we see:

&gt;&gt; The absence of criteria like punctuality might be noticed, however, 
&gt;&gt; just as vital information omitted from a resume would be, he adds.

and means that leaving out such information is itself an negative mark on the
potential employee.  I have students RIGHT NOW who are peeing in bottles
(voluntarily) in order to get jobs.  Of course they do not take drugs, of
course they are doing it voluntarily, of course they want the job.  They do it.
Voluntary release of your civil rights is not protection.  The argument that
you have nothing to fear from this abuse of your rights if you are not guilty
never washes.  It is always just plain wrong.  Nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition, but this is the way it begins.

	    Rust Imitator Flew Flowers to the Black Sea

By Elfie Siegl, Moscow - Reported in Tages Anzeiger, Zurich - 13Jun90

  For the second time after Mathias Rust's landing on Red Square, a
West German amateur pilot flew illegally into the Soviet Union with
his private plane.  As reported by the union newspaper "Trud", an
unknown FRG citizen landed last Saturday [9Jun90] between 4 and 5pm 
at an airport in the Black Sea health resort, Batumi.  He got out 
and distributed flowers, business cards, and leaflets which called
for support of Gorbachov and of "perestroika".

  The Air Force Staff merely told Trud that many questions needed
to be clarified.  The press release of the Air Force Staff stated
that such a small airplane "simply couldn't be noticed". 

  The pilot flew over Turkey towards the Soviet border south of
Batumi, then under the radar control of the air force, and landed
at the civilian airport in Batumi.

[I have three questions.  Was this reported elsewhere?  The Tages
Anzeiger is not a rag.  Secondly, the author states that this is the
second time since Rust's famous flight.  Who was the first
imitator?  Lastly, why was this not front page news?  Is it to be
assumed that any yokel can fly into Russia?  Forgive my naivete.]

Subject: First jailed UK computer hacker
 
&gt;From a UK newspaper called 'The Daily Telegraph', Friday 8 June 1990:-
 
['Mad Hacker' jailed for computer war]
 
A computer operator who called himself "The Mad Hacker" became the first in
Britain to be jailed for the offence yesterday. Nicholas Whiteley,  21,  of
Enfield,  north  London,  was sentenced to 4 months with a further 8 months
suspended for criminally damaging computer  disks  and  wreaking  havoc  on
university  systems. Whiteley, who, it was said, was driven by a desire top
become Britain's top hacker, wept in the dock and held  his  hands  to  his
face as he walked to the cells to begin his sentence.
 
Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, described him as "very malicious and  arrogant",
and  told  him:  "Anyone minded to behave in this way must be deterred from
doing so.".
 
Whiteley declared war on computer experts, using a computer in his  bedroom
to  swamp  university  computers  with masses of useless material including
threats and boasts about his brilliance. One  said:  "Don't  mess  with  me
because I am extremely nutty.".
 
He was found guilty last month of 4 charges of causing damage  to  magnetic
disks in mainframe computers at the universities of London, Bath, and Hull.
The judge said some of the computers stored important and confidential data
relating to medical and scientific research.

This reminds me of the time a couple of weeks ago when I was taking part
in a car rally, providing communications support.  I was amused to hear
some of the traffic being passed just after the race started, to do with
two sets of fancy digital clocks that provided the elapsed times.  It would
appear that one of the clocks advanced itself by three minutes, as a result
of nearby UHF CB activity from the race marshalls.  It did not seem possible
(or perhaps legal) to alter the errant clock, so from there on the time had
to be adjusted manually before being reported.  Since the average lap time
was about one minute such a failure was obvious, but had the course been
much longer then errors could easily have crept in.

From what I understand, Caller ID *cannot* be used to report crank phone calls.
It is simply provided (in some areas - Pennsylvania's legislature has ruled
that Caller ID is an invasion of privacy) as a convenience.

In order to legally report the phone number of a crank call without prior
tracing arrangements with Bell's Nuisance Call Group, one needs to use the Call
Trace function which reports the caller's phone number to Bell while keeping
the number secure from the call's recipient.

The only thing I couldn't understand is that it seems that the ability to "Call
Trace" is an optional service (costing ~$1.50/month).  I would imagine that it
would be in the public's better interest to make it available to anyone since
one usually cannot anticipate when such a call might be made.

(I'd love to report the numbers of these calls that I get telling me that I
need to call 976-xxxx RIGHT NOW.  I definitely consider these to be a
nuisance!)

My answering service told its customers in a recent "fact sheet" that the
software they run is used at many (over 200?) locations around the US.

I pick up my messages by calling a "message-number" and dialing a five digit
code.  The first four digits are nothing more than my account number (assigned
sequentially beginning at 0000), and the last digit is whatever it takes to
make the number a multiple of nine (casting out nines)!

How simple.  It'd be trivial for me to read anyone's messages.  In fact, since
the mapping from DID number to the account number is fairly easily determined
from a few tries (293-[78]XYZ maps into "account" [12]XYZ, for example), I
could scan the phone book for rented numbers from this answering service, and
scam on just about anyone I felt like.

Security.  Ha.  If this is the same software that's running on hundreds of
sites around the country, lots of answering services are very vulnerable.

Just another person that doesn't always answer the phone,

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.05.html">RISKS-10.05</A> I expressed some "minority opinion" about the article on A320 in
Aeronautique, April 1990 (<A HREF="/Risks/10.02.html">RISKS-10.02</A>).  The article that was written by Mr.
Bertrand Bonneau and translated to English by Pete Mellor.

While taking issue with the original article, I tried to compliment the
translation.  In trying to do that I made a terrible mistake by refering to
Bertrand Bonneau as the "the translator to English".  This mistake offended the
Pete Mellor to no end, as he expressed in RISK-10.06: "If this is a joke about
the translation, it's a bit too subtle for me!"

		     I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS MISTAKE !

	[An explanation (not an excuse): After composing my message
	about the article I looked for the translator's name and misread
	the line: "Translation of article by Bertrand Bonneau" as if the
	translation, not article, was by Bertrand Bonneau.

	I read it as: "Translation (of article) by Bertrand Bonneau"
	in stead of : "Translation of (article by Bertrand Bonneau)".

	RISKS readers are kindly asked not to submit contributions
	about "Risks in Using Languages with Ambiguous Syntax" and
	not to recommend using LISP as the ultimate solution.

In later issues of RISKS several contribution expressed strong
disagreements with what I submitted.  

One of the key points made by them that in this case (unlike many
others) as expressed in:
&gt;&gt; "The pilot and copilot survived the Mulhouse crash, and immediately
&gt;&gt; made statements implicating delays in engine acceleration (Times 27th
&gt;&gt; June 1988)". 

Another point is the rush to judgment motivated by the desire of the
French airlines/Industry/Government/etc., not to ground the aircraft.
This was expressed in:

&gt;&gt; "...the day after the accident, the DGAC announced a preliminary
&gt;&gt; conclusion that the pilots, and not the aircraft, were to blame for
&gt;&gt; the disaster. According to the French press, details of the flight
&gt;&gt; records were given to Aerospatiale, which announced that it had
&gt;&gt; confirmation that the aircraft was not at fault in the crash. Several
&gt;&gt; days later, the DGAC exonerated the mechanical performance of the
&gt;&gt; Airbus. The head of the DGAC, Daniel Tenenbaum, said that if this had
&gt;&gt; not been the case, it would have been necessary to ground the A320
&gt;&gt; for tests."

&gt;&gt; (And we couldn't have that, now, could we? :-)

&gt;&gt; [In fairness, I should add that I have spoken to a number of people
&gt;&gt; in the CAA and elsewhere who know a lot about flight certification
&gt;&gt; and about the Mulhouse accident in particular, who have assured me
&gt;&gt; that it *was* pilot error, but, as always, confidentiality prevented
&gt;&gt; them from saying *how* they knew that.]

Facts (that took very little time to find after the accident) included
that the pilots flew too slow and too low (e.g., as I remember it the
pilots submitted plans for 100' and flew at 35'), that due to the high
pitch angle the pilots didn't see early enough the terrain into which
they flew, and that the pilot disconnected some of the safety systems
(some of RISKS readers complained later that it is not safe for an
aircraft system to allow manual override and disconnection -- [this was
probably submitted by non-pilots]).  All of that was confirmed by the
FDR.  [By the way, it shouldn't take more than just a few hours to read
the FDR.]

The surviving pilots (from the hospital) complained that it took too
long for the engines to regain their power.  Many consider the pilots'
statement to be too self-serving (what a surprise!).  It was the opinion
of many (including not only the FAA/NTSB-like organizations but many
people even in competing aircraft engine companies) that this delay was
well within the normal response of such an engine.

Based on the above the aircraft was cleared ("un-grounded").

History didn't prove this decision to be wrong.

P.S., About the timeliness of Aircraft Accident investigation reports:
      The NTSB report about the UAL DC-10 crash at Des Moines, Iowa,
      on July-19-89, is not out yet (as of June-15-90).

        Nearly twenty years ago a full text electronic database of legal
opinions named OBAR was released upon the world.  Each word (except for common
ones like `the' or 'is') in each opinion included in the database was placed in
an inverse file with a pointer to where that word appeared in the database.
This allowed for rapid on-line boolean searching for cases containing certain
specified terms.  Thus a search for "cat and (dog or hound)" would produce a
list of all opinions in the database in which the word `cat' appeared together
with the word `dog' or the word `hound' (or both).  This OBAR system has grown
over the years into the Lexis system (including the Nexis collection of
newspaper and magazine articles) run by Mead Data Central which is the largest
fulltext documentary database in the world.

        I have always assumed that the two major risks associated with
using this system are: 1.) the fact that a document might not have been
entered into the database or, if it was entered, that it might have been
entered incorrectly and 2.) the tendency of a user who found a bunch of
documents (that seem to be what is wanted) to assume that _all_ the
relevant documents had been found.  Type II errors--documents found that
are not what one wants, i.e., false positives--are easy to spot on Lexis
and similar systems, but type I errors--documents that should have been
found, but weren't--simply don't show up in a search.

        On last Wednesday, however, I realized that I had been rather
naive.  On that day I ran a bunch of searches in the United States
Supreme Court Library on Lexis each of which was in the form:
"ENTITLEMENT and DATE(BEF 1/1/19x0) and DATE(AFT 12/31/19y0)" where
y=x+1.  Each of these searches should have produced a list of all the
opinions of the United States Supreme Court during a particular decade
that contained the word `entitlement'.  (Actually, since the date field
in the Lexis database contains the date of argument as well as the date
of decision, there would be some overlapping of the cases in the various
lists, but this is easily adjusted for.)  But that is not what I got.
Instead I got identical lists for the 1940's and 1950's and both of
these lists contained the same documents--which were, to make thing's
worse, opinions handed down in the 1980's.

        I reported this to one of our research librarians who tried to
make the same searches and got the same results.  She then phoned Lexis's
customer representatives who in turn made the same searches and got the
same results.  The customer representatives thanked our librarian for
brining this interesting situation to their attention and promised to
phone her back.

        And they did phone her back quite promptly.  It seems that Lexis
had installed new searching software back in May sometime and that this
new software has a bug in it when doing date delimited searches.  They
hope that it will be fixed in a couple of weeks.

        I suppose I was lulled into a false sense of complacency because
I have used this system for over 20 years and because its boolean
searching capabilities have always seemed to me too primitive to be
buggy.  But now I wonder how many lawsuits have been won or lost--or how
many law review articles have contained worthless data--because of
defects in the searching software rather than the user's searching
strategy.

        This particular example involved Lexis, but now I worry also
about its competitor Westlaw and about all the other textual databases
such as Dialog.  Have similar problems ever arisen with the many on-line
scientific databases?

According to the AP, a newspaper in Malaysia reports that a bank
executive ``cracked'' the bank's computer security system, and
transferred money from some clients' accounts to his own.  The loss
was discovered by an audit, and he had made himself conspicuous by
buying several expensive new cars.  The executive allegedly looted
$1.5 million.

	Saturday night someone exiting an office 60 feet away from mine
discovered the hallway full of acrid fumes; they ran choking down the stairs
to get away. They called Stanford Health and Safety, who came with air-sampling
meters and identified my office as the source. By this time the whole building
reeked; people were getting headaches from the fumes. The Health and Safety
people thought the fumes smelled like bromoform, a common chemical used in
analyzing rock samples that we've had problems with before when a fumehood
malfunctioned. But there are no fume hoods on my floor, which perplexed them.
(No windows either, even though we're on the 4th floor; Stanford's red tile
roofs take precedence over student offices having windows. The extremely poor
air circulation on our floor is a continual cause of complaints from the
students here.)

	Since it was my office I was called at home; they were trying to
puzzle out how dangerous chemicals could be getting into my office. Fortunately
we were able to point them on the right track immediately: the source of the
toxic fumes was my Color Sun 3-110 monitor! How were we so sure? Because the
same thing happened a year previously to a similar Sun monitor on our floor!
That time it wasn't on a weekend, so the building circulation was in higher
gear, and the building happened to be empty so when people arrived most of the
fumes had dispersed. Still, last time that office was unuseable for a couple
of days. This time, a day after the event my office still gives me a headache
within a minute or two of entering, and makes my eyes sting. The Health and
Safety people carted my Sun monitor away in a sealed plastic bag used for
carrying "hazardous material"!

	Stanford Health and Safety was quite concerned about this incident.
There are a LOT of Sun workstations around here. They've never heard of this
happening before, and want to find out more about this "risk of workstations".
So:
	1) Has anybody else out there had this happen? Since we only have
about 15 Suns, and it's happened to two of them now, it seems it must be
pretty common. But if that's true why hasn't Health and Safety heard of this
happening at Stanford before? Is it just because we have such bad ventilation
here? Perhaps the computer scientist types who have most of the workstations
on campus never work with dangerous chemicals, so they always just open the
windows and forget about it?
	2) What IS that nasty chemical? Health and Safety take anything that
gives near instant eye burn and headaches VERY seriously. Will I have bury
all my books in a toxic waste dump?

	Too bad, and I was just learning to type slowly enough so that my
Sun keyboard wouldn't go "click" and eat a random character or two every other
sentence...

With regard to the imprisonment of Nicholas Whiteley for 4 months, and the
Computer Misuse Bill currently going through parliament, it is worth noting:

- Whiteley was convicted on four charges of malicious damage to property.
  This offence has nothing specifically to do with computers: you can be
  charged with the same thing for breaking down the fence of the local swimming
  pool (as a colleague of a friend of mine found to his cost after he decided
  to go for a midnight swim after a party).

- The provisions contained in the Computer Misuse Bill would not have assisted
  in his detection or conviction. It is possible that the charge sheet could
  have been made longer: separate charges of i) unauthorised access,
  ii) unauthorised access in furtherance of a more serious crime (i.e. damage),
  and iii) the damage itself. Whether this would have attracted a more severe
  sentence is doubtful. The prosecution claimed that the cost of the damage
  was 25K pounds sterling. If that amount was believed by the court, and it
  still led to four months only, it is difficult to believe that the addition
  of the ancillary charges would have caused the judge to take a more serious
  view of the case.

- It is also difficult to see how the amendment proposed by Emma Nicholson,
  to increase police powers of telephone surveillance, would have assisted
  in his capture.

Far from indicating the need for new anti-hacking laws with tougher sentences
and more loosely-defined offences, this case goes to show that where hackers
actually do damage, the existing laws are adequate, and that the main problem
is, and will remain, that of catching them.

Subject: A320 near-disaster (from RISKS 1-2-34)
Date: 18 Jun 90 19:29:31 GMT
Posted: Mon Jun 18 14:29:31 1990

This is from the French science biweekly "Mon Dieu"  Translated and reprinted
without permission:

"TOULOUSE,
French aviation authorities here admitted to a near-disaster which occured
about a month ago aboard an Airbus A320 jetliner.  The controversial aircraft
with its 'fly-by-wire' flight controls has been the subject of intense
controversy since its introduction.  The manufacturer, a consortium of
European interests, has steadfastly maintained the aircraft's inherent safety
over other aircraft, largely as a result of the computerized controls which
limit inputs from the pilots to ensure they are always compatible with
the current aerodynamic state of the plane.  Pilots and other pundits have
argued that these same safeguards can severely limit the crew's options
in emergency conditions.  Additionally, they argue that the increased
faith placed in the on-board computers leads to crew complacency and
inattentiveness.

"The incident in question took place while the aircraft, a British Airways
plane, was at cruise between New York and Fairbanks.  The co-pilot was
apparently entering new navigational data into the craft's INS (Inertial
Navigation System) when he misstyped a code.  The INS came back with
'Invalid PIN number selected' and returned the craft's weight and balance
data to the astonished crew.  'We tried several more times," exclaimed
Reginald Dwight, the Captain, 'and every time it was the same thing.  On
the third try it said "Access violation, contact your credit institution if
you believe there is an error."  At that point all the plane's controls
froze and it refused to respond to our commands.  We didn't know what to
do, so we got on the radio."

:British Airway's mechanics were equally dumbfounded and decided to call
French mechanics.  France's Aerospatial is the prime contractor for the
aircraft.  'The French were totally rude to us,' stated an unnamed
BA mechanic. 'They stated the problem was our fault and that "the pasty
little Englishman probably had too many meat pies and Guiness".'  'It wasn't
until we told them that Jerry Lewis was aboard the flight that they became
concerned.'

"French mechanics traced the problem to the ATM-6000 INS computer, which was
a modified version of a computer used in the United States for bank
transactions.  'Essentially, the INS decided that the co-pilot was trying
to rip-off someone and locked the controls.'  French authorities then assured
the English crew that the system would automatically remove the restrictions
at the start of the next banking day.  'We told them that we would be in the
sea by then!' exclaimed the frustrated copilot, Nigel Whitworth.

"A French team, headed by Bertrand Swatboutie, determined that manual control
of the plane could be re-established if a crewmember went back to the
tailcone and operated the elevators manually.  The rudder is linked by
backup cables to the cockpit and with the crewmember operating the
elevator they determined they would have enough control.  'There is nothing
wrong with ze plane,' exclaimed Swatboutie, 'that a little pinch in the
rear will not cure.  Just like a woman.  If these English souffres knew
anything about women, they would never have had to call us in the first
place.'

"The plane was able to safely land at Denver's Stapelton airport, where the
craft was repaired and all crewmember's credit histories reviewed."

        Recently, my wife was taken to a local hospital (which shall
remain nameless) for uncontrolled bleeding after a cut in the kitchen.
(She seems to be fine now, but the cut required 3 stiTches.)  While we
were waiting to see the doctor on duty, we saw a man wearing a
stethoscope coming in the admitting room to try to fix the printer
used to print admission and insurance forms.  We later found out that
he was the doctor seeing patients that day for the emergency room.
Another patient waiting had a possible concussion.

The risks are obvious.

The June 18th issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology has a half-page
article on two problems the Hubble Space Telescope has been having.

One problem is that some RAM used by the fine guidance system is being 
scrambled when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly,
a region representing a "dip" in the Van Allen Belts that has been
known to be hazardous to spacecraft electronics for decades.  This happens
for a ten minute period during every 98-minute orbit.  The NASA deputy 
project manager of the HST, Jean Olivier, said that they had evaluated
the radiation effects very carefully, but that they had apparently
miscalculated.

The data in the RAM is supplied, according to the article, by the
telescope's Rockwell Autonetics DF-224 general purpose computer.  The
magnetic core memory used by the Rockwell computer is not considered to
be susceptible to disruption by radiation.  Olivier said that the Rockwell
computer can be programmed to refresh the RAM ten times a second, with the
result being that a completely new set of parameters in the fine guidance
sensor electronics would be calculated every five seconds, thereby eliminating
the problem.

The second problem is with the telescope's solar arrays.  Analyses done in
Europe and the United States sugest that the poles that hold the solar
arrays in place, called bistems, bow under a 50F degree temperature gradient,
causing the ends of the arrays to move about ten inches, resulting in their
oscillating for up to six minutes.  Olivier said that the solution is to
program the spacecraft's magnetic torquers to apply counteracting forces.

I don't know if this counts as a Risk or not, except for programmers
(such as myself) who occasionally fall into the trap of "Nobody'll
ever need a line longer than N characters."

In RISKS-FORUM Digest Volume 10 : Issue 02, the following paragraph
appears:

--- Begin included paragraph ---
Although what have come to be called the "Chirac flight" and the "Habsheim
affair" are the two facts most known to the public, the first year of operation
of the A320 has been marked by numerous incidents which have directly called
into question certain systems on the aeroplane. Often badly received by the
first crews qualified on this aircraft, and sometimes vigorously denied by the
technical directors of the launching companies, these incidents lead one to ask if the manufacturers and the certification authorities have not proceeded a
little too quickly.
--- End included paragraph ---

Those of us looking at that on an 80-column screen see nothing wrong,
but I chanced to be using a wider screen and saw that the line which
begins "technical directors" actually wraps around to the next on-screen
line and ends with "not proceeded a" - a total of 155 chars + newline.

No, my editor of choice had no trouble with it, but I can think of
several programs which do text handling which would.

Story 1.
I don't have a newspaper citation for this story -- I heard it on the
phone last night while talking with a friend in Atlanta.

It appears that in north Fulton County, Atlanta, a water main broke
inside one of the pumping stations.  The resulting flood damaged 4 of
the main pumps and they had to be taken offline.  The area was without
normal water pressure for a few days, and some places were completely
without water.

The Risk?  Well, the computer center where they have the machines
running the Avail ATM network for Atlanta was in that area.  And they
evidently depend on the public water system for cooling (either the
building or the machines themselves -- it wasn't clear to my friend
from the news reports).  The center had to be shut down until normal
water service was restored, thus "un-Availing" ATM customers
throughout the Atlanta area.

Story 2.

At 4am on the 7th of this month, a 14" water main broke in one of the
service tunnels here on campus.  Unfortunately, it broke in a tunnel
connected to the campus computing center (conveniently located in the
basement of one of the buildings).  What happened next was nasty.
In the words of George Goble of our ECN staff:

&gt; I heard there was eventually 2-3' of water down there, about 500,000 Gal,
&gt; more than the city swimming pool. Gives a new meaning to "floating point
&gt; overflow", and "source pool", etc.  Water came in so fast, it went up at
&gt; 1-2" per min, and the mech equipment room (with 100HP motors for air
&gt; handling, etc) became submerged while in operation.. no more motors!
&gt; 480V running around everywhere, 12KV in the (flooded) tunnels!
&gt;
&gt; There were reports of Macintoshes and PC's starting to submerge, and
&gt; water blowing out the fans, and fire/smoke coming out the power supplies.
&gt; Floor tiles were floating down the hallway, until they bumped into
&gt; something, releasing trapped air, and sank.  There was a pallet or
&gt; two of water softener salt stored in the basement also, I heard some
&gt; PC's had only the plastic remaining, as the salt/corrision had eaten
&gt; away the metal.  Early on, someone said they saw an elevator which
&gt; had stopped at the basement, go up one floor, open its doors, and
&gt; 3' of water poured out on ground floor.

The service tunnels out of that building were also flooded, and helped
carry the water into the basements of nearby buildings.  That's good,
in one sense, or the water would have gotten much deeper in the
computing center.

Then, to make the whole situation even better, the folks who were
pumping stuff out used gasoline powered pumps that filled the entire
Math/Science building with carbon monoxide leading the police to
cordon off the building and prevent anyone from getting to their
offices.  This included the Math &amp; Stat departments, the math sciences
library, and the Dean and his staff.

Amazingly enough, some of the networks and machines were up and in
normal operation by the end of the weekend.  This was good, because
the networks coming into campus are routed through that complex.

Luckily, our CS computer room is on the 2nd floor of another building,
and our ECN computer center is across campus.  Other sites, similarly
isolated were also unscathed.


Morals:
1.  Basements are not the best place to keep your computers
2.  Depending on outside water (or lack thereof) to keep your machines
running can be a mistake.
3.  If you do pipeline processing, be sure to check for overflow!

If RISKS editorial policy is to publish hoaxes, jokes and elaborate fictitious
accounts of non-events, at any time of the year *without* explicit warning,
then its purpose will have been undermined.

The article by Gregory Travis of Indiana "University" about the A320 may have
been jolly good humourous nonsence, but it was presented as a genuine RISK.
There are other news groups and mailing lists for jokes.  RISKS is for RISKS!

Which introduces another abuse of information technology:  when is an
article in RISKS a real RISK?  How many other published articles have 
been mere hoaxes?  How are we to know?

I think an explanation is required.

I am very sorry for any confusion.  I inadvertently deleted the line that said
that the message was from rec.humor.  (I'm glad only a few of you took it
seriously, although I am also sorry to besmirch my own efforts to provide
incisive and consistent moderation.)  Too bad that the tale was not
sufficiently outrageous that it could not have been true!

I was editing remotely under tight time pressures.  I also omitted from the
Contents of the issue Steve Bellovin's item on computer security problems in
Malaysia, also attributable to the same editing difficulties.  Editing through
an imperfect terminal emulator can be quite risky.

The latest issue of the Whole Earth Review has an article ("Perpetual
Novelty") about the growing "artificial life" movement, which works to
create computer simulations of artificial beings, with rather
far-fetched and grandiose long-term goals.  I was particularly struck by
the discussion of the idea that some of these people have to release
lots of relatively dumb robots and simply let them evolve.  Talking
about one researcher's goals, the article says:

He wants to flood the world (and beyond) with inexpensive, small,
ubiquitous thinking things.  He's been making robots that weigh less
than 10 pounds.  The six-legged walker weighs only 3.6 pounds.  It's
constructed of model-car parts.  In three years, he'd like to have a 1mm
(pencil tip-size) robot.  He has plans to invade the moon with a fleet
of shoe-box-size robots that can be launched from throw-away rockets. 
It's the ant strategy:  send an army of dispensable, limited agents
coordinated on a task, and set them loose.  Some will die, most will
work, something will get done.  In the time it takes to argue about one
big sucker, he can have his invasion built and delivered.  The motto: 
"Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control."

I think that about says it all.  The risks should be obvious, at least
to the people who read RISKS.

Update on the progress in the Alcor/email case as of June, 1990
(originally reported in comp.risks)
 
by H. Keith Henson 
 
A suit under section 2707 of U.S.C. title 18 (the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act) against a number of individuals in the Riverside, California
Coroner's office, the District Attorney's office, and the Riverside police
department was filed Jan. 11, 1990, one day short of the statutory limit.
There were 15 plaintiffs out of roughly 50 people who had email on the Alcor
system.  For those of you who are not familiar with the case, the coroner
removed a number of computers from Alcor in connection with an investigation
into the cryonic suspension of Dora Kent in December of 1987.
 
The defendants moved in March for a dismissal of the case, arguing that 1) the
warrant for the computer was enough to take any email found within it, and 2)
that even if the defendants had made "technical" errors in confiscating the
email, they should be protected because they acted in "good faith."
 
Our lawyer opposed the motion, arguing that the warrant originally used was
itself defective, even for taking the computers.  This is something Alcor had
never done, because (I think) people can only object to a warrant after charges
have been filed, and for all the accusations the coroner and DA made in the
press (which included murder, drugs, theft, and building code violations), no
charges have been filed in this case in the last two and a half years.
 
The federal judge assigned to the case denied the motion after hearing oral
arguments in May.  Based on the comments of the judge from the bench, it seems
that he agrees that the plaintiffs have a case, namely that taking email
requires a warrant for the email, or the persons doing so will face at least
civil liability.
 
So far the legal bill stands at over $10,000.  Suggestions as to organizations
or individuals who might be interested in helping foot the bills would be
welcome.  (Donations would be returnable if we won the case and the county has
to pay our legal bills as required in section 2707.)
 
The text of the legal filings (40k, three files) have been posted to CuD.  If
you can't get CuD, they are available by email from hkhenson@cup.portal.com

Subject: "Unbreakable Math Code Finally Broken"

[The following article appeared in the 06/20 Columbus (Ohio) Post Dispatch,
 credited to the Washington Post.]

Two mathematicians, working with hundreds of colleagues, announced yesterday
that they had broken a code viewed by many cryptographers and security experts
as virtually impenetrable.  The feat, in which the mathematicians factored one
of the world's ``most wanted'' numbers, means that many security-minded
organizations will need to change their cryptographic systems to prevent
security breaches.

"In the long run, mathematical breakthroughs like this will make everyone more
cautious about how far one must go to keep a message private," said Arjen
Lenstra of Bellcore, the research arm of the major regional telephone
companies.  Lenstra, with Mark Manasse of Digitial Machine Corp., successfully
factored a 155-digit number, a feat many mathematicians had believed to be
prohibitively difficult.

Cryptographic systems are used to encode messages and data before they are sent
among banks, corporations, governments, the military -- anyone wishing to avoid
having computerized mail perused by outsiders.  The sender encodes messages
using a many-digit number that would be difficult or impossible to factor.
[...]  Only someone who knows the factors of the large number can decode the
message.  Until now, it was thought virtually impossible to factor a number 155
digits long, and many cryptographic systems used numbers that long to encode
their messages.

The work of Lenstra and Manasse, and hundreds of mathematicians who plugged the
Bellcore program into their computers at night to solve additional parts of the
problem, changes the game.  Lenstra now says security-minded users must now
find numbers greater than 200 digits to feel safe.  Lenstra and Manasse,
chewing up the equivalent of 275 years of computer time, found that the
155-digit number could be factored by a 7-digit number, a 49-digit number, and
a 99-digit number.

  [This certainly points up the risks of supercomputers and high-precision
  math, not to mention the risks of the press reporting on computer-related
  topics.      :-) -- jab]

An electronic mail system should not tamper with the contents of the messages
which it conveys. However, when sending messages via Unix electronic mail, any
line starting with "From" in the body of the message has a "&gt;" prepended to it
to avoid the line being confused with a "From" line in the header which is used
to delimit messages in a mail box file. However, such lines are not that
uncommon in text.  Source text for publication is now more and more routinely
being sent via e-mail, and any changes in the message could easily end up being
printed since it is often assumed that the text has already been proof-read.

As an example of this, see the paper "Some comments on the
assumption-commitment framework for compositional verification of distributed
programs" by Paritosh Pandya, in "Stepwise Refinement of Distributed Systems",
Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science no 430, pp622-640. On pages
626, 630 and 636 three paragraphs start with a "From" and have an upside-down
"?" just beforehand. (This is what the LaTeX document preparation system
transforms "&gt;" to in the standard font.)    [...]

Recently I posted an article about a DEC RA90 disk failure that we had
in February, and said that DEC had not notified customers of the
problem.  I have since found out from our lab staff that DEC *did*
notify customers.  It looks like I screwed up, not DEC.

Prior to our failures, and several others that occurred at about
the same time, DEC believed that, of the drives with serial numbers
in the ``possibly affected'' range, either they failed when brand new,
or they were ``safe''.  Ours were among the first ``midlife failures''.
In response, I understand that DEC replaced all RA90s with serial
numbers in the ``possibly affected'' range, even though only 2% of
these drives ever experienced failures.

So DEC 1, me zero.

Also, my original posting had deserved a followup anyway, but doubly so
in this case:  I had included a disclaimer in my original message, but
the RISKS moderator clipped it off when he compiled the digest.  When I
saw that, I considered posting a RISKS article about the risk of losing
disclaimers, but decided against the extra traffic.  Wrong again....

Here are excerpts from THE SEATTLE POST INTELLIGENCER, March 22, 1990, p. B7:

BOEING TASK FORCE TACKLES PROBLEMS WITH THE 747-400 by Bill Richards

After a year on the job, Boeing's newest jumbo jet, the 747-400, has piled up
more mechanical delays at the departure gate than any of the company's
jetliners since the first 747 went into service 20 years ago.

Boeing officials said yesterday they knew about problems with two especially 
troublesome pieces of equipment --- a computerized power unit used to start the
plane's engines and a computer that spots maintenance problems --- but decided
to sell the jumbos anyway.  ...

(Boeing official Robert A.) Davis said the problem with the 400's engine power
unit was caused by unusual sensitivity in the unit's digital monitoring system. 
If the plane switches from ground power to auxilliary power to engine power in
the wrong sequence, the engines shut down and must be restarted, which results
in a delay at the gate, he said.

Boeing engineers were aware of the problem during the plane's flight tests,
said Davis, but decided to maintain the plane's sales schedule and troubleshoot
later.  

Boeing also discovered a problem with the plane's central maintenance computer
during flight tests.  The computer, which keeps track of equipment malfunctions
in 75 separate systems when the plane is on the ground, was not "fully
debugged" when Boeing began delivering its first 400's last year, Davis said.

The 400's performance record lagged so badly behind previous jetliner models
that the company formed a special task force last month to whip the plane into
shape.  Davis, who heads the task force, said the unit has started improving
the 400's "dispatch reliability rate," the measure of how frequently the planes
are delayed more than 15 minutes at the boarding gate because of mechanical
malfunctions.

Davis said none of the problems encountered in the 400 could cause the plane to
be unsafe to operate.  But Boeing has received complaints "across the board"
from airlines that own the jetliner, Davis said.

Boeing said it expects to cure the glitches in the 400 by making changes on its
production line next month. ... So far, about 20 of the (57) 400's already in
operation have been retrofitted since October.  After the modifications, Boeing
said, delays of the 400's due to mechanical problems dropped to almost zero.

The 400's reliability rate is currently running at 94.5 percent.  That compares
with a reliability rate of about 97 percent for Boeing's 767, whch Davis said
has "roughly the same technical elements" as the larger 400.  Boeing, said
Davis, had expected the 747-400 to parallel the 767's  reliability rate. ...

Here are excerpts from THE SEATTLE TIMES, June 23, 1990, p. A11:

BOEING DENIES RECALL OF JET SOFTWARE --- Associated Press

Seattle --- A Boeing Co. spokeswoman yesterday denied a report by a Japanese
news service that the aircraft manufacturer was recalling some cockpit computer
software for its new 747-400 jumbo jets. ... 

Kyodo News Service reported that on April 3, a pair of flight management
computers on a Japan Airlines 747-400 failed to function when the plane was
preparing to land in Seoul.   

JAL officials would not confirm the reported Boeing recall, but said both
flight management computers on the JAL plane briefly failed to function
properly as the plane was approaching the South Korean airport. ...

Kyodo, quoting unidentified industry sources, said yesterday that there was a
programming problem in software for the 747-400's flight management computer,
which controls such functions as navigation and flight planning.

The sources said Boeing would replace the software with an improved version
after receiving permission from the Federal Aviation Administration, Kyodo
reported. ... 

"There has been no recall of FMC software," said Liz Reese, Boeing Commericial
Airplane Group spokeswoman.  Boeing is, however, in the process of issuing an
updated version of the software, something it does about every six months as
part of a regular plan for all 747-400 operators, she said.   

The scheduled upgrade is separate from another Boeing program to fix bugs that
appeared in software for other 747-400 computer systems, Reese said. ... In
addition to the FMC, other computers monitor such things as the aircraft's
environment, engines and maintenance needs. ...  (When) the  new jumbo jet went
into service last year, operators reported "really nagging, minor
problems," with bugs in some computer software, Reese said.  In some cases, the
software was sending out "nuisance messages," or reporting problems that didn't
exist, she said.  Boeing formed the "747-400 Task Force" with the operators to
correct the problems and has been sending out improved software to fix the
bugs, she said. .... 

The 747-400, the world's largest passenger aircraft, is distinctive ... for its
use of highly sophisticated computer systems that permit a flight crew of two,
with no flight engineer. ...  Introduction of the 747-400's was delayed from
1988 to early 1989.  Boeing said it fell behind (...for various reasons,
including) the plane's new electronic cockpit took longer than expected...

    I'm afraid Robert Dorsett is mistaken when he states "And nobody's
crashed a 757/767 yet. . ."  On July 23, 1983, a 767 operating as Air
Canada Flight 143 crashed at Gimli, Manitoba.  That crash may well
have been a proper "risk"  subject.  It seems the plane ran out of
fuel while at 41,000 feet because someone inputted the wrong fuel load
quantity to one of the flight computers.
    This crash was well dramatized in "Freefall", by William and Marilyn
Hoffer, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1983.

I understand Keith Dancey's complaint about the "labelling" of articles,
and I appreciate that some of the articles are often outlandish enough
to provoke disbelief in their veracity. But it seems as if one of the
greatest risks facing us today is the loss of a sense of humor (as well
as a sense of proportion). Without intending anything personal, I cannot 
conceive of anyone reading the original article without realizing it to 
be a joke. Save us from a world where everything is labelled in advance
so we can decide in advance how to react!

In RISKS 10.11 there appeared a Washington Post article beginning as follows:

&gt;Two mathematicians, working with hundreds of colleagues, announced yesterday
&gt;that they had broken a code viewed by many cryptographers and security experts
&gt;as virtually impenetrable.  The feat, in which the mathematicians factored one
&gt;of the world's ``most wanted'' numbers, means that many security-minded
&gt;organizations will need to change their cryptographic systems to prevent
&gt;security breaches.

I don't know if this is another case of deliberate distortion in order to make
things sound sensational or a misunderstanding by a reporter who doesn't
understand the subject.  In any case, it's grossly inaccurate.  According to
experts in the field, what Lenstra and Manasse (the two mathematicians who
organized the factoring project) actually did was to factor a 155-digit number
HAVING A VERY SPECIAL PROPERTY, namely one that equals a^b + c where a and c
are small (in this case a=2, b=512, c=1).  The method used (a specialized
version of the Number Field Sieve algorithm) does NOT apply to other numbers
(which would be necessary in order to break a cipher such as RSA), and if
another method, the Quadratic Sieve algorithm, were used, it is estimated that
it would require 6.7 x 10^19 operations to factor a number of such length,
which would take over 20 years if you had a machine which could perform 100
billion operations per second.
  So the statements that an impenetrable code has been broken and that
organizations need to change their cryptographic systems because of this
achievement seem a wee bit exaggerated.

A reprize on the 'burning your bridges' method of software/hardware upgrades...

Recently, a DEC software distribution required that all RA90 drives
connected to an HSC (Hierarchical Storage Controller) were required to be
at least at MicroCode Version MV10.  Mine was at MV7 so I requested an
DEC Field Service Service Call to replace the microcode.  I was surprised
to see that the this was really just software load off a special Zero Insertion
Force slot on the RA90's console board.  Just plug it in, hit the down-load  
command and the firmware is loaded (btw, the module was very sexy in its
special plastic mount ;-).

The FS person proceeded to do the download.  It failed on the verify pass.  

Repeating the procedure generated the same result.  The DEC FS person asked
nicely if he could try the other R0A90 drive to see it would work there.  I
just as nicely said no, thank you. 


Since the procedure apparently erased the EEPROM containing the old microcode,
the drive was essentially broke.  DEC has neglected to provide a 'backup'. Old
firmware revisions left you with the old chips, or a floppy (ala 11/780 WCS
upgrades) that contained the original downloaded binary.  This new procedure
apparently was not thought to be 'risky'.

Since it was 5pm, and the disk was a scratch disk, we went home for the
evening, or so I thought.  My FS person actually drove 2 hours to get the local
DEC disk expert out of bed and down to the office to shake out the problem.  He
got home at 1am (confirmed.  I happen to live next door to my FS person...
sometimes handy, but our wives don't care for it that much ;-).

DEC's drive people confirmed that the data path from the load module to the
EEPROM does not have a non-destructive self-test, and probably in our case 
had a broken part somewhere along the path.  The only quick fix was to send  
down a new board, with good firmware on it, and replace the other parts  
(console module, and data cable), and hope everything was fixed.

The next morning we tried two boards.  One 'old model' (fits only the RA90) did
not fit (??).  The new RA90/92 board, worked fine.  Since there were at least 2
other parts that could cause the firmware load to fail, and the only way to
test it was to risk destroying the working firmware with possibly no recovery
(DEC couldn't be sure on that), I vetoed any further testing, in lieu of a more
formal shakedown at some later date.  I got to the required rev, albeit over 17
hours after the upgrade started.

Given the amount of data on a RA90 (1.2 GB, 1.5+GB on a 92, which uses the same
procedure/hardware), the amount of downtime it causes when a firmware load
fails, it strikes me a a great risk to a) erase the eeprom first (given its
nature, putting an equal amount of dram and downloading to that, and if
successful, then loading to EEPROM would be a better solutions) and b) to not
have a 'backup' to roll out the eeprom data (again, a dram, or at least a write
command, which would essentially test the data transfer path in a
nondestructive manner).

A friend suggested I read the following message (once posted to the sci.med
newsgroup).

I think it should interest anyone who types a lot.

One point the author does not mention is that the "force-depression curve" of
your keyboard may also play a role.  It is better to have a linear relationship
between force and depression.  But the keys on some keyboards require greater
force to depress the first few millimeters than the last few.  This gives what
is sometimes hyped as "positive-touch" or something similar.  The net result is
that you have to press (relatively) hard to get over the "hump," then with the
low resistance beyond it, your fingers bang into the base with more force than
with "linear" keyboards.  People have suggested that this sort of dynamic may
aggravate or even induce CTS.  Many of our HPs have this "nonlinear" keyboards.
The keys on some Sun3 keyboards have become so sticky that they give the same
effect.

From: Andrea Frankel &lt;andrea@sdd.hp.com&gt;

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:

This is a slightly edited reposting; apologies if you've seen it before,
but many people who read this on an internal HP notes group have found
it useful and asked for it to be more widely distributed.

Disclaimer:  I am not a doctor (but I sometimes play one on the Net ;@).
This is from my own personal experience with the malady, supplemented by
a little research and lots of talking to doctors and such.  Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome is being seen more and more frequently among the
computer set (my neurologist jokingly refers to it as "hacker's hand");
when caught early, conservative treatment can completely cure it.
However, if you let it go on long enough you can cause irreversible
damage.  If you have any question at all, PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR!  Better
safe than sorry.

1.  The setup

The bones in your wrist form a 3-sided tunnel, with the fourth side
closed off by a very tough piece of cartilage.  In this carpal tunnel
run the tendons of the muscles which flex your fingers, as well as the
very important median nerve which ennervates the thumb and the first two
fingers.

If something happens to cause the contents of the tunnel to swell, or to
cause the tunnel itself to get smaller, the pressure exerted on the
median nerve results in carpal tunnel syndrome.  Pregnancy, sudden
weight gain, drugs which cause water retention, and repetitive overuse
(or abuse) which causes tendinitis in those flexor tendons, can all cause 
carpal tunnel syndrome.  (I recently learned that hypothyroid condition
can also cause CTS.)

Positions where the wrist is bent back while being used really
exacerbate the problem (e.g. bicycling with drop handlebars, if you are
not careful about hand positioning).  

Other things can contribute as well - if you are doing carpentry in your
spare time and twisting many screws by hand, for example.  When you
become aware of the problem, start becoming aware of both the wrist
position and the stresses on it in various activities.

The median nerve runs up the heel of the hand onto the palm, along the
"life line".  Direct repeated blows to this area can mimic or add to the
carpal tunnel syndrome, and are often lumped in with it.  Our HP
keyboards are awful in this respect.  Kayaking, bicycling, gardening
without heavy gloves, all sorts of things can bang on this exposed
nerve.

2.  The symptoms and diagnosis

Any or all of the following:  pain, numbness, tingling, or sensations of
fullness in the fingers, hands, or shooting up or down the arms.  

Quick test #1:  make an "O" with thumb and forefinger, insert the thumb
and forefinger of the other hand, and resist while trying to force the
"O" apart with the other hand.  The "O" should not come apart!

Quick test #2 (Tinnel sign):  place the backs of your hands together,
bend each hand 90 degrees towards the inner wrist, fingers pointing down
(forearms parallel to the floor, held out in front of you).

=======oo=========     key:  === forearms
       ||                    o   wrists
       ..                    |   metacarpals
       ..                    .   fingers

Press the backs of the hands together and hold for 30-60 seconds.  If
you start getting some numbness or tingling or pain, this is suspicious.

Loss of grip strength is a sign that you may have a more advanced case.
(I finally sought help when I was unable to open a can of tuna fish with
a standard Swingline manual can opener.)

I believe the best specialist for diagnosis is a neurologist.  A
neurologist will do nerve conduction studies, comparing rates of
conduction above and below the wrist, and between hands.  A good one
will also do electromyography, to see if the muscles enervated by the
nerve are firing properly or not.  (As a techie, I was fascinated to
watch the 'scopes while he poked me!)

3.  The treatment

Standard treatment is to start with the most conservative, least
invasive approaches, and move up only if they don't help.  The old
RICE formula - rest, ice, compression, and elevation - is the place
to start, but omit the compression as this is not a muscle strain.

A wrist splint (basically a velcro-and-ace-bandage type of thing with a
bent metal strip in it to hold the wrist in the right position) is worn
at night for a month to see if it helps; it can also be worn during the
day for stretches.  (Do not make it tight - it is for positioning only.)
In many cases, that plus correcting one's work habits is sufficient.
Some people find that a month is all it takes; others use the splint at
night for the rest of their lives, or off and on as needed.  I still use
mine occasionally when I've been overdoing it.  It's also a good idea to
wear it in situations where you might be tempted to do something silly
(like lugging suitcases or lifting weights), both as protection and as a
reminder to be careful.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. Motrin) are used, if it looks
like inflammation is a major cause of the problem.

Icing the wrist helps alot, both for the pain and the swelling.  (Be
aware that over-icing has a rebound effect as the body attempts to warm
the area by increasing circulation.  Best is to ice for 10-20 minutes
max each time, leaving at least an hour between icings.)  I keep a
couple of the soft gel-type blue ice packs in a little fridge near my
desk, so that I can ice several times a day if I need to.  Bags of
frozen peas work great (hit 'em a couple whacks on the counter to
loosen them up, then pat the bag around your wrist so it conforms
to the curves).  For obvious reasons, jacuzzis (especially if you
leave your arms in) will tend to make things worse.

If water retention is a problem, you might try a mild OTC diuretic.
(Women:  it isn't uncommon for CTS symptoms to be worse during PMS
time.)  Also, simply elevating the wrist (for example, resting it on the
back of a padded chair or car seat, or sleeping with your splinted wrist
wresting next to your head on the pillow) can help relieve some of the
discomfort at least temporarily by reducing the swelling.

As a long-time fan of vitamins, minerals, and Prevention magazine,
I of course asked my doctors about B6 as a treatment for CTS.
Unfortunately, the original article reporting success from B6 treatment
was not reproducible by other experiments.  What's more, excessive doses
of B6 (over 50 mg/day supplement to a normal diet) can actually cause
peripheral neuropathy, mimicking some of the symptoms of CTS.  My doctor
said it wouldn't hurt if I wanted to take up to 50 mg/day, but since I
had been taking that amount for quite some time for other reasons, he
advised against increasing it.

Some doctors go for cortisone injections, although mine cautioned that
the carrier substance is not well absorbed, and can actually make the
problem worse by increasing the fluid pressure in the tunnel.  Your doctor
will decide based on the type of CTS and how it is responding to other
treatment (or not).

The final stage is surgery.  I had mine a few years ago; if you're
facing it, I'd be glad to chat with you about it.  The surgery itself
was a piece of cake, taking maybe 10 minutes once I was fully prepped -
very simply, they slit that piece of cartilage along the "life line" and
onto the wrist, and it spreads apart before it heals up, making the
tunnel larger.  Instant relief, although the recovery and rehab takes a
couple months.  For those interested in such things, I talked them into
skipping general anaesthesia in favor of a Bier Block, which worked
splendidly - I was out of there and wolfing down antipasto and garlic
bread an hour after surgery.

A friend notes that not everybody who has had the surgery finds it a
piece of cake.  His advice would be to make sure you have absolutely the
best doctors when it come to surgery on one's hands, with which I heartily
concur!  Hands are incredibly complex, considering all the different types
of finely coordinated movement they are capable of (and all the muscles and
nerves that requires).  

I would strongly recommend that you look for an orthopedic surgeon who
is board certified in Hand Reconstruction Surgery - my scar is almost
invisible, compared to some pretty horrific looking ones I've seen.  (I
asked the neurologist, who was really top-notch, to look through my CCN
[preferred provider] booklet and recommend someone to me.)  An
orthopedic surgeon who handles a little bit of everything - shoulder
tears, knee arthroscopy, back problems - probably won't be as good at
carpal tunnel surgery as someone who spends their entire professional
life specializing in the elbow down.  For example, my surgeon stopped
the surface cut at the first wrist fold, lifted the skin, and continued
the surgery under the skin to minimize the scarring; other surgeons (who
don't specialize in hand reconstruction surgery) often don't think to do
that.  It doesn't affect how effective the surgery is, but it sure makes
a difference in how pretty your hand looks afterwards!

4.  The progression

The symptoms may come and go with heavy bouts of typing, bicycling, etc.
When it gets really bad, it can hurt all the time or start aching
spontaneously.

In the early stages, relieving the pressure on the median nerve will
quickly reverse the symptoms (in a matter of days to weeks).

Untreated, the pressure on the nerve will eventually cause it to die
back to the point of constriction.  When this happens, the muscles
atrophy.  (The large adductor which forms the mound at the base of my
thumb had shrunk to half its size by the time I was operated on.)

If you don't catch it quickly at that point, the nerve sheaths (which
the nerve had been inside before it died back) start to fray.  This is
bad news.  If you have surgery while the sheaths are still intact, the
nerve will grow back along the sheath (around 2 mm/day - you can
actually track it!)  and pretty much recover all of its connections and
functions.  I have a tiny patch less than 1/4" diameter on two finger
tips which is numb, and otherwise have full function back.  If the nerve
sheaths have frayed, however, the nerve can't find its way back to make
the right connections, and you're screwed.

IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME, GET IT LOOKED AT
*NOW*!!!  Don't delay, or you might not make a full recovery.  Workman's
comp studies looking at prognosis for recovery give very low odds,
based on most factory workers (who used to account for most of the CTS
claims before computeritis hit) being too macho or too scared of losing
their jobs to file a claim before it was too late.

5.  Prevention

The optimal position for your wrist is with the hand bent back just
20-30 degrees; you want the position where the front of your wrist
makes a straight line with the first inch of the heel of the palm.
Play with it a bit until you find the place where the wrist seems 
to be maximally "open", but without bending the hand back so far that
you feel strain.

Look down at your hands as you type - if you are dropping your wrists,
you are at risk.  Think about how they used to teach piano technique:  an
almost straight line along the back of the forearms, through the wrist, onto
the back of the hand; fingers dropping down.  (My sister's piano teacher
used to place pennies on the back of her hands while she played, to
teach keeping it level.)  Practice typing that way, and instead of
resting the heel of your hands on the edge of the keyboard when you're
thinking or reading, rest them in your lap instead.

I got a very nice padded wrist rest from a local office supply house,
that allows me to rest my forearms or wrists while I type in this
position; I have one under my 320 keyboard, and one for my Vectra.
You can also improvise by taking a length of bubblewrap, rolling it up
and securing the ends with rubber bands, then taping the roll to your
desk in front of the keyboard.  Warning:  this padded wrist rest can
actually make it worse for some people, if it distorts the normal typing
motion or presses too hard against the wrist.

I currently have a keyboard draw from Devoke (about $115) that has a
full 6" height adjustment, slides in and out and swings to both sides.
It mounts with two screws, and I have one in the "L" of my workstation
table at work, and on the desk at home where I have my PC.  This has
made the most difference when my CTS flared up again (along with rest
and splinting).

Wear padded gloves for anything which might bang on your hands.  Bicycling
gloves with Spenco pads can be used for many things (I wear mine ice
skating!).  The Spenco pads are definitely superior to leather or other
types when it comes to cushioning that area against shocks.  (After the
surgery, I was warned that the median nerve would always be a bit more
exposed and sensitive, and it definitely made me a connoisseur of bicycling
gloves!)

Learn to back off when you realize you're about to lift or torque
something heavy with your wrist bent.  If you can't rethink the movement
so you can keep your wrist straight, get help (person or tool)!

I only request that you not delete anything, especially the disclaimer.

MESSAGE FROM RON RIVEST VIA JIM BIDZOS VIA STEVE KENT VIA STEVE CROCKER:
Thanks to Robert Silverman for keeping many people honest.
As an additional effort to that end, I attach an analysis of
the recent factoring effort, done by Ron Rivest.  The early 
reports of RSA's demise have been greatly exaggerated...
Note: Be sure and read the end of Rivest's note.
Jim Bidzos, RSA Data Security

To:	Whom It May Interest (Feel free to distribute further...)
From:	Ronald L. Rivest
Date:	June 21, 1990
Re:	Recent Factoring Achievement
	(Preliminary draft; may contain typos or other inaccuracies.
	Please send corrections to rivest@theory.lcs.mit.edu)

This note is in response to the numerous inquiries I've received regarding
the recent factoring of a 155-digit number by A. Lenstra, M. Manasse, and
others.  (See the New York Times article of 6/20/1990 by G. Kolata.) 
This note attempts specifically to correct some of the misimpressions that
may arise from a reading of such popular press articles.

Using an ingenious new algorithm, Lenstra, Manasse, and others have
factored the 155-digit number known as "F9", the ninth Fermat number:
		F9 = 2^(2^9) + 1 = 2^(512) + 1 .
In binary, this number has the form
		100000....000000001
where there are 511 zeros altogether.  (F9 is a 513-bit number.)
This is a fascinating development, and the researchers involved are to be
congratulated for this accomplishment.

The algorithm used is known as the "number field sieve", or "NFS" (not
to be confused with a network protocol of the same acronym!).  The NFS
algorithm is described in the Proceedings of the 1990 ACM STOC Conference.
The NFS algorithm is based on an idea due to Pollard, as developed further by
Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik W. Lenstra, and Mark S. Manasse.

The NFS algorithm is specifically designed to factor numbers that,
like F9, have a very simple structure: they are of the form
		a^b + c 
where c is relatively small.  (For F9, we have a=2, b=512, and c=1.)
Some simple extensions of this algorithm are also possible, to handle
numbers whose binary representation has many zeros, and related kinds
of numbers (ternary, etc.)  Numbers that have such a special structure are
extremely rare and are unlikely to be encountered by chance.  That is,
the NFS algorithm does not apply to the kind of "ordinary" numbers that
arise in practical cryptography, such as using RSA.  They only apply to
numbers with "sparse" representations having few nonzero components.
(Let us call such numbers "rarefied".)

When working on a rarefied number, the NFS algorithm has an estimated
running time of the form (for an input number n):
		exp(1.56 (ln n)^1/3 (ln ln n)^2/3)			(1)
For n = F9, this evaluates to 
		4.1 x 10^15 operations,
which, at 3.15 x 10^13 operations/year for a 1 MIP/sec machine (i.e. a
MIP-year), gives a workload estimate of
		130 MIP-years,
only off by a factor of two from the actual work of 275 MIP-years. (That is,
formula (1) may be roughly too low by a factor of two.)

It is instructive to see the effect of doubling the size of the number
being dealt with.  A 1024-bit (332-digit) rarefied number requires an estimated
		1.54 x 10^21 operations
	=	4.9 x 10^7 MIP-years,
a dramatic increase in difficulty.  The NFS algorithm algorithm is not a
"polynomial-time" algorithm; the difficulty of factoring still grows
**exponentially** with a polynomial function of the length of the input.

What has this to do with RSA and cryptography?  I think there are three
basic points:
	-- This development indicates that the status of factoring is
	   still subject to further developments, and it is wise to be
	   conservative in one's choice of key-length.
	-- The NFS algorithm may yet be generalized to handle "ordinary"
	   numbers, and the potential impact of this should be considered.
	-- Factoring is still a very hard problem, despite everyone's best
	   efforts to master it.

Regarding the further extensions of NFS to handle ordinary numbers, this is
judged to be a reasonable possibility by those working on NFS, so it is 
helpful to consider what impact this may have.

It is conjectured (see the ACM STOC paper referenced above) that a successful
extension of the NFS algorithm to ordinary numbers would have a running time
of the form:
		exp(2.08 (ln n)^1/3 (ln ln n)^2/3)			(2)
This is similar to equation (1) except that the constant 1.56 is
replaced by the constant 2.08.  Note that a practical version of such
an extension does NOT yet currently exist (to the best of my
knowledge), but even granting its plausibility we arrive at an
estimate of the tie required to factor a 512-bit number of
		6.5 x 10^20 operations
	= 	2 x 10^7 MIP-years
which (in my opinion) is a substantial degree of security.  It is 
interesting to note that this work factor is actually GREATER than that
required by the ``standard'' factoring algorithms (e.g., the quadratic sieve),
which have a running time of
		exp((ln n)^1/2 (ln ln n)^1/2);
for a 512-bit number, this gives a work-factor estimate of only
		6.7 x 10^19 operations.
Indeed, the NFS algorithm (when extended) will be asymptotically superior than
the quadratic sieve algorithm, but will be slower for numbers with less 
than about 200 digits.  That is, assuming that (2) is indeed the correct
running-time estimate for any extension of NFS, then NFS will not affect the
security of any numbers of less than about 215 digits.  So any "standards"
that have been considered using 512-bit RSA moduli are not likely to be
affected by any NFS extensions.  (At most, one could imagine that the
RSA key-generation process might be extended to check that the resulting
modulus n is not a rarefied number.)

In the truly worst-case scenario, we would have that an extension of
NFS would be found that allows ordinary numbers to be factored with a
work-factor that is governed by equation (1); in this case one would
need to adjust the sizes of moduli used by RSA upwards by a factor of
less than two to more than offset the new algorithm.  A factor of two
in size affects the running time of public-key encryption (or
signature verification) by a factor of four and the running time of
private-key encryption (or signature generation) by a factor of eight.
Noting that the speed of workstations has increased by a factor of
over 100 in the last decade (indeed, such factors have been the
technological advance that made the successful implementation of NFS
possible!), such performance penalties, if necessary, seem to be
easily absorbed by expected technological advances in the speeds of
the underlying RSA implementation technologies.  That is, the NFS-like
factoring algorithms do not, even in this worst-case scenario, prevent
successful implementations of the RSA cryptosystem.

As a cryptographer, I am actually very happy with all the effort that
is being spent trying to determine the exact level of difficulty of
factoring.  Achievements such as the recent development of NFS help to
pin down the best-possible rate of growth of the difficulty of
factoring, so that users of cryptographic schemes can pick key sizes
with an increased degree of confidence that unforeseen developments
are unlikely to occur.  The best way to ensure confidence in a
cryptographic system is to have it attacked vigorously and
continuously (but unsuccessfully) by well-qualified attackers.  If,
despite their best efforts, the difficulty of cracking the system
remains intrinsically exponential, then one can have a reasonably high
degree of confidence that the system is actually secure.  This is the
process we have been seeing at work in the recent work on factoring.
The results of the attacks can be used to guide the selection of the
necessary key size for a desired level of security (with an
appropriate margin of safety built in, of course).

(As a closing note, here's a prediction: I expect that the 128-digit
``challenge RSA cipher'' published in the August 1977 issue of
Scientific American to be cracked (probably by the quadratic sieve
algorithm or a variant, not NFS) during the next 1-3 years.  This
accomplishment will require substantially more computer time than the
275 MIP-years required to factor F9.)

I'm concerned by the increased use of laptop computers with
cellular phones, to connect to remote host machines.  Given the
ready availability of scanner radios capable of receiving
cellular phone frequencies, this practice seems to amount to
broadcasting your passwords, proprietary information, etc., to
anyone who cares to listen.  (Yes, I know that federal law
prohibits listening to such calls, but everyone who has a scanner
or knows someone with one knows that it's done all the time.)
Is there any record of anyone breaking systems this way yet?
Has any company adopted a policy discouraging its employees from
using laptops with cellular phones, or, for that matter, from
broadcasting other sensitive information over cellular phones?

At the risk of turning this into a medical forum I wanted to add to the
excellent summary on carpal tunnel syndrome that there is a related problem
called ulnar nerve syndrome.  As with CTS, those of us who spend lots of time
using keyboards are prone to ulnar nerve syndrome, too.  The main difference
in the symptoms is that with CTS the numbness and tingling is in the thumb and
first two fingers, with UNS it is in the other two fingers and along the
outside of the forarm.  (When you "hit your funny bone", what you've done is
bash your ulnar nerve.  The symptoms are similar to that feeling, but they
don't go away.)

My wife's neurologist (she's been going through a bout of it) said there are
many causes, but a common one is some activity that constantly rubs the elbow.
In her case it is almost certainly typing while resting her elbows on the arms
of a chair.  One danger is that carpal tunnel syndrome is so hot, such a fad
right now, that a physician might automatically connect "numbness" with
"programmer" and say "carpal tunnel".  My wife's physician did this, and only
changed his mind after we had looked in some medical books and found that CTS
symptoms did not match hers.  (Physicians deny that they reason this way.
Experience tells otherwise.)

Treatment is basically like CTS:  ice, avoid bending the elbow as much as
possible (not easy to do), don't do things that rub the elbow a lot,
anti-inflammation drugs.  There is surgery, but unlike CTS, ulnar nerve
surgery is not a good option.  Apparently it has about a 50% chance of making
things worse, according to my wife's neurologist.  (That might have been an
estimate that took the nature of her condition into account, i.e., there are
cases where it has a high probability of success, but hers isn't one of them.)

&gt;One point the author does not mention is that the "force-depression curve" of
&gt;your keyboard may also play a role.  It is better to have a linear 
&gt;relationship between force and depression...
&gt;...  People have suggested that this sort of dynamic may
&gt;aggravate or even induce CTS...

What was the incidence of CTS twenty years ago, when electric typewriters
routinely had non-linear force-depression curves?  Or before that, when
manual typewriters required far more finger pressure than any modern
keyboard?  Yet again, we have here a case of a "computer risk" that isn't
really new, and data from olden days could be very useful in deciding what
*really* causes it.

Data would be particularly useful because it's easy to construct an argument
that points in precisely the opposite direction!  Once you've pushed a
non-linear keyboard key "over the hump", you can relax pressure.  But with
a linear keyboard, you have to push all the way down, since you get no
"that's enough" feedback until the key hits bottom.

Some of this may be a risk not of nonlinear keyboards, but of lack of proper
training.  Pre-computer typing courses taught you to *strike* the keys rather
than *pushing* them, so your muscles were already relaxing when the key
bottomed out.  One side effect of the proliferation of keyboards is that far
more people are using them without formal training, or with training from
"touch typing" programs that teach you which keys to hit but don't teach
posture or hand position.

&gt; Tonight's news was really distressing -- that there is a fundamental
&gt; mirror flaw that cannot be repaired until 1993 or so.

It's not *quite* that bad.  The optics do seem to have a significant case
of spherical aberration -- so perfect that it's almost certainly the
result of an incorrectly-figured shape, rather than a manufacturing
deviation from the desired shape -- and this will hurt the cameras
badly, but the spectrographs and the photometer (3 out of 5 of the
instruments) shouldn't be badly affected.  Unfortunately, the affected
instruments are the ones that would produce all the nice crowd-pleasing
pictures, so the public-relations disaster is much worse than the
scientific one.

The Wide Field / Planetary Camera was slated for replacement in 1993-4
anyway, and it may be possible to build the replacement in time for a 1991
flight (about the earliest NASA could launch a repair mission anyway).

The big question is, how did this happen?

The Hubble space telescope, which cost $1.5e9 to build (and a lot
more to store and launch), isn't working properly.  There appears to
be a problem with one of the two mirrors being flawed.  Weren't
they tested?  Yes, they were -- but they were tested individually,
not in the final assembly.  It seems that the test jig would have
cost too much.

Lessee -- the components all worked individually, but not as a system.  Where
have I heard that one before?

undermining the serious aviation-related discussions also posted there.

I considered submitting the story to RISKS orginally, but decided against it
because of the harm it might have done to RISKS serious nature.  Robert
Dorsett, I believe, passed the submission on to RISKS (through PGN?) much to my
delight.  Personally, considering the flood of mail I've received, I think we
might well start a serious discussion in RISKS about the risks of computer
types who cannot recognize a blunt-faced satire when it hits them.

&gt;    I'm afraid Robert Dorsett is mistaken when he states "And nobody's
&gt;crashed a 757/767 yet. . ."  On July 23, 1983, a 767 operating as Air
&gt;Canada Flight 143 crashed at Gimli, Manitoba.  

Actually, it's difficult to classify that as a crash.  Part of the dif-
ficulty is terminology: "crash" is not defined by either ICAO or the FAA.
The two relevant terms are "accidents" and "incidents."  

US NTSB 830-3 defines "aircraft accident" as "an occurrence associated with 
the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person 
boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have 
disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in 
which the aircraft receives substantial damage."

"Incidents" are anything other than crashes, which could affect the future
safety of operations.

The Air Canada landing at Gimli can certainly qualify as an accident.  How-
ever "crash," as used by the industry in general, has more permanent connot-
ations.  The airplane was under control at impact, did not suffer substantial 
damage, and nobody was seriously injured.  I therefore hesitate to classify it 
a crash.

On the other hand, there *was* a rather nasty incident in Florida a few years
ago, a result of a "hard landing."  The airplane was damaged sufficiently 
enough that it was a marginal-recovery issue, but it remained under pilot
control, and nobody was seriously injured.  Both the Gimli 767 and that
767 are back in the air.

Perhaps I should rephrase my original comment: there have been two A320 hull
losses.  There have been no 757 or 767 hull losses.


&gt; That crash may well have been a proper "risk"  subject.  

Indeed; it's been popular in the past.  Here's the review of _Freefall_ I 
posted to rec.aviation last year.  It may be of interest to RISKS readers.

======

_Freefall_ (by William and Marilyn Hoffer, St. Martin's Press: New York, 1989) 
deals with the near-crash of Air Canada Flight 143, a Boeing 767-200 which ran 
out of fuel over near Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1983. 

The book is partially investigative reporting, partially schlock: while it 
provides a detailed accounting of the events leading up to the eventual landing,
it also wastes an enormous amount of space on what the passengers think, feel, 
etc--and in that respect rather closely resembles the style Arthur Haily used 
in _Airport_.  In other words, it's light reading, and tries to be something
for everyone.  Fortunately, though, the authors kindly segregate the chapters 
into what's happening in the cockpit, and what's happening elsewhere.  If one 
sticks to the "Cockpit" (clearly labelled) chapters, it's tolerable (but since 
the book itself is only 263 pages of double-spaced large print and large 
margins, and less than half of it deals with the technical issues, the 
$17.95 price tag isn't exactly worth it).

To save people the some time and effort, here's what it boils down to:

1.  A fuel-metering device failed on a previous flight.  A maintenance worker,
through trial and error, got the system to work again.  A subsequent worker
mistakenly flagged the system as inoperative.

2.  To verify how much fuel was on board, "dripsticks," a  series of fuel-
measurement devices mounted under the wings, were used.  A flotation device 
("donut") is mounted on the top of the stick; when the stick is released, it 
drops.  Where it stops (a length unit, represented by how much of the stick 
is pointing out) can be used to determine how much fuel is in that 
compartment.  The procedure then is to use a chart to convert the unit read 
into liters, then to kilos, then, finally, to use a conversion factor to 
get pounds.  All such measurements are then added to determine the total load 
on board.  In Flight 143's case, an incorrect conversion factor was used for 
the last step.  Confusion among ground workers and the flight crew as to the 
correct conversion factor (the 767 was the only metric aircraft in Air Canada 
service) induced them to launch with half tanks.

3.  The captain launched with his fuel metering system inoperative, in 
violation of the minimum equipment list (but there may have been justification 
for doing so, as several references contradicted each other on this point).  
To overcome the loss of the totalizer, they set the flight management system 
with what they thought was a full load, which then provided them with a fuel 
burn total for the rest of the flight.  GIGO.

4.  They ran out of fuel near Winnipeg, Manitoba, which resulted in a loss
of nearly all of their electrical power, including the EFIS and EICAS systems
(electronic flight instrumentation and engine control and monitoring in-
strumentation).  Radios and backup instrumentation was supplied by battery
power (and, initially, APU power); some hydraulic power was obtained from 
a ram air turbine (optional equipment, I believe, on the 767--Air Canada
bought them in anticipation of extended-range twin oceanic operations).  The
turbine serviced basic flight controls, but did not provide power for other
surfaces, such as flaps.  They were eventually forced to deadstick the plane 
to an abandoned military base near Gimli.  They landed on top of a social 
event being held on a disused runway, fortunately not killing anyone.  The 
nose gear collapsed, there was a small fire (from the nose brakes) and there 
was some damage to the airplane, but the plane was eventually put back in 
service.

5.  The flight crew was initially fired, then rehired.  The first officer, 
according to the book, is starting his captain's training.

Robert L. Smith in his posting re: the A320's attack of nerves refers to the
crash of an Air Canada Boeing 767 at Gimli Manitoba.  He seems to be using the
word 'crash' in a sense with which I was previously unfamiliar.

The plane ran out of fuel because of a combination of factors.  The fuel guages
(computerized?) were malfunctioning, and Air Canada was in the early stages of
conversion to metric.  Reports at the time suggested that the refuelling was
measured in pounds and the measurement was used un- or incorrectly converted in
a formula that expected kilos.

When the engines flamed out, the rather small WW 2 training field at Gimli was
the closest airport, 100 miles away.  The pilot was highly praised for making a
successful dead stick landing, and the plane became known as the Gimli glider.
I believe it was flown out a few days later, without the passengers and with a
very carefully calculated fuel load.

The subsequent investigation was somewhat acrimonious, with the airline
pointing out that the pilot had ultimate responsibility for the fuel on board,
opposed by a strong public sympathy for the pilot and a feeling that the system
was designed to fail.  I suppose the risks are pretty much the same whether a
computer was involved or not - large organizations occasionally screw up when
they try to run complicated systems.  This case also shows the value of
properly trained people retaining ultimate control of the system.

On June 19-21, 1990, IBM held some kind of a development conference for GDR
universities, in the research center of the ministry for science and technology
in (east) Berlin-Koepenick. Similar to an annual conference for West German 
universities (`IBM university forum'), invited speakers from West and East 
German universities as well as from IBM informed about their actual work. A 
broad diversity of areas was covered, from CD-ROM based 'Thesaurus Linguae 
Graecae' to CAD, simulation of complex molecules and synthetic speech. The
conference was accompanied by an exhibition where many additional applications
and software products of scientific interest were shown by East and West German
scientiests as well as IBM people, on IBM owned PS-2s. Many demonstration 
diskettes were freely available.
 
Among the exhibitors, the Virus Test Center demonstrated how to detect and
eradicate viruses. In many discussions, we were surprised to learn that
many scientists regarded viruses as some kind of a joke as they had suffered
mainly from viruses of the funny kind, e.g. playing Yankee Doodle in the Bulga-
rian version "TP 44" or "legalizing marijuana"; only a few seemed to have 
experiences in really damaging viruses such as Israeli or Dark Avenger. Yet at
the end of the exposition, our essential task was to eradicate some damaging
viruses such as Dark Avenger (the Bulgarian "Eddie" which broadly migrates
through Eastern Europe) from most of IBM's PS-2 as neither protection 
nor careful work had been practized nor prescribed.

With surprise we learned that there existed a secret research unit in GDR
to which every virus or other threat had to be reported; this secret group 
would then produce an antivirus and send it to concerned institutions. In its
latest version (which we hope to receive afterwards), 11 viruses could be 
detected and eradicated. 

Lesson learned: there should be a special antivirus service for exhibitions,
not only for large ones (in FRG's CeBIT and Systems exhibitions, about 15-20%
of the workstations and PCs were found to be infected *at exhibition's end*).

Recently, the LISTSERV which I get my risks digests from sent me a copy of
one of those unsolicited mailings that I always get via the US MAIL.  You know
the type, "You can make 50,000 bucks overnight with my ...".  Yeah, yeah
right.  Those are one of the reasons (besides bills) why I dont go to my
mail box any more, and deal with electronic mail.

Now I get to deal with this kind of crapola via the BITNET?  Regardless of
whether or not the message was accidently sent to a LISTSERV and redistributed
to everyone that the LISTSERV knows about, I never should have been able to
receive the message.  LISTSERV software should be modified to include some
sort of authentication.  Granted, an individual with enough know-how can
bypass a simple "authentic address" in the "Received From/By:" headers, but
it would prevent those "whoops, I accidently did its...".

Maybe the author did, maybe he didn't.  Either way, I really dont enjoy reading
that stuff, and am sure that others don't as well.  Also, the proposed
scheme is a pyramid, and is quite illegal here in Il.  Anyone for prosecution?

      [Abuses of the BITNET and USENET RISKS addresses have happened
      before, although they could easily be blocked were it not for the
      intentional sandbox orientation.  Fortunately for the rest of 
      us, we did not see the abuse.  The author did apologize to me
      that it was not intentional, however...   PGN]

[This is a message from Dimitri Mihalas (dmihalas@altair.astro.uiuc.edu).
Mark Bartelt, Canadian Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics]

in case you have not heard: from a reliable inside source i found out that the
problem with ST is that the SOFTWARE driving the polisher was defective. the
corrections for spherical aberration were put in with the wrong sign.
consequently the mirror is not corrected for sph. abb., but has an added dose
of it.
 
the error was not detected during testing because no test with collimated
light was ever done. (editorial remark: unthinkable!) apparently this was
a $30M economy measure in the face of the Challenger accident. likewise
none of the optics were ever tested in vacuum. the primary was and is
"perfect" relative to the specified curve; but alas the specification
was wrong. sigh.
 
from my amateur astronomer days (does that include 1990?) i recall that
spherical aberration is EASY to detect with the foucault test, which is
done with a pinhole, not collimated light. it is hard to believe that
ANYONE could have made such a blunder..
 
the only reason that people know this much is that the same software
was used for AXAF. the errors there were so huge as to be immediately
noticeable, and when the software was corrected, the mirror was "perfect".
i don't know whether the information from axaf was available prior to
the launch of ST, but it seems that it had to be. in which case one
wonders why PE didn't issue a "hold everything!".
 
the future: no chance of bringing the whole telescope down for a refit.
best plan is to design compensating optics into the lightpath for future 
instruments: relatively easy to do. but that will still take 3-5 years.
 
i suppose it's "win a few, lose a few..." but i personally think that
nasa, the government, and the people should stick it into PE and TURN
it hard until they agree to refund the cost of the mistake and of the repairs.
i'm sick of seeing defense and defense-related contractors get away
with bloody murder and just get fatter and fatter on the profits.

        A while back I sent to RISKS an (itself rather buggy) description of a
bug that turned up in the Lexis/Nexis database when I was doing date delimited
searches in the library containing the fulltext opinions of the United States
Supreme Court.  A representative of Mead Data Central--the owner of the
Nexis/Lexis service--has since contacted me to explain the nature of the bug
and to assure me that it will be corrected on June 30.

        In the first place, it appears that the bug is _not_ in the
basic software that searches through the database for cases decided on,
after, or before a specified date.  Secondly, it is clear that the bug
did _not_ cause me to miss any cases that I should have located, it just
turned up some additonal cases that were not decided within the period
that I was searching.  That is the good news.

        The bad news is that the problem relates to the way that the
Lexis/Nexis system parses dates in the database and that the proposed
fix will work only until the year 2000, at which time a new variant of
the bug should cause real havoc.

        Here is a corrected version of the type of search that exposed
the bug:

        Entitlement and date(aft 12/31/39 and bef 1/1/50)

That search, when conducted in the Supreme Court file, should find all
opinions, and only those opinions, decided by the United States Supreme
Court during the decade of the 1940's that contained the word
`entitlement'.  (Lexis warned me that it assumed that I meant after
12/31/1939 and before 1/1/1950.)  As it happens, there are no cases that meet
those criteria.  But Lexis reported that it had found a dozen or so
cases--cases that did contain the word `entitlement' but that were
decided in the 1960's, 70's, and 80's.

        It seems that a couple of months ago Mead Data Central decided
to include the argued-date as well as the decided-date within the date
field, and it is this enhancement that caused the bug.  The fix that
will be implimented this Saturday is to once again exclude the
argued-date from the date field.

        Since cases are not always decided in the same year that they
are argued, including the argued-date in the date field will, of course,
cause some cases to be reported as occurring in two different decades,
which would be a nuisance.  But that is only a miniscule part of the
bug.  The real problem occurs because some cases are argued on more than
one date, so that the argued-date field would appear in the database as,
say:  "argued June 22-23, 1980" and the decided date field as: "July 3,
1980)."  At first glance that would not seem to cause any problem.  And
it wouldn't, except for the fact that the Lexis system parses the date
fields in the same way that it parses user input, and thus concludes
that "June 22-23" means "June 22-1923".  Thus our hypothetical case
would have a date of July 3, 1980 (which is after December 31, 1939) and
would also have a date of June 22, 1923 (which is before January 1,
1950).  If that case--decided, you will recall, in 1980--contains the
word `entitlement' it will turn up in my search for cases in the decade
of the 1940's, and in my searches in the 1950's, and in the 1960's, etc.

        I can understand why the system parses user input so as to
interpret 1/1/50 as 1/1/1950--but I never dreamed that a system would
parse its own data.  According to the people at Mead Data Central,
however, their system parses the data fields in exactly the same way
that it parses user input.  It seems that the Lexis/Nexis database
contains texts--especially news reports--with dates in the form
"nn/nn/nn". Today those dates are parsed as "nn/nn/19nn", but what is
going to happen in the year 2000?

        It would seem that ambiguous data in the data base will be much
harder to find and fix than a software bug.

I am a long time sufferer of CTS.  The first symptoms I recall were during
high school, nearly twenty years ago, but it was not properly diagnosed
until I was in excruciating pain, dropping things, not sleeping because
my hand was burning at night and more, all about four years ago.

Tests said that I had "a very mild case"!?  That reassuring info did not
make my hand better.  I used splints, Motrin, ice until I finally insisted
on the carpal tunnel relief operation.  That was two years ago, this month,
but I still have recurrences - especially when I meet the same RISK which
pushed my CTS over the edge: using a MOUSE.

The typical mouse promotes all the bad habits that can result in CTS symptoms.
One typically rests the heel of the palm on the mouse, and press the chord
keys - frequently with constant pressure (on Apple's mice, the required
pressure is substantial for me, and their new mouse reqlly aggravates the
problem with its stylized, aerodynamic "look").  I cannot use a mouse to this
day without suffering a "mouse hangover".

Track balls are better for me, but I still would rather avoid them.

I am really looking forward to _getting_my_hands_on_ ;-) a touch screen.
I've seen some very nice ones with quite satisfactory resolution!

And please - If you think that you might have CTS - don't waste time.

Readers of RISKs might be interested in a recent Oxford University Press
paperback book "Benefits and Risks of Knowledge-Based Systems" (ISBN
0-19-584743-9). This is a 76-page Report of a Working Party of the (UK-based)
Council for Science and Society, chaired by Professor Margaret Boden (Prof of
Philosophy and Psychology at the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences,
University of Sussex).

The main chapter headings are:

1 How Knowledge-Based Systems Work

2 Applications of KBSs

3 The Benefits and Dangers of KBSs

4 Influencing the Future Uses of KBSs

5 Conclusions and Recommendations


Summarizing the final conclusions and recommendations:

1 The general level of public awareness about the applications and social
implications of KBS is low, and education about KBS should be included in
school courses.

2. There should be more interdisciplinary undergraduate and postgraduate study
programs in cognitive sciences and KBSs.

3. A government initiative applying KBSs to health education and health care
would be popular and in the long term cost-effective.

4. A KBS should complement human workers rather than replace them.

5. It is undesirable to substitute a computer for a human function, such as the
giving of psychiatric help, that should involve respect, understanding, empathy
or love between humans.

6. Great attention should be given to the immense hazards presented by possible
malfunctioning of military command and control systems and autonomous
decision-making programs.

7. The Data Protection Act should entitle people to know not only what data are
held about them, but also the rules by which they are processed.

8. Statutary regulation of KBS standards may be needed in future.

9. KBS vendors should adopt a suitable Code of Practice.

10. Meanwhile they should be legally obliged to insure themselves against
claims for damages by users.

11 Various industry standards are needed, especially in the interface
between the program and the user.

12 Professional associations such as the Society for the Study of Artificial
Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour, and the Expert Systems Group of
the BCS should adopt a code of conduct for their members.

13 Setting up a formal body for KBS practitioners with restricted membership is
*not* recommended.

I am reposting this, after being told that my original postings were only seen
on BITNET. Sorry BITNET readers for a possible quadruple posting :-(
[It has also been posted on SWL-L.]


   ---------------------------Original message----------------------------

A posting appeared recently on the SWL-L list regarding a computerized
information system that informs motorists about traffic conditions:

&gt;Here in Chicago, the Illinois Department of Transportation operates a
&gt;group of low-power AM stations that provide traffic information.
&gt;
&gt;The stations broadcast at the top and bottom of the dial (540 and 1610
&gt;I think).  The broadcast alternates between events affecting traffic
&gt;and actual traffic reports.  It is all automated.
&gt;
&gt;There is a tape that describes the daily schedule for construction
&gt;work, lane closures, ramp closures, parades, and other events
&gt;affecting traffic.
&gt;
&gt;This alternates with computerized traffic reports: "As of ... 5:55 pm
&gt;... there is severe congestion on the following currently monitored
&gt;sections of the highway system ... Kennedy expressway ... inbound ...
&gt;between Montrose avenue ... and Irving Park road ... between Kedzie
&gt;avenue ... and the Ohio street junction ..." and so on.  The reports
&gt;are updated every 10 minutes or so by sensors buried in the highways.
&gt;
&gt;[text omitted]
&gt;
&gt;One problem with this system is that when traffic comes to a complete
&gt;stop somewhere, the computer doesn't detect cars moving over the
&gt;sensors and decides that there is no traffic.  This is fairly rare.
&gt;[text omitted]
&gt;
&gt;It's a system that I like a lot.

I find it amusing that this user likes the system, despite its apparently
well-known tendency to be completely wrong in worst-case conditions. I
wonder if people from out of town are told about this quirk, or left to
discover it on their own.

Today I called my bank (Bank of the West) to transfer some money from one
account to another.  Before initiating the transfer, I asked for the balance in
the source account.  The amount the teller said was in my account seemed
somewhat high, but in the right ballpark.  Since I hadn't balanced my checkbook
recently and since it covered the amount I was about to transfer out, I
initiated the transfer, thanked the teller, and hung up.

Immediately after getting off the phone, I balanced my checkbook, and realized
that the amount she had read to me was about $2K too high (though the correct
amount still covered the transfer).  I called back immediately, this time
getting a different bank worker.  I told her that the amount I had been given
earlier was incorrect.  She said that the bank had just installed "new
software" the previous day, and all account balances were temporarily wrong
until "things sort themselves out", which would be a day or so.  She said that,
unfortunately, not all the bank's employees were aware of the problem.

I wonder what "until things sort themselves out" means.  "Until all
transactions recorded in the old system are entered into the new one", perhaps?
If so, why didn't they do this before putting the new system on-line to
workers?  Maybe "until bugs in the software are fixed?"  If so, their testing
of the new software was seriously inadequate.

The RSRE Viper microprocessor and Avra Cohn's report on its formal
verification, have been discussed earlier in RISKs. Readers may therefore be
interested in the following article, by Simon Hill, which appeared on p.3 of
the (UK) Computer Weekly for July 5, 1990. It is reprinted here in its
entirety, without permission.

::              USER THREATENS COURT ACTION OVER MoD CHIP
::  
::  The first commercial user of the Viper safety-critical chip developed
::  by the Ministry of Defence is threatening legal action for alleged
::  misrepresentation.
::  
::  Teknis International Railroad Systems of Adelaide, Australia, is
::  seeking assurances that the Viper technology can meet the claims that
::  the MoD and its commercial partners make for it.
::  
::  Teknis, which is developing a signal and railway crossing control
::  system using Viper for the Australian National Railway Commission, is
::  also threatening action against the MoD's commercial licensee, Charter
::  Technologies.
::  
::  Worcester-based Charter was licensed in january 1988 to exploit
::  commercially the fruits of the Viper work carried out at the Royal
::  Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern.
::  
::  Ron Davison, Teknis' business development manager, says, *We are
::  looking for every comfort we can get from the development and
::  suppliers of Viper:.
::  
::  Davison says the A$12m Australian railways project "is a world first"
::  in the safety-critical market, making the first time that Viper has
::  found a user outside the military and defence communities.
::  
::  Teknis' concern has been inspired by a series of reports in UK and US
::  academic circles about RSRE and Charter's claims that Viper is
::  formally verified for use in safety-critical applications where lives
::  may be put at risk if the technology fails.
::  
::  Davison says he is "surprised at the sudden rash of reports about
::  Viper coming out of the woodwork" 18 months after Teknis began work
::  with the chip.
::  
::  But the report that is most critical of Viper, written by Avra Cohn of
::  Cambridge University's computer laboratory, is two years old.  It was
::  published in May 1988 and delivered to RSRE, but Charter technologies
::  claims it was not shown Cohn's findings until mid-1989.
::  
::  RSRE and Charter claim that Viper is formally specified, with a chip
::  design which conforms to this specification.  Cohn says in the report
::  that this is misleading.
::  
::  "Such assertations, taken as assurances of the impossibility of design
::  failure in safety-critical applications, could have catastrophic
::  results," Cohn says in the report.
::  
::  The MoD says "It is a matter of interpretation of the words used to
::  describe the dependabiliity of Viper.  Nothing can be described as
::  absolutely fail safe."
::  
::  This year a report by US consultants Computational Logic for US space
::  agency Nasa says "Viper has not been formally verified" and lists four
::  deficiences in RSRE's specification.  In a draft copy of the same
::  report dated June 1989, obtained by Computer Weekly, the former chief
::  RSRE scientist on the Viper projects, John Cullyer, has indicated his
::  agreement with Nasa's conclusions.  Cullyer is now Professor of
::  Electronics at Warwick University.
::  
::  The MoD cannot say whether the Nasa and Cohn reports have been looked
::  at by RSRE staff, but a spokesman says, "Work is continuing to
::  reinforce verification techniques and if a relevant report has been
::  produced then it will be studied by scientists at RSRE."
::  
::  Marconi Electronic Devices of Lincoln, sub-contracted by the MoD to
::  manufacture Viper hardware circuitry, is reining back on its
::  commitment to the project while it waits for replies from the MoD.
::  
::  Tony Smith, Marconi Electronic Devices' integrated circuits contract
::  manager, says the company "wanted a discussion with MoD and RSRE about
::  what could be guaranteed for Viper.  That meeting was due to take
::  place this year, but the MoD cancelled it.  We have still not had that
::  meeting".
::  
::  Marconi has asked the MoD to respond to the Cohn and Nasa reports, but
::  has not yet received a reply and has not been shown either of the
::  reports, Smith says.  The company is making prototype Viper circuits,
::  but has no commercial orders.
::  
::  The Ministry of Defence would not comment on "confidential or
::  commercial correspondence between it and third parties".
::  
::  The MoD says, "No Viper chip is known to have failed, but work is
::  continuing to reinforce and improve verification techniques: on Viper,
::  and that *although there are not known faults in the Viper design, an
::  unremitting search for weakness must continue".

The following appears in an article advising against the use of cellular
telephones in aircraft (it's illegal in most countries), published in Flight
Safety Bulletin (the quarterly journal of the General Aviation Safety Committee
in the UK):

"As a point of interest, the manufacturers of some mobile telephones have
issued a warning that they should not be used in cars fitted with an
electronic anti-lock braking system (ABS) because the cellphone could cause
the system to malfunction."

Presumably the risk is from EMI.

Does any RISKS reader have details on this? Is it just a precautionary
warning to limit legal liability, or is there evidence? If this is a real
risk, what about coaches, trains, other nearby vehicles ...?

The following is taken from an article by Kevin Eason in the (London) Times of
July 9th:

     A safety alert has been issued to thousands of mobile telephone
     engineers after an incident in which a Jaguar car lost all power
     because of faulty telephone installation.  The driver escaped
     safely when all electrical systems, including lights, brakes and
     engine, were shut down by a crossed wire. 
     
     Jaguar drivers were warned yesterday to use only car phones
     fitted and checked by company dealers.  The Federation of
     Communications Services has alerted its 350-member companies
     which handle mobile communications equipment that faulty
     installation could damage vital equipment, especially anti-lock
     braking systems (ABS), and urges them to check with manufacturer
     specifications.  
     [...]
     
     The Jaguar driver involved was stranded on a motorway when all
     power to the car failed.  Checks on the vehicle showed that a
     telephone engineer had crossed vital wires which caused a
     complete systems shutdown. 
     
     Most new cars now have complex computer engine management systems
     and increasing numbers have electronic controls for suspension,
     brakes, gearbox and safety mechanisms.  The new Mercedes SL
     convertible sports car, for example, has an automatic pop-up roll
     bar operated by computer.

	I unfortunately had a Hertz rental car on Orcas Island, Washington,
when a Washington State Ferry rammed the Island's only car ferry dock and
knocked it out of service for a minimum of several days. The incident raised
several interesting points:

	1) Hertz had no category for this case; they repeatedly told
us "If the car were broken, then you could fly off the island and get
another car, and retrieving your car would be our problem. But since
you say it isn't BROKEN, every day your car sits on the island is a day
you are renting it... and of course if we have to pick it up there you get
a retrieval fee, a fee for renting one-way, etc etc".

	2) It would be interesting to get more informed information about
how the ferries work. From the June 29, 1990 Seattle Times:

	"All indications point to a failure in the vessel's computer-control
system. Inspectors will attempt to recreate the situation which caused the
computer failure, but 'often these computer glitches have a tendency not to
reappear'. ... The six Issaquah-class ferries ... were built in the late '70s
and early '80s and have been plagued by propulsion-control problems. The
system's top engineer in 1986 ... said then that the propulsion systems
were so unpredictable that if he had his way he would replace them. Last
year the state awarded a $550,000 contract ... to do design work for the
ferry system, including modifications on the Issaquah-class propulsion-
control system. ... Unlike the original propulsion system which controls
and reverses the variable-pitch propellers on the diesel-engine ferries
through a computer, the new system is simpler and more reliable ... ."

	From what I could gather from talking to the Seattle Times reporters
covering the incident, the ferries have a "fly by wire" propulsion system that
among other things does automatic docking. Occasionally the propulsion-control
computer hiccups, locking the controls for a few seconds. Normally this is no
bid deal, but in this case the computer system had the bad timing to hiccup
just as the ferry was supposed to start braking for the final stage of docking
at Orcas. As a result the ferry didn't brake at all and ploughed straight into
the terminal, causing $250,000 in damage. (Also costing island merchants much
of their July 4 weekend tourist revenue, and severely inconveniencing many
unlucky tourists. We eventually managed to get our Hertz car off the island
by private barge.)

Driving to work this morning there was an interesting story on the radio.  It
seems the Domino's Pizza joint closest to the Pentagon can accurately predict
when a major operation is about to take place.  Evidently the planning meetings
go on long into the night, and the best place to get food is Domino's.  They
interviewed someone from Domino's and he said that prior to the Panama invasion
deliveries to the Pentagon jumped 25%.  I'm glad I'm not in security.....

This is from the July 19 issue of Computer Weekly:

    The 9 billion pound Trident nuclear warhead programme is being held up
  because of serious problems with a computer system, developed by Logica,
  that keeps highly volatile nuclear materials apart during weapon assembly.
    The system, which ensures the safe movement and records the exact
  whereabouts of plutonium and other materials around two buildings at the
  Ministry of Defence's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston,
  is only able to handle half the volumes set by the MoD.  Despite this, the
  system went live on July 13.
    [...]
    The system is a high integrity movement control package, using Stratus
  fault-tolerant hardware, used in A45 and A90, the two buildings at AWE
  involved in Trident development work.
    One source says that the MoD has set a target for the system to handle
  200 units of nuclear material within the two buildings at any one time,
  but that the present system can only handle 100 units.
    The source says that the MoD and AWE have been revising the target
  downwards, but that Logica has been unable to meet the new figure.
    [...]
    A Logica spokeswoman says it is not company policy to comment on
  projects which have not been announced.

Yes, this is the same Logica that ran into trouble during a project for
San Fransisco's transit system.

According to a story by Jeffrey A. Perlman in the 'Los Angeles Times' 18
July 1990, the General Accounting Office has issued a new report entitled
"Air Traffic control -- Inadequate Planning Increases Risk of Computer
Failures in Los Angeles."

The GAO says that in planning for a 1995 consolidation of Southern
California radar tracking facilities, FAA officials have refused to
consider computer solutions that could solve their computer problems
because the agency does not want to rewrite or develop software to run on
new, state-of-the-art hardware and expend the "additional time they believe
would be required to undertake such an effort."  

A 1989 GAO report singled out the Los Angeles - Orange County air space as
having the worst comuter-related aircraft tracking problems.  The new
report criticizes the FAA for ignoring the situation, saying air traffic
controllers may find their radar screens flickering, showing insufficient
data or blanking out at critical moments.

FAA officials "are still analyzing the GAO report and had no formal reply."

A short item in 'Business Week', July 30:

      BMW PUTS A BACKSEAT DRIVER ON A CHIP
    
The latest cars offer a plethora of computerized wonders -- like chips that
control the engine or warn you is a door is ajar.  But would anyone want a
computer that took over control of a car if it judged the vehicle was being
driven too fast or improperly for road conditions?  BMW engineers are
betting the answer is yes.
   
They've already installed an early version of their Heading Control system
in cars at the auto company's research center in Munich.  A camera above
the rearview mirror tracks the center stripe and the line along the right
side of the road.  If a driver gets too close to either marker, a small
electric motor integrated into the steering system is activated to put
things right.  Later versions will gauge road conditions and differentiate
between broken and solid lines, so the computer can tell such things as
whether it's okay to pass.  Drivers being corrected might feel a tug on the
wheel.  But they can easily override the computer by continuing with
wahtever they are doing.  BMW engineers say the system is at least five
years from market.  And they predict that once customers get used to the
idea, they'll love it.

&gt;From the Reuters news wire:

BRITISH AIR DEFENSE COMPUTER SUFFERING A  "NERVOUS BREAKDOWN" 
    LONDON, Reuter - A nearly half-billion dollar computer
designed to mastermind Britain's future air defenses won't be
fit for action for another 10 years because of bouts of nervous
confusion, Defense Ministry officials said Wednesday.
    The $448.8 million system known as ICCS -- Improved UK Air
Defense Ground Environment Command and Control System -- was due
to enter service in 1987. But officials told Parliament's
defense committee the computer's problems with logic would delay
operation by up to 10 years.
     "We get wrong answers sometimes and the bugs have to be
tracked down and sorted out,"  Donald Spiers, who heads aircraft
control at the ministry, told the committee.
     "Secondly, from time to time it crashes. What this means is
the equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It becomes confused with
the information and goes wrong." 
    The production consortium, made up of Hughes Aircraft,
Marconi and Siemens-Plessey, have upgraded the main computers
driving the system to give more power, Spiers said.
    ICCS was designed as the sophisticated equivalent of the war
tables used during World War II when model planes were pushed
around a board.
    It will coordinate radar, fighters, surface-to-air missiles
and air command centers through a single network.
    The system is being developed on a fixed price contract and
Spiers said all extra costs had to be met by the consortium.
    He said the companies had not been paid for the past two
years because of the problems encountered.

&gt;From the Guardian, Mon. 23rd July, front page:

Headline: BR signalmen 'worked blind'

Subhead:  Computer software problems admitted at key commuter train centre

By-line:  Patrick Donovan, Transport Editor

British Rail has admitted that computer software problems have been uncovered
at a signal centre which controls London's busiest commuter lines. They left 
operators "working blind" after train movements were wiped off control screens
on at least one occasion over the last five weeks.

A BR spokesman said newly installed software, responsible for flashing up the
position of trains on the indicator screens of signal operators at Wimbledon,
has been found to contain two technical faults.

The Wimbledon centre controls 90 mph services south of Waterloo and includes
the Clapham Junction area, where 35 people died in a train accident in December
1988.

Faulty wiring on a signalling modernisation programme was found to have caused
the crash.

BR said one of the faults uncovered on the indicator screen software has not yet
been fully rectified. An internal investigation began after an operator found
that the system was providing "the wrong information". Realising that he had 
lost track of train movements, the operator immediately turned all signals to 
red.

A spokesman said that at no time was any train at risk. "What happened caused
concern to the signalman." But he stressed that the mechanical signal equipment
and all other equipment worked normally, bringing all trains to an immediate
standstill after the problem was discovered.

"The problem was caused by computer software fault in the signal box. [sic - PM]
It gave the wrong indication to the signal man. All the trains froze where they
were. The lights told him that something was different to what was happening
[outside]."

BR conceded that the faulty equipment served a vital function, "this little
piece of software tells the signalman what is happening outside".

The software faults were found inside the panel in the train indicator box in a
system responsible for operating the lights.

Alastair Wilson, contracts and production director of E. B. Signal, the 
manufacturers, said: "The system is under test. I do emphasise that things are 
going through a testing stage. It is not unusual to have minor software bugs."
[!!! - PM]

A spokesman for the National Union of Railwaymen said that any operational 
shutdown of train indicator screens would "at best create a major disruption
and at worst could create alarming safety hazards. If everything goes to red it
puts enormous pressures on an individual signalman."

[Remainder of article omitted. It goes on about unrelated signalling problems
in the Clapham Junction area, including a loss of communication between Waterloo
and Wimbledon signal centres, concern about the growing use of driver-only 
services on Network SouthEast, contradictions in the rule-book about whether or
not such services may operate with a defective radio, and the need for the 
driver to draft competent members of the public to assist him in ensuring safety
after an emergency stop.]

A few comments:

The report is rather confused, but it seems that the system receives information
about the position of every train in the region, and displays this to the
signalmen in the form of lights moving over a large indicator board. The bugs
were in the hardware/software module which drives the display, so it was a case
of "correct information in, garbage out". 

I wonder if the faulty module was rated as "safety-critical" in the hazard 
analysis.

It would be nice to know *how* the signalman knew that he was being given
wrong information, and what would have happened if he had not been so alert,
and continued to operate the network with the wrong information.

It is amusing to hear the manufacturer refer to a bug which brings an entire
railway regional network to a standstill for some time as "minor". Perhaps he
meant that only a few lines of code were in error! Somebody should have a word
with him about how to classify faults and failures!

If, as the manufacturer states, the system is under test, why was it being run
to control live traffic without any back-up system? Surely BR's testing
strategy can't be "Let the train take the strain"? (To quote one of their own
advertising slogans!)

We have had tales of computer-perverted names before.  John W. McInroy
(Lockheed, Austin) sent me a very cute article by Mike Kelley that appeared in
the Austin American-Statesman (23 July 1990, p. A8) describing a computer
generated letter recently received by the Austin law firm of Friedman,
Weddington and Hansen.  Their local bank computer referred to the firm account
as "Friedman Wedd etal".  This of course led to a letter to Etalfried Wedd from
a financial services company, with a "Pre-Approved Loan Authorization" for $750
requiring only a signature, "because you have demonstrated that you maintain a
good credit record ..."

In a wonderful spoof that I will only summarize here, Mike Kelley wrote about
"Etalfried" answering indignantly that $750 "does not justify the time it takes
to sign my name", the finance company upping it to $5,000, another indignant
response, then an offer of a loan for $250,000.  The story ends with Etalfried
finally getting an unsecured cash loan of $3.4 billion and retiring to "elegant
and commodious surroundings on the sea in a small and remote South American
country. ... It is also reported that he takes particular delight in reading
over and again the account of how Tom Sawyer contrived to whitewash Aunt
Polly's fence."  Congratulations to Mike Kelley for spinning a fine yarn.

The 30 May issue of Flight International notes an interesting FAA decision.
The latest wonderful innovation for airliners is TCAS, the Traffic alert
and Collision Avoidance System, which uses transponder returns from other
aircraft to report significant collision hazards and advise the pilots
on evasive action.  The first TCAS systems are now in airline testing.

The decision says "...enforcement action will not be initiated against
flightcrews who deviate from an assigned clearance issued by air traffic
control when that deviation is in response to a TCAS-generated resolution
advisory and the response is in accordance with the air carrier's approved
flight procedures".  (A "resolution advisory" is, roughly speaking, a
report of imminent danger; TCAS can also issue "traffic advisories",
milder warnings of potential trouble, not mentioned in the FAA ruling.)

The airlines and the pilots' union are satisfied with this for now, but
would like to see changes to the laws, rather than just a promise not to
enforce them, in the long run.

This brings to mind an interesting thought: who gets the blame if (when) a TCAS
warning *causes* a collision, through either electronic or human confusion?

Here are excerpts from THE SEATTLE TIMES, July 23 1990 p. E3:

COMPUTER ANIMATION AIDING LAWYER'S CASES (from the ORLANDO SENTINEL)

ORLANDO, Fla. --- The truck driver claimed he couldn't avoid hitting and
severely injuring the 9-year-old riding a bike.  But a one-minute computer
simulation depicting the 1986 accident near St. Cloud, Fla., showed that
the driver had enough time to miss the rider.  The truck driver's insurance
company settled the lawsuit in 1988 for $2.1 million. ...

Whether in depicting auto accidents, plane crashes, industrial accidents or
other events, computer animation is fast developing into a powerful legal
tool that helps lawyers win cases.

The technology is used primarily by personal injury lawyers who are trying to
win big-dollar awards for their clients.

F. Lee Bailey, one of the nation's top trial lawyers, told a group of lawyers
at a recent Florida Bar annual meeting in Miami Beach that computer animation
is becoming as important as courtroom rhetoric in winning cases.

"There are untold opportunities for the use of animation in the courtroom,"
said Bob Scott, head of Juris Corp., an Orlando company that produces courtroom
exhibits and recently began offering computer animation.  "I believe in five
years it will be the predominate methodology in showing demonstrative
evidence," Scott said.

[ There is at least one firm in Seattle that specializes in creating computer
animations of accidents for use in court.  - JJ ]

In Oklahoma, about 18,000 state employees were paid late -- very late --
because of the cutover to a new computer system.  As of today -- 12 days
after they should have been paid -- only half of them had received their
checks.  The state was forced to use an older computer system to write
the checks; additionally, since the news story indicates that they had
to draw on a special reserve fund, it would seem that the entire disbursement
system, and not just the payroll system, is involved.

The problem -- the new code apparently runs too slowly, and input tapes are in
the wrong format.

JUSTICE PROCEEDS TO CREATE ITS DRUG INTELLIGENCE CENTER

National Drug Intelligence Center ...  [and] about $55 million to establish
the center ... they expect annual operating costs to be about $27 million.
The Justice plan calls for NDIC to become totally operational in 1992 ...

Members of Congress and groups such as Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility and the ACLU have voiced concerns ... they have questioned
whether the center might violate privacy laws by using electronic information
and linking numerous federal databases into a national database.  Thornburgh
attempted to quell these fears saying "It's not 'Big Brother'" ... other
agencies involved include the the Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI.  The Defense Department
also has assumed increasing responsibility.

An example of the latter is a similarly expensive facility for the Navy, which
will integrate data from various radars, besides listening in on telephone
calls and so forth.

&gt;From a recent issue of "Computing," the weekly newspaper of the British
Computing Society:

  "When it comes to choosing a speedy communications channel in today's
  technology market-place nothing beats a pigeon.  Fax company Faxit Europe
  discovered this to its embarrassment, after pitching one of its high-tech fax
  machines against Joe, a four-year-old Blue Chequer pigeon.

  "The company wanted to show at the launch of its new public pay-fax credit
  card system that fax is quicker than flight. But they hadn't bargained with
  Joe, a winner of two open races.  Joe beat the fax in a one mile challenge
  race, arriving more than a minute before the caricature drawing of him
  emerged from the machine.

  "Executives at Faxit Europe were left perhaps not so much with egg on their
  faces, but with [...] on their collective shoulders."

I am posting this article to inform the netters about a problem with Citibank
ATM machines and to ask for any information and suggestions.  Please bear with
me.

When I received my last bank statement, I have noticed three transactions in
which $900 dollars were withdrawn from my accounts from a Citibank ATM machine
at a downtown NYC branch which I have never used.  ($900 were withdrawn in
three transactions.)

FACTS:
	1.  I did not do those transactions.
	2.  When they took place I was at work out of NYC.
	3.  I did not lose my bankcard or give it to anyone.
	4.  I did not write down my password or tell it to anyone.

After I received my statement I went to my branch and talked to a customer
representative.  After a couple of days I got two letters from Citibank saying
that results of their investigation (which consists only of looking at the ATM
machine records for those specific transactions) showed that for those
transactions my bankcard and my password were used therefore they could not
honor my claim.

Now my guess is that this is most probably a software problem because last 
weekend I went to the branch where money was withdrawn and there was a sign 
on the door saying that the ATM machines there were out of order. I also
learned that they have been out of order for about a week.

I am going to take a legal action against to Citibank therefore
I would like to know if anybody is aware of a similar situation or if anyone
has any ideas on how this might have happened.  I would appreciate any 
information and suggestions that can help me to fight Citibank to recover my 
money and to explain how this event might have happened.

Please e-mail to    mii@briar.philips.com  or  isbara@cs.columbia.edu 
Thanks in advance.

A320 FADEC Software Diversity??

The Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS) is not the only flight-critical
software controlled system on the A320. The Full Authority Digital Engine 
Control (FADEC) is another.

Single points of failure of hardware can be eliminated from system design by
using redundant components or hardware subsystems. To achieve a similar
design aim where software is concerned requires diversity. The EFCS in fact
incorporates both software diversity, hardware design diversity, and hardware
redundancy. See, for example:

Traverse P.J.: "Dependability of Digital Computers on board Airplanes"
          Preprints of 'Dependable Computing for Critical Applications',
          IFIP WG 10.4 Intl. Working Conference, Santa Barbara, CA, Aug.1989,
          pp 53-60

I have recently received copies of: 

Cosimo J. Bosco: "Certification Issues for Electrical and/or Electronic 
                  Engine Controls."
                  SAE Technical Paper Series #871844, 1987
       Keywords:  EEC electronic engine controls FADEC certification issues

and:

Federal Register Vol. 54, No. 17, Jan.27, 1989, Docket No. NM-26:
  "Special Conditions: Airbus Industrie Model A320 Series Airplane." 
  (Final special conditions for certification)

Bosco states (p. 20) that "The all electronic FADEC is usually a completely
redundant, dual-channel, primary/secondary type of system. Current systems 
have successfully employed *ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SOFTWARE* in each of the 
redundant channels." [my emphasis]

Now, if the same software is loaded into redundant hardware processors, any bug
is a potential source of single-point failure of the system as a whole. Bosco
in fact goes on to discuss this very point.

The final special conditions in docket NM-26 do not require diversity as such, 
only that "...the components of the propulsion control system...must have the 
level of integrity and reliability of a hydromechanical system (HMC) meeting 
current airworthiness standards".

In the discussion printed below this statement of the requirement, it is stated 
that in practice this "...is demonstrated by an inservice loss of thrust 
control approximately once per 100,000 hours of operation...This level of 
reliability for the loss of thrust control on one engine will result in an 
overall airplane propulsion control system reliability that is consistent with 
the guidance [presumably 10^-9 probability of failure as in AC 25.1309-1] 
associated with 25.1309(b)(1), *ASSUMING AN INDEPENDENCE OF THE FAILURE 
CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOSS OF THRUST CONTROL*."[my emphasis again]

The question that I ask is therefore: "Does the FADEC as *actually*
certified on the A320 employ diverse software in the different channels?". 

My suspicion is that the FADEC does not incorporate dissimilar software, and 
that its software can therefore be a source of common mode failure for the 
whole propulsion control system. This would seem to contradict the special 
condition referred to above. At the same time, the FAA seems to be very well 
aware of the common mode failure potential of software.

Even if the same two dissimilar programs are present in both FADECs, it is
possible for a bug in one homologue to be a common point of failure between
the two engines.

FADECs are relatively mature devices. Does anyone out there have any hard
information, particularly references to published papers?

"Ain't hindsight wonderful?"

First off, any large complex project is bound to have problems.  I'm not saying
that I support my employer or defend the HST.  Consider for instance that other
institutions are also bound to have used some of the same types of components
in their systems: Perkin-Elmer (and its subsidary), Lockheed, etc. are all
going to feel this (in one investigation which JPL was involved, LMSC was also
blasted by Congress).  P-E is making mirrors and instruments for other
projects, I would worry about Keck for instance.

Second, every project is a set of compromises.  I've have seen other criticisms
of HST in the science press before launch and also had my own crticisms of
GSFC.  Those of "us" who have been on "losing teams" aren't off saying "I told
you so."  But in finger pointing, it does not help to keep wheat and chaff
together.  The less noise when trying to locate problems, the better.

Lastly, it is important to note this isn't bad just for NASA but bad for big
science and science projects in general.  I worry about the "climate" for any
research in this country, because research tends to fail 90% of the time (if
you really need a reference for this I have it).  The next time, it might not
be a satellite telescope, but maybe a particle accelerator, a computer project,
or who knows.  Are we are too involved in finger-pointing and not enough
involved to 1) help fix, 2) stay out of the way of those trying to fix (keeping
quiet unless we have significant info)?  Are we contributing to the demise of
any research funding (DARPA, NSF, NASA, DOE as well as private) at all?

&gt;From: henry@zoo.toronto.edu
&gt;Subject: Re: info on carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)

Henry Spencer asks:
&gt;What was the incidence of CTS twenty years ago, when electric typewriters
&gt;routinely had non-linear force-depression curves?  Or before that, when
&gt;manual typewriters required far more finger pressure than any modern
&gt;keyboard?  Yet again, we have here a case of a "computer risk" that isn't
&gt;really new, and data from olden days could be very useful in deciding what
&gt;*really* causes it.

Unfortunately I don't know of any data that is available concerning RSI in
typists before the introduction of computers to the work environemnt. However,
what Henry is overlooking is how a typist's job has changed with the advent
of computers. Instead of having to pause every page to change the paper, and
in some cases at the end of every line to return the carriage, now a person
can sit at a computer uninterrupted for hours on end. This greatly increases
the amount of stress on the carpal tunnel because there is very little
variance in movement any more.

I agree that it would be nice if there were data from the "olden days" that
details typists, but all the data I am aware of (which isn't much) deals with
RSI in factory workers. I wish I could interpret this as meaning that RSI was
not prominent enough to garner any attention, but that would be overextending
the data (or lack thereof).

Also, RISKS readers might want to familiarize themselves (if they aren't
already) with the RSI problems in Australia. This is a very interesting
situation where the incidence of RSI is very high, but there is some data that
suggests that the explosion of RSI cases may have more to do with
unsatisfactory work conditions (pay, not posture) and the health-care system's
treatment of RSI than with actual physical problems. I'm afraid I don't have
any references handy, but I could provide them in short order if anyone wishes
to pursue this further.

_New York Woman_ (presumably the current issue) addresses a problem common to
women (and men) in the Big Apple: roaches in your personal computer.  The
recommended solutions include traplike surrounds, replacing oxygen with carbon
dioxide in an airtight container (with the computer OFF), spiders (even if you
have aRACFhnophobia?), or find a specialist to take it apart and "administer a
nice, roach-repelling pesticide."  Also included are disrecommendations, such
as not enclosing it in an airtight plastic container with the power on, and not
putting it in the fridge.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 1 August 1990, p.
A10.]

RISKS has dealt with all sorts of bugs, but I don't recall mention of roaches
in our five-year roadshow (roach-ho!).  Oh, yes, 1 August 1990 marks the FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERY FIRST RISKS ISSUE.  This is our 774th issue, averaging
about 3 a week through thick and thin.  Sheer heroism on the part of your
moderator?  Or masochism?  Either way, its been fun (except for the mailer
headaches).

So, let me take this opportunity to report on sendmail bugs.  We installed a
patch that deletes from the in-progress list any address for which successful
mailing appears to have been accomplished.  A few of the addresses on one of
the sublists (but not consecutive ones) still managed to get multiple copies of
<A HREF="/Risks/10.16.html">RISKS-10.16</A>, one of the copies bearing a botched (incomplete) last line of the
header routing information.  This looks like a NEW bug, so we have backed off
to the old mailer for a while longer -- because it had seemingly been reliable
lately.  At this point I'm ready to try the plastic bag approach.  I know that
pesticides don't provide a very sound solution, ecologically or otherwise.  PGN

Really-From: Chaz Heritage &lt;chaz heritage:wgc1:RX&gt; via Richard Busch

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.15.html">RISKS-10.15</A> Rodney Hoffman quotes from 'Business Week', 30 July 1990:

  &gt;[BMW have]already installed an early version of their Heading Control
   system in cars...A camera above the rearview mirror tracks the center
   stripe and the line along the right side of the road.  If a driver gets too
   close to either marker, a small electric motor integrated into the steering
   system is activated...Later versions will gauge road conditions...&lt;[etc.]

There are two possible problems here. Assuming (as one has no right whatever to
do) that the system as implemented is technically perfect and never fails, one
is still left with some difficulties to do with the nature of driving:

1. If, as it would seem, the system relies on the uniformity of the road
construction then it will be unable to work on roads other than motorways
(freeways, autobahnen, autostrada, etc.) which are of modern construction and
uniform design. It will definitely not work in many urban or suburban areas in
which roads are usually far from uniform. It is on such roads (probably for
similar reasons) that most accidents occur. Motorways have very low accident
rates per vehicle-mile. It is therefore odd seemingly to address only the
problem of course loss (often due to sleep) on otherwise rather safe roads.

2. Even if the course loss problem were the main concern, then without some
method of detecting a vehicle ahead and slowing or stopping the guided vehicle
automatically, the system seems likely to ensure that a sleeping driver will be
unerringly guided into a nose-to-tail collision with the first slower-moving
vehicle encountered in the same lane.

3. The decision to overtake is prompted not primarily by the absolute legality
of the operation (i.e. over which type of line one proposes to pass), but by
the view of the road ahead, which is not available to this system. A mechanical
veto on overtaking, particularly taking the form of a 'twitch' of the steering
at the critical moment when the front wheel crosses the line, seems almost
certain to bring about accidents. The system could not reasonably be expected
to distinguish between the solid line in the centre of a minor road, which one
may not cross, and the solid line around the edge of the warning zone at the
junction of a motorway and its sliproad, which line one may cross in emergency.
It could thus intervene at a critical moment during an emergency; hardly a
contribution to road safety.

4. The experience of the introduction of ABS strongly suggests that if the
system is installed then it will be systematically abused. ABS appears to
encourage some drivers both to take unreasonable risks of loss-of-control
accidents, and to demonstrate their 'machismo' by charging the last vehicle in
a stationary queue, making an 'ABS stop' at the last moment. The introduction
of BMW HCS would infallibly bring about a perception on the part of such people
that they can (a) use as many handheld telephones as they wish; (b) read the
newspaper while driving; (c) drink more alcohol before attempting to drive,
since the car can 'find its own way home'.

In my view this development and many like it are fatuous, and are not an
acceptable substitute for responsibility on the part of drivers. Expecting
people (indeed, allowing them to be encouraged) to behave competitively and
aggressively on the road and then proposing by technical means to prevent them
from causing accidents are not the correct solution to a high accident rate.

                    PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT    

    SIGSOFT '91: Conference on Software for Critical Systems

                  Location: Washington, D.C. area
                  Dates: 10-12 December, 1991 

    General Chair: 
          Mark Moriconi, SRI International (moriconi@csl.sri.com)
    Program Co-Chairs: 
          Nancy Leveson, UC Irvine  (leveson@ics.uci.edu)
          Peter Neumann, SRI International (neumann@csl.sri.com)

Computers are being introduced into systems that affect nearly every aspect of
our lives.  There are very good reasons to do so ranging from economics to
efficiency to enhancing effectiveness and capability.  But in the enthusiasm to
take advantage of computer capabilities, we are becoming increasingly
vulnerable to errors and deficiencies in the software.

The SIGSOFT '91 Conference will provide a forum in which research on all
aspects of quality in critical systems can be presented.  A critical system is
a system that must exhibit, with very high assurance, some specific qualities
such as safety, reliability, confidentiality, integrity, availability,
trustworthiness, and correctness.  The conference will focus on architectures,
design methodologies, languages, analysis techniques, processes, and experience
that can increase the likelihood that a system exhibits its required qualities.

Papers will be due in the Spring of 1991.  More details will follow.  Please
save the dates.

EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON RESEARCH IN COMPUTER SECURITY               ESORICS-90
October 24-26, 1990, Toulouse, FRANCE

The aim of this symposium is to further the progress of research in
computer security by establishing a European forum for bringing
together researchers in this area, by promoting the exchange of ideas
with system developers and by encouraging links with researchers in
related areas. To achieve this aim in the best conditions, ESORICS-90
will be a single track symposium and the selected papers will be
presented in a conference hall whose capacity is 250 attendees.

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in
environments where there is a possibility of intrusions or malicious actions.

This isn't a promise not to enforce the laws, it's a fairly straightforward
interpretation of some of the most fundamental aviation regulations in
existence (and long-standing, harking back to days of captains on the high
seas, out of touch with their admiralties for months running).

By U.S. Federal Aviation Regulation 91.3(b), "In an in-flight emergency
requiring immediate action [such as a TCAS alert], the pilot in command may
deviate from any rule of this part [including clearances] to the extent
required to meet that emergency."  I suspect that the ALPA's beef is that
they'd just like it more explicitly worded with respect to TCAS and other
automated aids, and perhaps changed to "a perceived in-flight emergency."

   This brings to mind an interesting thought: who gets the blame if
   (when) a TCAS warning *causes* a collision, through either
   electronic or human confusion?

By FAR 91.3(a), "The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly
responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of
that aircraft."  If Air Traffic Control instructs a pilot to fly into
the side of a mountain, the pilot is at fault if he follows along.  If
TCAS says "CLIMB!" it's still the pilot's responsibility to decide
whether to obey.  It's the pilot's job not to be confused.

General aviation pilots have voiced the concern that TCAS will lead to
complacency on the part of air carrier crews, depending too much on
the technology, leading to a breakdown of the basic "see and avoid"
(FAR 91.113(b)) means of avoiding collisions, which is still the only
method that will work when flying near non-transponder-equipped
aircraft.  Air carrier pilots respond, as expected, that everyone
should have a transponder.  And so it goes...

It's not clear that deviating from a clearance is violating the regulations at
all.  My evidence:

	From the Pilot/Controller Glossary:

	Emergency: a Distress or Urgency condition

	Distress: A condition of being threatened by serious
	and/or imminent danger and of requiring immediate
	assistance

	Urgency: A condition of being concerned about safety,
	and of requiring timely but not immediate assistance;
	a potential Distress condition.

So, if your TCAS has just told you that you might hit another
airplane if yuo don't change course, that's an emergency.

Now we turn to Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 91: General
Operating and Flight Rules.  Section 91.123 is where it says
you can't leave an assigned altitude:

	(a) When an ATC clearance has been obtained, no pilot in
	command may deviate from that clearance, except in an
	emergency....

	(b) Except in an emergency, no person may operate an aircraft
	contrary to an ATC instruction in an area in which air
	traffic control is exercised.

	(c) Each pilot in command who, in an emergency, deviates
	from an ATC clearance or instruction shall notify ATC
	of that deviation as soon as possible.

And section 91.3 gives blanket authorization:

	(a) The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly
	responsible for, and is the final authoriaty as to,
	the operation of that aircraft.

	(b) In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate
	action, the pilot in command may deviate from any
	rule of this part to the extent required to meet
	that emergency.

	(c) Each pilot in command who deviates from a rule under
	paragraph (b) of this section shall, upon the request of the
	Administrator, send a written report of that deviation
	to the Administrator.

This seems pretty clear.  A pilot who realizes the possibility of a midair
collision has the authority and responsibility to do whatever is necessary to
prevent it.  After deviating from course one must notify ATC (``New York
Center, Cessna 5-7-Tango turning right 2-0 degrees to avoid traffic'') and file
a written report if requested, but emergency deviations are explicitly allowed
by the regulations.

In the 10.16 edition of Risks, Mr. Miya points out that about 90% 
of research fails.  However, the Hubble telescope's problems are 
a bit more mundane, NASA just goofed.  When a research experiment 
fails to give us the answers we expected, we must adjust our theory 
and possibly our hypothsis and begin again.  Hubble's problems 
indicate to many in Congress as well as the public that NASA has 
problems managing itself as well as its contractors.  Ironically, 
it seems that a part of the difficulty stems from the use of a 
notoriously secretive Air Force affilliated contractor to do the 
critical mirrors.

RE Gene Miya's "hindsight" arguments:

	I agree that complex projects have "problems" and that many (not
"every") projects involve "compromises."  These are EXACTLY the reasons
for ADEQUATE and THOROUGH TESTING.  The lack of testing and the
fuzzy-headed thinking that rationalized away the need for testing are
nothing new to observers of the DoD (MY employer, folks).  Our systems
have been failing for years because of inadequate independent testing
and evaluation.

	I wonder if there's a connection between NASA's increasingly
poor performance and the increasingly large number of ex-DoD types
working there in VERY high places?

	"Lastly," we all agree that much "research" ends in "failure"
according to the uninformed definition of "success."   But building the
Hubble was no research project.  It was an ENGINEERING job.

Needless to say, these opinions are mine and do not constitute an official Army
position, etc, etc.

&gt;I worry about the "climate" for any

&gt;[Perkin-Elmer] is making mirrors and equipment for other project, I would
&gt;worry about Keck for instance.

I agree with your point about research, but I view Hubble as "screwed up
research" instead of "a good try that failed".  The mirror was only the latest
serious screwup.  I have no inside track on Hubble; that's just an outside
impression.

The Keck mirrors have been a concern.  There is a difference from Hubble,
however.  Keck uses asymmetrical mirror segments.  Each of the 36 segments
is a slice of the final shape.  Weights are hung from each segment, the
mirror is conventionally ground, then the weights are released.  All this
is very new, and very research oriented.  (Perkin-Elmer is not involved,
unless it happens to own Itek, the primary mirror contractor).

Hubble's mirrors are precise, but nothing special.  I find it ironic to
go back to some glowing magazine articles about how well the the mirrors
were built... they exceeded spec on several points (including reflectivity).
The builders seemed very proud.

In a recent digest, "Richard_Busch.SD"@Xerox.COM writes
&gt;   [...] Joe, a four-year-old Blue Chequer pigeon.
&gt;
&gt;   [...] Joe beat the fax in a one mile challenge race, arriving more
&gt;  than a minute before the caricature drawing of him emerged from the
&gt;  machine.

It should be noted that the pigeon was given a two-minute head start
before the fax company began its transmission.  As I read the actual
article, it appeared that the pigeon had arrived before the company even
began it transmission.

While we all may enjoy that good old-fashioned methods can sometimes
subvert the best efforts of modern technology, we should not let this be
portrayed in unrealistic examples.  The referenced excerpt made it sound
as if the two had started at the same time, requiring the pigeon to be
flying near light speed (exaggeration for dramatic effect!).

Excerpted from TIME magazine August 6, 1990

Two risks I noticed in the article:

In regards to the design of the coasters:

	To achieve these extremes, designers create computer-simulation
	models that show the effects of high speed and sudden force on the
	riders, the cars and the structure. This enables the engineers to
	build roller coasters with the steepest possible inclines and most
	sharply banked curves to create the illusion of breakneck speed.

Regarding the operation of the coasters:

	Most rides are directed by two sets of programmed logic controllers
	encased in small bunker-like rooms beneath the stations where the
	riders board the cars. The computers monitor the distances between
	trains by means of solid-state sensors embedded in the rails. If a
	train slows or stops, others behind it are halted. Multiple sets of
	pneumatic brakes can automatically slow a train down midway through
	a course. By allowing the new coasters to run three of more trains
	at the same time (as opposed to one on the old rides), the elec-
	tronics have boosted rider capacity from an average of 500 people
	an hour to more than 2,000.
	      Park operators say the technology has also improved safety.
	Some coasters, like nuclear-missile launchers, require two attendants,
	pushing separate buttons, to dispatch a train. [text deleted]
	      Operator error has been eliminated," asserts Richard Kinzel,
	president of Ohio's Cedar Point park. Says Paul Ruben, editor of
	"RollerCoaster!" magazine: "If people really knew how safe they are,
	roller coasters would lose a lot of their thrill."

announced on the gnu.announce mailing list that the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm
on which "compress", "uncompress", and "zcat" may be covered by a patent
assigned to Unisys.  Unisys claims that people should not be running these
programs without their permission.

Since "compress" is the de facto standard method for moving big files across
the net cheaply (and I believe for high speed modems as well), this could
create some serious problems.  For one thing, if people stop using compress it
could really put a strain on the network.

On the other hand, sending people compressed files could put them in the
potentially legally precarious position of running uncompress without
permission.  This is the position the GNU folks seem to be taking.  They will
either find a new data compression algorithm or send around uncompressed files
(as soon as they can find the disk space to store the uncompressed tar files!)

If the POSIX committee is not able to license the algorithm, they will drop
these utilities from the next draft of the standards (according to a draft of
the POSIX user portability extension standard P1003.2a).

Depending on your political orientation, this can be viewed as a RISK of
software patents or a RISK of dependence on a de facto standard.  In either
case, life may be a little tougher without "compress".

In Risks 10.16, Eugene N. Miya &lt;eugene@wilbur.nas.nasa.gov&gt; claims that 90% of
research experiments fail.  I trust he is using a different definition of
failure than most scientists.

An experiment is a test designed to discover something not yet known.  An
experiment fails only when nothing is learned.  It is usually (some would
say definitively) the result of improper design of the experiment.

It is a matter of lore that Thomas Edison tried over 1000 different materials
for making light bulb filiments before finding tungsten.  I view that (as I
believe most scientists would) as 1000 successful experiments, 999 showing that
certain materials won't work, and probably giving some indication as to why.  I
expect the 90% failure rate Mr. Miya speaks of is from the point of view that
this was 999 failures and 1 success.  I also suspect that this figure was more
or less invented ("estimated" is the conventional euphemism) by someone,
although probably not Mr. Miya.

The Hubble (which is what started all this) is a (partial) failure because its
mirror problems are keeping parts of the telescope from providing anything
useful; it is not discovering anything not previously known.  This is quite
different from having a perfect Hubble showing us that the view from up there
looks exactly like the view from down here; that would be very surprising and
educational indeed!

Improper use of statistics is one of the greatest problems we face today.
Most often, their use is misleading just as in this example, where vague
terms obscure the actual meaning of the statistic.  If 90% of government
funded experiments fail (as I take the meaning of failure), this is a very
serious problem calling for overhaul of the whole government funding system.
If, however, the 90% just don't yield the hoped for outcome, who cares?

Some anti-abortionists claim they have surveys indicating a vast majority
of Americans "support some restrictions on abortion."  This could conceivably
mean that most Americans feel that women should have to wait at least 4 hours
between the time they ask for an abortion and the time it is performed, to 
give them a chance to change their mind.  Obviously the intent is to make
people think that most people are opposed to people having abortions.  
Please no flames on abortion politics, this is just about the statistical 
claim, which I believe was made to support AT&amp;T's decision to withdraw its
support from Planned Parenthood.

I wish there were some way we could reduce the risks to society of statistics.
We have drug testing, sobriety checkpoints, tax systems, and all sorts of other
government programs which are sold to the public on the basis of just such
statistics.  A recent Scientific American article refuted the claim that
mandatory testing of employees for drugs is beneficial, by reexamining the
studies and what their results can show; these results were often used in a
misleading way by citing only some statistical findings.  Other researchers
have determined that there is no sound basis for the cholesterol-lowering
treatment regimens many people are put on to reduce the risk of heart attack;
the studies indicate a correlation between high cholesterol and risk of heart
attack, but do not show that lowering cholesterol by the amounts normally
achieved with "conventional" treatment have *any* effect on heart disease.
(There is a brand new study which shows some beneficial effects of a
comprehensive therapy which reduces cholesterol among other benefits, but that
study reduces cholesterol much more than "conventional" therapies, and they do
not even claim that the cholesterol reductions are the reason for the therapies
success, since some people in the study had very high levels even after the
reduction.)

So be very skeptical of statistics, and try to find a solution to this problem.
Meanwhile remember, as some net-person reminds us in his signature, 

  97.43% of all statistics are made up.

In Risks 10.15 Peter Mellor quotes an article from the Guardian about
signalling problems in British Rail.

I would like to add a few comments on this material lest Risks readers get the
wrong ideas.

&gt;From the descriptions in the article, and from memory, the area is fitted with
what is known as an NX signalling system with a VDU and tracker-ball based
user interface. These systems consists of two independent parts - the
interlocking and the control system.

The interlocking is relay based circuitry which actually controls points and
signals. In computer terms, its input are push buttons and hardware train
detectors (usually track circuits, which detect trains because they connect
the rails together electrically), and its outputs are signal lamps, points
motors settings, and display lamps.

The interlocking is a safety-critical system, and is designed accordingly.
The system must be proof, for example, against any combination of relays
failing normally, and against an earth fault at any single point. It is the
responsibility of the interlocking to ensure that two trains cannot be
signalled on colliding paths, for example.

&gt; A BR spokesman said newly installed software, responsible for flashing up the
&gt; position of trains on the indicator screens of signal operators at Wimbledon,
&gt; has been found to contain two technical faults.

In older installations, the push buttons and display lamps mentioned above
are physically present; a route is set for a train by pressing two buttons,
and a train's presence is indicated by a magenta light. In newer systems,
including I believe the one in question, the displays and controls are
computer and VDU based. The display system is *not* safety critical, as any
malfunction can only cause bad commands to be sent to the interlocking.

A third part is the train identification system. This takes information from
the interlocking and from manual input, and displays train identities on the
control panel or screen. It has no input back to the interlocking, and so is
also not safety critical. BR has used computers in these systems for thirty
years.

It would appear from the quote that one of these two failed.

&gt; An internal investigation began after an operator found
&gt; that the system was providing "the wrong information". Realising that he had 
&gt; lost track of train movements, the operator immediately turned all signals to 
&gt; red.

A bit drastic ! The trains would all be following safe and valid routes.

&gt; A spokesman said that at no time was any train at risk. "What happened caused
&gt; concern to the signalman."
True.

&gt; The lights told him that something was different to what was happening
&gt; [outside]." ...
&gt; The software faults were found inside the panel in the train indicator box in
&gt; a system responsible for operating the lights. ...
&gt; BR conceded that the faulty equipment served a vital function ...

Vital, but not safety critical.

Paul asks:

&gt; It would be nice to know *how* the signalman knew that he was being given
&gt; wrong information, and what would have happened if he had not been so alert,
&gt; and continued to operate the network with the wrong information.

Depending on which sub-system failed, perhaps he was seeing routes set which
cross each other, or train 1E23 on his panel (this train is never less than
200km from Waterloo). Trying to operate the system blind (assuming the
push-button simulator wasn't malfunctioning as well) would be awkward, but
certainly less difficult than operating with all signals at red and trains
moved through verbal orders.

&gt; If, as the manufacturer states, the system is under test, why was it being run
&gt; to control live traffic without any back-up system?

First you test it on a model railway. Then you hook in the display system in
parallel with the existing one, and see what happens. Eventually, however, you
have to go live.

"Run for the hills! Congress is in session!"

The following item was included in a column on printer technology in the
August '90 issue of "St. Louis Computing," a tabloid freebie local paper:

"...computer printers have become so advanced that the Treasury Department 
is concerned that they will soon be used to print money. Michigan
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. has introduced a bill that would make it a
crime to possess any device that the Treasury Department concludes would
facilitate counterfeiting."

Hmmmm.... I hope the generality is in the reporting and not in the proposed
legislation, because "any device" as cited above includes eyeballs,
pencils, engraving tools, paper, ink, color copiers, and millions of
other items both mundane and esoteric... If the legislation is actually
written so broadly or vaguely, I nominate it for "dumb bill of the month".

Anyone out there know the actual details of this proposal?

According to a story by John Kendall in the 'Los Angeles Times' 10 August
1990, a computerized voice recognition system will be used in a six-month
pilot program to assure that gang members on probation stay home during
"Red Alerts," declared by the Probation Dept.

&gt;From the article:  

"A computer will telephone designated gang members at random during the
hours they are restricted.  The computer will direct them to state their
names and repeat after the computer as it names several states.  The
computer will then electronically analyze their responses and compare the
findings with voice tapes made earlier.  If the computer questions any of
its contacts, it will notify monitors, and a probation officer will be sent
to check in person....

"Probation Department Deputy Director Michael Lindsey ... expects the
computer monitor program to be in place sometime this month.  If it is
deemed a success, he wants to extend electronic monitoring to the entire
county, with upward of 1,000 gang members in the system eventually.  But
first, the present program must be perfected, he says.

"The $19,000 system employs a computer and voice-analysis software provided
free to the Probation Department for six months by BI Inc., a Boulder, CO
firm.  Currently, four college students are preparing background
information for the computer on 100 gang members.  Next, deputy probation
officers will record their charges' voices for comparison by computer.

"When gang trouble develops, the police and probation officers will
identify the gangs involved, determine what members are on probation and
tell them individually to stay home for periodic checks by the computer.
Lindsey hopes that computer monitoring will afford soft-core gang members
an excuse to stay out of trouble."

computerized radar and communications equipment designed especially for the
Saudis, has been a problem for Boeing.  The equipment was designed as a
ground-based air defense system to complement the airborne AWACS, but Boeing
engineers are still attempting to debug the system's softwear [sic].  The
softwear is made by Computer Sciences Corp. of El Segundo, Calif.  Boeing
officials said Peace Shield was scheduled to be completed next year, but is
behind schedule.

By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
    WASHINGTON (AP) - A NASA committee investigating the focusing flaw that
crippled the Hubble Space Telescope said Thursday that there was an error of
about 1 millimeter in a measuring device used to grind the telescope mirrors.
In the precise world of optics, such an error is ``astonishing,'' said one
expert.  
    A one-page statement released by NASA said a committee investigating the
Hubble problem found that a measuring device called a reflective null corrector
had been adjusted incorrectly when the primary mirror was being ground and
polished at the Hughes Danbury Optical Systems plant in Danbury, Conn.  Hughes
Danbury had preserved the null corrector in the exact position that had been
used to grind and polish the mirrors in the early 1980s and the investigation
committee tested the device on Wednesday.
    Preliminary results of the test, the statement said, ``have revealed
a clear discrepancy of approximately one millimeter between the
design of the null corrector and the device as it exists.''  [...]
    Daniel Schulte, a senior scientist at the optical laboratory at the
Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory in California, said that an error of
that magnitude was ``astonishing.'' ``That's gross,'' he said. ``There's no
reason for an error of that size to be tolerated.''  Schulte said that in
normal optical manufacturing, a tolerance of a 20th or a 50th of a millimeter
is considered ``standard tolerance.''  He said the error was so large ``it had
to be a transposition of numbers or something like that, that was carried
through. It had to be something clerical like that.''  Schulte, an astronomer,
was a member of an independent panel named by NASA to evaluate the Hubble
focusing flaw just after it was discovered in June.
    A null corrector is a device that can be adjusted to create a pattern of
light in the exact shape desired in an optical lens or mirror. The light
pattern from a null corrector is interpreted by another device to tell a
computer the precise grinding and polishing pattern that must be followed.
However, if the null corrector is set wrong, then the lens or mirror will be
ground to an incorrect shape. In effect, the optics are then made to the wrong
prescription and cannot give the expected focus.  [...]

Many thanks to Clive Feather for explaining (<A HREF="/Risks/10.18.html">RISKS-10.18</A>) what probably
happened when a BR signalman closed down a part of the network because he
could (apparently) no longer trust the information displayed to him.

Disclaimer: I know next to nothing about railway signalling, so I could only
quote the Guardian news item verbatim (but adding a few speculations of my own).
Clive is obviously much better informed.

On one point, however, I do stand firm. That is the manufacturer's preposterous
(at any rate, it sounded preposterous to me) claim that the system was still 
'under test'.

As Clive says:

&gt; First you test it on a model railway. Then you hook in the display system in
&gt; parallel with the existing one, and see what happens. Eventually, however, you
&gt; have to go live.

I entirely agree, but that was my point: when you go live, the system is no
longer 'going through a testing stage' as the manufacturer said. If the system
is 'under test', then, as Clive says, you run it *in parallel* with the
existing system (as the final stage of its trial). The new system goes live,
without back-up parallel systems, when the manufacturer is confident that its
reliability is no worse than the system it replaces.

He can't have it both ways!

The message in RISKS regarding compress was unnecessarily alarming.  In fact,
it really represents the start of a chain of hundreds of Usenet messages
discussing the Unisys patent in detail, including various postings by the
compress authors.  There is considerable question regarding software-only
implementations of the algorithms, *which* algorithms really are involved,
Unisys' true intentions, compression vs. decompression, validity or invalidity
of the patent if tested in court, etc.  It is not a simple situation, and there
is significant evidence that some people may have become alarmed unnecessarily,
or at the very least prematurely.

People who need more information about this subject should look over the entire
discussion if possible, not react to the initial statement.  This would seem to
be a risk of seeing only the first message in a chain!

There may yet be potential complications regarding compress and the Unisys
patent, but this is by *no* means an established fact at this point and is a
matter of active analysis at this time.

The 14 Aug. New York Times reports that a "Rogue Computer" is billing New
Yorkers $19 million a year for parking violations they have not committed.

City Councilman Andy Stein insists that the city must hire an independent
auditor before a consulting company's contract for $11m is renewed.

A spokesperson for the Bureau call Mr. Stein's statements "hyperbolic", adding
that the bureau only makes $4m in errors, not $19m.

The system processes about 12m summonses a year, resulting in an average of
42,000 complaints against the city.  The bureau officials feel that a resulting
percentage of .003 is quite good.

Previously, the system had been operating at 82,000 errors annually.

Monday, many of those who have been unfairly ticked held a news conference.

A Mr. Hernandez, who began receiving tickets prior to being of legal driving
age, has never held a license and never owened a car, (he also claims not to
know how to drive) received $4,152 in parking tickets and has had is wages
attached.  Another example is a individual who had his license plates stolen,
reported it promptly, and still receives summonses.  The bureau advises him to
track down the car that bears his plates as the only solution.

In summary, we have another example of computerized bureaucracy more than a
little out of control.

Dr. Caroline Dow and Dr. Douglas Covert, assistant professors of
communication at the University of Evansville Indiana, believe they
have linked noise made by video display terminals with stress symptoms
in women, who hear high-frequency sounds better than men.

The AP article, reported in the Aug 12, 1990 San Jose Mercury News (all the
news we twist to fit*), reports that the couple first became interested when Dow
noticed the subconciously irritating effect that a university computer she was
using had on her.

Tests on 41 students in April 1987 showed that the subjects exhibited the
stress symptoms of speeded up work and a doubling of their error rate when
doing clerical work in a room where the high-pitched sound was created.  Dow
said, "We can all work through that sound, but it is tiring and distracting."
They hope their research will be expanded on by others, possibly linking the
noise with headaches, tension, miscarriages, and other health problems.

Men are rarely bothered by the 16 kilohertz pure-tone sound, as they generally
cannot hear frequencies above 15kHz, while women can hear up to around 18
kilohertz, Dow also said.  Dow and Covert were to present their findings at the
Minneapolis national convention for Education in Journalism and Mass
Communications.

Will Martin asked about the Riegle bill that would make it a crime to possess
any device that the Treasury Department concludes would facilitate
counterfeiting.  I don't know anything specifically about that bill but will
pass on info concerning the larger issue. (Those who want the bill can contact
Sen. Riegle's office or contact the U.S. Capitol switchboard ((202-224-3121))
and ask how to get a copy.)

Several years ago, the Treasury Dept. became aware that color copiers had
reached a level of reproduction clarity that the technology could be used for
counterfeiting.  A study was done by Battelle on the issue and supposedly a
recommendation was made that there be changes in U.S. currency design to prevent
counterfeiting of this sort.  I understand that the change was to include
certain metallic-like threads that would be incorporated into the paper used for
printing currency.  The threads would prevent true copies from being made or,
depending upon how they were used, to make it easier to spot counterfeit money
since they would not look the same as the true currency when eyeballed by a
bank.  So far, I have not heard of the new bills being distributed or whether
old currency will have to be traded in.  

My guess is that the Riegle bill is not in response to that issue but more due
to an article that was in Forbes Magazine last year.  The article described how
desktop publishing could easily be used to create false financial documents,
including checks, certificates, and other documents, such as school transcripts,
that could be used for financial gain.  DTP fraud worries bankers, who already
have come across several cases.   

My guess is that the bill does not *outlaw* printers, computers, or other
devices but may be an attempt to beef up the counterfeiting laws on the books
and force the Treasury to determine ways to protect easily copied financial
instruments. After all, Riegle is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,
where they sure know about illegal creation of funds (the Keating Five) and
restricting flows of money (the Savings and Loan crisis).

Hope this stops rumors that the Feds are trying to outlaw computers.

Several people have asked for references to the Scientific American article
which I mentioned in RISKS 10.18.  The article is "Test Negative: A look at the
'evidence' justifying illicit-drug tests" by John Horgan in _Scientific
American_ Vol. 262, No 3., pages 18 &amp; 22; March 1990.  The author examines the
broader question of making unjustified conclusions from research findings, in
the context of illicit-drug use, and concludes that on-the-job illicit-drug
testing does not have any scientific justification.

Also, it was pointed out that the legend has it that Edison discovered the
carbon filament, not the tungsten filament.  I apologize for the error.

Programmers are now coming to grips with the fact that they are no longer free
to write and distribute programs in the United States.  Both user interface
copyrights and software patents create monopolies on large classes of computer
programs, thus restricting the programs that most of us are allowed to develop.

For example, Unisys claims a patent covers compress, which may soon be a
required part of a national standard (POSIX user portability extensions).
Companies delivering the supposedly free X Windows server are being threatened
with lawsuits by two different companies.

The League for Programming Freedom is an organization dedicated to bringing
back this freedom.  The members include professors, students, entrepreneurs,
and many programmers.  Prominent members include Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy,
Robert S. Boyer (known for fast string search), and Guy L. Steele, Jr.

The League advocates the abolition of copyright on interfaces and of software
patents.  It does not oppose copyright as it was understood until a few years
ago--copyright on individual programs.

For more information on the patent threats mentioned above, on the League
position, and on the arguments behind it, write to league@prep.ai.mit.edu and
ask for the position papers.

}Since "compress" is the de facto standard method for moving big files across
}the net cheaply ...
} They will
}either find a new data compression algorithm or send around uncompressed files
}(as soon as they can find the disk space to store the uncompressed tar files!)

Of course, sending around uncompressed files is unbelievably idiotic.  That
WOULD be consistent with the general FSF philosphy, which is to apparently
avoid innovation at all costs and restrict their activities to implementing
other people's ideas.

Plain and simple, there are zillions of compression schemes about.  'compress'
is hardly the best of them, although it is quite good.  Its major advantage and
popularity is more accidental than that it depends on any real technical
necessity [a questionably-public-domain implementation 'made the rounds', and
it *IS* better than the adaptive Huffman coding compression, which is what was
previously being used.  And so it kind of 'snuck in'.  Few people using
compress have any intellectual or technical investment in it: in fact, few have
any clue what the algorithm even IS: if it were changed to something else
tomorrow almost no one would know or care.

While on a recent visit to Scandinavia, I encountered "Ex, the
magazine for Nordic airport passengers".  Despite my citizenship not
being Nordic :-), I read the July/August issue.

An item titled "Costly Debt" reports the sad case of Bjarne Arnhaug,
of Vestfossen, Norway.  It seems that he bought a lightning rod
which for some reason was priced at 3040.62 kr., say about $500 US.
But Norway has eliminated its smallest coins, so that the closest you
can get to making up that amount in cash is 3040.60.  And when he charged
the purchase, that was the amount the bank's computer billed him for.

Presumably it was the store's computer that, after 6 months, turned over
the remaining debt of 0.02 kr. to a collection agency, which then billed
Arnhaug for that amount plus 45.00 kr. in fees and interest!

Arnhaug's comment: "I find this a curiosity but I wonder if the debt
collector has any control system when such things are allowed to happen.
Computers are normally a good thing, but they must be used with common
sense. ... Maybe I have a [0.02 kr.] coin hidden somewhere to give them
if they are really so poor.  But I am not going to pay the extra bill."

I received an anonymous letter today describing a bank problem that seems
worthy of mention.  However, since the anonymous contributor did not want
his/her name mentioned, I shall not mention the identity of the bank either.

  "At the beginning of August, 1990, the physical plant/maintenance department
decided to test the fire-control system in the computer room.  The part of the
system that shuts off all computer power was supposed to be disconnected first.
Computer operations supervision was notified first, and approved of the test.
So *at the approved time* (which was *during the day*, and *in the middle of
month-end processing*), the system was tested and all computer power was lost!
  "The computer was down for about a day while the staff worked to restart it.
[The bank] missed the deadline for the Federal Reserve's month-end
requirements.  All teller machines shut down, and all bank branches, too (and
probably had to pay the resulting penalty/fine...).
  "I'll bet they test their automatic fire control/computer shutoff system
differently next time."  [End of anonymous contribution]

Upon opening our Saturday, August 11th USmail, we were greeted by "one of
those" government looking letters from the US Department Of Education.
Nervously, we dropped all other USmail, and tore it open.

When we opened it, we were greeted with a intimidating letter that we owed
~$700.00 on my wife's Guaranteed Student Loan. I remarked that I'd paid the
loan off-in full in 1989 (May 31st, to be exact), and that I'd call them on
Monday.

Well, I just got off of the phone with them. There's a massive problem caused
by malfunctioning "new computer &amp; new software" said the person on the other
end of the phone. "let me transfer you to another extension".  At that
extension, a very harried man answered, I gave my story, wife's SSN, etc., and
he said "your wife's account is paid in full -- you've got the "Computer
Problem" also. He explained that there was a massive problem. Then, he
explained that I'd be transferred to abother extension, where I could explain
it to a person, who could post "Account Paid".

OK, I've now been forwarded to the next person. This person sounds worn out,
like serious burnout from his job is happening. Once again I explain, give him
my wife's SSN, he checks, and says "Yep, you're wife got it too"!!.  I thought
I'd try to find out more from this person(who had phones ringing in the
background). Iasked him what the problem was, he explained "About 2 weeks ago,
a new system was brought online". "The new system seems to have forgotten about
300,000 ++ paid debts". "So that machine a couple of days ago started sending
out delinquent notices to all these folks". He went on to explain that the new
system had been "disabled", thus rendering it unable to generate any more
inaccurate bills!!!

I've got to wonder how many folks, upon seeing this notice from the govt,
blindly went and paid the bill anyway thinking that they were still not paid
off on their loans.

Thank God, I got through. They're reposting that my wife's account is paid
off ...

I recently received a postcard with the following text:

"Due to a human error at our computer service your renewal to VeloNews was
started with the wrong issue date."

The postcard goes on to apologize and to explain how they will compensate
for their error.  Nice to see someone who doesn't blame the machines!

The following happened to a relative of mine who obtained a computer
for his kids.  Names have been omitted to protect the guilty:

The new computer worked, but not well: it failed to boot off one of the system
disks.  There followed a trip back to the store.  Other computers in the store
showed the same failure.  The manufacturer was telephoned and abused.  In
desperation a virus check was run.  It revealed an infection.

It transpired that before allowing a computer to leave the store, the salesman
checked that the system worked and that the disks could be read.  What he did
not realise was that a virus had infected the store demonstration computer's
hard disk (from a pirate game played by a staff member probably).  This
(somehow) meant that ALL computers leaving the store carried the virus.

Its a pity, really: having conscientious quality control defeated in such a way.

Paul.

    [Starkly excerpted by PGN from selections from SKlein]

There is much more to the article excerpted below, which appeared in Washington
CityPaper, a weekly muckraking free newspaper distributed in and around the
Washington, DC area.  The article was written by Greg Kitsock, August 10th
issue (Volume 10, No 32?).  Washington City Paper at 724 9th Street NW, 5th
floor, Washington, DC 20001.  Phone (202) 628-6528.  They can also be reached
at MCI Mail 384-9327.

Bent Out of Shape:

Four years and millions of dollars after Challenger, NASA thinks it's got the
shuttle's glitches all straightened out.  But engineer Ali AbuTaha insists
there are a fatal few that NASA missed.

Ali AbuTaha, an engineer with 20-years of aerospace experience traces the
Challenger disaster--and future disasters if his warnings aren't heeded--to a
radical change in launch procedures that was mandated by NASA officials just
prior to the shuttle's maiden voyage in 1981.  That change in launch
procedures, says AbuTaha, has subjected every mission to liftoff forces far
exceeding the hardware's safety margins.

   [There is a fascinating bit about the torque while revving to full throttle
   before takeoff, because of the asymmetry with respect to the boosters,
   producing a motion known as `twang', and AbuTaha's analysis of the
   situation.]

     "The Rogers Commission was not oblivious to shuttle "twang."  But it
rejected the idea that twang had anything to do with the Challenger disaster.
Page 54 of the first volume of the commission's report states, 'The resultant
total bending moment experienced by [the Challenger] was 291 x 10^6
inch-pounds, which is within the design's allowable limit of 347 x 10^6
inch-pounds.'  However, on Page 1,351 of Volume 5 of the report, the commission
cites the same figure, written as '291,000,000,' as the bending moment for the
_right_ solid booster only.  The effect on the entire assembly, argues AbuTaha,
should be the combined bending moments of both boosters.  Multiply by two, and
you arrive at the maximum force that AbuTaha calculated.

     "This figure is 70 percent greater than the design's allowable limit,
as cited in the Rogers report.  And every shuttle mission up to the
Challenger explosion (and possibly afterward) has experienced this force.
'This is the kind of error that catches up with you,' warns AbuTaha.

     "Not only does this miscalculation explain the shuttle disaster that
killed seven astronauts and set our space program back nearly three years, as
AbuTaha suggests, it also reveals the source of the mysterious malfunctions
that have plagued the shuttle program since its first launch in 1981, from
tiles knocked off and booster segments warped to satellites that inexplicably
failed to work."

I was amused by the article about the store which inadvertently virussed
the disks of every computer it sold in "checking" them to make sure they
wold work.  I have the following similar story:

At Harvard, there is a large room full of computers (mostly macintosh) in the
basement of the Science Center for students to use to write papers, etc.
Because a lot of software is available "for loan" from a software library in an
adjoining room, this setup is obviously very vulnerable to viruses.

It seems that "those in the know," in order to combat this problem, have set up
one computer running some disinfectant-type program or other constantly; it is
the "disinfecting station" and there are signs posted to tell students and
other users to make sure to disinfect all their disks on a regular basis.

The RISK is clear: although their anti-virus program is very effective, sooner
or later, a virus will be invented which will elude its defenses.  And then all
these students will be swapping their disks in and out to make sure they won't
get any viruses ...

A couple people here at Sun have gotten phones calls from "MST" in Kansas City,
offering free magazines "because of our good subscription records".  Mine came
to my office phone, while others have gotten them at home.

They will give you 4 magazines free, for 60 months at no
charge.  "No charge? Absolutely free???" says us.

 "Well, there's a minor processing fee of $2.30 a week."

Which comes out to $120.00 per year for 4 magazines.   click

After hearing from others how the magazines were pretty much tailored to their
interests (computers, sports, whatever), it seems that they probably are simply
using a computerized mailing list to generate calls to subscribers about other
publications in the same category as their hobbies and interests.  Nothing
special about that - their only hope is that people fall for the $2.30 a week
ploy.

Well, you could generate a fairly accurate list of interests from Usenet, if
you could compile stats of what newsgroups people read regularly.  Scanning
someone's .newsrc file (or whatever is appropriate for their reader), could be
done under program control (sort of a Nielson service), looking for groups in
which the user has marked articles to be read or whatever.  The news lists
"arbitron" program does something like this, but does so anonymously and with
no commercial intent.

Rumors periodically circulate that someones manager is suspected of snooping by
checking out what newsgroups his charges are reading this way.

So what kind of magazine offer will I get if I read alt.flame?

Someone recently expressed the opinion that the uncertainty over the validity
of the compress patent means there is no reason to be alarmed today.

I think this conclusion is inadvisable.  The validity of any patent is
uncertain until there is a lawsuit.  That does not mean it is wise to ignore
this problem until a suit is decided.

The problem with compress is a little like that of global warming: by the time
you can be sure the problem is real, it is too late to solve it easily.  The
more the use of compress spreads, the harder it will be to stop using it, if
and when Unisys threatens to sue you.  The prudent thing to do is to stop now
when it is easier to do.

This patent is important for another reason as well: it shows us the kind of
trouble patents are likely to cause.  If you are lucky this time, and either
Unisys never sues you or they lose a suit, that doesn't mean you will be lucky
with the next patent.  Thus, the compress patent should serve as a warning
about the danger of software patents.

If you would like to challenge Unisys in court and try to defeat the patent, by
all means do so.  But this can solve only a small part of the problem of
patents.  Fighting one patent at a time is prohibitively expensive and you
can't expect to win each time.  The only way to solve the whole problem is to
make software exempt from patents.

  If the algorithm on compress were changed tomorrow, every person who ever
used the old one would be unable to recover the data from the compressed form.
I think that's a far cry from "almost no one would know or care."

  More improtant, the performance of compress (bytes/cpu-sec) is very good
compared to the other available programs. I ran a test on this (for other
reasons), and found that compress is a factor of four faster (CPU) than any of
the other compressors. It is not by any stretch the best in terms of
compression, but an increase that large in time to compress news batches would
make news impractical on many machines.

  Here's a subset of the test results, for a typical news batch (text).
Times are in sec, measured by the kernel, on a 25MHz 386 running V.3.2.
Note that the size for the archivers includes a directory.

			CPU		final		COMMENTS
Program			sec		size	(original 56718 bytes)

compress		0.78		25486
zoo			1.96		28178	archiver
arc			2.84		29284	archiver (w/ "squash")
zip v1.02		3.76		21031	archiver, run under MSDOS
lharc v2 (beta)		6.93		20602	archiver, run under MSDOS
lharc v1		7.12		22952	archiver
lzhuf			7.64		22918


  Hope that sheds some light on the discussion. There does not seem to
be anything as fast currently available (to me).

In fact, the FSF's raison d'etre is to encourage innovation by making it
unnecessary for programmers to write code that's already been written.  The GNU
project is in a drudgery phase right now since they *are* having to rewrite
much existing code.  At least these programs are being improved as they're
being rewritten.  GNU Tar, for example, does incremental backups.  Their most
successful product, GNU Emacs, was the original idea of the FSF's founder,
Richard Stallman.

&gt;Few people using
&gt;compress have any intellectual or technical investment in it: in fact, few have
&gt;any clue what the algorithm even IS: if it were changed to something else
&gt;tomorrow almost no one would know or care.

Not true.  Although the LZW compression algorithm is transparent to users of
compress, as it should be, files compressed using it couldn't be uncompressed
by a replacement program.  The existing base of compressed files in public
archives and private systems combined with the nearly ubiquitous presence of
compress, uncompress, and zcat on today's UNIX systems would make a switch to
an alternative method far from easy, fast, or transparent.

&gt;For example, Unisys claims a patent covers compress, which may soon be a
&gt;required part of a national standard (POSIX user portability extensions).

As an aside, it should be noted that inclusion of patented technology in
national standards is nothing new, when it is considered the best approach
and when the patent holder is willing to promise reasonable licensing.
(The inclusion of compress in POSIX is, last I heard, conditional on such
a promise from Unisys.) 

A good example of this is Ethernet, overwhelmingly the standard medium-
performance LAN, which is a national standard despite being covered by Xerox
patents.  Almost nobody realizes that Ethernet is patented and that your
Ethernet equipment supplier is paying royalties to Xerox.  This is a good
example of managing patents properly: the inventors profit and the public
interest is nevertheless well served.  Unfortunately, it's not always that way.

In the Wall Street Journal of Tuesday, August 14, 1990, on the front
page, there is a VERY interesting story about so-called credit doctors.
People who will, for a fee, help you fix your credit rating.

Some people who provide this function are legitimate.  Some are not.  There are
several methods detailed in the story that are used (illegally) to allow people
with bad credit to obtain more credit.

One of the more frightening examples was where a customer with bad credit
enters such a place and for a fee, is provided with information to be used to
apply for credit.  Among this new information is a "newly assigned" social
security number (the client claimed ignorance of illegal doing, but getting a
ssn from anyone OTHER than the Social Security Administration, not to mention
getting a NEW one at all, seems like it should be a BIG red flag!).  The
"credit doctor" has used bought or stolen access codes on credit bureau
computers to search (note, this is a READ-ONLY operation) the database for
other people with identical or similar names.  He then copies down THAT
PERSON'S ssn, address, mother's maiden name, whatever is there and provides it
to his client with instructions that it be used when making new credit
applications.

Of course, eventually, when the client (either intentionally or because of
continued bad financial habits) defaults on a payment, the credit bureau comes
after the poor slob whose information was lifted.  One woman is STILL trying to
get things sorted out and people won't extend her credit now even though her
file lists her as a victim of fraud.

People named John Smith should be quaking in their boots.  :-(

The credit bureaus are claiming this particular hole is plugged now by
requiring more information about someone before being able to call up their
credit record.

Another method was to (legitimately) contest all bad references in a client's
file.  By law, all contested references cannot be reported for 90 days until
things are cleared up.  During that 90 days, the client can apply for all kinds
of credit and have a favorable credit report.  This is clearly an abuse of the
system that should be fixed within the system.  The victim here is the merchant
who unknowingly extends credit to someone who doesn't deserve it, who may or
may not receive payments due at some time in the future.

All around a pretty scary article.  Obviously not enough thought has gone into
our system of maintaining credit information.  One of the "credit doctors"
claimed to be forcing a change to a broken system (and therefore justifying his
actions for the common good!).  The implication is that the whole credit system
may be changing (mutating?) very soon.

The posting in <A HREF="/Risks/10.20.html">RISKS-10.20</A> on gang members subject to computer voice
recognition while under detention and avoiding it by forwarding their
calls to cell phones reminded me of this: 

Over the past weekend, here in the St. Louis area, there were a string of gas
station robberies. A man who was under one of those "house arrest"
restrictions, with an electronic device fastened to his ankle and a sensor in
his home, linked to the telephone, was arrested and charged with these crimes.
It turned out that, while the computer (a PC) that monitors these detainees
works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the humans who have the duty of checking
the computer's output work a 9-to-5 5-day-week schedule, so nobody was there
over the weekend to notice that the computer had been reporting that this guy
was not at home. This was in a particular Illinois jurisdiction, I believe. (I
don't think they have this program operating in St. Louis City yet.)

Of course, the publicity about this now has notified all such detainees
that they are 'free' over the weekends. Of course, their 'escape' will
be discovered Monday morning, and they then could be jailed (if caught)
for breaking the terms of their detention.

Anyway, after seeing that RISK item about call-forwarding, I immediately
thought of the following: These detainees could all get together for a party
and still remain undetected if they conspired together to all meet at the
residence of one of the group. Each of the others would set their own phones to
call-forward to that site. That call-receiving phone would have the electronic
sensor attached, and, thus, when a call was placed to any of the detainees'
phones, it would be answered at the meeting site, and the sensor on that phone
would properly report that the detainee wearing the device that responds to the
code sent was in fact there.  [They would be vulnerable only during the travel
time it takes to get from their residences to the meeting site, and could
probably arrange to travel during the interval between calls.]

Would this deception be detectable by the monitor? Are the sensors and
ankle-units made as a pair, so the sensor will only interact with its own
particular ankle unit? Or are the sensors generic, so they will just detect if
the ankle unit asked about is in range? For that matter, are the ankle units
coded to the individual detainee, so that the system queries if unit "123Z" is
in range, or does the system just check to see if any ankle unit is in range?

If the sensors are generic, then the next step after the meeting for the party
would be for a confederate of one of the detainees to go to his residence, and
remove the sensor unit from the phone. (Remember the detainee is already away
at the other site, and being detected by the sensor there. So no one should
detect this removal.) Then that sensor is attached to a cellular phone, which
is given to the group of detainees.  They then set the meetingplace-site phone
to call-forward all calls to the cellular phone, and provide power for that
sensor unit attached thereto. Thus they can then travel about as a group and
engage in a crime spree, with a perfect alibi -- the computerized records will
still show them all at their respective homes under electronic detention!

This won't work if the sensor only detects its matching ankle unit, but I would
guess that having the sensor just be a device that would get an ankle-unit code
from the computer and query the neighborhood for that code's presence would be
cheaper and simpler, avoiding problems like having to reprogram a sensor when
an ankle unit is broken, and thus would be more likely for budget-limited
municipalities.

It also won't work if I have the wrong idea about how these things operate. I'm
assuming the monitor site calls the sensor-equipped phones, and they don't do
anything like detect when the ankle unit leaves their range and call in and
report that fact.

I donate this idea to the public domain; if you write a "movie of the week"
screenplay based on it and become rich and famous, you can put my name in the
credits as "Original idea by ...". :-)

An amusing juxtaposition of topics, since Edison was very fond of a wine drink
which contained considerable amounts of cocaine.  According to contemporary
reports, it consumed it in considerable quantities.  Remember back in school
when you were indoctrinated with the "Thomas Edison" story - about how he'd
work all night and only get a few hours of sleep a day - now you know why.

1.  I'm glad that the New York Times headline put quotes around `Rogue
Computer': it's surely a matter of lousy software design or persistent
operational errors, rather than some real-life HAL from the movie _2001_, and
the Times seems to know that.  (I _hope_ that the readers caught the
implication.)

2.  The Times quotes PVB spokescritter Stephanie Pinto, as saying that if you
divide 42,000 (errors) by 12 million (tickets) you get 0.003, (0.0035 actually)
and asking ``Is three-tenths of one percent reckless?''.  If my bank posted 3
out of every thousand transactions to the wrong account, I'd certainly take my
money elsewhere.  You'd better believe that the bank's CEO would transfer the
operations VP to the mailroom in short order, too.

3.  Stein's rhetoric (``... rogue computer ... terrorizing ...'') is overblown
headline-grabbing, but the problem is real, and both bringing in an outside
auditor and installing safeguards sound like good, albeit sadly overdue, ideas.

American Management Systems of Arlington, VA was hired in 1984 to design the
new system.  A document written by the bureau's computer managers in 1985
outlined ``critical structural deficiencies'' and warned of ``profound and
far-reaching implications.''

4.  The contractor was not competent to do the job.  They have delivered trash
in return for their $11 million so far.  (That is for developing the software
*and* running the system for the PVB.)  Would a grep of the RISKS archives find
other stories about lousy work by American Management Systems?  That name rings
a bell.                   [No bell prizes that I could find since Vol 7.  PGN]

5.  If PVB management permitted the contractor to implement the design after
their own computer folks pointed out serious deficiencies, it's hard to avoid a
choice between the hypotheses of stupidity and bribery.  If, on the other hand,
the contractor was required to correct the errors in the design, then the same
choice of hypotheses applies to those responsible for monitoring contract
compliance.

6.  Once the system had been implemented, it is possible that management
decided to install the system, not due to either stupidity or corruption, but
rather on the basis that 42,000 errors/year is better than 85,000.

Note that #6 does not contradict #5: the ``lesser evil'' hypothesis may apply
to the decision to install the new piece of @#$%, but it cannot excuse a
decision to permit the contractor to implement a known bad design in the first
place.

7.  Speaking now as a former New Yorker, the PVB has been one of the more
obvious centers of corruption in that corrupt city gov't for decades.  This is
not `whisper behind the hand' stuff: during the Koch administration, a county
leader of the Democratic Party committed suicide when his part in PVB
corruption came to light in an investigation that was making headlines even
without the suicide.  If #5 turns out to be a matter of corruption, rather than
mere stupidity, few New Yorkers will be surprised.

On the other hand, stupidity about computing is *also* a tradition in the NYC
gov't: the NYC Human Resources Administration used to pay tens of thousands of
employees with a payroll system written in OS/360 Fortran, using type REAL*8
for money, and wonder why the pennies never seemed to balance.  :-( (No, they
were not smart enough to avoid fractional parts by storing amounts in pennies
rather than dollars.)

&gt;From the Sydney [Australia] Morning Herald, August 20th, 1990

"Sorry, you can't afford it"

CANBERRA: Debt collectors believe that in the not too distant future there will
be "total knowledge" about all individuals and envisage the Government allowing
financiers to build enormous data banks which would include confidential tax
file number information.  In fact, they believe banks and other lenders will
have so much information that debt collectors will be made redundant.

The Orwellian vision is contained in an article "Back to the Future for
Commercial Agents", published in the Institute of Mercantile Agents' journal,
The Mercantile Agent.  Its author, Mr Norman Owens, a former president of the
institute and owner of a debt-collecting agency, told the Herald that
governments would one day see it as "desirable" to link together and make
public all the enormous data bases containing highly sensitive personal
information.

"Tomorrow's credit grantor will be extending credit in a perfect market with
total knowledge of the debtor," Mr Owens asserted.  "The credit grantor in the
future will have access to all the debtor information. This will be made
available through linked data bases in the manner of George Orwell's 1984. "

Credit cards will be of the "smart card" variety which will be 
"genetically engineered implants" that capture all transactions from 
cradle to grave. (In fact, Westpac [a major Australian bank] is 
working on a smart card which has a small computer chip that records 
all transactions and makes credit cards more secure.)

Credit files, like those held by the Credit Reference Association, 
will be linked to the Government's tax file number data base.
"Some time in the future," he told the Herald, "mercantile agents 
won't exist. This is because there would be total knowledge about 
every individual including assets, income, credit history, and any 
future liabilities. The debt collector exists to catch those debtors 
that escape the creditor's receivable system. For most part the holes 
in that system will disappear in a business society armed with 
perfect knowledge about all transactions," he said.

Mr Owens conceded that this may sound like science fiction, but insisted that
it was "science possible".  He acknowledged that the community was horrified by
such Orwellian plans and said the Government was adamantly opposed to it, but
he was confident that one day people and governments would realise that such
measures were of benefit to society.

[The thing I personally found most frightening about Norman Owens' comments -
aside from the total lack of concern about possible risks - was his choice of
words. Words like "perfect market", "total knowlege", "genetically engineered
implants", and - of course - "benefit to society". I also must add that the
basis for his Orwellian vision is the inclusion of tax file number information
currently retained by the federal government. Under current laws, this
information is confidential, so his proposed scheme would be illegal. -- PH]

Monitoring "house arrest" detainees is equivalent to a common issue in computer
security.  It is known as user authentication -- determinating that a
particular person is at a particular location at a particular time.

Reading the research literature on the subject of user authentication shows
that the current solutions depend on co-operation of a typical user.  For
example, he won't reveal passwords to others, and won't comprise physical
security in case he uses auxiliary devices such as smart cards or credit cards.
And maybe more important, he stands to lose something if someone else can
successfully masquerade as him.

In the case of detainees, none of these assumptions holds.  Plus the easy and
wide availability of such devices as master remote control unit, which can
learn signals generated by other devices of a similar type, it seems that no
cheap (and thus practical) solution is in sight, unless one can assume that no
one would attempt to grasp the potential forgery market.

(From July 1990 Privacy Journal, Vol. XVI, No 9, Page 1)

			     TRUE COLORS

Thailand -- a constitutional monarchy with a parliament largely dominated by
the military -- has taken the Orwellian step that most Western democracies have
been afraid to take.  The Thai government this month inaugurated a centralized
database system to track and to cross-reference vital information on each of
its 55 million citizens.

The system includes a Population Identification Number (PIN) with a required
computer-readable ID card with photo, thumbprint, and imbedded personal data.
The system will store date of birth, ancestral history, and family make-up and
was designed to track voting patterns, domestic and foreign travel, and social
welfare.  Eventually 12,000 users, including law enforcement, will have access
by network terminals.  It is the largest governmental relational database
system in the world.  In the private sector, only the Church of Jesus Christ of
Later-Day Saints, the Mormon Church, has a larger one.  "The people feel that
the system will protect them," says the director of the Central Population
Database Center in Bangkok.

*What is more curious than the ambitious system itself is the fact that the
federally-sponsored Smithsonian Institute chose -- on behalf of all Americans
-- to honor the Thais for their efforts*.  The second annual Computerworld
Smithsonian Award for innovative information technology in the governmental
sector went last month to the Thailand Ministry of Interior for its oppressive
system for keeping tabs on its citizens.  Something to ponder: Two of the three
judges making the award have major computer responsibility in the U.S.
government.

Amidst all our stories of systems that have screwed up, it's worth noting one
that did work as planned.  The New York Federal Reserve bank's Fedwire EFT
system was in the area blacked out by the New York power outage.  Its backup
diesel generators kept things running for several days.  When one showed signs
of faltering, they moved operations to a backup site outside of the city.  That
backup site had been established 3 years ago for exactly such contingencies.

With regard to the unreliability of statistics, the only solution is to make
Darrell Huff`s book "How to lie with statistics" a compulsory text at all
schools. It is, I believe, the source of the quote "97.43% of all statistics

Despite the danger of severe shock to RISKS readers who see this, I thought
that someone should give due credit to the designers of a particular ABT which
is run by the National Westminster Bank, and an example of which is installed
at City University.

Last week I drew some money on my way to lunch. As usual, I requested a
receipt.  When my service card popped out, I put it back in my wallet, but
(being a bit more preoccupied than usual) walked away without collecting the
money or the receipt. I realised my mistake one minute later when I reached
into my pocket to pay for a beer, and sprinted back to the machine, only to
find the receipt dangling out of the slot, but no cash. I had no option but to
draw some more money and make the best of it.

I was puzzled that there had been nobody around at the time who would have been
likely to have seen my mistake, and made off with the cash, so I rang the bank.
They explained that this type of till, in which the money comes out through
rollers, gobbles the money back if it is not pulled out of the rollers within
ten seconds. Sure enough, when they 'agreed' the till the next day, they found
it in credit by the amount I had forgotten, and a record of a 'customer
time-out'. So they promptly credited my account with that amount.

Now, *that's* what I call user-friendly! :-)

	PORTLAND, Ore. (UPI) -- Hundreds of automated bank teller machines on
The Exchange network in Oregon and Washington went on the fritz this week, a
problem officials traced to a computer software glitch.
	The network includes most major financial institutions in Oregon,
except for First Interstate Bank.
	Tom Bass, president of The Exchange, based in Bellevue, Wash., said the
problem was ``a certain segment of the computer overloaded, and it had to be
rebalanced.''
	One Portland woman said she put her card in a machine to withdraw some
money and got a slip back showing the withdrawal but no cash.
	In other cases, customers using about 400 machines put in their cards,
watched the machine process their transactions and got their card back, but no
receipt. Others got no money, only a receipt showing that their request to
withdraw cash had been denied.
	Bass said Tuesday the problems had been corrected but that officials
were watching closely to prevent any repeat. He said the system can detect
errors and correct them automatically but advised anyone who has difficulties
with the machines to contact their bank's customer service department.

As I know from personal experience, recommending an article on formal
verification to the RISKS readership is itself a risky act.  Nevertheless let
me, with some trepidation, recommend (without necessarily agreeing totally
with) the paper "Formal Verification of Safety-Critical Systems", by Moser and
Melliar-Smith, that has just appeared in the August 1990 issue of Software
Practice and Experience.

The paper's abstract is as follows:

 "We describe our practical experience in the use of formal verification to
 obtain increased confidence in the design of safety-critical systems. The
 experiment involved demonstrating the consistency of the design specifications
 of SIFT, a software-implemented fault-tolerant operating system for aircraft
 flight control. Specifications were written at successive levels of
 abstraction from the most abstract requirements definition down to the
 detailed level of program code.  Consistency of the successive levels of
 specification is demonstrated using the enhanced HDM verification system.
 Formal verification is currently feasible only for carefully simplified
 systems, but there appears to be no alternative method that can meet the
 extreme safety requirements for safety-critical systems."

Apart from the description of the SIFT experiment, I regard the article as
notable for its discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of software
testing, software fault tolerance, safety kernels, fault tree analysis, and (in
much more detail) formal verification.

Quoting from the paper's section entitled "Can Verification Ensure Safety?":

 "Formal verification is an elusive approach to achieving safety in computer
 systems. It is clear that whatever is demonstrated by formal verification is
 demonstrated with almost absolute certainty. But what is it that is
 demonstrated by formal verification and is it what is needed for safe
 operation?

 Strictly speaking, formal verification only demonstrates a mathematical
 relationship between a mathematical representation of the requirements or
 specification of the system and a mathematical representation of the design or
 program code. Before we can assert that the verification has any significance,
 we must be confident that

 1. The top-level specifications or requirements are correct and
    sufficient to ensure the properties we need - a major problem.

 2. The mathematical representation of the specifications means what we
    think it means and the verification system does not permit invalid
    proofs - usually not a problem.

 3. The mathematical representation of the program code is identical to
    the actual code - often it is not.

 4. The formal semantics of the programming language and the
    verification conditions constructed for the program accurately
    reflect our intent for the language - a problem only for difficult
    constructs such as concurrency.

 5. The implementation of the design or program code, including
    compilation and instruction execution by the underlying computer, 
    is correct - another significant problem.

 6. The fault models are realistic models of the risks of faults in the
    system."

Some of the authors' overall conclusions will, no doubt, arouse
controversy, but nevertheless are I think worth quoting from here:

 "Within the current technology, formal verification is a possible
 approach for small sets of safety properties in clean simple
 carefully-designed systems, where the cost of failure is high enough
 to justify the cost of verification. Examples of such systems include
 nuclear reactor safety shutdown systems, simple security systems such
 as red/black encryption schemes, and simple operating system kernels.
 To be verifiable such systems must be highly restricted in their
 levels of complexity, and desired features may have to be sacrificed.
 ....

 It is clear that it is still infeasible to verify typical real
 systems of sizes in the tens and hundreds of thousands of lines of
 code.  Examples of systems that are still infeasible are nuclear
 control systems, aircraft flight control systems, and multi-user
 secure operating systems.

 For systems that must be very safe, there appears to be no alternative
 to verification. Testing, fault tolerance, and fault tree analysis can
 make important contributions to safety, but they alone are unlikely to
 achieve the high levels of safety that are necessary for safety-
 critical applications. Without improved verification systems these
 applications should not be certified at the level of 10**-10
 safety-critical failures per hour.

 Formal verification is, therefore a critical enabling technology for
 many important applications, both civil and military. It is far from
 clear that imminent advances in verification technology will suffice
 to render feasible the verification of these systems. A realistic
 time-scale for the improvement in verification technology required to
 verify real systems cannot be less that twenty years, even assuming
 sufficient interest and funds.

 Unfortunately, interest in and support for research in formal
 verification has been limited and, consequently, progress has been
 slow. Potential users have been reluctant to accept verification for
 fear that they may be forced into premature use of a technology that is
 currently difficult and costly to apply. This reluctance is bolstered
 by wishful thinking about techniques, such as software fault
 tolerance, that are easier to apply but that are unlikely to achieve
 the high levels of safety required."

Let me end by stating explicitly that my aim in making these selective
quotations is to encourage RISKS readers to study the full paper and
debate its conclusions (preferably in that order!); as I mentioned at the
outset, it is not to imply my total agreement even with those parts of
the paper I have chosen to quote.

The 8/17 issue of The Nation has an article by Herbert Kohl that describes the
effect upon the industry of an article by Paul Brodeur on the hazards of VDT
radiation that appeared in MacWorld.  Brodeur's MacWorld article reviews the
evidence on VDT radiation (a summary of what is in his book, "Currents of
Death: Power Lines, Computer Terminals, and the Attempt to Cover Up Their
Threat to Your Health"), then gives the results of testing ten monitors
commonly used with the Macintosh.  From Kohl's article:

  "At twelve inches electromagnetic radiation ranged from a low of 1.11 milli-
  gauss (but was generally higher than 2) at the front of the screen to a high
  of 15.86 milligauss at the side of a color, high resolution monitor. (The sides
  and backs of monitors emit the highest levels of radiation.)  They found that
  only at a distance of twenty-eight inches -- 'arm's length' -- was it 'sensible'
  to sit at the front of the screen.  Four feet was their recommended distance
  from the sides and back."

Brodeur contends that epidemiological studies strongly suggest that levels of
low-frequency electromagnetic radiation from power lines, water-bed heaters,
electric blankets, and VDTs may increase risk of leukemia, brain cancer, and
reproductive disorders.

In response to the MacWorld article, Apple announced that it will support the
development of industry-wide safety standards for electromagnetic emissions,
but argued that there is yet no scientific proof of how electromagnetic
radiation affects the body.

The Chicago Tribune, sometime around 30 July 1990, reported the following:

The computer terminals at newspapers are equipped with all sorts of dangerous
buttons that should be purged from the keyboard.  One is the "spell" key, which
transforms poor spellers into non-spellers.  Another is the "search-and-replace"
key, which at a single touch can, for example, change "FBI" to "Federal Bureau
of Investigation," or vice versa.  The Fresno Bee in California has this
technology, and because of it had to run the following correction the other
day: "An item in Thursday's Nation Digest about the Massachusetts budget crisis
made reference to new taxes that will help put Massachusetts `back in the
African-American.'  This item should have said `back in the black.'"

Protecting Your Credit and Your Privacy

By Simson L. Garfinkel

1. The first step to protecting your credit record is to get a copy of
it.  If there is invalid information on the report, have it corrected.

   If you have been denied credit within the last 30 days, the credit reporting
agency is obligated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to provide you
with a copy of your credit report for free.  Otherwise, you will be required to
pay $15 for the report.  (If you live in Maryland, the cost for the report is
$5; in California, $8; and in Connecticut, $10.)
   When requesting your report, be sure to include your name, address, previous
addresses for the past five years, your social security number, your signature,
and a telephone number where you can be reached during the day.
   In addition to your credit history, the report will include the names of
every business that has requested your report within the past two years.  If
you do not recognize any of the companies, someone may have obtained credit in
your name.
   Since each credit bureau maintains its own files, some may have errors that
others do not.  You should be sure to check with more than one bureau.  The
``big three'' are:
	TRW
	P.O. Box 5450
	Orange, CA 92667
	714-991-5100

	Equifax
	5505 Peachtree Dunwoody, Suite 600
	Atlanta, GA 30358
	404-252-1134

	Trans Union Corporation Consumer Relations Dept.
	P.O. Box 119001
	Chicago, IL 60611
	312-645-6008

There are also many local credit bureaus.  Bankcard holders of America, a
non-profit consumer education group, publishes a ``credit-check kit'' that
includes the name, address and phone numbers of legitimate credit bureaus
across the country, as well as a pamphlet that explains in details your rights
under the FCRA.  The kit costs two dollars and is available from:

	Bankcard Holders of America
	560 Herndon Parkway Suite 120
	Herndon, VA 22070

   If you disagree with anything on your report, contact the credit bureau.
The FCRA requires the bureau to reinvestigate the facts in the dispute; if you
do not agree with their conclusion, you have the right to include a statement
in the report with your version of the story.

   2. Obtain a statement of your earnings from the Social Security
Administration every two years.  This will tell you if someone else is earning
wages under your social security number, which can lead to many difficulties at
retirement.  If you suspect an error, you have three years, three months and 15
days after the mistake is made to challenge it.

   To get your statement, you need to fill out a Request For Earnings and
Benefit Estimate Statement card, which can be ordered by telephone from the
Social Security Administration's toll free number, 800-234-5772.

   3. You can ``opt-out'' of direct marketing and telemarketing by having your
name added to the databases maintained by the Direct Marketing Association.
Write to:

	Telephone Preference Service
	Mail Preference Service
	Direct Marketing Association
	6 East 43rd Street
	New York, NY 10017
	212-689-4977 ext. 369

   The major credit bureaus also use their credit databases for direct
marketing, and many magazines also sell their subscription lists for
advertising purposes.  You can write to each company that has your name and
address and ask that your names not be released for marketing purposes.
   4.  You can get a copy of your medical information file by writing to:
	Medical Information Bureau
	P.O. Box 105
	Essex Station Boston, MA 02112
	617-426-3660

   The MIB will tell you if they have a file on you, but in some cases they
will send its contents only to your physician or dentist.  Therefore, be sure
to include that person's name and address.
   5.  Do not permit merchants to record your credit or charge card account
number on personal checks; these numbers are often transcribed and used for
fraudulent purposes.

&gt; Not true.  Although the LZW compression algorithm is transparent to users of
&gt; compress, as it should be, files compressed using it couldn't be uncompressed
&gt; by a replacement program.

  Hmmm, I wonder if Unisys holds a patent on uncompressing LZW files.  I'm not
a patent lawyer, but it's the method of LZW compression that is patented.  It
seems (IMHO) that one couldn't patent the parsing of a published file format.

E-mail lawsuit cranks open privacy rights can of worms, By Jim Nash

_Privacy vs Property_ might be a better case name for the
invasion-of-privacy suit filed last week against Epson America, Inc.

The suit, born out of a personal dispute last January at Epson's Torrence,
Calif., headquarters, pits those who hold electronic mail to be as inviolate
as U.S. mail against those who consider E-mail company property.

Attorney Noel Shipman filed the class-action suit in Los Angeles Superior
Court on behalf of ALana Shoars, Dick Flanagan, Lee Cheaney, Glen Mosby --
all former Epson employees -- and hundreds of other Epson employees who have
used the company's E-mail since Auguest 1989.  Shipman claimed that it was
about that time that Robert Hillseth, manager of Epson's Hewlett-Packard Co.
computer system, illegally tapped messages between the HP system and its
external MCI Communications Corp. E-mail service.

Shipman seeks damages of $3,000 per person for each alleged violation of a
California statute barring the interception of an electronic communication
without consent of all parties in the communication.
--- end excerpt ---

That's about all of real interest; the rest consists mostly of quotes from
both sides ("we deny it," "they did it," etc.).

No risks, per se, but more the result of issues previously discussed in
risks (namely, "network security," of various sorts).

Let me take a "hack" at a design for a house arrest unit.

0&gt; The unit is physically attached to the detainee, looking something
   like a bracelet.  This is in common with one of the products "out
   there", although not to the voice recognition unit that was the
   original subject of the thread.

1&gt; The unit has, stored on a volatile memory chip, a supply of bit
   strings long enough to last the sentence.  These strings need not
   be particularly long -- a single bit for each "string" might well
   suffice -- but they are set at the dispensing organization, not
   determined by any algorithm.

   The device is built in such a manner that it can't be opened
   without destroying it, at least within the resources the detainee
   is likely to bring to bear.

2&gt; At random but appropriate intervals, perhaps Poisson with
   lambda=ten minutes, a polling station, physically inaccessable to
   the detainee, broadcasts a poll signal; the bracelet broadcasts
   it's next bit string as stored per 1&gt;.

3&gt; The reply is received by several stations, and time delays are
   measured to put the detainee at the intersection of the surfaces of
   several ellipsoids with the polling station and each receiving
   station as foci, and several hyperbolae, with each pair of
   receiving stations as foci.

   There can be perhaps a half dozen polling stations and a half dozen
   receiving stations.  Any attempt by the detainee to build his own
   repeater to simulate being where he is supposed to be is doomed to
   failure, because if the repeater's transmitter is at any place
   other than the detainee's house the intersection of the hyperbolae
   will turn out wrong, and if the repeater's receiver is in the wrong
   place the speed-of-light delay between the halves of the repeater
   will swell those ellipsoids whose major axes do not run along the
   path from the halves of the repeater.

4&gt; There is a box at the detainee's house that listens for polls and
   the detainee's bracelet's response and beeps a horn if there is a
   failure [no response, as opposed to the wrong response].  Detainee
   is responsible for notifying his probation officer in case of a
   failure -- "Come and inspect me and bring me a new bracelet."

Can someone poke a hole in this?  Seems cheap enough; 2K bytes of static RAM is
a about a month's supply at one bit per poll, the detainee can't leave any
device at his house to respond to polls for him because he can't open his
bracelet safely, it shouldn't be all THAT expensive [and a per-bracelet cost of
a few hundred or a thousand dollars does not sink the application], and yet it
looks like spoofing the system involves defeating well-known physics [assuming
you accept my stipulation that the detainee can't read out his RAM].
                                                                        -dk

On page 63 of the August 1990 _World_Press_Review_:

"Unreliable Computers", by Nick Nuttall, "The Times," London

Two Australian scientists are calling for a world-wide ban on the use of
computers in sensitive areas, such as hospital intensive-care wards, the
nuclear-power industry, air-traffic control stations, and early-warning defense
systems.

Computers are inherently flawed and too unreliable for critical tasks, say Tom
Forester of Griffith University and Perry Morrison of the University of New
England, both in New South Wales.  In the British academic journal _Futures_,
they write that computer systems cannot be designed without the threat of
life-endangering malfunctions, because their very complexity makes thorough
testing for errors and bugs impossible.  Forester and Morrison have documented
instances of death, destruction, financial loss, and mayhem caused by
computers.  These include patients being given fatal drug doses by
malfunctioning computers; 22 fatal crashes of the Black Hawk helicopter --
which flies by computer -- used by the U. S. Air Force; and 104 failures in a
single day of the Los Angeles air-traffic-control computer in July, 1989.

I'd appreciate it if someone would dig up this issue of _Futures_ and post or
summarize this paper.

Oddly, <A HREF="/Risks/10.23.html">RISKS-10.23</A> contained a note on the Ethics book by Forester and Morrison,
pointing back to the Contents and Preface in <A HREF="/Risks/9.15.html">RISKS-9.15</A>.

As they acknowledge in their preface (<A HREF="/Risks/9.15.html">RISKS-9.15</A>), they drew heavily on RISKS,
but they did not check all their sources.  They do have a disclaimer in the
book that not all of their information is guaranteed.  The 22 FATAL Blackhawk
crashes sounds BOGUS to me, and certainly not from RISKS.  PGN

Here in New Zealand the government is reviewing the "intellectual property"
laws, and several open meetings are being held to discuss the issues.  I went
to a recent such meeting about copyright, interested mainly in the user
interface question already widely discussed on Usenet and elsewhere.

At the meeting, however, what concerned me more was the subject of "reverse
engineering". Lawyers there agreed and insisted that object code be subject to
copyright, and that making any "disassembled" or "uncompiled" version of the
object code was making a derivative copy - and not allowed as "fair use". They
argued that the only people who would wish to do this would be people wanting
to get around copyright protection in creating competing programs.

I discussed this question with several of the lawyers afterward, and they
explained that if you obtained a copyright protected object program, then
object code was all you legally had.  One lawyer suggested that would mean you
could print out "ones and zeros", but nothing derived from them - they shrugged
when I pointed out that "ones and zeros" notation was not inherent in object
code, and so would also be a derivation. I asked how people could determine how
a program might behave unless they could look at it.  The lawyer suggested that
it was their view that the *behaviour* of the program was sufficient for people
to see how it would work.

Now there are some interesting points here. 
1) If object code is copyrightable, what *exactly* is it that is subject
   to the copyright? Magnetic patterns? Ones and Zeros? Source code?
2) Of course, program behaviour in the past is *not* sufficient to
    determine how a program will behave in the future.

Most importantly, these people seem to be arguing that if you have (legally) an
object-code program protected by copyright, and even though you *do* have the
"fair use" right to execute the program, you may *not* have the right to
inspect the program itself by disassembling or reverse compilation, to
determine how it may work in future circumstances.  This seems to me a great
Risk.

Two final points: 

  Firstly, of course programs may be protected by other legal mechanisms which
are not addressed here. But copyright is usually the minimum.

  Secondly, in the meetings addressing the issues here, there was little
attention paid to the rights and viewpoints of the *users* of computer programs
- most discussion centred on the rights of developers.  This too seems a Risk.

I recently received a Discover credit card and found that it boasts a
24-hour toll-free hot-line.  A colleague informed me that one can call this
hotline to retrieve account information from an automated system.  She noted
that it didn't request any identity verification, just the account number.

I called the number, and when prompted with the voice menu, selected the
option that would allow me to get my account balance.  I was connected with
a person, not a computer.  This operator requested such account verification
information as my address and SSN.  I figured either my colleague must have
been mistaken or the Discover folks had changed their policy.

After requesting some information from the representative, I asked him
whether one could obtain the same data on-line without talking to a person.
He assured me that all I needed was a touch-tone phone and my account number.
I asked him whether I had to verify my identify in any way -- there is no
PIN associated with this card, to my knowledge -- and was told, "No."

I was a little puzzled, since I'd called from a touch tone phone, so I called
back.  I turns out I had made a mistake when I called the first time -- I
forgot to end my request with a '#' -- and the computer assumed I was on a
rotary phone and connected me to an operator.  This time I pressed the '#',
and the system prompted me to enter my account number.  I did, and was
immediately informed of my balance, available credit, previous statement
balance, and current statement due date.  My colleague was right: I didn't
have to verify my identity in any way.

I find this odd, and more than a little irritating.  First, most
bank-by-phone systems I have used require a PIN before divulging personal
account data.  Second, the human representative required my name, address,
account number, and SSN before he would allow me to solicit information,
implying that Discover has a policy of verifying an account holder's
identity, but did not apply that policy to their automated system.

I don't particularly like the idea of someone being able to get that
information on me merely by calling a freely advertised number and punching
in my account number.  Any clerk at a store where I use my card can make the
call.  Anyone who finds or steals my card can, as well; Discover even makes
it easy by printing the number on the back of the card.

A letter complaint is in the mail...

&gt; CANBERRA: Debt collectors believe that in the not too distant
&gt; future there will be "total knowledge" about all individuals . . .

No need to look down under or into the future for this sort of thing.  Readers
of misc.legal may recall a recent submission reciting a bill already passed by
the Oklahoma state legislature, to take effect next January, requiring every
individual to list every possession (yes, even books) and its value for tax
purposes -- and requiring a physical inspection of every persons' property at
least once every four years to verify the accuracy of the list.

In comp.risks ph@wyvern.cs.uow.edu.au quotes a newspaper article:
&gt;they believe banks and other lenders will have so much information that debt
&gt;collectors will be made redundant.
...
&gt;"Tomorrow's credit grantor will be extending credit in a perfect market with
&gt;total knowledge of the debtor," Mr Owens asserted.

I can't believe how stupid people are sometimes when talking about the
allegedly glorious future.  Does he think that tomorrow's creditor's knowledge
will include seeing into the future to see the debtor's circumstances at the
time at which payment is required?

Sigh, it seems that only a minority of people realize that the application of
technology does not automatically solve any problem.

I just received a copy of the book "Rogue Programs: Viruses, Worms, and Trojan
Horses," edited by Lance J. Hoffman.  The book is published by Van Nostrand
Reinhold, copyright 1990, ISBN 0-442-00454-0.  The publisher's suggested list
price is $32.95, in softcover.

This book is a collection of 27 articles and book excerpts about "vandalware"
on computer systems.  Contributors include Len Adleman, Anne Branscomb, David
Chess, Fred Cohen, George Davida, David Ferbrache, Michael Gemignani, Harold
Joseph Highland, me (!), Ken Thompson, Steve White, and many others.  The table
of contents lists the following parts: Overview of Rogue Programs, Social and
Legal Issues and Effects, Rogue Programs and Personal Computers, Rogue Programs
and Networks, and Emerging Theory of Computer Viruses.

Perhaps I'm somewhat biased because I'm the author or co-author of 3 of the 27
contributions.  However, I believe this is the most comprehensive collection on
the topic currently available.  It contains case studies, theoretical analyses,
legal opinions, and step-by-step technical information.  The book is valuable
as both a technical reference and as a textbook around which a course can be
organized.  I'm sure it is going to become one of the 2 or 3 standard
references in the field (the forthcoming book from ACM Press edited by Peter
Denning will probably be the other biggie).

If you are interested in some of the issues involving viruses, worms and
vandalware, you really should get a copy of this book and check it out.

Condensed from a story in the 23 Aug 90 'Los Angeles Times' by Ronald J.
Ostrow:

The General Accounting Office says that a lack of adequate computer
security in the Justice Department's new "state-of-the-art" data center in
Rockville, MD will permit unauthorized remote users to enter and exit the
system undetected, endangering highly sensitive information such as
identities of undercover operators and confidential informants.

The GAO report says that the data center is accessible over phone lines and
commercial computer networks, making it vulnerable to remote users who
could "introduce viruses and other disruptive software ... into vulnerable
computer systems."  Investigators found that contingency plans to be
implemented when computer services are disrupted had either not been
prepared or not tested and that no mandatory computer security training was
being given all employees.  They said, "Systems programmers with extensive
knowledge of hardware and operating procedures had unescorted access to the
data center and were capable of issuing critical computer commands that
should have been limited to computer operators."  Guards were not stationed
and surveillance devices such as cameras or motion sensors are also lacking
in some places.

The GAO blames the security weaknesses on "a lack of effective leadership
and oversight by the justice management division."

A Justice Dept. public relations official said, "... we have requested
additional resources from Congress for [computer security audit] and have
not received them."  A dept. official also said "a lot of corrective action
[has already been] taken and more ... is under way."

(I am sending this to both RISKS and TELECOM.  I think it is germane to one
or the other, perhaps even both, but I'll leave that decision up to the
respective editors.)

     I have been using a "pay-by-phone" service to pay bills out of my
savings account for longer than I can remember; I think at least ten years. 
The service has been simple and straightforward: after entering your account
number and PIN in response to some minimal prompting (I don't remember now
whether it echoed the account number; it did not echo the PIN) you repeated
a simple cycle -- (a) "enter payment code" (b) enter code, terminated by #
(c) "payment code &lt;number echoed&gt;; enter payment amount" (c) enter amount,
using * for decimal point, terminated by #. (d) "payment amount &lt;number
echoed&gt;".  The four square inches or so of instructions you received in the
mail tell you what to do if you make an error (enter * instead of the next
entry requested) and what to enter (payment code 02) to finish.  After
finishing, it tells you the total of payments and remaining balance.

     Anyhow, in the last few weeks the bank has decided to modernize and
improve matters by installing a completely new system.  This new system is
so "user friendly" I will probably cancel my account.  Instead of the
simple, minimal dialogue used previously, the new system makes the whole
process an agony.  Since it is now part of a "larger" service you have to
walk through several levels of verbal menus to get to the point where you
have entered your account number and PIN number; I guess I can live with
that.  The problem lies with making the individual payment entries
thereafter.  The dialogue has now increased at least three-fold.  It now
goes as follows:  (a) "enter payment code, terminated with a pound sign.
enter code 02 to indicate last entry" (b) you enter code (c) "you have
entered &lt;code repeated&gt;. Confirm with a pound sign, or reject with an
asterisk" (d) at this point you have to enter another # to continue (e)
"enter payment amount.  Use the asterisk key for a decimal point and
terminate the entry with the pound sign." (f) you enter the amount (g) "you
have entered &lt;amount repeated&gt; confirm with pound sign, or reject with an
asterisk" (h) enter pound sign to continue. The process then repeats, in
all the gory detail each time.  (I didn't tape the dialogue the last time I
used it and the service was unavailable while I was writing this, so the
system's responses aren't verbatim, but pretty close.)

     I wrote the system's manager a slightly incensed letter.  In short, I
charged that whoever he bought the system from obviously hadn't been in the
business of building interactive systems for very long and that he had been
sold a bill of goods.  I pointed out that every well-designed system has
some means of making life easier for the experienced user, either by
allowing to say he is experienced or by keeping enough records to decide
that he is experienced.  There is absolutely no need to repeat the
instructions every single time for every entry for every user, nor is there
a need to ask for a positive confirmation for people experienced enough to
know you can enter a rejection at a certain point.  I do have to say he
promptly wrote back an acknowledgement of my letter, thanked me for the
suggestion of having a mode for experienced users, and promised to consider
it for a future feature.  I'm not holding my breath.

     The RISKS?  That by not knowing how to use the technology wisely (and
it certainly isn't new technology) the bank is going to lose business
instead of gain it.  The only reason I use this particular bank instead of
another one is the pay-by-phone.  I suspect the bank will gain a few
casual users by making the system "more friendly", but I really wonder if
that will be offset by the frequent users who are so frustrated as to take
their accounts elsewhere -- and it is exactly those users who have more
money in the bank and cause more cash to flow through it.

I agree with the recommendation of Huff's book, but for different reasons.

As a former statistician, I get very tired of the constant misperception that
there is something inherently unreliable or evil about statistics and
statistical techniques.  Statistical analysis is a perfectly legitimate
mathematical discipline.  The techniques are well understood and they work.  By
definition, you can't lie with statistics without misusing those techniques.

By all means, read Huff's book to learn how and recognize when the
techniques are being abused.  But don't let that lead to rejecting all
statistics out of hand.

As one of my former stats profs used to say: "You can lie with statistics,
but not to a statistician."

This has been standard procedure for our (Citicorp) ATMs from the first --
about 15 years.  The only ATMs I can think of that don't do this are some of
the older Diebold machines that drop dispensed cash in a bin (a mind-
bogglingly bad design, IMHO).  The time-delay, BTW, is usually set by the bank.
Ten seconds is rather short, by our standards.

Many ATMs do similar things with cards left in card readers.

In RISKS DIGEST 10.22 Pete Mellor mentioned a useful timeout in a National
Westminster Bank cashpoint machine; these machines recover money that has
not been withdrawn within a short period.  I have seen a similar timeout
that involves the card rather than money.

I was standing in a queue at a Barclays Bank cashpoint machine behind two
women who were deep in conversation.  After a while the machine beeped
loudly and asked whether the customer wished more time to consider the
transaction.  A little later it beeped again and displayed a more strongly
worded message to the effect of `If you do not press a button within the
next thirty seconds your card will be confiscated'.  Thirty seconds later
a third message appeared `Your card has been retained, please inquire inside
the bank for further information'.  The perspex shutter then closed over the
display and keyboard; only this noise seemed able to distract the women
from their conversation who then went into the bank cursing machines.

I was pleased to see that if I forget to retrieve my card it is likely to
be retained by the bank rather than by a passerby.  I was also pleased to note
that if you want more time to consider your transaction then you can prolong
the timeout.  It was worth the inconvenience of waiting in the queue to see
the look on their faces after losing the card.

A final thought: nobody in the queue asked the women to hurry up.  Would
people in other countries wait patiently or is this a British characteristic?
I probably ought to have drawn their attention to the second message but I
was too interested to see the behaviour of the machine.

The detainee doesn't have to break open the device to read out the RAM.  All
he has to do is poll the thing himself and record its responses.  After feeding
this info into a handy tabletop "device", he can go about his business.  Is
a big enough hole?

In Risks Digest 10.24, King says that in the event of a unit failure, the
parolee calls his/her probation officer and says "come and inspect me and
bring me a new bracelet".  Herein lies a weakness of the proposed system.

Background:  About a year ago, a neighbor installed a burglar alarm system
in his house.  For a variety of reasons, it went off (alarmed) two or three
times a week.  The alarm included a rather loud bell outside his house.
The first few times this happened, some of us went to see if he needed
help, or see if there really was a burglar.  Soon we realized that these
were false alarms, and began to first ignore, then resent this intrusion.
Had there been a real burglary then, no one would have paid any attention.

Back to the subject at hand.  The parolee regularly calls his/her probation
officer and says "come and inspect me ...".  Also, the parolee should on
occasion be out of range when polled, but not so far out of range that
he/she can't get back in time for the parole officer to catch.  Soon the
parole officer begins to mistrust the system, then even ignore it.  Then
the parolee can begin to test the limits.

Just one hole, but a big one: this scheme assumes perfect reception - no

&lt;king@kestrel.edu&gt; proposes a house arrest unit, the design of which is
based upon the principles of radio location.  Some observations follow:

Were the radio transmissions only one-way, base-to-user, it could
probably be quite inexpensive -- certainly no more difficult than
personal paging services to implement.

The difficult part is that the bracelet replies.  Now, instead of a few
high-power transmitters to cover an urban area (say, within the
"beltway" of the typical city), a large network of receivers is needed.
These receivers must be connected centrally for coordination, "voting,"
and the ellipsoidal computations.  This quickly becomes expensive, and,
although it may be of lower cost than incarceration, political leaders
seem to feel that "We already have a jail; we'd have to buy this
system."

In addition, the urban environment provides many unintentional
reflectors for radio signals.  In voice communications, the receiver
simply selects the strongest component and ignores the others.  In a
position location application, the direct component must be selected.
Because of reflections and masking, the direct component may not even
reach the receiver.  

Also, the risk for computational and logical error seems large.  I don't
believe that this application is "off the shelf," so the software is an R&amp;D
project subject to the error discoveries about which we often read in this
Digest.

Risks 10.24 contains a proposal for an electronic house arrest unit which
is based on distance triangulations using timing over the phone lines.
This method has a hole in it the size of a barn door. The problem is that
one cannot rely on calls to go via a repeatable route between any two
locations or at any time. The phone company may route your call in any way it
chooses and at any time. It is almost impossible to distinguish phone
company re-routing from hacking re-routing.

king@kestrel.edu proposes an "uncrackable" design for a house arrest unit based
on physical propogation delays for position location and a stored key string
maintained in a bracelet.

Suggested improvement:

1&gt; Store a DES cipher key in the bracelet, and send an encrypted version
   of a random "probe" signal. This (a) avoids having to store a very
   long string of "random" bits inside the unit, and (b) reduces the
   risk that a "forged" bracelet could produce the correct response.
   (If the response is only 1 bit long, I have a 50% chance of guessing
   it right, don't i?) 

Cracking/hacking the scheme...

2&gt; The "people system" is probably the weakest point. Convince your
   parole officer that the propagation of the signal is poor, and that
   any alarm is probably a false alarm. Do this by: heating up /cooling
   down the unit, static discharge, RF flooding, putting electro-magnetic 
   shielding in parts of the house, etc. Keep calling him/her out at
   3:00am because the local CB radio is inerfering with your device. 
   Chances are this will create some flexibility in dealing with 
   system problems (how many maintenance engineers will be on call at
   3:00am?) Will they take you back into custody, replace the 
   bracelet, or wait until 9:00am the following morning - enough time
   for you to commit whatever heinous crime you had in mind?

3&gt; Use some active ECM against the *entire system*. (I'm assuming here 
   that the half dozen transmitting/receiving stations are city
   wide - on grounds of cost). Try and jam or confuse the entire 
   system for a period of time. What are "they" going to do? Check on
   *every* person under house arrest?

Whether either the cost/complexity of scheme or the cost/complexity of
overcoming it is justified is another question...

This technique is well developed within the military and is usually called
TDOA - time difference of arrival.  Systems exist that can listen to 10's
of thousands of pulses, sort them out, calculate ground location, and
report same -- and all within a very nominal size machine.

I'd like to resurface an observation that I've made from time to time in
various places in regard to protection of intellectual property.

A central issue that must be sorted out somewhere along the way is the
essential difference between information per se and the representation of
such information.  Example:  One's name is information; it can be
represented in ASCII, as a written signature, as a spoken phrase, in Morse
code, as magnetic domains, as electrical signals, as modulation on a
carrier, etc.

The legal community will have to appreciate the distinction, and establish
the principle within both the judicial and the legal systems.  Until it
does, we'll be creating laws that deal with bits and pieces of the problem
and generate increasing confusion.

There was an article by Pamela Samuelson in the Jan 1990 issue of IEEE Software
discussing Software copying, especially as it applies to reverse engineering.
While a letter from an IBM Corporate lawyer disputed the findings in the July
issue, MS Samuelson made a case for it not being a violation of the copyright.
It makes for interesting reading.

I would agree that a decompilation of a copyrighted program is a derived
work, but I would belive that deriving this for personal use is "fair
use" - subject to the same limitations as the original object code.

Every time this topic comes up, I am impressed with how well the notions
of copyright law seem to agree with the field. And every time computer
people discuss this with lawyers, I am disgusted with how impossible it
seems to find common ground with the lawyers when it comes down to
interpreting the copyright law.

&gt;Now there are some interesting points here. 
&gt;1) If object code is copyrightable, what *exactly* is it that is subject
&gt;   to the copyright? Magnetic patterns? Ones and Zeros? Source code?
&gt;2) Of course, program behaviour in the past is *not* sufficient to
&gt;    determine how a program will behave in the future.

I would surmise that it is the behaviour of the program that should be
copyrightable. However, for practical purposes, that behaviour needs to
be determined from an inspection of some representation of the
algorithms. This may require decompilation.

Hence, fair use should allow you to decompile the code, but compiling it
for another machine should be considered a "copy". Likewise, a
transcription of the source code with every comment deleted/replaced, and
every variable name changed (and possibly transliterated into a
different programming language) should be considered a "copy" even if no
tokens are the same.

On the other hand, I think that "look-and-feel" goes too far. The Lotus
suit and the MacIntosh suit get very close the the kind of issues that
belong in patent law, rather than copyrights.

If the lawyers understood the field better, would they be more likely to be
"reasonable" ? Is this an issue of poor "cross-cultural" communication, or of
crossed goals ? Of different perceptions of fairness ?

I'm not a lawyer, so don't take the following as legal advice, but....
Any lawyers out there will be certain to set me straight (or try!).

The purpose of copyright is to protect the commercial interest of the
copyright holder (author or publisher).  A copyright on an object code
version of a program is intended to prevent you from selling copies of
the program.  It certainly seems reasonable to say that reverse
engineering the object code preserves the copyright -- trying to sell
a copy of the program in any form would infringe the economic
advantage of the program author/publisher, whether that copy is the
object code itself, or a new version of the program derived from
reverse-engineered code.

They key here is what you do with copies.  If I buy a book and make
ten copies of it, the problem comes about if I sell those copies or
give them away to others, thus depriving the copyright holder of those
sales.  If I buy a computer program and make ten copies of the program
that I lock up in ten different places because I am worried about
loss, I have not deprived the copyright holder of additional sales as
those copies are not being used, and are therefore not depriving the
publisher of potential sales. (I would probably be violating the
standard license that comes with most software that limits the number
of backup copies that can be made, but that isn't copyright.)

Reverse-engineering the code to see what it does is a problem if I use
that reverse-engineered version to sell or give away copies of the
program, or use the material to write a new program incorporating part
of the old one, or to make copies that I will use internally on which
I do not pay copyright royalties.  Those infringe the rights of the
copyright holder.  Translating the copy into something I find easier
to read, for my own private use, does not infringe those rights.

I don't know about New Zealand (Robert Biddle's subject), but here
copyright law is "enforced" in civil courts.  The copyright holder
needs to sue for damages and show how the copyright was abused.
(There is a criminal violation of copyright, but that requires certain
proof of criminal intent, etc.)  If the plaintiff cannot show that any
loss or damage occurred as a result of the copying, and that all use
was for private purposes, I don't see that there could be a negative
judgment.  In all probability, the case would never even be allowed to
come to trial.  Also, it is unthinkable that any copyright holder
would go through the aggravation and expense of pursuing such a case
over private decompilation of object code.

If the law in New Zealand currently under consideration attempts to
broaden copyright to prevent private copies that do not deprive the
copyright holder of royalties, and if that is what the lawyers are
recommending, then I would indeed be concerned.

Mr. Max Frankel,
Executive Editor
The New York Times
229 West 43rd Street
New York, NY 10036

Dear Mr. Frankel:

Your article, "Washington is Relaxing Its Stand on Guarding Computer Security",
by John Markoff, August 19, reflects a serious misinterpretation of both the
intent and the probable effect of the new Presidential directive on computer
security.

The new directive replaces NSDD #145, which was issued by the Reagan
administration in 1984. With the authority of that older directive, and because
they were not willing to accept the utterly mundane, unexciting nature of the
data security problems in most agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA)
distorted the data security implementations of many federal civil agencies and
reduced the effectiveness of their computer security programs.

NSA's computer security efforts were oriented exclusively about the protection
of classified data from disclosure to those who did not have appropriate
security clearances. Their development program did not address the need for
data to be complete, accurate, timely and available. They were concerned only
with the confidentiality of data and wholly unconcerned about their usefulness
to their proper owners.

It has been an unfortunate NSA assumption that those with appropriate security
clearances can be trusted to the level of their clearances. This ignores the
damage which has been done in recent years by Messrs Walker, Pelton, Pollard,
Boyce, Smith, Miller, et al, all of whom were cleared for access to the data
which they delivered to those who appeared, until recently, to be the enemy.
There seems to be no basis for a belief that comparable damage has been done
through technically-oriented, foreign-directed penetrations of our systems
containing classified data.

Fortunately, the new directive relieves the civil agencies from a requirement
that they continue to accept misleading guidance in computer security from NSA.
Unfortunately, it was not issued not until significant damage had already been
done.

The Computer Security Act of 1987 gives the National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST) responsibility for providing technical guidance in
computer security to the civil agencies and DoD for the protection of their
unclassified data. It is regrettable that NIST is very poorly funded for work
in the computer security area and, at the current funding levels, cannot
provide any significant amount of the technical leadership in computer security
so badly needed by the civil agencies.

Only a small portion of funds previously available to NSA for computer security
would permit NIST to provide the needed guidance. Whether those funds are
provided or not, the new and wisely conceived directive will not result in
relaxation of the security afforded data by either DoD or the civil agencies.
The new directive rectifies a serious error of the previous administration and
makes it probable that data security in the civil agencies will improve - not
as much as it would if NIST had adequate funding and not as much as it should,
but it will be improved. The contrary impression conveyed by your reporter is
unfortunate.
                                     Sincerely, Robert H. Courtney, Jr.

&gt;From Channel 4 news last night (Tue. 28th Aug.):

It is reported that Iraq may be deploying some of the Royal Navy's latest
high-tech weaponry. Apparently this is causing US commanders to be reluctant
to send aircraft carriers into the northern area of the Gulf.

The villain of the piece is the smart mine 'Stonefish', developed by Marconi
Underwater Systems under contract to the Royal Navy. This little charmer is
so cute it listens to the engine noise of ships passing overhead, and can tell
what type of vessel is within range. It 'hides' from minesweepers, and
blows the backside off anything else.

At the heart of the system is (you've guessed it!) 'highly sophisticated and
classified' *software*.

The Channel 4 investigators have in their possession the 'Technical Description
and Specification' of Stonefish. The cover sheet and first few pages of this
document were actually shown on screen, and looked pretty authentic, with the
Marconi logo and classification 'UK restricted: commercial in confidence'
clearly visible.

C4's copy, however, comes not from Marconi's Watford HQ, but from a source not
a million miles removed from Cardoen International, a Chilean firm (no boring
restrictions on arms sales there!) described by an expert from Jane's as being
specialists in the 'laundering' of military technology for the benefit of third
world countries (at least, those with adequate oil revenues to pay for it).
Cardoen has well-established links with Iraq.

The implication is not that Stonefish has been sold bundled to Iraq, but enough
technical information is in dubious hands for the Iraqis to have a good go at
building a look-alike.

Carlos Cardoen, filmed at a news conference, said that he had a very close
relationship with Marconi, and some of their guys had visited him.

Marconi said 'We have no relationship with Cardoen.' and refused to be
interviewed.

An expert from an outfit called something like 'Naval Weapons Review' gave it
as his opinion that Iraq probably has 'a limited number of quite sophisticated
mines', but implied that we shouldn't worry too much, since 'the Navy would
not let a UK contractor simply hand over the software for a weapons system'.

So there you have it. Saddam Hussein is in the Stonefish plug-compatible
market, but our Navies are safe provided he can't get his hands on the
operating system.

All of which prompts me to wonder:-

 1. If the Iraqis have the software for a 'limited number' of mines, why
    haven't they got enough for an unlimited number? 
    (Perhaps the blockade is working, and they haven't got enough floppy disks 
    to make the copies. :-)

 2. How does Stonefish 'hide' from a minesweeper? The cylindrical object shown 
    in the newsreel shots doesn't look as though it is capable of crawling
    under a rock. Perhaps it just switches off its disk drive to stop the noise
    and pretends to be an oil-drum. :-)

 3. How reliably can Stonefish identify ships by their engine noise signature?
    What happens if your cruiser's big ends are rattling?

 4. Does Stonefish rely on some sort of sonar transponder
    to distinguish friend from foe? (Remember the Falklands helicopter!)

 5. What are the chances that Iraq already has the software? (After all, we all
    know Arabs can't write programs, and software is rather difficult to 
    smuggle through customs. :-)

 6. The sophistication of Stonefish's recognition system argues for some kind
    of artificial intelligence. If it's that smart, would it know who was
    winning and change sides accordingly? :-)

 7. Isn't it time that Jane's produced 'All the World's Software'?

RISKS readers will recognize this as an old risk but it made this
academic chuckle as we begin another semester.  The computer at the
campus bookstore prints out a tag for each required textbook
indicating the course number, instructor, number of copies ordered,
etc.  Given that textbooks are often used by more than one course, the
computer kindly prints out a cross-list of other courses using the
same text.  One card caught my eye with its unusually long list of
cross-listings.  Curious as to what textbook was so popular this term,
I looked closer to see the title.  Being an author I had hopes that
maybe it was mine :-)  Alas, the title of this very popular text was
NO TEXT REQUIRED.  I wonder who gets the royalties on that textbook? :-)

There have been several RISKS submissions recently discussing the legal
status of reverse-engineering of copyrighted material.  Reading them, however,
one could easily conclude that copyright law is the only governing issue
involved.  It isn't: in fact, most of the products I've seen (both mainframe
and personal computer) assert not only copyright but also contract rights.
For example, IBM's FY90 GSA schedule in Special Item 132-30, section 4(a)6
(page 44) includes the item:

  (6)  The Government shall not reverse assemble or reverse compile the
       licensed programs in whole or in part.

Almost all vendors have a corresponding clause in their software license
agreements, so the question of copyright law permitting reverse engineering
is usually moot.  Of course, we now have the issue of deciding which 
parts of the contract are legally enforcable.  (Cf. Vault v. Quaid, in 
which my memory says the court held that the shrink-wrap "license contract"
in PC software was unenforcable.)

Shakespeare was right: shoot all the lawyers.

It was somewhat disturbing to discover that all of the people who took time
to comment on the "electronic house arrest" units focussed on the technology,
and none apparently noticed that this is a safety-critical application.
I.e., failure of the system may lead to the re-incarcenation of a parolee.

I would feel more comfortable if our court/prison/parole system were funded in
such a way as to permit personal contact between the parolee and parole
officer.

  I believe it should be available, however the following should apply:

1) It should be blockable at no charge for any number.
2) Name or address (or the fact it is a pay phone) should be made available.
3) Actual calling number should be used not billing number.
4) Under no circumstances should a third number be used shown as the

According to Flight International (29 Aug-4 Sept, page 13), Northwest Airlines
is suing CAE Electronics over a fatal aircraft crash in 1987 which Northwest
claim was partly caused by inaccuracies in a CAE flight training simulator.

The crash occurred when the crew attempted to take off without deploying flaps
and slats; according to the NTSB report, the crew failed to carry out the
checklist, and an unexplained electrical failure caused the take-off warning
system to fail to warn them.

Northwest claim that the simulator shows a warning system failure if the power
fails to the warning system, whereas the aircraft system fails silently. They
also claim that the crew selected go-around on the flight director, from
take-off, and the result was an additional pitch-up command of 6 degrees,
whereas the simulator effectively inhibits go-around from take-off.

CAE says the claim is frivolous and without merit.

This claim seems to me to suggest (a) that once again, aircrew do not
understand the side-effects (pitch-up, in this case) of flight-director
commands (which I believe means that the systems are too complex). I also
believe that the claim demonstrates the importance of formal specifications for
critical systems such as simulators - on this evidence, a simulator used for
crew training in emergency procedures is *itself* a safety-critical system.
(Presumably it should therefore require certification in the same way as an
in-flight system of equivalent criticality. Does anyone know the certification
requirements for simulators?)

The Computer Misuse Act came into force on Wed. 29th August 1990.

It introduces three new offences:

 - 'Unauthorised access': a basic offence committed by anyone who seeks
   to enter a computer system knowing that the entry is unauthorised.
   Punishable by up to six months imprisonment.

 - 'Unauthorised access' in furtherance of a more serious crime.
   Punishable by up to five years imprisonment.

 - 'Unauthorised modification of computer material': Introducing viruses,
   Trojan horses, etc., or malicious damage to computer files.
   Punishable by up to five years imprisonment.

The act was the result of a private member's bill introduced by Michael Colvin
MP (Conservative), which was supported by the government.

Extract from the Guardian, 29.08.90, p.2 [PM's comments in brackets]:

Headline: New hacking law 'too hard to enforce'

By-line: Owen Boycott

  Peter Sommer [in true Grauniad style, they mis-spelt his name "Summer"],
  author of the Hacker's Handbook [under the nom-de-plume "Hugo Cornwall"],
  who opposed the need for new legislation, said yesterday he feared that doing
  away with the criminal damage law [??? !!! See *1 below] would make it more
  difficult to prosecute malevolent hackers.

  "They are creating more difficulties for this offence than before," he said.
  The new and untried legislation might be open to challenges on the definitions
  of the wording of the act.

  Scotland Yard's four-strong [!! *2] computer crime squad will be enlarged to
  cope with the extra work expected. But yesterday, one member said: "It will
  depend on people being aware a new crime exists, and reporting offences to
  us. Previously they were not certain what was a crime and what wasn't. [*3]"

  During the passage of the bill, the police argued for greater powers to tap
  computer lines and force telecommunications companies to pursue hackers.

  They were resisted by the bill's author, the Tory MP, Michael Colvin, who
  believes the act will prevent damage by computer hacking. [*4]

  He said: "Information technology is so much a part of a company's business,
  that a hacker in the computer system is as bad as someone sabotaging the
  production line.

  "It is vital companies become far more computer security conscious. Over the
  last five years the Department of Trade and Industry has recorded 270
  computer crime cases. Only five were brought to court.

  "Some have said the offence (in the act) does not go far enough, but it gives
  the police powers to enter and search premises...once they have gone to a
  judge for a warrant."

  Although the estimates of the annual cost of computer crime have ranged up to
  [Pounds sterling] 1 billion, most is fraud committed by employees using
  computers for crimes that would otherwise have involved paper forgeries.

  There are a few cases of hackers breaking in from systems outside companies
  and extracting large sums. But cases of hackers breaking into systems and
  damaging computer files are increasingly common.

  Fears that there will be a sudden round-up of young computer enthusiasts 
  who have been hacking are unlikely to materialise. Like almost all
  legislation [almost??], the Computer Misuse Act is not retrospective.

  The DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] has welcomed the act, and hopes
  it will encourage companies to take more care over systems' security. [*5]

End of extract

Notes:-

 *1 Criminal damage is an offence that has nothing to do with computing, and
    it has certainly not been 'done away with'. Since Peter Sommer is acutely
    aware of this, I suspect that the Grauniad has garbled his words. I can
    envisage a future prosecution involving both the offences created by the
    new act *and* the old offence of criminal damage (which was the charge
    under which Nicholas Whiteley was sent down for four months a short while
    ago: see <A HREF="/Risks/10.03.html">RISKS-10.03</A>, 10.09, 10.10). A police spokesman was quoted at the
    time as saying that the new act would not have made it any easier to
    convict Whitely. Peter Sommer has always argued that this existing offence
    is adequate for prosecuting a hacker who has caused actual damage.

 *2 Wow! Those guys are really taking this problem *seriously*!

 *3 [Censored, even though disemvoweled (as in *br*dg*d or s*n*t*z*d).  PGN]

 *4 Nice to meet an optimist! The plea for increased police power to intercept
    communications was supported by Emma Nicholson, MP, whose earlier bill
    failed for lack of parliamentary time - See <A HREF="/Risks/10.03.html">RISKS-10.03</A>. It is a fact of
    human psychology that people are *not* deterred by a stiff penalty from
    indulging in a profitable or enjoyable (but illegal) activity which has a
    low probability of being detected. See, for example, H.J. Eysenck: "Sense
    and Nonsense in Psychology". Eysenck cites the cases of sheep stealing in 
    18th century England, which persisted at a high rate though punishable by
    hanging, and of his own family's flight from Nazi Germany *with* the family
    jewels, when removing assets (but not fleeing in its own right) was
    punishable by death. If you want to stop hacking, make it certain that
    hackers will be caught. So why do I not support Nicholson? Because I'm a
    pinko liberal and prefer my communications untampered with even if it
    slightly increases the opportunity for undetected crime.

 5* Fat chance! If anything, it will make them more complacent. To his credit,
    Colvin does criticise system owners who are lax about security, and regards
    their slackness as a dereliction of their duty to their users (<A HREF="/Risks/10.03.html">RISKS-10.03</A>).

BTW, we await the test case with baited breath.

As for the future of hacking? Well, as someone said when prostitution was made
illegal in New Orleans (or was it Paris?):

     "They may make it illegal, but they'll never make it unpopular!"

     The following is the press release approved on August 20, 1990 by the
National Security Agency:

     The National Security Agency (NSA) has announced that the National
Computer Security Center (NCSC) will be functionally realigned to enhance its
capability to respond to network and system information challenges.  The NCSC
was created by the Department of Defense in 1981 to provide needed emphasis on
computer security and serve as a center of technical expertise.

     The restructuring, which has been under consideration for some time, will
serve to facilitate the integration of the Agency's communications security
technical expertise and the computer security development and evaluation
process to better assure systems oriented solutions to system security
problems.  The restructuring was prompted by increasing recognition that
current user applications virtually eliminate traditional distinctions between
telecommunications and information systems such that a functional merger of the
communication security and computer security disciplines was necessary to
effectively address network and system security issues.

     The NCSC will continue to operate as a separate reporting element of NSA's
Information Systems Security Directorate.  Patrick Gallagher, a senior NSA
official and Director of the NCSC, will be responsible for assuring that the
integration of communications security and computer security technical
expertise strengthens the NCSC's effectiveness in the development of criteria
for and the evaluation of information systems.

     Agency officials emphasized that all NCSC activities will continue and
that this convergence of resources and skills from the two disciplines is
intended to enhance the NCSC's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and
effectively meet new challenges.  These responsibilities include providing
technical support to activities of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology under the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235).  NCSC
remains committed to providing this support and to fostering the availability
of secure products to protect U.S.  Government classified information as well
as unclassified and sensitive information, to the extent such technology has
application, is economically advantageous, and is consistent with the Public
Law.  All of the NCSC's commitments to its industry partners regarding product
and system evaluation will continue to be met.

As the silly season draws to a close, it is time to note that the reporter
quoted in the RISKS item beginning

	(From The Lewiston Morning Tribune, June 30, 1990)

	Associated Press
	SEATTLE--The Orcas Island ferry dock, badly damaged when
	a state ferry rammed it, ...
was wrong regarding the following sentence:
		Ferry operations superintendent Don Schwartzman
	said it appeared the ship's computerized power supply
	control system failed to respond to commands.  

Followup stories confirmed what every ferry lover already knows: There are no
computers on Washington State ferries.  All were removed several years ago.

    [Or else the superintendent did not know that the computers had been
    removed, as reported was going to happen way back in RISKS volume 4. PGN]

I tried to respond to "Brian M. Clapper &lt;clapper@chekov&gt;" by mail, but can't
find a host named "chekov" anywhere in the NIC host tables, when trying to make
the address given into something replyable-to.

                         [He has a decidedly noncompliant mailer.  That is
                         what his mail said.  Try clapper@nadc.navy.mil .  PGN]

His comments on the Discover Card didn't ring a bell with me, so I dug
around my own Discover Card paperwork. First off, Mr. Clapper said there
was no PIN associated with the card, but not only did I receive a PIN
with mine, but there was a form to fill out and send in to get another
form (!) to request a specific PIN. You need the PIN to use the card in
certain ATM networks to get cash. (I've never done that, by the way.)

Secondly, he said the 800 number was written on the back of the card.
There is no number on the back of my Discover Card.

The Discover literature I have is full of the number 1-800-858-5588 (to call to
report a lost/stolen card, etc.). I called that number just now to see if I'd
get the automated interface he described, and, lo and behold, I instead get an
intercept recording that says, "The 800 number you have dialled has been
disconnected. No further information is available about this number." [!] I
find that rather astounding -- even if Discover switched numbers, they still
should have a cross-reference to the new number.  The only thing that comes to
mind is that Discover changed 800 carriers, and the one that has 858 doesn't
want to give any business to whatever firm took over the Discover account.

I do consider it a "RISK" that the number cited in the cardholder's literature
as the one to call about a lost or stolen card does not work and has no
forwarding or cross-referencing to the current correct number.

I didn't bring a recent bill with me, so I don't have their current 800 number
to compare with this. I found a different "customer service" number in the
paperwork, too (1-800-451-4451), but it gets the same intercept recording. Glad
I found this out now, rather than when I had an urgent need to call them! I'll
see if I can locate a current number and update this info in case I need it
sometime.

Since I couldn't try out the automated response system for Discover, I took a
chance and called the number on the back of my AT&amp;T "Universal" Card (MC
version). They have one, also. I waded thru the menus and found out that they,
too, do not ask for a PIN but they *do* ask for the "ZIP code of your billing
address" as verification. I think that is a good compromise. I never carry the
card PINs with me, nor have them memorized, since I never use the functions
that require them. So this is something I *do* know and that would be at least
some deterrent to a thief who has someone else's card. If he has the whole
wallet, with ID and cards, though, he'll have that ZIP (probably).

While I am certainly not in favor of letting your typical computer program/
system be given full control (with no chance for override or other
intervention) of safety-critical situations, I am bit disturbed by a blanket
call for banning computers from being used in such environments at all.  It
strikes me as a little odd that no one has seemed to mention the drawbacks of
such a ban.

For example, I throw out the following questions without knowledge of
the answers, but hoping that those who have called for this ban have
carefully thought through all of them:

          (1) suppose that computers are banned from intensive care units?  How
many extra people are going to be needed?  What is the chance of a human error
occurring, with people instead of machines?  Furthermore, what equipment will
be used in place of certain computerized monitors?  (This one hits close to
home, folks.  A computerized heart monitor notified Intensive Care nurses and
cardiologists that my father was having a heart attack, resulting in his living
five more years instead of diying then and there.  The cardiologists on duty
both commented that it was lucky the hospital had installed the monitors the
previous week, as there was (to their knowledge) no other equipment that would
have alerted them in time to save his life.)

          2.  If you ban computers from early warning systems (assuming that
you need such beasts), what are you going to use?  Do you have any idea how
many extra people it would take?  Or what the chance would be of an error
caused by the sheer boredom of these people?  Or what the chance would be that
no response would be taken when needed, because of an inability to collate data
in time?  While I believe that letting a computer be in total charge is RISKy,
to say the least, I believe that taking computers totally out of the loop would
be far more RISKy.

          3.  If you ban computers from flight control systems, what do you do
about the increased wear and tear of the electromechanical parts that replace
them?  What do you do about the increased strain on the pilots?  Again I am not
advocating letting computers have complete control of the aircraft (as I pilot
myself, I certainly don't wnant that).  However, I think that the tradeoffs
need to be carefully considered before one advocates such an extreme measure as
a total ban.

In summary, while I do NOT believe that computer hardware/software is of
sufficient quality as to be trusted with the sole stewardship of human life, I
DO believe that the decision as to whether or not to automate should be made
after a careful analysis of the RISKS of both potential decisions, not just the
RISKs of automating.
