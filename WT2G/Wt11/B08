This publication is produced in cooperation with the Governors Small
Business Environmental Task Force, the Illinois Department of Commerce and
Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA).  It is created in response to a recommendation made by the Task
Force to explain existing financing programs that can be used to assist
small businesses in meeting environmental compliance costs.  Specifically
requested were programs available through federal, state, local and other
public sources.<p>

Many sources for financing environmental compliance and pollution
prevention projects exist.  However, few are specifically targeted for that
sole purpose.<p>

It is the intent of this publication to identify the various sources of
financing that exist.  The financing tools (or programs) that exist are
constantly changing.  Therefore, we recommend that you contact the sources
of financing for the current financing programs available to help you
implement your environmental project.<p>


<h3>First Steps to Financial Assistance</h3>

Usually the best source of financial assistance is your local lender.  They
may know about other available programs.  Other organizations to contact
include:<p>
<ol>

<li> local economic development commission<br>
<li> local chamber of commerce<br>
<li> local municipal economic development department<p></ol>

Exploring the availability of local financing resources should be your
first option.<p>


<h3>Information to Take to your Lender</h3>
<ol>
<li> Statement of purpose for the loan<br>
<li> History of your business<br>
<li> Financial information for the last three years, balance sheet, income
     statements for existing businesses<br>
<li> Projections of income, expense and cash flow<br>
<li> Schedule of term debts for existing businesses<br>
<li> Aging of accounts receivable and payable for existing business<br>
<li> Lease details if applicable<br>
<li> Amount of investment in the business by the owner<br>
<li> Signed personal financial statements<br>
<li> Personal resumes<br>
</ul>

<strong>
ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS<br>
PARTICIPATION LOAN PROGRAMS</strong>
<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has designed the
Participation Loan Programs to encourage lenders to make loans that they
would not otherwise make for a variety of reasons.  For the purposes of
this program, a lender is an Illinois bank, Development Corporation, or
other lending institution.  By providing financial assistance through local
lenders, the borrower does not need to submit a separate application to the
Department for a loan.  All loan servicing, except some necessary reports,
is handled by the local lender.<p>

Participation loans are purchased when the project being considered has the
potential to create or retain substantial employment  for the people of the
State of Illinois.  The loan can be used for new plant start up,
modernization, expansion or to improve the competitiveness of the borrower.<p>

For current information on this and other state and local programs, contact
the nearest Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  To identify the SBDC
in your area, please call the DCCA Business Assistance Hotline at 800/252-
2923.<p>

<strong>
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CDAP)
</strong>
<p>
DCCA makes grants to local governments, who can in turn make funds
available to local businesses.  The program is targeted to benefit low and
moderate income persons by creating or retaining job opportunities and
improving the quality of their living environment.  Applicants must certify
that 51% of the jobs created and/or retained from the CDAP-funded project
will benefit low to moderate-income persons. Units of local government,
such as cities, villages, townships and counties, may apply for funding.
Municipalities must be 50,000 or less in population and must not be located
in an urban county that receives "entitlement" funds.<p>

For more information, contact your local municipality; local economic
development office or the nearest Small Business Development Center (SBDC).
To identify the SBDC in your area, please call the DCCA Business Assistance
Hotline at 800/252-2923.<p>

<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3></center>

This publication is produced in cooperation with the Governor's Small
Business Environmental Task Force, Illinois Department of Commerce and
Community Affairs, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. This
document is the response to a recommendation made by the Task Force to
provide small businesses basic information about the process of selecting
environmental consultants.<p>

The guide is designed to provide the basic questions to ask, issues to be
identified and approach to take as you seek the expertise of
environmental consultants. Like any guide, it is intended to help you
identify the major areas of which you should be aware. Ultimately, you
the business are responsible for your environmental compliance.<p>

We hope this information will help you as you begin your search for the
wide variety of quality environmental consultants that are available to
assist you. You may wish to identify a consultant before a specific
problem arises.<p>

In some instances, you may want to contact existing programs to identify
the scope of your problem before contacting a consultant. Some agencies
have existing programs that offer information and assistance at no
charge. They include:<p>

<center><h3>Role of the Environmental Consultant</h3></center>

You may be aware that environmental requirements are applicable to your
company or that some environmental problem already exists. Where do you
turn for help?<p>

First, take environmental matters seriously. In recent years the
financial and legal consequences of environmental problems have expanded
dramatically.<p>

Second, recognize that you may need both technical and legal assistance.
As the environmental requirements have expanded and become more detailed,
consultants and attorneys have become specialized to address them. You
probably need to go beyond general practitioners in these areas.<p>

Third, carefully define the issue. This will require an environmental
professional who not only specializes in the environmental area, but also
has a broad understanding of both the technical issues and regulatory
process.<p>

Fourth, you may need specialized environmental services. They might
include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>air/water/soil testing
<li>detailed design and construction services
<li>laboratory
<li>legal
<li>professional engineering
</p>
</ul>
For example, the construction contractor may do the actual hands-on work,
such as hazardous waste clean-ups or tank removal. However, some
environmental consultants provide clean-up work, either with in-house
capability or by subcontracting to other parties.<p>

The nature of the environmental project dictates the academic training,
qualifications and credentials required of the provider of the services.
A summary of various types of environmental professionals and of
recommended or required credentials is provided in <a href=#b>Appendix B</a>.<p>

<a name="Selection"><hr></a>
<center><h3>Selection Methods of the Environmental Consultant</h3></center>

An environmental consultant will oversee your environmental project and
ensure that it is completed in a manner which will not only satisfy you
but also meet all applicable state and federal regulations.<p>

Your environmental consultant also will be responsible for developing a
project plan and hiring or assisting in hiring any subcontractors which
may be needed. Contacting your lender early in the search process will
ensure that your efforts are coordinated with your source of financing.<p>

Suggested steps to follow in selecting an environmental consultant:<p>
<ol>
<li> Business defines project (e.g. hazardous waste, storage tank,
asbestos)
<li> Business determines role of consultant (e.g. assessment, survey,
plan, design, construction oversight)
<li> Contact firms, request statements of qualifications (e.g. lists in
yellow pages, DCCA, engineering associations)
<li> Short list up to six firms based upon review of qualifications and
request proposals from these firms (you may want firms to visit site)
<li> Interview firms following review of proposals
<li> Rank the top three firms in order of preference
<li>Develop Scope of Work and negotiate fee with top ranked firm only
<li> If agreement reached, finalize contract
<li> If no agreement, drop number one firm and begin negotiations with
second ranked firm and so on until agreement is reached.
</ol><p>
Things to consider in evaluating an environmental consultant:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>professional reputation
<li>   references
<li>   licenses, registrations, certifications
<li>   professional association activities
<li>   professional awards
<li>   insurance/amount and type
<li>   Quality Control/Quality Assurance procedures
   experience in dealing with your particular problem and
   successful completion of similar projects in your state
<li>     identity and qualifications of project manager
<li>     approach to project
<li>     subconsultants
<li>     ability to meet or exceed schedule
<li>     location of firm
<li>     financial stability
<li>     ability to communicate
<li>     creativity
</ul>

<strong><center>Attorney Selection</center></strong>

You may consider hiring an attorney familiar with the particular
environmental laws and regulations affecting your project. Given the
complexity of environmental laws today, it is wise to retain the services
of an attorney who concentrates his or her practice in the environmental
field. Other resources for finding an environmental attorney include:
referral from your current legal counsel, the Environmental Services
Directory published by DCCA and the Directory of Environmental Attorneys,
published annually by Prentice Hall Law & Business.<p>

Criteria to consider when selecting environmental counsel:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Capability to provide the legal support and resources required
    to successfully complete your project.
<li>The attorney's experience in handling your particular problem.
<li>The attorney's relationship with the government.
<li>The attorney's familiarity with regulatory agencies with
    jurisdiction over your project.
<li>The identity of the attorney who will be working on your    matter.
<li>The attorney's experience with environmental consultants and
    contractors.
<li>The attorney's experience with businesses similar to yours.
<li>Potential conflicts.
</ul>

<strong><center>The Team Approach</center></strong>

A "team" approach is essential to the successful completion of any
environmental project. This team could consist of you, your environmental
consultant, subcontractors such as construction contractors, and
environmental legal counsel. For your project team to be effective,
however, it is imperative that the environmental professionals you
consider hiring are appropriate for both you and the task at hand.<p>

<a name="Contract"><hr></a>
<center><h3>The Contract</h3></center>

After you and your consultant have defined your project,  a contract
should be prepared that reflects the parties' understanding of the terms
and conditions of the services to be provided. For small scale projects,
the agreement may simply consist of a letter referencing an attached
Scope of Work and the consultant's general contract terms and
conditions or it may consist of a purchase order with an attached Scope
of Work. For more complex projects, the agreement may be several pages
long and provide for a number of contingencies that may arise. Regardless
of the form, you should be sure that the following provisions are
considered:<p>
<dl>
<dt>Scope of Work
<dd>Defines the work that you and the consultant have agreed upon and should
be as detailed as possible. Sometimes contracts include a general
description of the Scope of Work and reference an attached Scope of Work
or set of drawings and specifications that provide the details of the
work. For cases where you cannot precisely define the Scope of Work,
provide as much detail as is known about the project and a description of
the consultant's project approach. The contract should provide a
mechanism for owner participation in modifying the Scope of Work, such as
a change order, during the project.<p>

<dt>Compliance with Applicable Laws
<dd>The consultant and all contractors should perform their services in
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure that work
required by law, but not specifically identified in the Scope of Work, is
included.<p>

<dt>Confidentiality
<dd>To prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the information given to the
consultant or information generated by the consultant, include a
confidentiality provision in the professional services agreement.<p>

<dt>Cost and Payment Terms
<dd>The cost and payment terms, together with the Scope of Work, describe the
essence of the bargain between you and the consultant. The cost provision
should clearly spell out the amount the consultant will be paid.<p>

The cost provision should clearly state on what basis the consultant is
being paid and how the consultant is paid. Payment may be in one lump sum
or progress payments made over the term of the contract. The contract
should define project completion. Termination provisions also should be
included stating under what circumstances the contract can be terminated.<p>

<dt>Insurance
<dd>Consultants should be able to provide comprehensive general liability,
professional liability (also known as "errors and omissions"),
comprehensive automobile liability, and workers' compensation and
employer liability insurance. In addition, consultants and contractors
who specialize in hazardous waste or asbestos can often provide insurance
coverage against certain environmental liabilities.<p>
</dl>
<b><center>Limits on Liability</center></b>

<strong>Consultants</strong><br>
The ways in which consultants may limit their liability include the
following:<p>
<ul type=square>
   <li>To the amount of the contract fee (meaning profit, not total
   dollars to be paid by you under the contract).

<li>     To the amount paid to the consultant (not limited to profit).

<li>     To amounts that will be covered by the insurance the
     consultant agrees to carry as listed in the agreement.

<li>     To a fixed dollar amount.
</ul>
Limitations on liability should be carefully reviewed. Although some
consultants may not be willing to perform the work without some
limitation on liability, you should carefully consider limitations in the
agreement.<p>

<strong>Your Limitations</strong><br>
In addition to requiring insurance in sufficient limits, you can attempt
to limit your liability by insisting that the consultant indemnify you
for the consultant's activities. Many contracts also provide for owner
indemnification of the consultant under certain situations.<p>

For additional contract information, see the "Standard Form of Agreement
Between Owner and Engineer for Professional Services" prepared by the
National Society of Professional Engineers, American Consulting Engineers
Council, and American Society of Civil Engineers. For more information,
contact the Consulting Engineers Council of Illinois at 625 South
College, P.O. Box 1604, Springfield, Illinois 62705. The phone number is
217/528-7814.<p>

When in doubt, have an attorney review the contract.<p>

<a name="Env Issues"><hr></a>
<center><h3><a name="Issues">Environmental Issues and Lenders</a></h3></center>

You are contemplating the purchase of a new business location. You wish
to expand your facility. You want to borrow money for business purposes.
You have just discovered that an environmental problem exists and you
will need to borrow funds to handle it. In all of these situations it is
important to initiate discussions with your lender as soon as possible.<p>

Lenders will have their own requirements regarding environmental issues.
Contacting the lender early may save money by incorporating those
requirements into your plans before work has commenced. Some lenders have
an approved list of consultants that they use. Using a consultant that is
acceptable to the lender may also save the cost of having your
consultant's report reviewed by a consultant acceptable to the lender.<p>

Even if you do not borrow additional money, you may need to inform your
lender of environmental concerns. Most loan documents have environmental
clauses that require lender notification upon discovery of an
environmental situation. Even if not required by your loan documents, you
may wish to do so in the interest of open communication with your
lender.<p>

<h3>
IEPA<br>
Feb. 1995
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<center><h3>Good Housekeeping Practices</h3></center>

<h3>Why are Good Housekeeping Practices Important?</h3>

The potential danger of a hazardous waste does not go away when it's put
into a container. Many chemical leaks and work-related injuries are due to
improper or unsafe container management.<p>

Accidents happen. Hazardous waste spills, fires and explosions can result
in serious injuries, significant property damage, and expensive clean-up
costs. It is your responsibility to minimize these accidents by following
the basic good housekeeping practices in this guide.<p>

<h3>What is a proper Waste Container?</h3>

Store hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes in containers that are in
good condition and compatible with the waste being stored (i.e., strong
acids should not be stored in unlined steel drums).<p>

Keep incompatible wastes in separate areas to reduce the risk of a
potentially dangerous reaction and accident. Incompatible wastes should not
be placed in the same container. Mixing a spent acid (i.e., sulfuric acid)
with a spent caustic material (i.e., sodium hydroxide) could result in
dangerously high temperatures or a violet chemical reaction.<p>

Keep storage containers closed except when adding or removing waste. This
will help reduce the evaporation of some volatile gases and minimize the
chance of spills, fires or explosions.<p>

<h3>How do I Design a Proper Storage Area?</h3>

Store containers on pallets so leaks can be detected early and the
containers can be moved easily during an emergency.<p>

Waste storage areas should have a diked, crack-free concrete floor or pad
so if containers leak, the waste does not contaminate underlying or
adjacent soils, sewers, or bodies of waters.<p>

There should be sufficient aisle space (at least 30 inches) between the
containers to allow for easy container inspection and easy movement of
emergency and spill control equipment.<p>

Protect the containers from the weather by storing the containers under a
roof. This will reduce corrosion, infiltration of water through the bung
holes, and the effects of weathering on labels and signs.<p>


<h3>Why Should I label Containers?</h3>

Label containers clearly so you know their contents at all times. For
example, write the words "HAZARDOUS WASTE" on the label if that is what you
are accumulating. Include as easily understood description of the waste and
the hazards associated with he waste (i.e., "ignitable" or "toxic").<p>

Record the date you begin accumulating hazardous waste and mark the date on
the container when it is full. These steps will help you determine how much
hazardous waste you generate in a calendar month. The amount of waste you
generate determines what requirements you must meet.<p>

When you transfer a waste (i.e., hazardous or non-hazardous special waste)
to another container, make sure you put a label on the new container and
remove the label from the old one (unless you will use it to hold the same
type of wastes immediately after).<p>


<h3>How Are Containers To Be Emptied and Disposed?</h3>

All waste containers may go to a solid waste landfill or a scrap metal
dealer if you remove all the waste and residue from the container. Remove
all wastes by triple rinsing the container with a solvent capable of
dissolving any residue in the container.<p>


<em>IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETELY EMPTY A WASTE CONTAINER, YOU MUST SEND THE
CONTAINER(S) TO EITHER A SPECIAL WASTE LANDFILL OR A HAZARDOUS WASTE
LANDFILL.</em><p>


To send a hazardous waste container to a special waste landfill you must:<p>
<ol>
<li> Remove all residue possible, leaving less than one inch of residue in
     the container or;<p>

<li> Leave less than three percent of residue from the total capacity of
     the container (e.g.: three percent of a 55-gallon drum is 1.7
     gallons).<p></ol>

These containers can then be sent to a special waste landfill.<p>

However, containers which stored hazardous waste and still contain stubborn
waste residue must be sent to a hazardous waste landfill.<p>

For more information about what types of wastes you may have at your
business, please refer to IEPA Fact Sheet: "How to Determine What Types of
Waste you Generate and What Are Your Responsibilities".<p>


<h3>When Should I Conduct A Self-Inspection?</h3>

Inspect the containers every week. If a container begins to corrode or
leak, immediately clean up the waste and transfer to another container.<p>


<h3>How Should I Prepare for Emergencies?</h3>

Severe accidents can be minimized if you are prepared. Make arrangements
with local authorities (police, fire departments, etc.) to familiarize them
with the types of materials stored and the layout of the facility.<p>

Designate an "emergency coordinator."  This coordinator might be the owner,
foreman, or main person in charge on each shift and should be "on call" at
all times.<p>

Post the name and number of the emergency coordinator, the location of fire
extinguishers, spill control material, the fire alarm, and the telephone
number of the fire department and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
(IEMA) next to the telephone.<p>

The owner or operator of the facility should ensure all employees are
familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures (i.e., what
materials are hazardous, where the telephone is, where the spill control
materials are, how to use the fire extinguisher, etc.).<p>


<h3>What If An Accidental Spill or Leak Occurs?</h3>

Clean up any chemical spills or leaks immediately so that you do not
contaminate surface waters, groundwater's, soils, or sewer systems.<p>

Call the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) at their 24-hour
emergency phone number (800/782-7860) to report any chemical spills or
leaks.<p>

<hr>
<center><h3>Things To Remember</h3></center>

Do not discard any waste into an open dump, raving, gully, surface
impoundment, or ditch. Your waste must go to a permitted landfill. Ask your
hauler to supply proof of proper disposal of your trash.<p>

Do not rinse or drain hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes into the
sanitary or storm sewer, creek, ditch, septic system, or underground tank.
Chemicals poured, spilled, or leaked into sewer systems can form explosive
vapors in sewers or basements or disrupt municipal wastewater treatment
plant operations. Discharges underground may poison private or public water
supplies, while discharges to surface waters may kill fish, livestock, or
other wildlife.<p>

Hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes cannot be discarded into the
dumpster, roll-off box, or trash cans that are used for general refuse. The
wastes may catch fire or injure your waste hauler or workers at the
landfill.<p>

Don't store hazardous wastes on site more than 90 days without consulting:

<h3 align=center>Does Your Business Need A Water Pollution Control Permit?</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document is intended to provide a guide or road map to assist persons in determining whether their business requires a water pollution control permit from the Bureau of Water. Figuring out whether or not a permit is needed has been confusing and frustrating to many small businesses. This document explains how to make this determination. However, it does not provide a definitive answer for every person or business, since there can be complex matters requiring interpretation and assistance.<p>

There are three kinds of water pollution control permits. Discharge permits (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES) are required by the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.  State construction permits are generally required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act for water pollution control hardware. In addition, state operating permits are generally required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act for facilities not required to have an NPDES permit.<p>

All three of these permits are issued by the Bureau of Water. You should be aware that your business may also need a permit from the Bureau of Air (an air permit) or the Bureau of Land (a land permit) or both. One or both of those permits may be required whether or not you need a water permit.<p>

The Bureau of Water's Permit Section is ready and willing to assist you with your water permit questions in any way possible. If you have a question or would like assistance, please contact the Permit Section at 217/782-0610 and ask for the Engineer on Call.<p>

<h3>
Discharge Permits<br>
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
</h3>
                                    
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit regulates wastewater. There are two types of discharges controlled by NPDES permits - process and storm water. An NPDES permit may be required at one business for either type of wastewater or for both. You should determine whether you need an NPDES permit either for process wastewater or for storm water. You are required to obtain these permits prior to any discharge. The requirements for each one are discussed separately in Parts 1 and 2 below.<p>

<h4>Part 1:  Does your business discharge wastewater (other than storm water) so as to require an NPDES permit?</h4>

To answer this question, you should go through the three steps below. The first two steps help you
determine whether you need an NPDES permit.  The last step contains an exemption to the NPDES permit requirement you should consider as well.<p>

<ul>
<em>Step 1:  Does  your business discharge a wastewater? You should first ask if your business has a wastewater discharge.</em><p>

The definition of  wastewater is very broad and will include almost any discharge of water that is generated from any process industry, manufacturing, trade, or business. The definition also includes any solid, liquid or gaseous waste; and all other substances whose discharge would cause water pollution or a violation of the effluent or water quality standards of the State. Toilet and hand washing waste is also defined as a wastewater.

If your business does not have a wastewater discharge as described above, you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>

If your business does have a wastewater discharge as described above, you should go on to the next step.<p>

<em>Step 2:  If your business has wastewater, does your business discharge it to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth?</em><p>

This provision is very broad so that you can assume that any discharge that goes to surface water or the ground on your property, or that leaves your property, is included. However, wastewater that is applied to agricultural land for crop or soil benefit is not regulated by the NPDES program. The permits required for this type of activity are discussed later in this document.<p>

<em>Step 3:  Does your business have ONLY toilet and hand washing wastewater?</em><p>

If the only wastewater your business discharges is toilet and hand washing wastewater and the discharge of toilet and hand washing wastewater is less than 1500 gallons per day, you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit. However, the Illinois Department of Public Health does regulate these discharges.<p>

If the discharge from your business of toilet and hand washing wastewater is greater than 1500 gallons per day, you are required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Part 2:  Does your business have a storm water discharge so as to require an NPDES permit?</h4>

You need to go through the two steps below to determine whether your business needs an NPDES permit for its storm water discharge. You will usually need to know the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for your business to do this.

<ul>
<em>Step 1:  Does your business have a SIC code for which NPDES storm water permits are required?</em><p>

Storm water may also be considered a wastewater depending on the type of business in which you are engaged. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or type of operation your business is engaged in will determine whether or not the storm water that discharges from your property will be considered a wastewater. A listing of categories for which storm water permits are required is contained in Appendix 1.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code or operation that is listed in Categories 1-10 in Appendix 1, then you are required to obtain an NPDES permit, even if you do not have objects at your business exposed to storm water.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code that is listed in category 11 of Appendix 1 then you may be required to obtain an NPDES permit. A category 11 industry in required to obtain an NPDES permit if material  handling equipment or activities, raw materials, intermediate products, final products, waste materials, by-products, or industry machinery are exposed to storm water. If you have a business in a category 11 industry and you do not have these objects at your business exposed to storm water, then you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code or operation that is not listed in Appendix 1, then you are not required to obtain an NPDES storm water permit, unless you are violating water quality standards of the State.<p>

<em>Step 2:    If your business has wastewater, does your business discharge it to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth?</em><p>

This provision is very broad so that you can assume that any discharge that goes to surface waters or the ground on your property, or that leaves your property, is included.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Important Additional Information Concerning NPDES Permits</h4>

You should be aware that a general NPDES storm water permit is available from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section if you meet the criteria described in the general permit. A general permit is a standardized permit with pre-determined conditions for similar discharges. You can review a general permit and decide ahead of time whether to apply for it rather than for an individualized permit. A one-page application is available for most general storm water NPDES permits. The simplified permit is usually issued within 2 weeks of receipt of the application.<p>

An NPDES permit issued by the Bureau of Water has a maximum life of 5 years.<p>

If you are required to obtain an NPDES permit from the Bureau of Water, you are required to make a timely application 180 days prior to a new discharge or expiration of the existing NPDES permit if you wish to renew the permit.<p>

<hr>
<h3>State Construction Permits</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

A water pollution control construction permit is required by state law for businesses with the potential to cause water pollution. This construction permit is required prior to constructing or modifying a facility. You can determine whether you need to obtain a construction permit by going through Steps 1 and 2 below.<p>

<h4>Step 1:  Will there be construction at your facility, or modification of your facility, such that a construction permit is required?</h4>

State construction permits are required if your business is constructing or modifying anything within one of the four categories listed below.<p>

Construction is defined as the commencement of on-site fabrication, erection, or installation.<p>

The definition of modification is rather long and can be found in Appendix 2. You should look carefully at this definition because it includes such things as an increase in the amount of wastewater discharge even if the increase is not due to any other physical change in the facility.<p>

 The definition of wastewater is discussed in Part 1, Step 1 of the section dealing with NPDES permits.<p>

If you are planning on constructing or modifying at your business, you should determine whether what you intend to construct or modify falls within one of the four categories listed below.<p>

If what you intend to construct or modify falls within one of the four categories listed below, you are required to obtain a construction permit from the Bureau of Water prior to the construction or modification.<p>

If what you intend to construct or modify does not fall within one of the four categories listed below, you are not required to obtain a construction permit from the Bureau of Water.<p>

<em>Category l: TREATMENT WORKS</em><p>

A treatment works is a device used for collecting, pumping, treating, or disposing of wastewaters, or for the recovery of byproducts from such wastewater.<p>

A treatment works usually discharges wastewater to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth.  However, a treatment works may also recycle wastewater for other uses and not have a discharge.<p>

<em>Category 2: PRETREATMENT WORKS</em><p>

A pretreatment works is a device used for collecting, pumping treating or disposing of wastewater, or for the recovery of byproducts from such wastewater, before the wastewater in discharged into a publicly owned sanitary sewer system.  The sanitary sewer system conveys the wastewater to a publicly owned treatment plant for further treatment.<p>

In addition to the exemption listed in Step 2 of this section, pretreatment works have an additional exemption which is fairly complicated and may require interpretation.  This additional exemption in listed in Appendix 3. If you need assistance interpreting or understanding this exemption, you can obtain assistance from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 or you may obtain assistance from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

<em>Category 3: WASTEWATER SOURCE</em><p>

Wastewater source is any discharge of wastewater, usually to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.  Wastewater discharges to agricultural land for crop or soil benefit are also considered wastewater sources. Some examples of wastewater sources would be:<p>

1.   A new business in an existing building with existing sewers that connect to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer. Your new business will be generating a wastewater which you will discharge through the existing sewer. This discharge would be considered a wastewater source.<p>

2.   Land application and/or spray irrigation of wastewater (including wastewater sludges) to agricultural lands.<p>

<em>Category 4: SEWER</em><p>

A sewer is defined as a stationary means of transport intended to transport wastewater from your business to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.<p>

The portion of the sewer which requires a construction permit is that portion which runs from the boundary of your building to the point of connection to the publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.<p>

<h4>Step 2:   Do you fall under the exemption for treatment works, pretreatment works, sewers, and wastewater sources?</h4>

This exemption can apply only to businesses who generate toilet and hand washing waste.<p>

If you generate any wastewater that is not toilet and hand washing waste, this exemption does not apply to your business, and you must obtain a permit.<p>

The exemption is as follows:<p>

Construction permits are not required for any treatment works, pretreatment works, sewer or wastewater source designed and intended to serve a single building and eventually treat or discharge less than 1500 gallons per day of strictly toilet and hand washing waste (other wise known as domestic waste).<p>

If you fit under this exemption, then you are not required to obtain a state construction permit from the Bureau of Water.<p>


<hr>
<h3>State Operating Permits</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

State operating permits are required for the use or operation of most treatment works, pretreatment works, sewers or wastewater sources for which a construction permit is required. You should go through the two steps below to determine whether you need a state operating permit from the Bureau of Water.<p> 

<h4>Step 1:   Does my business need a state construction permit?</h4>

In the section called State Construction Permits, you determined if your business required a state construction permit.<p>

If you were required to obtain a state construction permit (other than for a sewer) you will be required to obtain a state operating permit, unless you fit under the exemptions listed in Step 2 below. Operating permits for sewers are generally issued with the construction permit.<p>

If you have existing treatment works, pretreatment works, or wastewater sources, you are required to have a state operating permit unless you fit under one of the exemptions listed in Step 2 below.<p>

If you do not need a state construction permit for your business, you do not need a state operating permit for your business unless you intend to use land application and/or spray irrigation of wastewater (including wastewater sludges) on agricultural land.<p>

<h4>Important Additional Information</h4>

An operating permit issued by the Bureau of Water has a maximum life of 5 years.<p>

If you are required to obtain an operating permit from the Bureau of Water, you are required to renew that permit by its expiration date for continued operation of the permitted facility.<p>

If you meet the criteria for needing an operating permit, you are required to obtain the operating permit even if you did not obtain a construction permit.<p>

<h4>Step 2:   Is my business exempted from the requirement for a state operating permit?</h4>

A state operating permit is not required for the following even if a state construction permit was required.<p>

A treatment works whose discharge is covered by an NPDES permit.<p>

A pretreatment works or wastewater source whose discharge to the publicly-owned treatment plant (usually owned by a municipality) has been authorized by a receiving publicly-owned treatment plant that has an approved pretreatment program.<p>

You should identify the publicly-owned treatment plant to which the discharge from your business flows. Once this is done, you should contact the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 to identify publicly-owned treatment plants that have approved pretreatment programs.  This will tell you if the publicly-owned treatment plant to which your discharge flows has an approved pretreatment program.<p>

If the wastewater discharge from your business flows to a publicly-owned treatment plant with an approved pretreatment program, then a State operating permit is not required.<p>

If the wastewater discharge from your business does not flow to a publicly-owned treatment plant with an approved pretreatment program, then a State operating permit is required.<p>

For certain pretreatment works or wastewater sources, there are some additional, somewhat technical, exemptions. The rule containing these exemptions is in Appendix 3 to this document. If you need assistance interpreting or understanding this exemption, you can obtain assistance from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 or you may obtain assistance from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

<h3 align=center>Does Your Business Need A Land Pollution Control Permit?</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document is intended to provide you with a guide to determining whether your business needs a permit from the Bureau of Land (a Land permit). It will not provide answers to all your questions about environmental regulations, but will help you determine your permit responsibilities.<p>

This document takes you through a series of questions that you need to answer to determine whether you need a Land permit. It will also identify how you can get help with these questions should you need assistance. Many of these questions and their answers are complex and, as you apply them to your business, will often raise questions of interpretation for which you may need assistance from the Agency or from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

Certain key words are in bold type within this document. If you understand the meanings of these words, it will make asking questions and understanding the answers easier for you. A word printed in bold type is defined in the regulations. It has a special meaning to regulatory professionals. The words in bold type are defined in the Attachment to this document.<p>

Your business may also need a permit from the Bureau of Air (an Air permit) or the Bureau of Water (a Water permit) or both. One or both of those permits may be required regardless whether a Land permit is required.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>1.   What activities may require a land permit?</strong></em><p>

You must obtain a permit to conduct some regulated activities. The need for a permit is dependent upon the type of waste, what you do with a waste and location of the activities. A land permit is generally required to manage waste. If you do not treat, store or dispose of some kind of waste you will not need a land permit.<p>

The kind of land permit that you need will be determined by the kind of waste that you manage and how you manage it. These management activities are discussed below.<p>

There are a variety of waste activities that are regulated to control contamination by wastes. Because some regulated activities require a permit, you need to understand what these activities are to determine if your business needs a land permit. If your company or business activities make waste, you are a waste generator. The regulations explain how you must handle the waste while it is on your property. Waste generation is a regulated activity but does not need a permit unless you conduct one of the activities described below. These are the activities that may trigger the need for a permit.<p>

Waste storage. If you store waste on your property you must comply with all the storage requirements in the regulations. Several different sets of regulations may apply to this activity depending on who generates the waste, the classification of the waste, and how long the waste is stored at your facility.<p>

Waste transportation is also regulated. If you transport the waste on a public road, you must obey the transporter rules.<p>

Waste treatment. Any activity which changes the rule is regulated as waste treatment. Treatment includes, among other things, mixing the waste with other wastes or materials, burning, grinding or separating the waste.<p>

Waste disposal is the most highly regulated waste management activity. Disposal includes, among other things, dumping waste on the ground, storing it in piles on the ground, in a landfill, or in lagoons and storing waste indefinitely even when it is held in tanks, buildings or containers.<p>

If you conduct one of these activities, please read further to determine if your activities require a permit.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>2.   What is a waste?</strong></em><p>

A waste is anything that is being discarded or can no longer be used for its original purpose. Something may be a waste if it no longer has a dollar value or if it is used carelessly, spilled, burned, buried or poured down the drain. All waste is referred to as solid waste. In fact, in the regulations, solid waste and waste mean the same thing. The term solid waste as used in the regulations can be misleading in another way because it includes not only solid materials but also liquids and gasses. If you want to re-use something, it may not be a waste. The Agency's Industrial Material Exchange Section would be happy to assist you in finding someone to re-use materials for which you no longer have a use. They can be contacted at 217/782-0450.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>3.   What is waste management?</strong></em><p>

Managing a waste refers to any kind of waste storage, treatment or disposal activity. You will hear the term manage used with great frequency in the land regulations and in almost any discussion of waste. Examples of waste management include burning a waste, burying a waste, or storing a byproduct or sludge.<p>

Waste management is regulated in many different ways, including through the requirement to obtain a permit, which is the subject of this document. However, you should be aware that many other requirements in addition to a permit requirement may apply. These other requirements include regulation of waste transportation, design and operating requirements for waste treatment, storage, disposal, and reporting requirements on waste generation.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>4.   What type of waste do I manage?</strong></em><p>

Wastes are grouped into different categories by the regulations. You must determine which categories of waste you are managing to determine the kind of permit you will need.<p>

Solid waste is divided into two categories: nonspecial waste and special waste.<p>

<em>NONSPECIAL WASTE:</em>   Nonspecial wastes are generally not as harmful to people or the environment, so they are not regulated as special waste. Nonspecial wastes include garbage and commercial waste. These types of wastes are generally associated with offices, homes and restaurants, but also include clean packaging, landscape waste, clean machinery components and construction or demolition debris.<p>

<em>SPECIAL WASTE:</em>  Special waste includes potential infectious medical waste (PIMW), industrial process waste, pollution control waste, and hazardous waste. Because the mismanagement of these wastes may cause serious health or environmental problems, special waste may be regulated under one or more sets of regulations in addition to the regulations for nonspecial waste. Special permitting requirements may also apply.<p>

Potentially Infectious Medical Waste (PIMW)  includes most medical waste generated by health care professionals or medical research that may be infectious to humans. It does not include medical waste generated at your home.<p>

Industrial process waste includes waste generated by industry or commercial services such as gas stations or painting contractors. Industrial process waste does not include clean packaging materials, office or food waste.<p>

Pollution control waste is generated by the treatment or cleanup of other wastes. Treatment residues from wastewater treatment, air scrubbing and spill cleanups are all pollution control waste.<p>

Hazardous waste is the most highly regulated category of waste. Some wastes are hazardous because of their ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic properties. These are called characteristically hazardous wastes. In other instances, USEPA has decided that the waste produced by certain industrial activities will always be a hazardous waste. These are called listed hazardous wastes.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>5.   Do you accept waste from someone else?</strong></em><p>

If you accept any waste from someone else for treatment, transfer, storage, or disposal, including a facility of your own located at a different address, you must get a permit from the Bureau of Land.<p>

The type of permit that you must obtain depends upon the kinds of waste that you accept from someone else. Even if you do not accept waste from someone else, a permit may be required for certain hazardous waste management activities. The type of permit you may need is discussed next in this document.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>6. What type of permit do I need?</strong></em><p>

Solid waste permits are required for the nonspecial waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities that accept waste from someone or somewhere else.<p>

Special waste permits are required for facilities that receive or store, treat or dispose of nonhazardous special waste and for hazardous RCRA exempt waste storage or treatment facilities. ( RCRA  is a common way of referring to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.)<p>

The same system is used for permitting both solid and special waste management units. For both solid waste and special waste: development (DE) permits are required to construct new units; operating (OP) permits are then required before receiving waste at a new unit; and supplemental permits are required to modify an existing permitted activity.<p>

Usually, a DE permit is issued prior to construction. An OP permit is issued for operation of the business if the new unit was properly constructed. In some cases, the DE and OP permits are issued jointly.<p>

Hazardous waste permits are required for hazardous waste storage, treatment or disposal facilities. A new hazardous waste management facility must obtain a Part B RCRA Permit prior to construction or to receiving waste. This is a single permit for the facility. Unlike the permits for nonhazardous waste, separate development and operating permits are not required.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>7.   How do I determine if I need a hazardous waste management permit?</strong></em><p>

To determine whether or not you need a hazardous ra-te management permit, you must determine:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>The type of waste<p>
	The time limits for unpermitted storage may vary by hazardous waste type.<p>
<li>The amount of hazardous waste you generate per calendar month<p>
There are time limits on the storage of hazardous waste generated on site based upon these amounts.<p>
<li>The process that generated the waste <p> 
Some processes produce listed hazardous waste even when analysis indicates the waste would not be very harmful.<p>
</ul>

There are many instances where hazardous waste management activities may be exempt from the permitting requirements. However, remember that even if you are exempt from the hazardous waste permit requirements, if you receive waste from someone else or from a different location, you must get a permit.<p>

For further information or assistance in these determinations, you may contact the Bureau of Land Permit Section at 217/524-3300. They will be happy to assist you.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>8.   Are there any special requirements affecting permits of which I should be aware?</strong></em><p>

Before the IEPA can review your permit application, you must provide proof that you have complied with the local siting requirements. All new pollution control facilities must obtain siting approval from a specified unit of local government. The procedures for obtaining local siting approval and the operations which are exempt from these requirements are found in the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.<p>

As indicated earlier, all facility operators that accept waste from another location must first get a permit.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>9.   Is a land permit needed for the transportation of wastes?</strong></em><p>

The Agency recommends that you always use a licensed special waste hauler to transport your waste. Some waste transportation operations must be licensed by the Agency  You must have a license to transport special waste unless you are a small quantity generator transporting your own waste from your own site to a permitted storage, treatment, or disposal facility.<p>

If you are not a small quantity generator, you must either obtain a special waste hauler license or have a licensed special waste hauler transport the waste for you.<p>

<em>SUPPLEMENT TO #9:</em>

You can on haul your own waste without a special waste haulers license or without a manifest if you generate 100 kg. or less of special waste including hazardous waste and less than 1 kg. of acutely hazardous waste in a calender month. You may also qualify for an exemption from manifesting if you generate between 100 kg. and 1000 kg. of hazardous waste in a calender month and the waste is reclaimed under a contractual agreement.  The exemption for small quantity generators hauling their own waste referred to in Question #9 of this document and the exemption from manifesting for small quantity generators referred to in Question #9 of this document are not applicable to a small quantity generator as defined in Appendix 1.<p>

You must also use a manifest as the shipping paper which accompanies your waste, unless you are a small quantity generator.<p>

No license is needed to transport nonspecial waste such as garbage.<p>

You should be aware that the transportation of hazardous material is regulated by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). You may contact them at 217/782-4974 for further information.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>10.  In addition to the permit requirements, are there any other kinds of regulations of which I should be aware?</strong></em><p>

There is a hierarchy of wastes dependent upon their potential to harm people or the environment.<p>

Generators and receivers of the wastes must comply with all the regulations specific to their category plus those applicable to less dangerous wastes.<p>

Nonspecial wastes are regulated under the solid waste rules found in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 807 through 815. Portions of these regulations also pertain to all special waste.<p>

Hazardous wastes are also regulated under the federal rules resulting from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These RCRA rules have been made a part of the state's rules and can be found in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 700 through 739. These hazardous waste  rules are very complicated and contain many specific inclusions, exclusions and exemptions. A guidance document on understanding the hazardous waste rules is available from the Bureau of Land at 217/782-6762. This guidance document includes a helpful discussion of how you can determine the classification of your waste.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>11. Whom should I contact for further information?</strong></em><p>

If the previous information indicates that you may need a permit, you should contact the Bureau of Land's Permit Section at 217/524-3300. Different types of permits are issued by different units.<p>

To help you get to the appropriate person to answer your questions, we have identified the units that review each type of application or permit previously discussed.<p>

Fact Sheet<br>
Women-Owned Business in Illinois
</h3>


<h3>ILLINOIS RANKS FIFTH IN THE NATION AS HOME TO WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES</h3>

<pre>
  the number of women-owned firms                 336,000+
  employment of women-owned firms                 949,000
  sales and receipts of women-owned firms        $119.6 Billion

</pre>

<strong>Number of Firms:</strong>  Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms nearly doubled.  1996 estimates by the National Foundation of Women Business Owners rank Illinois fifth in the nation with nearly 337,000 women-owned firms, a 90 percent increase from 1987.<p>

<strong>Industry Distribution:</strong>  Although 82.3 percent remain concentrated in services, retail trade, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate), Illinois women-owned businesses are diversifying:  percent representation in all but two industries showed an increase from 1987.  Services and retail trade declined.  Chicago boasts more women-owned firms in the construction industry than any other major metropolitan area in the country. <p>

<strong>Employment:</strong>  Employment levels sky-rocketed 112 percent, with women-owned businesses employing 315,615 in 1992  -- up from 149,164 in 1987.  Payroll grew from just over two billion to almost six billion, a 175.8 percent increase.<p>
 
<strong>Sales and Receipts:</strong>  Employer firms still enjoy higher sales. While non-employer firms saw a significant 65.5 percent increase from 1987 to 1992, the sales and receipts of employer firms demonstrated a 154.3 percent gain.  Industry sector matters:  firms located in manufacturing enjoyed the highest sales levels, averaging nearly $1.075 million per company compared to $41,645 per company located in services.  Illinois women-owned businesses overall witnessed an extraordinary 252 percent increase in sales between 1987 and 1992.<p>  

<strong>International Trade:</strong>  Seven percent of Illinois' women-owned firms report international sales.  Nationally, the average is 3 percent.  Export activity has primarily occured in the Canadian and European markets, followed by the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and South America.<p>

Fact Sheet<br>
Hispanic-Owned Business in Illinois
</h3>

ILLINOIS IS THE HOME OF 24 OF THE 500 LARGEST HISPANIC-OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE COUNTRY WITH ANNUAL SALES OF $258.53 MILLION.<p>

In the Chicago area Hispanic-owned businesses have continued to show steady growth. The number of Hispanic businesses has grown by over 300 percent from 1972 to 1995. Most are located in the Chicago neighborhoods of Logan Square, Little Village, Pilsen, West Town, South Chicago, Uptown, Humboldt Park and Avondale. There are also areas of concentration of Hispanic-owned businesses in other Illinois cities such as Aurora, Waukegan, Joliet, Elgin, Peoria, Rock Island and Rockford.<p>

The top three industries of Hispanic-owned businesses are services, retail trade and construction. Growth was most brisk in transportation, construction, finance and services with a spectacular growth of small diversified businesses. Growth receipts also quintupled from $51 million to $268 million over the same period. This tremendous increase makes the Chicago market the fourth largest in the U.S. after Los Angeles, New York and Miami. During 1994 these 24 companies created 3,230 jobs and generated $258.53 million to the Illinois economy.<p>

As of 1987 census, there are approximately 12,000 + Hispanic firms registered in the state and their steady growth is anticipated in the coming years. As a newcomer to the economic mainstream, Hispanic firms face many problems and obstacles that require special business assistance. Recognizing the special problems associated with this emerging group, the Hispanic Business Advocate was established in the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' (DCCA) Office of Minority Business Development to serve as a liaison between minority business owners, organizations and the state to assist minority entrepreneurs who are starting or expanding their businesses in Illinois.<p>

The Illinois Hispanic Business Advocate, works closely with other components of DCCA's business service network including Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, International Trade Centers, NAFTA Opportunity Centers, the Office of Women's Business Development, Small Business Environmental Assistance and the First Stop Business Information Center to develop materials, approaches, policies and contacts which explain existing minority owned business assistance programs and direct these to targeted business groups and entrepreneurs.<p>

The basic goal of all labor-management committees is to improve communication between labor and management, resulting in improved labor-management relations.  Although the structure, goals and objectives of the individual committees may vary depending on the economic conditions of their particular geographic area, all provide a forum in which labor and management can increase communication and work cooperatively toward the betterment of the area.<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>A local Area Labor-Management Committee (ALMC)  serves a municipal, county or regional population and consists of a core advisory body composed of representatives from business, labor, government and/or the public.  The ALMC generally has a permanent office, paid professional staff and full or part-time clerical staff.<p>

<li>An Industry Labor-Management Committee generally consists of associations or coalitions of employers and labor organizations which are involved in the same industry.  Industry committees have been formed in the building and construction, retail food, coal, masonry, men's clothing and rail-road industries.
</ul>

With the growth of the area committee, many industry committees have been incorporated as special subcommittees of an area committee.<p>

<hr>
<img src="/dcca/graph/lm4.gif" alt="Typical Local Labor-Management Programs & Services" width=131 height=78 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=right>

<HR>

The Illinois Labor-Management Grant Program was established to promote labor-management relations and provide assistance in the development of local labor-management committees.<p>

General revenue funds are appropriated annually to the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) for the Illinois Labor-Management Grant Program to provide grants and other resources to establish and support area labor-management committees and other projects which enhance labor-management relations i the state, its regions, industries and worksites.  The Department, with the advice of the Labor-Management Cooperation Committee, awards grants or matching grants in four areas: (1) to existing local labor-management committees; (2) to developing local labor-management committees; (3) to develop and conduct specialized education and training programs of direct benefit to representatives of labor and management; and (4) for research and development projects related to labor-management issues.  The needs for education and training programs and research and development projects are determined and prioritized annually by the Department with the advice of the Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee.<p>


Types of Local Labor-Management Committees include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Industry Labor-Management Committees generally consisting of associations or coalitions of employers and labor organizations involved in the same industry;<p>
<li>Worksite or Plant Labor-Management Committees comprised of labor and management representatives with activities limited to a particular worksite or facility; and<p>
<li>Area Labor-Management Committees (ALMCs) consisting of a core advisory body composed of representatives from business, labor, government and/or the public, serving a municipal, county or regional population.<p>
</ul>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee makes the determination as to the allocation of funding to the specific grant categories and reviews all grant applications received by DCCA, providing recommendations to DCCA's Director for awarding of grants.<p>

During Program Year 1994 and 1995, the State Committee established priority focus areas for area labor-management committees (ALMCs) including:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Facilitate the adoption of worksite labor-management programs by Illinois   private and public sector employers and labor unions;<p>
<li>Increase ALMC programs and services directed toward small and   medium-sized manufacturing firms and public sector employers;<p>
<li>Provide important educational opportunities on major issues affecting the   labor and  management environment (i.e., workshops, seminars and training   sessions);<p>
<li>Develop and conduct programs in conjunction with local school districts to educate  students at all levels on the collective bargaining process and   importance of a labor-management cooperation in the workplace; and<p>
<li>Facilitate the negotiation of special construction project agreements between union building trades and contractor association, promoting the common goals of quality, craftsmanship, teamwork and cooperation within the union construction industry. In FY 1994 and FY 1995, DCCA awarded 23 labor-management grants to support cooperative labor-management programs in Illinois including: 19 existing local LMC grants; three developing local LMC grants; and one research and development project grant.<p>
</ul>

Typical programs and services provided by local committees funded under the Labor-Management Grant Program include: communication facilitation between labor and management assistance in maintaining the competitiveness of union contractors; program promoting job retention and skill training; information and assistance for displaced workers; assistance and participation in various economic development activities; educational workshops; specialized training programs; and technical assistance services to employer/employee organizations.<p>

A proven method to enhance the labor-management environment at the workplace is through implementation of cooperative program addressing issues such as worker safety, product and service quality, working conditions and overall labor relations.<p>

<hr>

<center><img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp3.gif" alt="Most Common types of Cooperative Programs" width=97 height=55></center>
<ul>
<li>Worksite Labor-Management Committees are flexible committees usually comprised of an equal number of labor and management members.  A committee contains both labor and management representatives and meets periodically to identify and discuss opportunities to improve production methods and resolve problems affecting both parties.<p>
<li>A worksite committee is a vehicle to increase communication.  It can provide an effective response to challenges facing the plant or worksite.<p>
<li>Employee Involvement Programs  seek to engage all employees in an effort with management to achieve goals such as product improvement, cost-cutting or some other goal.<p>
<li>Quality Circles involve 6-12 employees in regular meetings to discuss how to improve production techniques and the work environment.<p>
</ul>

A substantial proportion of Illinois firms utilize cooperative labor-management programs as part of the routine conduct of business.<p>

A LABOR-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP/COOPERATIVE WORKPLACE PROGRAM ENABLES LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TO WORK AS PARTNERS OR EQUALS IN RESOLVING PROBLEMS/ISSUES AND DEFINING THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE ORGANIZATION.<p>

<strong>What's in it for Labor?</strong><p>

1. Involvement in decision making.<p>
2. Improvement in communication and overall relationship.<p>
3. Access to organization information.<p>

<strong>What's in it for Management?</strong><p>

1. Productivity gains through efficient use of resources.<p>
2. Improved communication and unified access to all unions.<p>
3. Improved quality, decentralization and support in decision making.<p>

<hr>
<img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp4.gif" alt="Tips for Survival" width=100 height=61 align=right>
<ul>
<li>The leadership of both sides must want this procedure to be effective.
<li>Both parties must be genuinely open to working on a wide range of   problems.
<li>Channels of communication should always be kept open.
<li>Both parties must report back to their respective group the problems   considered at meeting and how issues ate to be resolved.
<li>The parties jointly own the partnership and are responsible for making it   work.
<li>Success requires a willingness to listen to the opposite side.
<li>Parties must concentrate on the problems at hand instead of past   differences.
</ul>

<hr>
<img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp5.gif" alt="Labor-Management Partnerships" width=104 height=61 align=left vpsacw=5 hspace=10>

A means of increasing both communication and understanding between labor and management is to establish labor-management partnerships.<p> 

These partnerships, composed of key leaders chosen by both labor and management, first discuss the concepts and expectations of a joint labor and management partnership.<p>

The establishment of a labor-management committee is an important step in implementing a workplace program.  The focus of these programs often is on quality of work life, human resource utilization, safety, productivity and quality improvement.<p>

Structurally, these efforts vary significantly.  Some are operated by a steering group with satellite participation teams, and some are confined to the shop floor.<p>

Participants in joint labor-management efforts report that when labor and management tackle problems together, not only are they more successful in solving their problems, but the solutions are more widely and readily accepted by all.<p>

It is important that the parties realize that this is only the first step, and they should dedicate themselves to working hard to make this  procedure work.<p>

Ethanol Demonstration Program<br>
Ethanol Powered Heavy Truck Fleet Program
</h3>
<hr>
<h3>About the Program</h3>

Recognizing the need to improve air quality in our cities, the State of Illinois has become a leader in the testing of ethanol as a viable alternative transportation fuel.  In October 1988, the President signed the Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988 (AMFA), the purpose of which is to encourage  the use and production of alternative fuel light-duty vehicles, urban transit buses and heavy-duty trucks.  Also, in 1990, the Clean Air Act (CAA) was signed into law imposing new emissions standards for transportation vehicles.  In response to these Acts, the State of Illinois, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, has developed a test and demonstration program involving the nation's first ethanol-fueled heavy-duty, over the road truck fleet to meet the 1994 emission standards.  The fleet is made up of four ethanol trucks which are owned and operated by Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur.  In addition, ADM is operating one conventional diesel, identical to the other trucks, as a control vehicle for the study.  The trucks will initially be driven only on short runs, returning to Decatur every night.  Eventually, however, they will be used for interstate driving to Iowa and Missouri, and will be refueled at ADM terminals in those states.  The heavy trucks are expected to receive high hours of usage and high mileage-it is estimated that they will be driven up to 150,000 miles per year, mostly over interstate highways.  This amount of use will provide valuable information on the performance and reliability of ethanol engines in commercial fleets.<p>

<h3>The Vehicles</h3>

The trucks being used for this demonstration are 1992 White GMC model WIM64T dual-tandem tractors.  They contain Detroit Diesel Corporation 6V-92 engines designed to run on ethanol fuel.  The 6V-92 is a vee-configuration, 6 cylinder engine rated at 300 horsepower.  They are "dedicated" engines, which means they can only run on E-95 fuel.  E-95 is composed of 95% anhydrous ethanol with a 5% denaturant required by law.  (This is the same ethanol blended 10% with unleaded gasoline.)  The trucks also contain several specialized features not found in a conventional diesel engine.  These include an advanced electronic control system, modified fuel injectors, redesigned glow plugs (to enhance engine startup), and a catalytic converter.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Vehicle Testing Program</h3>

One of the primary purposes of this project is to evaluate ethanol's role in meeting the emissions standards of the Clean Air Act.  Under the Clean Air Act, new regulations, effective in 1994, have been established for emissions from heavy-duty truck engines.  Laboratory emissions test, performed by Detroit Diesel Corporation, on the DDC 6V-92 ethanol engines show results that are lower than the levels required by the 1994 regulations.  Through this project, it is hoped that emissions levels measured from heavy truck engines operating under normal conditions will confirm the laboratory results.<p>

The ADM trucks will undergo extensive testing throughout the three-year period.  A transportable emissions testing laboratory from he University of West Virginia will be used to measure the total hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and aldehydes emitted by the trucks.  In addition, a DDEC II electronic monitoring system will be plugged into the computer of the truck to provide a computerized readout of the total hours driven and miles per gallon.  Driver of the trucks will also be asked to report about the trucks' driveability, reliability, performance, and any problems they may experience iwht the vehicles.  Finally, at the end of the program, the Detroit Diesel Corporation will perform a complete engine teardown and wear analysis of the truck engine to further evaluate the effects of ethanol as a motor fuel.<p>

<h3>Ethanol Fuel</h3>

The Unites States currently imports about 50% of the petroleum we use for fuel every day.  Ethanol is a clean burning, renewable American fuel made from of corn.  Corn is a crop grown in abundance in the Midwest-Illinois alone harvests over 1.3 billion bushels each year.  Each bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol, but only the starch from the corn is used to make the ethanol, leaving a high protein livestock feed and other valuable co-products.  In addition to ethanol, a bushel of corn yields 1.5 pounds of corn oil, 12.4 pounds of 21% protein feed, 3 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 17 pounds of carbon dioxide (used for carbonating beverages).  Illinois produces about 500 million gallons of ethanol annually, more than any other state in the nation; therefore, it makes sense for us to use our own "homegrown" fuel.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Benefits of Ethanol to Illinois</h3>

<ul type=square>
<li>Environmental<p>

Unlike the fossil fuels it is replacing, ethanol does not add carbon to the atmosphere, and so does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.  Growing corn used carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis and emits oxygen to the atmosphere.  Using corn-derived ethanol as a transportation fuel, then, simply recycles the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere where it started.  Furthermore, ethanol is an oxygenate-an octane enhancer which contains oxygen content of the fuel, causing gasoline blended with 10% ethanol to burn cleaner and emit an average of 20% less carbon monoxide than does unblended gasoline.<p>


<li>Economic<p>

The ethanol industry currently has over $1 billion in capital invested in Illinois and provides over 800 industry jobs as well as 4,000 additional jobs in industry related services throughout the state.  It has been estimated that 2,200 jobs are created for each 100 million bushels of corn used to produce ethanol.  Illinois farmers also benefit form the ethanol industry because it services as a market for surplus corn and helps support grain prices.<p>

Illinois uses more ethanol to substitute for gasoline than any other state in the nation.  Consumer acceptance of gasoline blended with 10% ethanol is steadily growing, and over 30% of all gasoline currently sold in Illinois contains 10% ethanol.<p>

In addition to the heavy-duty ethanol truck fleet, Illinois is also sponsoring demonstrations of ethanol-fueled mass transit buses in Peoria and a fleet of 12 ethanol-fueled cars operating in Chicago and Springfield.  Other projects are also being planned, all of which will help to evaluate the role of ethanol as a viable alternative transportation fuel for the future.<p>

In testing these ethanol vehicles, Illinois is taking a strong stand in support of cleaner environment and promoting domestic sources of energy.<p>

<img src="../../graph/enr/bus.jpg" width=256 height=173 align=right>
<h3>About the Program</h3>

The State of Illinois is dedicated to improving air quality in our urban areas, and has begun several efforts to make this possible.  These efforts include the testing of ethanol as an alternative to gasoline and diesel in meeting transportation fuel needs of the future.  One of these projects is being conducted by the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District (GPMTD).  The project consists of 14 ethanol-powered buses which will be operating throughout Peoria and represents the first and largest project test and demonstration of dedicated ethanol engines in urban transit buses in the country.<p>

in October 1988, the Alternative Motors Fuels Act (AMFA) was signed into law in order to encourage the sue and production of alternative fuel light-duty vehicles, urban transit buses, and heavy-duty trucks.  Also, in 1990, the Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed establishing new emissions standards for all transportation vehicles in this country.  The Peoria Ethanol Bus Project si designed a s a response to AMFA and CAA by being on the first program in American to test the effectiveness of factory produced ethanol engines in meeting emissions standards of the future.<p>

<img src="../../graph/enr/vehicles.jpg" width=253 height=154 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=left>
<h3>The Vehicles</h3>

The Peoria bus fleet is operating 14 dedicated ethanol engines developed by the Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC).  The ethanol engines used in this project are modified versions of conventional DDC 6v-92 diesel engines, which are electronically-controlled, six cylinder, vee-configuration engines that can produce up to 350 horsepower.  The changes to the engines include modifications to the electronic control systems, fuel injectors and glow plugs (to make starting easier).  Three identical buses with diesel 6V-92 engines are also being operated as control vehicles for the program.  The 6V-92 ethanol engines used in the Peoria buses are rated at 253 horsepower, identical to the horsepower produced by the diesel engines.  The buses were manufactured by Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC) in Roswell, New Mexico.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Vehicles Testing Program</h3>

 One of the main objectives of this program is to evaluate ethanol's role as an alternative fuel in meeting the vehicle emissions standards of the future.  Therefore, the buses will undergo complete emissions testing to determine whether the ethanol engines meet the emissions requirements of the Clean Air Act.  The U.S. DOE/University of West Virginia Portable Heavy-Duty Chassis Dynamometer facility will perform most of the emissions tests for the program.  Emissions form the ethanol engines and a control diesel engine will be monitored for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbon, and aldehyde levels.  A second objective is to evaluate the performance and reliability of the ethanol engines.  An engine teardown for wear analysis will be performed at the end of the program.  Bradley University will conduct survey of the drivers, riders and the general public before and after implementation of the program.  The third objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with operating urban transit buses on ethanol fuel.<p>

</h3>


The Illinois Solid Waste Management Act (415ILCS 20/1 et seq.) authorizes the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to promote alternative means of managing solid waste with the goal of reducing reliance on land disposal.<p>

Through the Bureaus of Energy and Recycling, DCCA has established an array of programs to provide funding to qualified applicants for project directly related to the goals of the Solid Waste Management Act.  All programs, except the Used Tire Recovery Program, are funded with DCCA's share of the $0.45 per cubic yard tipping fee surcharge imposed on all municipal waste landfilled in Illinois.  The Used Tire Recovery Program is funded with DCCA's share of the $1.00 surcharge on he sale of each new tire in Illinois.  These programs encourage the implementation of waste reduction, recycling, energy recovery, and composting methods as alternative to conventional landfill disposal.  The goals of these DCCA programs and services are to divert large volumes of waste from landfills or incinerator disposal and to foster recycling endeavors in Illinois.<p>

Illinois is at the center of a Midwest economic renaissance spurred by many factors, including a state government that has been friendlier to business than any in 20 years.  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is leading the charge, helping companies find locations for their next expansion or location, unraveling red tape, training our productive workers, fostering the growth of small businesses, promoting environmentally-sound practices and helping improve quality of life through partnerships with local government to address infrastructure and human service needs.<p>

Over the past year, DCCA has received record numbers of inquiries from companies interested in expanding or locating in Illinois.  From ALCOA to Zenith, businesses are choosing Illinois for their major projects.  In fact, Industry Week magazine readers ranked Illinois first in the Midwest as the preferred destination for industry relocation. <p>

DCCA's web site is designed to provide you with a comprehensive look at the agency's many programs and services to promote economic development.  I invite you to investigate.  You can also access the <a href="http://www.state.il.us">State of Illinois home page</a> for more information about our great state.<p>

International Trade Centers (ITC) provide assistance to the new-to-export small businesses in Illinois. Two ITCs also serve as NAFTA Opportunity Centers (NOC), available thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NOCs are specialized resource centers available to current and potential exporters and business assistance providers. NOCs provide information and assistance on export opportunities in Mexico and Canada now.<p>

ITC/NOC services include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>international market resource data to evaluate key overseas opportunities<p>
<li>identification of potential foreign buyers, agents and/or distributors through trade leads<p>
<li>information and training programs on export procedures, distribution, methods of payment and foreign business practices<p>
<li>an extensive collection of international trade reference materials<p>
<li>access to the Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs' International Business Division<p>
</ul>

The strength of the ITCs and NOCs is the link between the rest of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network and the Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs' International Business Division. This link allows firms to receive a variety of export programs and services through a three-level export infrastructure comprised of local, state and overseas resources.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS IS SERIOUS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h3>

South African International Trade Exposition, SAITEX `96 (Made in USA `96)<br>
Johannesburg, South Africa<br>
October 22-26, 1996<p>

South Africa is one of the world's dozen or so "Big Emerging Markets" U.S./Illinois firms are turning to. For years, apartheid kept U.S. companies out of South Africa, but political reform and the promise of political stability are quickly turning the once-taboo nation into a hot market.<p>

The United States now ranks as South Africa's leading trading partner. More than 300 U.S. companies have made significant investments in South Africa since the lifting of the U.S. sanctions. The two nations launched a commission to foster improved business relations in March of  1994. In 1995, Illinois exports to South Africa grew 44.3% over the previous year. This growth earned South Africa's place as one of the top 25 countries receiving Illinois exports.<p>

After experiencing a successful promotion in South Africa's 1995 Made in USA exposition, Illinois' DCCA International Business Division elected to return in 1996 with an even larger group of Illinois companies. A contingent of 48 Illinois firms will receive exposure to the South African market at this event. This is the largest U.S. export trade promotion event in South Africa where more export leads are generated in five days than most companies see in a year.<p>


SAITEX `96 (Made in USA 96) success is largely due to a U.S. Department of Commerce grant provided to DCCA's International Business Division, which in effect helped defray partial booth costs for participating Illinois companies. This program is presented as part of the "Illinois Export Partnership for Big Emerging Markets and Sectors Project" and has proved to be a very cost effective means for penetrating one of the world's "Big Emerging Markets".<p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS TRADE FORECAST - OUTLOOK 1997</h3>

Illinois' export growth continues to outpace the nation as a whole. In 1995, Illinois exports increased to $32.6 billion, representing a 23.6 percent increase over the previous year, and placing Illinois ahead of the national growth rate of 13.8 percent. This growth is expected to continue for a variety of reasons, most important being Illinois' ability to supply products to the world's most active and growing economies in key country development sectors. These sectors encompass core materials-industrial and capital goods that are essential to building the infrastructure of the world's developing nations. One trend is clear: Companies that make the leap into export are growing faster than others.<p>

Exports from Illinois surged 23.6 percent in 1995 to $32.6 billion. Illinois export figures have a proven track record for being competitive and Illinois export growth was double the national average in 1995. The type of products and services that Illinois is sending abroad provides the key to Illinois' future export growth. More than 70 percent of Illinois' exports are in high-technology sectors such as electronics, computers, and transportation equipment. Illinois' export growth in 1995 in electronics (41.7 percent) and industrial equipment (15 percent) remained strong and is predicted to grow throughout 1996. In fact, Illinois' growth in the electronics and other high tech sectors nearly doubled that of the national average in 1995. As the global market continues to modernize, Illinois' competitive advantage in those and other high-tech industries will continue to be tapped, increasing the number of value-added jobs in the state. Simply defined: Illinois' success in exporting comes from producing high-quality products, mainly capital goods, for the highly competitive world marketplace.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Exports are a Vital Component of our State's Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li>	One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent on exporting; one in four in the manufacturing sector. As of 1995, it is estimated that more than 625,300 Illinois residents are employed by jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.
<li>Every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 of state tax revenue.
<li>Export related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois. Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, exceed the U.S. average by 24 percent.
<li>Illinois ranked 5th in the nation among the top ten exporting states in 1995; this is the second consecutive year that Illinois has improved its ranking. Illinois export growth is evidenced by double digit export increases in 1993, 1994, and 1995: 24.6 percent, 20.2 percent and 23.6 percent respectively. 
<li>Illinois exports reached an all-time high of $32.6 billion in 1995, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1994 and nearly double the 13.8 percent increase of all U.S. exports for the same period 
<li>Exporting companies pay employees more than plants that produce only for domestic consumption.
<li>Worker productivity at exporting companies is 30 to 50 percent higher than that of non exporters.
<li>Innovation is stronger at exporting companies. Exporters adopt new technologies far more frequently than non exporters and report more significant benefits from doing so. This tendency is especially strong in fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and transportation equipment-key industrial sectors in Illinois
<li>Exporting companies tend to be larger than others, on average four times as large in employment and six times as large in sales.
<li>Sales per employee tend to be 50 percent greater in exporting companies than in non exporting companies.
<li>Value added per employee is up to 33 percent greater in exporting plants than in non exporters.
</ul>

<h3>Illinois' Global Future:  The Underlying Structure</h3>

Some of the factors that account for a positive global outlook for Illinois and those relating to Illinois' continued status as an export driven economy are the fact that:<p>

1)	Illinois exports less of its gross product than the U.S. as a whole, indicating that opportunities for increased exports will continue to exist over the long haul.<p>

2)	The world market is four times larger than the U.S. market, and is predicted to grow as much as 40 percent faster than the U.S. market through the year 2000. The industrial centers and targeted industries within Big Emerging Markets (markets that will account for the overwhelming incremental growth in world imports over the next decade) are predicted to grow even faster.  Illinois already has a strong track record in many of the world's most explosive markets, indicating even greater economies of scale are expected from Illinois firms exporting to those rapidly growing economies.<p>

3)	Illinois produces what the world's most rapidly growing economies need- industrial machinery, telecommunications equipment, electronics, financial services, and products related to the needs of basic economic development. In other words, the products and services need to build a strong infrastructure and economy.<p>

The following are some market trends to watch throughout 1996 and 1997:<p>

Big Emerging Markets: What Are They and Where are They?<p>

Big Emerging Markets or BEMs are the markets that will double their share of world imports (and imports of Illinois products), rising 38 percent by 2010. No other category of market shows such dramatic growth potential.<p>

The BEM markets provide overwhelming opportunities for Illinois exports. While the markets of Europe and Japan continue to be among the top 10 trading partners for Illinois firms, current trends demonstrate slower growth in these traditional markets than in the BEMs. Most of the BEMs now rank among Illinois' top 10 trading partners, and are at least among the top 25 world markets for Illinois products.<p>

The BEMs are unlike Illinois' more traditional trading partners, such as Japan, Great Britain or Germany. There are frequently still trade barriers to entering those markets, and full respect for commercial systems are often still developing or lacking altogether. The nature of competition we face in these market is dramatically different from prior experience and they have economies that are growing twice as fast as the rest of the world.<p>


<h4>The Big Emerging Markets</h4>

The Chinese Economic Area (China,Hong Kong and Taiwan)<br>
South Korea<br>
The Association of' Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN<br>
India<br>
Mexico<br>
South Africa<br>
Brazil<br>
Poland<br>
Argentina<br>
Turkey<br>

<hr>
<h3>Look for Growth In Major Trading Blocks such as ASEAN</h3>

There are six countries whose combined GDP is likely to reach $1.1 trillion in little over a decade. And by that time, U.S. exports to the region where these countries are found will probably equal or exceed exports to China or Japan. The ASEAN region-consisting of Brunei, Indonesia Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam-has become one of the most dynamic economic areas of the world. The reasons: rapid growth, expanding purchasing power and falling trade barriers.<p>

Growth, and the problems it creates, is generating extraordinary opportunities through out Southeast Asia. Increased demand for and expenditure on quality housing, environmental concerns and health care-generating new markets for technologies are emerging along with regional economic success. Breakneck growth is straining every kind of infrastructure, creating what is perhaps the best single market for Illinois goods and services.<p>

<h3>Export Tips</h3>
<h4>EXPORTERS BEWARE</h4>

The following contribution is provided by LaSalle's Foreign Exchange Department.<p>

As the world moves toward a true global economy, U.S. exporters need to rethink their U.S. dollar invoicing strategy.<p>

When exporters strictly invoice in U.S. dollars they may think that they do not have foreign exchange risks. This is not true.<p>

By invoicing in U.S. dollars, U.S. exporters do not bear actual conversion risk but are susceptible to movements in exchange rates. As the U.S. dollar increases in value vis a vis foreign currencies, U.S. goods become more expensive abroad.<p>

The following is an example of what can happen: Let's assume the U.S. dollar/deutsche mark exchange rate is 1.54-this means that the German customer will need to give up 1.54 deutsche marks to purchase one dollar. If the exchange rate goes up to 1.60, the German customer needs to pay 1.60 marks to receive the same one dollar. The cost of doing business with a U.S. exporter just increased by almost 4%. If the German customer can find another supplier with the same or similar product that is willing to price goods in deutsche marks, the U.S. supplier will most likely lose the business.<p>

The majority of U.S. exporters still invoice in U.S. dollars. In order to maintain a competitive position in the global market, you should come aware of the advantages and disadvantages of local currency invoicing.<p>

To learn more about local currency invoicing and how to manage foreign exchange exposure, please contact Camille Rudge, Vice President and Foreign Exchange Manager, at (312) 904-2827.<p>

<h3>Rethinking Our Approach to International Trade: Big Emerging Markets</h3>

During the last decade, Americans have been forced to rethink their approach to international trade. This is because many markets that were formally closed to importing and exporting are now viable markets and "open for business" on an international level.<p>

Big Emerging Markets or "BEMs" are the markets that will account for the overwhelming incremental growth in world imports over the next 20 years.<p>

Looking toward the next century, the engines of economic growth will be found in fewer than a dozen regions of the world. The "BEMs" are:  in Asia-the Chinese Economic Area (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan), South Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), initially Indonesia, then expanded to include all the ASEAN economies (Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Viet Nam), and India; in Africa - South Africa; in Europe - Poland and Turkey; and in Latin America - Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.<p>

The BEMs are unlike our more tradition trading partners, such as Japan, Great Britain or Germany. There are frequently still barriers to entering these markets, including high tariffs, quotas and protectionist regulatory restrictions. Commercial systems, including full respect for intellectual property rights, are often still developing or lacking altogether. In some of the BEMs, impartial legal systems also are missing. The nature of competition we face in these markets is dramatically different from prior experience.<p>

Still, the BEMs continue to provide overwhelming opportunity for exporters. While the markets of Europe and Japan continue to be top ten trading partners for Illinois firms, current trends demonstrate slower growth in these markets than a good deal of the rest of the world.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Why are Big Emerging Markets so Important to Illinois?</h3>

Illinois exports to many of the Big Emerging Markets have already shown extraordinary growth. For instance, between 1992 and 1993, Illinois exports to China increased 239 percent. China is now Illinois' sixth largest trading partner. In 1995, Illinois exports to Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong grew an average of 83 percent. Exports to Indonesia and Malaysia grew a whopping 101 percent and 140 percent last year. In fact, exports to almost all of the ASEAN nations exhibited double digit growth.<p>

Illinois exports to Turkey increased 85 percent; exports to Poland increased 36 percent and exports to many countries in Africa increased their imports from Illinois as much as 100 percent.<p>

There is no doubt that these Big Emerging Markets are Illinois' fastest growing markets. BEMs will provide the greatest amount of export opportunity in the near future. Companies that develop an export action plan in accordance with these markets will remain competitive in the long term. A BEM strategy should be part of any company's export strategy and will help Illinois firms to maximize their competitive advantage over the long haul. Now is the time to be considering and scrutinizing these critical regions of the world.<p>

<hr>
<h3>The Economic Stakes</h3>

by Margaret MacLean, Managing Director, International Business Division<p>

Earlier this year, every newspaper in America ran daily stories chronicling the state of America negotiations with Chinese officials concerning illegal trade in pirated compact discs and computer software. Why? Because the issue is central both to the future well-being of hundreds of thousands of American workers and to our prospects in a market of 1.2 billion consumers with a voracious appetite for information products.<p>

Economic stakes in the BEMs are enormous. The ten BEMs as a group are importing about as much merchandise form the U.S. as Japan and the European Union combined. In fact, during the period 1990-2010, the BEMs could account for at least $1 trillion incremental U.S. exports.<p>

<h3>1996 Governor's Export Awards</h3>

Lt. Governor Kustra and Director Dennis Whetstone announced the winners of the 1996 Governor's Export Awards at the 2nd annual "Crossing International Borders Conference" held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers on May 16, 1996.  The awards were presented in three categories, New to Export, Continuing Export Excellence, and Export Awareness and Development. In addition, the Community Service Recognition category was added as a new award this year.<p>

Companies were judged on the basis of percentage of export sales of total company sales, percentage of growth in export sales, size of export workforce and distinguishing features regarding international marketing strategies. Organizations were reviewed on the basis of regular educational outreach to the international community.<p>

Four winners in the New to Export category were:<p>

<h3>Export Tips</h3>

ATA Carnet, "The Merchandise Passport" is an internationally recognized customs document that allows exporters to avoid duties and taxes on temporary imports, thereby reducing the cost of doing business internationally.

<ul>
<li>NOT paying duties and taxes (VAT is a minimum of 15% in Europe).<p>

<li>NOT purchasing a temporary import bond.<p>

<li>NOT registering the goods upon departure from the United States.<p>

<li>USE ON MORE THAN ONE TRIP:  ATA Carnets are valid for up to one year and may be used for  multiple exits from and entries into
the United States and foreign countries.<p>

<li>COVERAGE OF MOST BUSINESS RELATED ITEMS:  Display booths, which are subject to duty, may  travel on Carnet.<p>

<li>PRE-DETERMINED COSTS:  Charges associated with the Carnet are paid before departure.<p>

<li>ACCEPTANCE IN OVER 50 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES: Thailand has recently joined the system  and China is expected to begin accepting Carnets later this year.<p>
</ul>

<h3>SEPTEMBER 1995 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ASIA MISSION SUMMARY</h3>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs International Business Division represented 12 companies in New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea and Japan in September 1995. A variety of small and mid-size manufacturers participated which provided a range of products and technologies to promote on site at each country stop. Laboratory optics, x-ray equipment, biohazard waste, emergency care, surgical tools, and products for the handicapped exemplify the diversity of the exhibition. The mission, referred to as Medical Equipment Asia, generated 546 sales leads for the group of Illinois firms and was a success for all involved.<p>

Prior to departing on the Mission, invitations were sent to major hospital groups and pre-screened companies in the medical/scientific fields from the active database files of the International Business Division's Hong Kong and North Asia/Tokyo offices. This promotional campaign initiated enormous interest among the medical communities at each stop. Some companies have already identified serious distributors for their products and several companies are following up on immediate sales opportunities. All of the Illinois companies realize that there is a market in Asia for their products. The mission provided the directive and contacts necessary to begin entry into Asia's most dynamic markets. In addition, mission participants were educated on the process of doing business in the Pacific Rim and collected valuable data for long term market strategies. With a little patience, perseverance and preparation all of them will be able to determine a road to success.<p>

Why Asia? Asia is the fastest growing region in the world for medical equipment and supplies. By the year 2000, the economies of East Asia, from Japan to Malaysia, will almost equal that of the United States. As purchasing power is boosted by swift economic growth, Asians are demanding more and better medical care. The quantity of simple and sophisticated medical goods required to meet this demand provides a serious opportunity for Illinois medical device companies. Sales of quality medical devices are expected to increase to keep pace with more affluent lifestyles and aging populations.<p>

Entering the markets of the Far East can be intimidating at first, but it is impossible to ignore the vast amount of opportunity and the demands for high end medical care. Moving into the future, the companies that develop a long term commitment to the Asian marketplace will reap significant benefits. If conservative assumptions about GNP growth hold true, the East Asian economy will surpass $6 trillion by the year 2000. By the year 2000, less than five percent of the population of East Asia will be classified below the poverty line. One billion Asians will live in households with consumer spending power, and over 400 million of them will be as rich as their western counterparts. Asia is simply too vast a market to ignore.<p>

<center><h4>January 8, 1996 - Press Release from the Office of the Governor-Springfield, Illinois </h4></center>

<h3>DCCA RECEIVES GRANT FOR EXPORT DEVELOPMENT</h3>

Governor Edgar announced that the state has been awarded a $450,000 grant by the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development. "Exporting is one of Illinois' greatest economic strengths," the Governor said. "We manufacture products that are in demand in the global marketplace, and one in eight Illinois jobs is dependant on exporting. It is crucial that Illinois continues to expand and explore markets which have untapped potential. This grant will help Illinois businesses identify those markets and sell their products in foreign markets that are emerging as significant trading partners with our state." <p>

The grant awarded to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs is one of only eight Market Development Cooperator Program competitive grants awarded this year by the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development. Lt. Governor Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the program DCCA will implement with the grant stresses the importance of cooperation. "This program is an intergovernmental private/public partnership," Kustra said. "The Illinois Manufacturers Association, the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce and The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce supported our proposal and will promote the services to be offered to their members and other interested companies. Small and medium size businesses, in particular, will benefit from the extensive assistance we will be able to provide with this grant."<p>

The program will assist Illinois firms in the targeted industries of environmental, health and information technologies. The markets to be targeted are China, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey.<p> 

Marketing Assistance will be offered at three levels:<p>

<ul>
<li><em>State Level</em> - Trade and Catalog shows for export ready companies will be organized by DCCA's International Buisness Division. The IBD is also responsible for the overall administration of the program.<p>
<li><em>Regional Level</em> - Seminars on market opportunities and exporting training for new-to-export and new-to-market companies will be provided by Illinois' four regional International Trade Centers, which are located in Glen Ellyn, Peoria, Champaign-Urbana and Edwardsville.<p>
<li><em>Local Level</em> - Electronic database development for trade show recruitment and follow-up matching for new-to-export and export ready companies in Chicago will be provided by the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development Office of International Affairs.<p>
</ul>

<h3>1996 GOVERNOR'S EXPORT AWARDS</h3>

Acknowledging exports as a vital component of the Illinois economy is an important factor for continued economic growth. The Governor's Export Awards were created to recognize and encourage small and medium sized Illinois exporters as well as organizations which work to promote export awareness for Illinois products. Signed into law (Senate Bill 269) by Governor Jim Edgar in 1993, the Governor's Export Award program is designed to highlight the significance of Illinois in the world marketplace. <p>

Currently in its third year, DCCA is administering the awards program as part of the agency's overall strategy to promote business expansion into global markets. Small and mid-size enterprises were responsible for more than one-third of total merchandise exports in 1994 and play a crucial role in driving the next generation of U.S. jobs. Companies that are competing to overcome the "export gap" should apply for this prestigous award. Deadline for application is March 29, 1996; and presentation of the Awards will take place on May 16, 1996, at the Crossing International Borders Annual Conference. The conference is jointly sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division and Arthur Andersen and will be held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers.<p>

Awards will be given for outstanding achievement in global competition in the following three categories:<p>

1)  New to Export (honoring companies that have successfully exported Illinois products for one to five years); <p> 

2) Continuing Exporting Excellence (honoring companies that have successfully exported for more than five years); and<p> 

3)  Export Awareness and Development (honoring not-for-profit organizations involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export awareness).<p>

Winners are selected each year by the Governor's Export Award Review committee comprised of a representative for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and Illinois based trade organizations and firms experienced in international business. Applications will be judged on export sales as a percentage of total company sales, growth of export sales, number of employees involved in export sales, and distinct factors indicating progressive international marketing strategies.<p>

For information on obtaining a Governor's Export Award application or for information regarding the Crossing International Borders Conference to be held on May 16, 1996, at the Chicago Hilton and Towers, please contact Patty Makropoulos of the International Business Division at 312/814-5713; TDD, 800/419-0667.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Global Access from Illinois</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Illinois has long known the importance of international trade.  
Illinois created its International Business Division, housed at the 
Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, in 1965 and  was among the 
first states to open an international trade office when it opened a 
facility in Brussels, Belgium in 1968. Today the state helps businesses 
pursue international opportunities from offices in Brussels, Tokyo, Hong 
Kong, Mexico City, Warsaw and Budapest, as well as through trade leads, 
participation in trade shows, catalog shows and trade missions.  In 
addition, the International Business Division, headquartered in Chicago, 
oversees a network of International Trade Centers in five locations around 
the state to help smaller Illinois businesses achieve success in the global 
marketplace.<P>

International markets play a critical role in the Illinois economy.  
International powerhouses such as Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Company, Archer 
Daniels Midland and Motorola are headquartered in Illinois, helping to make 
Illinois the fifth largest exporting state in the nation, seventh in 
manufactured exports and second in agricultural shipments.  Exports of 
agricultural products and manufactured goods from Illinois in 1994 were 
estimated at more than $26.4 billion.  Nearly 500,000 Illinois jobs are 
linked to exports and nearly 236,000 Illinois workers are employed by 
foreign-owned firms.<P>

Illinois is home to O'Hare International Airport, the world's 
busiest, which is served by all of the major international carriers.  
Thirteen port districts are located in the state, offering companies direct 
links to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.  Foreign trade zones, 
which offer low-cost production and warehousing facilities for imported and 
export-bound products, are located at the Illinois International Port 
District in Chicago, the Tri-City Regional Port District near St. Louis, 
and in Peoria, Rockford, the Quad Cities and Lawrenceville.<P>

More than 150 export managing/trading companies and more than 100 
international freight forwarders and custom house brokers maintain offices 
in Illinois.  At least 60 foreign governments have representatives in 
Illinois and 59 nations maintain consulates in the state.<P>

Seventy international banks have established branches or 
representative offices in Chicago.  The Illinois Export Financing 
Partnership, a joint effort between the Illinois Department of Commerce and 
Community Affairs and the Illinois Development Finance Authority, also 
helps small and medium-sized exporters by packaging loans for the Working 
Capital Guarantee Program through Eximbank, the independent U.S. government 
agency that facilitates the export financing of U.S. goods and services. <P>

<HR>

In order to provide Illinois companies with an improved system to receive international trade leads, DCCA's IBD has implemented a new technologically proficient system known as "ExPro" (Export Promotion Trade Management System).  ExPro is designed to facilitate the matching of companies with trade leads in order to deliver fresh leads in a more timely manner.<P>

Companies interested in this free service may request a Company Background Sheet form from the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs - International Business Division.  After the form has been completed, it may be returned, via fax or mail, to our office.  The form will require companies to provide their 6 digit Harmonized System (H.S. or Schedule B) Codes and their 4 digit SIC Codes for each product.  A foreign trade lead, specific to your industry, can then be matched and faxed directly to the company.  Harmonized System Codes may be obtained from either your company's shipping department, a freight forwarder/custom broker, or you can contact the U.S. Department of Commerce at 301/763-5200 or fax to 301/763-1109.<P>

Company specific information will be entered into our database and your company will be notified via fax of any trade lead matches as they occur. Our database is uploaded weekly via a computer clearinghouse to insure access to the most current trade lead information possible.  If you wish to participate in this program, please call DCCA's International Business Division at 312/814-7164; TDD, 312/419-0667, or send your request via fax to 312/814-6581, Attention: ExPro - Guang Yang.<P>

<P>Every partnership, corporation (including S corporations), and certain sole proprietors must have a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN). For a FEIN registration form and other tax information see <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">Internal Revenue Service</A> section on next page.

<A NAME="Sole"><HR></A>
<CENTER><H2>Sole Proprietorships and General Partnerships</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Contact your local county clerk's office for registration under the Assumed Name Act.  Sole proprietors must have FEINs if they: pay wages to one or more employees, or file any pension or excise tax returns including those of alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.

225 Illinois Compiled Statutes 345 (Water Use Act of 1983)
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Any business (such as golf courses, orchards, nurseries, crop production or any business using  large amounts of water) planning to drill a water well with an expected use of 100,000 gallons a day must notify the local Soil and Water Conservation District of its intent to be a substantial user of water.   In the counties of Kankakee, Tazwell, Iroquois, and McLean, businesses must register any new well.<P> 

In  emergencies (such as drought) the Department has authority to restrict groundwater withdrawals in those 4 counties.  Failure to notify the Soil and Water Conservation District of a proposed new point of withdrawal (a well), or any business failing to register a well in the 4 counties named above, or a business failing to restrict withdrawals if required to do so by the Department, is guilty of a petty offense.  If convicted more than once, violations become a Class C misdemeanor.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Notice to the local Soil and Water Conservation District Office of the intent to be a substantial user of water may be by phone or in writing, but must be given before  construction of  the well begins. The Soil and Water Conservation District then notifies the Illinois State Water Survey, which conducts an investigation to determine the impact the proposed groundwater withdrawal may have on other water users.  The conclusions of that investigation are published in a general circulation newspaper. The Soil and Water Conservation District informs any local units of government that might be affected by the proposed groundwater withdrawal.  The review must be completed within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A permit to drill a well is required by  Illinois EPA and Department of Public Health statutes. The drilling company normally complies with those requirements (although it is the responsibility of the business to be sure that they do) and to provide a "well log" to the State Water Survey.   The business must make pumping data available and allow the Department and/or Soil and  Water Conservation District employees access to private property to conduct investigations.

In order to be designated as a Qualified Solid Waste Energy Facility (QSWEF), electric generating facilities fueled by either methane gas from a landfill or from the incineration of solid waste must meet specific criteria.

The public utilities who purchase the electricity are entitled to tax credits equal to the difference between the amount paid for electricity and the amount that they would have otherwise been required to pay such facilities for electricity under the federal law (federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978). At the end of its contract, a QSWEF is required to begin repaying the State for the tax credits taken by the utility for purchasing its power.<P>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must file a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking a determination that the facility meets the criteria for QSWEF status. The Commission will hold a public hearing to determine whether the facility qualifies.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must be able to demonstrate compliance with the requirements for QSWEF status that are set forth in the Public Utilities Act and Local Solid Waste Disposal Act, and if QSWEF status is granted, file reports with the Illinois Commerce Commission demonstrating their continuing compliance with such requirements.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD>The purpose of EPCRA is to provide
information to the public that can help protect private citizens and
property against adverse effects of an inadvertent release of an extremely
hazardous substance into the environment and to minimize the likelihood of
such an occurrence. The Act requires businesses to file reports identifying
hazardous substances, chemical locations, chemical properties, etc., at
their facilities in amounts above established threshold quantities.  EPCRA
requires the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and the Local
Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to make these reports available to the
public upon request.  Because this information is accessible and useful, it
provides local citizens and local government officials an opportunity to
mitigate and prepare for any contingency involving a release of a hazardous
substance into the environment.  A business must notify immediately the
National Response Center, IEMA and the LEPC, and give pertinent information
about any inadvertent release of a hazardous substance into the environment
in reportable quantities.</DD></DL>

an extremely hazardous substance (as defined by the USEPA), must file with
the SERC and the LEPC an emergency planning notification and either a list
of  chemicals or Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), and an annual Hazardous
Chemical Inventory (Tier) report.

<P>2. Any facility with 10,000 pounds or more of a hazardous substance (as
defined by the USEPA) must file either a list of chemicals or a MSDS, and
an annual "Tier" report to the SERC, the LEPC and the local fire
department.

<P>3. Any facility that releases into the environment reportable quantity of
either an extremely hazardous or hazardous substance must report this
release immediately to the National Response Center, the SERC and the LEPC.
A written follow-up notice is also required to be filed with these agencies
as soon as practical after the initial notification.</DD>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD>The purpose of the ICSA is to establish an
orderly system to assure that owners and/or operators of business
facilities are adequately prepared to respond to a release of chemical
substances into the environment and to improve the ability of State and
local authorities to respond to such releases.  Businesses subject to ICSA
regulations are those assigned or included within the Standard Industrial
Classifications (SIC) named in the Act 430 ILCS 45/3.  The requirements of
Act also apply to businesses that are subject to the provisions of Section
302 of the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA) of 1986 and  use, store and/or manufacture a chemical substance in
a quantity that poses a threat to the environment or public health.  The
ICSA requires business owners/operators to prepare a written Chemical
Contingency Safety Plan (unless exempted by the statute), to maintain a
copy of it on the business site, and provide copies to the local emergency
response agencies.  These businesses must certify in writing to IEMA that a
Chemical Contingency Safety Plan has been developed and provided to the
local planning and response agencies and the dates that the plans were
delivered to local officials.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>

<DL><DD>None.  However, the IEMA may issue an exemption from
these requirements for chemical substances used or stored in innocuous
amounts that are not likely to result in a release that threatens the
environment or the public health.  Exemptions are issued on the basis of an
on site inspection of a facility.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>

<DL><DD>Requirements of the
ICSA apply to businesses with 5 or more full-time employees, or 20 or more
part-time employees, that is assigned any of the Standard Industrial
Classifications (SIC) codes listed in the Act.</DD>

  To hire an alien, an employer must demonstrate that no U.S.  workers are available, and that the employment of the alien will not adversely affect working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. 

As a first step in the U.S. Immigration process, an employer must file a Labor Certification request with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), the agent for the U.S. Department of Labor (IDOL).
Hiring an alien without  authorization subjects an employer to fines (and in some cases is a felony).

Application forms ETA 750 and ETA 750A must be completed and filed with the Illinois Department of Employment Security, Alien Labor Certification Unit.

The average processing time for applications is between 6 months and 1 year.

An employer must specify the job description, job hours, the prevailing wage and education requirements on Form ETA 750, and the alien's education and experience on Form ETA 750A.

The employer must post the position within his company, enter a job order into the Statewide Job Service system, and advertise the job in a publication identified by the Alien Certification Unit. The employer will be sent resumes of U.S. workers submitted through IDES and must interview qualified applicants.

If an employer fails to hire U.S. workers referred by IDES or any individuals submitting resumes, he/seh will be directed to document, in detail, why the U.S. worker had been rejected. IDES will follow-up with those applicants referred for their insight into the interview with the employer. If an employer fails to comply with the directives of IDES, the case will be referred directly to the U.S. Departmen of Labor Certifying Officer for a ruling, thereby delaying the hiring process. If the Labor Certification for an alien worker is not granted by the USDOL, the employer may appeal directly to the USDOL, Alien Labor Certification Unit.

<DL><DD>
Permits may be required of any business that has emission units (stationary equipment, operations and associated control systems) that have the potential to emit any regulated air pollutant (particulate matter, volatile organic material, and nitrogen oxide). Businesses usually required to have these permits are steel mills, manufacturing plants, electric utilities and chemical plants, as well as certain smaller businesses like hospitals, dry cleaners, grain terminals, print shops and electroplating shops. <P>

Construction Permits are required for the construction of new
emission units and modifications to existing units if those
changes increase emissions, and are valid for 1 year. <P>

Operating Permits  include four (4) types:  Smaller Source
Permit, State Operating Permit, Federally Enforceable State
Operating Permit (FESOP) and Clean Air Act Permit (CAAPP).  The
type of operating permit needed depends upon the amount of
regulated pollutants emitted and the geographical location of
the business and commonly are valid for 5 years. To determine
which Permit is needed, ask for "Does Your Business Need an Air
Pollution Control Permit?", from the Agency.<P>

If both are applied for at the same time, they both commonly are
valid for 5 years. Operating without a Permit may result in
fines.  Permit holders failing to comply with the Act are
subject to penalties that vary with the severity and duration of
their actions.<P>

Permit applications are reviewed by Agency engineers and are approved if the application shows that the emission units comply with all applicable air pollution control regulations. <P>

Applications can be denied if non-compliance is shown or if insufficient information is provided in the application. Permit denials can be appealed through the Pollution Control Board. <P>
</DD></DL>

<DL><DD><P>The purpose of the permit program is to
provide assurance that planning is provided for proper environmental
safeguards for the location, preparation, operation and abandonment of
mining, mining related activities and mine refuse disposal operations in
order to prevent pollution of waters within the state.  Mining and mining
related activities include the surface or underground extraction or
processing of natural deposits of coal by the use of any mechanical
operation or process.  The term mining also includes the recovery or
processing of coa from a mine refuse area.

<P>Related activities refers to all activities at a facility which are
directly in furtherance of mining, including activities before, during and
after mining.  Such related activities include but are not limited to coal
refuse disposal and coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal.  The term mining
related activities does not include land acquisition, exploratory drilling,
surveying and similar activities.  Also included in the Mine Pollution
Control Program permit process is coal transfer facilities and coal storage
yards (exluding consumer stockpiles) which is defined as any areas where
coal is transferred from one mode of transportation to another or where
coal is dumped, piled, stored or blended.

<P>Coal docks, blending yards, conveyor belts and pipelines are also included
herein.  Conducting Mining or Mine related activities without a permit is a
civiil penalty punishable by a fee of not more than $10,000/day that
violations are occuring.  The permit generally remains effective for a
period of 5 years at which time a renewal is required.  If a renewal
application is submitted at least 180 days prior to permit expiration, a
standard condition will allow the permit to remain effective until such
time as the renewal is addressed.</DD></DL>

case, the application to IDMM may be used as a joint application to the
IEPA, if so indicated.  All applications to the agency, whether a direct
submittal or submitted as a joint application to IDMM/IEPA, shall be
complete and include all items and requirements identified in Title 35,
Illinois Admin. Code, 405.104.

<P>All applications are reviewed by the IEPA for completeness, accuracy and
compliance with mine related environmental regulations.  Reasons for denial
of a permit from the IEPA -Mine Pollution Control Program would include any
proposed activity that threatens or allows the discharge of contaminants
into waters of the state.  Any permit denial can be appealed to the
Illinois Pollution Control Board.  The average processing time for a new
locations is generally quite timely and by comparison, shorter than for
renewals.</DD></DL>

<DL><DD>
A license, a permit and/or a certificate is required for projects that will cause a discharge into streams, wetlands or other bodies of water.  Federal permits are issued by the Corps of Engineers under the Dredge and Fill program.  Licenses are issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for hydroelectric power facilities.  Certificates issued by the Agency confirm that a proposed project may be constructed and operated in compliance with the applicable water quality standards established by the State.  Dredging, placement of fill, draining or other similar actions in streams, lakes, canals and adjacent wetlands must be authorized by the Corps of Engineers and the Agency under the Section 404 and 401 permit/certification program.  Causing a discharge into streams, wetlands and other bodies of water without the proper permit is subject to fines up to $50,000 plus $10,000 for each day the violation continues.  Permits remain effective until a project is completed.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file a "Protecting Illinois Waters" form including a description of the proposal and copies of plans and drawings of the project with the Corps of Engineers.  For projects requiring an individual permit, the Corps will issue a public notice jointly with the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Agency describing the project and offering the public an opportunity to comment and to request a hearing on the matter.  At the end of the public notice period the Agency will review all comments and evaluate the water quality aspects of the proposal.  If disputed issues arising from the impact of the proposed project and the public can be resolved, certification will be issued, usually within 30 days of the end of the public notice period.  The Corps usually acts within 3 to 6 months after an application is received.

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Permits are required to construct and operate a community public water
supply (CPWS) that serves 25 or more residents or that has 15 or more
residential service connections. (The Illinois Department of  Public Health
regulates smaller water supplies.)  A permit may be issued only to an owner
or official custodian in charge of the water supply.  The purpose of a
permit is to insure that installations, changes or additions to a CPWS do
not adversely affect the sanitary or mineral quality, or the adequacy of a
water supply.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>

<EM><STRONG>Construction Permit:</STRONG></EM> Applicants must submit an Application for Construction
Permit, together with construction drawings (bearing the seal of an
Illinois registered engineer or architect), specifications and an
engineer's design summary.  Applications are reviewed and approved by
Agency engineers if the proposed work will  not adversely affect the
sanitary or mineral quality and adequacy of the water supply. Law requires
the Agency to respond to applications for a permit within 90 days unless a
fee is required, in which case the Agency must respond in 45 days.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Operating Permits:</STRONG></EM> A permit to operate is required before improvements to
an existing water supply may be put in service.  The Agency provides the
required form at the time the construction permit is issued.  The official
custodian of the CPWS must sign the form and confirm that a certified
operator is responsible for the water supply system. The permit holder must
provide satisfactory water sample test results to the Agency.  Applications
are sometimes denied because a CPWS has reached it's expansion limit,
because of  technical flaws in the proposed construction, or because the
CPWS is in violation of a water quality standard.  If denied, an
application may be appealed to the Illinois Pollution Control Board.<P>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Owners and official custodians of CPWS must register with the Agency.  A
CPWS must be under operational control of a certified operator in
responsible charge of the water supply.  Owners/official custodians of a
CPWS are subject to monitoring and reporting requirements administered by
the Agency's Bureau of Water, Compliance Assurance Section.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Application fees for permits to construct,  install or extend water mains:<P>

From 200 to 1,000 feet = $120.<P> 
From 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet = $360.<P>
Over 5,000 feet = $600.<P>

Title 35, Illinois Administration Code, Parts 807.201-203, & 807.210.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A Development Permit authorizes the construction or installation of a "unit" (meaning any device, mechanism, equipment or area used for storage, treatment or disposal of waste, prior to September 18,1990).   An Operating Permit authorizes the use of a waste treatment, waste storage or waste disposal operation.  An Experimental Permit authorizes use of a process or technique that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in this Section when the applicant submits proof that the process or technique has a reasonable chance of success and the environmental hazards are minimal.<P>

A Supplemental Permit is the mechanism by which these permits are modified to reflect changes in the facility or regulations under which the facility operates.<P>

The permits apply to facilities that receive wastes from off-site.  Storage, treatment and disposal, within the site where such wastes are generated, are conditionally exempt from Permit requirements. However, the agency may require a Permit for these activities through enforcement proceedings if conditions warrant it.<P>

Conducting these activities without a permit may result in civil suits by the State's Attorney, the Attorney General's Office or any third party alleging violations of the Act.<P>

Development or Operating Permits don't expire. Experimental permits may be valid for up to 2 years. Landfill and composting permits are valid for up to 5 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Development Permit must file Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA3, LPC-PA8 and LPC-PA16. <P>

(For oil storage facilities, substitute Form LPC-PA13 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
(For "potentially infectious medical waste", substitute Form# LPC-PA17 in place of  LPC-PA3.) <P>

(For landfills, substitute LPC-PA2 instead of LPC-PA3.) (For composting, substitute LPC-PA6 instead of LPC-PA3.) <P>

For landscape waste composting, substitute LPC-PA12 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
Guidance is available for "land treatment of petroleum contaminated soils" and should be considered before submitting an application for that activity.  <P>

Applications for an Operating Permit must include Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA4 & LPC-PA16. Applications for an Experimental Permit require the same forms as a Development or Operating Permit, together with an explanation of the proposed experimental process and proof or reasons why the process should be allowed and why the process poses a minimal environmental threat..<P>

Applicants for Supplemental Permits must submit the forms appropriate for the type (i.e. development or operating or experimental) of permit being modified. <P>

The Agency has: 1) 90 days to reach a decision on solid waste permits (nonhazardous), but usually reaches a decision in 60 days; 2) 45 days for operating permits (where construction has been completed), but the Agency usually reaches a decision within 30 days. The review period for an existing landfill (which was not required to go through siting), and new landfills, will be 180 days.Permits for the management of non-hazardous solid waste (i.e., storage, treatment or disposal) of off-site generated wastes.<P>

The most common reasons Permit applications are denied is due to technical deficiencies such as not providing secondary containment around tanks and/or containers. <P>

If an application is denied, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Pollution Control. In the hearing the burden of proof is on the applicant. The denial may be resolved through negotiations with the agency before the Board holds the hearing. The negotiations may result in a revised permit.  <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Facilities managing waste received from an outside source must receive local siting approval before a Permit application may be filed with the Agency.<P>

Technical data, such as design drawings, specifications and engineering studies which accompany applications must be certified and sealed by a  professional engineer licensed to practice in Illinois.<P>

Facilities accepting nonhazardous special waste, must file an annual report with the Agency by February 1 of each year, specifying the quantities and disposition of the waste accepted during the previous year. <P>

Permits will usually specify inspection requirements, groundwater monitoring (in some instances), financial assurance for closure (for landfills) and soil testing (for remediation  of contaminated soils). <P>

A Permit authorizes activities including (but not limited to) deep well injection of hazardous-waste, other deep-well injection or shallow non-hazardous-waste disposal, biodremediation, injection of waste into underground formations, groundwater remediation projects and water recharge.<P>

A Permit is not required to apply nutrients onto the soil. Injecting fluid(s) without authorization by rule or a Permit, is subject to penalties including a jail term, and fines.

<H3>V. 	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must complete and file with the Agency an Inventory Report Form containing information that will allow the Agency to evaluate whether a Permit is required.  Applications to inject fluids into the ground from a Class V well must include a "Class V Inventory Form". Upon receipt of the Inventory Form, the Agency will determine if a Permit is necessary. If a Permit is not necessary, the operation is authorized by rule.  If a Permit is required, applicants must submit an "Underground Injection Control Permit Application Form" to the Agency. The average processing time for the "Underground Injection Control Permit Application Form" is 90 days for existing facilities and 180 days for new facilities. Denials are usually the result of technical deficiencies in the application. Denied applications may be appealed to the Agency.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. 	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>

A permit may be required from IEPA's Bureau of Water, Bureau of Air, LUST Section (Leaking Underground Storage Tanks) or RCRA Unit (Resource Conservation Recovery Act). Inventory forms must be updated whenever the well changes. Permitees are required to seal the well.

A permit is required to breed, hatch, propagate or raise aquatic life species including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, mussels, clams, gastropods, fish and aquatic plants.  

Permits are issued for one year, and are valid from February 1 of the year issued and expire the following January 31.
</DD></DL><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:</H3>
                           <DL><DD>
A permit will be issued by the Department upon receipt of a completed and signed Application for Aquaculture Permit, together with the necessary fees.  

Applications require approval by a Department biologist, which includes an inspection of proposed facilities if an application involves a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  

Applications may be denied (or consideration of an application may be postponed) if applicant has not provided sufficient information regarding risks associated with a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  In such instances, applicant may appeal the denial to the Chief of Fisheries.

The Department cautions applicants that no authority is granted to operate an aquaculture facility until a permit actually is issued.  The mere filing of an application or  possession of a canceled check representing payment of fees does not entitle a person to operate an aquaculture facility.

Typically, permits are issued approximately 2 to 3 weeks following receipt by the Department.

A permit from the Department is required for any individual to "hold, possess or engage in the breeding or raising of live fur-bearing mammals".  A permit must be obtained before purchasing a species and species can be obtained only from another licensed breeder.  

Only eleven species are authorized for possession by this permit.  They are: Badger, Beaver, Gray Fox, Red Fox, Muskrat, Mink, Raccoon, River Otter, Opossum, Least Weasel and Long-tailed Weasel.

It is illegal to take a species in the wild, and this permit does not authorize taking animals from the wild.  (Note:  1. A Permit does not authorize possession of striped skunk, bobcat or coyote, and possession of those fur-bearing species is prohibited.  2. A permit may not be required for breeding, raising and producing in captivity, and marketing by the producer, of Mink, Red Fox or Arctic Fox as live animals or as animal pelts or carcasses.  Such activity may be deemed to be an agricultural pursuit and persons so engaged may be considered "fur Farmers".  For complete details consult the Department at the address shown above.)

Permits are issued for a period of up to one year and expire on March 31 after the date of issue.

Applicant must swear that the information contained thereon  is true and accurate. False or deceptive information may subject applicant to arrest and revocation of license privileges for up to five years.

Licenses are issued approximately two weeks after a properly completed application and fees are received by the Department.  Common reasons for denial are applications that name a species not authorized a species obtained from an unlicensed breeder, and incomplete applications.

<DL><DD>
A license is required before any individual, association, club or corporation may operate a Game Breeding and Hunting Preserve Area.

Before issuing a license, the Department conducts a field evaluation of the proposed area to determine that it satisfies DONR requirements for public safety and size (an area may consist of not more than 1280, nor less than 200, contiguous acres, of  which 100 acres must be suitable wildlife habitat).  

Licenses are issued for a period of  up to one year and are valid from May 1 of the year issued, and expire the following April 30.

V.   Approval Process:    </H3>
                               <DL><DD>
Applicant must complete and file with the Department a "Wildlife Resources - Game Breeding and Hunting Preserve" application together with the applicable fee.  Upon receipt of a completed application and fee, the Department schedules a field evaluation.  Any problems established by the Department's application review or field evaluation are brought to the attention of applicant who is allowed an opportunity to correct them.  

Applications are denied if the area does not qualify in terms of size or suitable habitat or if public safety problems are not or cannot be corrected.

Applications must be filed with the Department prior to July 1 of the year of intended use.

The Department requires licensed areas to be posted. Operators are obliged to release a minimum of 250 pheasant or quail seasonally (between September 1 and April 15). License holders must maintain records of information, including the number of hunter-trips, a description of species "harvested", a log of all hunter's license numbers and city of residence, the number of birds released in the area and the dates they were released.  Records must be forwarded to the Department at the end of each month.

<HR>
<H3>IV. 	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A permit is required to extract coal, either by surface or underground methods, including removal of coal refuse. Exemptions from this requirement are as follows: 1) No permit is required where 250 tons or less of coal are removed in any 12 consecutive months for the  landowner's or lessee's own noncommercial use, or 2) where the extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals does not exceed 16 2/3% of the total tonnage mined for purposes of commercial use or sale.  However, where incidental extraction is proposed, the entity must first receive an exemption from the Department.  (This procedure is explained in a separate OMM Business Requirement Profile: "Approval to Conduct Incidental Coal Extraction".<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file an application including background environmental data, legal information regarding an applicant's right to mine, any past violation history, corporate structure (if applicant is incorporated), maps and detailed engineering drawings prepared by, or under the direction of, and sealed by a qualified, registered professional engineer licensed in Illinois. <P>

Applicant is required to place a newspaper advertisement for 4 consecutive weeks, describing the type of proposed activity and location. Anyone who believes he or she may be adversely affected by the proposal may request a conference or hearing.  <P>

Based upon OMM's internal technical review, and comments received from the general public and Interagency Committee, a decision to approve, deny or modify the application is issued. (In nearly all cases, the Department issues a decision requiring the applicant to modify the application.) If the applicant responds positively to OMM's request for modifications a permit may be issued.  Generally, applications take 1-2 years to process. A permit may be denied to anyone "blocked" on the Applicant Violator System, a computer network of mine operators with compliance problems.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. 	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
OMM may not issue a permit until an applicant posts a performance bond guaranteeing reclamation of the site. <P>

Coal mine sites require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit from the Illinois EPA. Additional permits may be required from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources - Office of Water Resource Management, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if floodplain disturbances are planned or if a large impoundment is proposed to be constructed, and the federal Mine Safety & Health Administration.  Operators are obligated to adhere to performance and monitoring requirements. <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
$125 per acre for all land within the permit boundary to be surface mined. $5 per acre for each year the bond is in force for all non-surface mined land within the permit boundary.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Any entity using radioactive material in Illinois must be licensed or
registered with the Department.  (Certain small sources or quantities of
radioactive material, such as those found in home smoke detectors or
luminous dial watches, are exempt.  Other small quantities, such as some
gauging devices, only need to be registered.)  Businesses that want to use
radioactive material that is not exempt, or quantities and forms other than
those requiring registration, must obtain a Radioactive Materials License.<P>

Typically, Licenses are required for medical use, research, and
manufacturing of items containing radioactive material.  Entities using
measuring and gauging devices (moisture/density gauges, lead paint gauges,
etc.) must also obtain a Radioactive Materials License prior to receiving
and using them.   Anyone may contact the Department to determine if a
license is required for a particular use. Using radioactive material
without a license is a Class B misdemeanor.  Licenses are valid for 5
years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Radioactive Materials License must file an application.
The Division of Radioactive Materials will provide assistance in preparing
a license application.<P>

Applicants must describe the type and quantities of radioactive material to
be used and the procedures to be followed for the safe receipt, use,
storage and disposal of radioactive material.<P>

If the Department review determines that the proposed program of radiation
safety is adequate to protect public and worker health and safety, a
license will be issued in 30 to 90 days.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
License holders  may be inspected periodically to ensure the requirements,
regulations & conditions of the license are being met. Licensees also must
comply with regulations concerning accreditation of technologists for
medical use of radioactive materials and certification of industrial
radiographers.  Licensees may also be subject to low-level radioactive
waste reporting requirements.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The various fees associated with licensure are specified in Title 32,
Illinois Administrative Code, Part 331.  They cover the cost of routine
licensing and inspection activities performed by the Department and vary
according to the degree of complexity of the license. Licensees and
applicants for a radioactive materials license can contact the Division of
Radioactive Materials for detailed and specific information regarding fees
for a particular use of radioactive material.  There also are fees
associated with Technologist accreditation, Industrial Radiographer
certification and generation of low-level radioactive waste.

<H3>IV.Requirement Description:</H3>
<dl><dd>
Federal and state law require judges in domestic relations cases to order employers to withhold a portion of an employee's income for payment of child support. Whenever an Order for support is entered, a separate Order for Withholding must be entered also. The Order for Withholding is served on the employer immediately unless the parties agree and an alternative arrangement that insures payment of support is secured. An employer may not fire, discipline, deny employment or otherwise penalize an employee because he or she is subject to an Order for Withholding. Employers have 10 days after being served with the Order to comply. Non-compliance with the Order may result in a fine on the employer of $100 per day plus payment of the amount of the order.
</dd></dl><hr>
<H3>V. Approval Process:
</H3><dl><dd>
Illinois courts, the Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA), or administrative agency or court of another state may issue a Support Order and an Order for Withholding and have it served on an employer. Upon receipt of a Support Order and an Order for Withholding from another state, an Illinois employer must treat it as if it had been issued by an Illinois tribunal, provide a copy of the order to the employee, and distribute the funds as directed in the order.<P>

The employer may withhold from the employee's pay the amount(s) stated in the Order, but not more than the limit allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (FCCPA). Some Orders will state that the employer must enroll minor children as beneficiaries in the company's health insurance plan. The employer must send withheld child support amount(s) to the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA, the court or administrative agency of another state and/or the child's custodial parent, as directed in the Order. The withheld insurance premium is sent to the insurance carrier.<P></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<dl><dd>
In cases where insurance coverage is mandated, employers must notify the custodial parent, IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state, of the date when coverage begins, information on the dependent coverage plan and all necessary claim forms within 15 days of enrollment (or upon request).  Employers must notify the office that served the Order when an employee is no longer employed. If available, employers must provide a new address, name of a new employer and other information that may be necessary to continue the withholding process. If health coverage is terminated or changed for any reason, the employer must notify the custodial parent, the IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state of the change and any conversion privileges within 10 days of the change date. For each deduction, the employer must provide the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA in direct pay cases, or the court or administrative agency of another state with the date the employee was paid. The employer must pay the amount withheld to the custodial parent, IDPA, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, or the court or administrative agency of another state in accordance with the court's Order or Administrative Order for Withholding, within 10 calendar days of the date the employee is paid.<p></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<dl><dd>
An employer can deduct a fee of up to $5 per month for each Order for Withholding. The fee is to be deducted from the employee's remaining pay (wages excluding the amount withheld). This fee must be within the limits of the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:  </H3>
<DL><DD><P>A Motor Fuel Use Tax is imposed on interstate carriers operating commercial motor vehicles* on highways in Illinois. There are two Motor Fuel Use Taxes programs: 1.) the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) and, 2.) the Illinois Interstate Motor Fuel Use Tax.  Illinois based carriers who operate one or more commercial motor vehicles in at least one other IFTA jurisdiction can apply for an IFTA license and decals.  A carrier based in a non-IFTA jurisdiction, who wishes to operate in Illinois, can apply for an Illinois Interstate license and decals.

<P>An Illinois license and IFTA decal allows a carrier to travel in all IFTA jurisdictions and to file a single return with the Department, reporting miles traveled, gallons used and gallons purchased in each jurisdiction.  The carrier then pays the net due, or receives a refund, whichever applies.  An Illinois Interstate license and decal only allows the carrier to travel through Illinois. If a carrier qualifies as an IFTA or Illinois Interstate licensee but does not wish to participate in either program, a single trip permit (valid for 72 hours) must be obtained from the Department or from a wire service to travel through Illinois.

<P>Operating a commercial motor vehicle in Illinois without displaying a valid motor fuel use tax license, a decal, or a single trip permit, is a petty offense. A commercial motor vehicle found operating in Illinois without registering and securing a motor fuel use tax license or single trip permit is subject to a penalty of $1,000. Operating as a motor carrier without a valid motor fuel use tax license or a single trip permit is a Class A misdemeanor, and each subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Applicants for a Motor Fuel Use Tax license and decals must complete and file application Form # MFUT-12 with the Department.  Licenses and decals are valid for a maximum of one year, from January 1 through December 31.  Applications for licenses and decals are processed in approximately two weeks, but may take longer during renewal season (October through February).  Carriers may be required to file a bond if they have failed to pay taxes, file timely reports with the Department, or an audit indicates it is appropriate to protect the interests of member jurisdictions.  Common reasons for denial of licenses are if the carrier:  Is revoked in Illinois or another jurisdiction, the application is not signed by an owner or corporate officer, has failed to file returns, has a balance due of over $50.00.  Carriers may appeal denial of an application.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Carriers must file a quarterly return.  Form (MFUT-15) with Fuel Summaries must be completed by Illinois IFTA carriers.  Form (MFUT-16) must be completed by Illinois Interstate Carriers.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VII.	Fees:  </H3>

<DL><DD><P>There are no application or renewal fees.  However, the fee for decals is $3.75 per set for each calendar year.  Checks must be made payable to the Illinois Department of Revenue.

<P>*A commercial motor vehicle is defined as: Having two axles and a gross weight or registered gross weight exceeding 26,000 lbs.; having three or more axles regardless of weight, or a vehicle used in combination when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 lbs. gross weight or registered gross weight.

<P>Exempted from this definition in Illinois are:  motor vehicles operated by the State of Illinois or the United States, recreational vehicles, school buses, commercial motor vehicles operated solely within the State of Illinois.  (Exempted under the International Fuel Tax Agreement are:  Recreational vehicles.)</DD></DL>

<DL><DD>
The Illinois Income Tax Act (IITA) and the Retailers Occupation Tax Act (ROTA) impose a liability obligation upon the purchaser of assets* of a business for any unpaid sales, withholding, income, or excise taxes from the seller. This includes returns to be filed for any period up to the close of business, or the sale date. The IITA and ROTA provide for a reporting of a sale. Also, a requirement is imposed on the purchaser to withhold funds from sale proceeds. This acts to limit the amount of transferee liability the purchaser may be held liable for.  A release of transferee liability is issued when the seller's accounts are clear or the purchaser has paid the funds in escrow.<P>  

Purchasing a business without complying with the requirements may result in the seller's unpaid liabilities being transferred to the purchaser.  *(Defined as the major part of  the inventory, furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, or real estate.) <P>

Failure to comply could result in revocation of the charter, criminal or civil penalties.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must submit to the Commissioner of Savings & Residential Finance (the Commissioner) the plan for merging after they have been approved by the Boards of Directors of all depository institutions. The plan should include the names of each merging institution; the name of the continuing savings bank; location of the business and branch offices; provisions stating the method, terms and conditions of the merge. In regard to the resulting savings bank, information must be submitted on the amount of capital, surplus and reserve for operating expenses, the classes and number of shares of stock and their par value, the charter and bylaws and a detailed financial statement showing the assets and liabilities after the proposed merger. Applicants must submit certified copies of the Boards of Directors' approval. The Commissioner then examines the affairs of each merging institution applicant, their affiliates and subsidiaries. Applications are usually processed within 4-6 weeks. Applications may be denied if the applicants do not meet necessary requirements, if the same conditions do not exist with respect to the new resulting savings bank that would be required for the organization of a new savings bank, or if the merger agreement is unfair. If an application is denied, the applicant may amend and resubmit the plan.  <P>

If all required tests are passed at the time of the inspection, the owner of the vehicle (or his/her agent) shall be entitled to an emission inspection sticker.<P>

The owner of a vehicle to be inspected may not be expected to wait more than 15 minutes from the time of presenting the vehicle for inspection and the actual start of the inspection.<P>

<DL><DD>
2 Illinois Administrative Code 560
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV:  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The purpose of this Act is to regulate persons who directly communicate with legislators, constitutional officers, and other officials, such as agency directors, deputy directors, and general counsels, for the ultimate purpose of influencing an executive, legislative, or administrative action.  This Act may affect any business that does business with the State.  A business may be required to register if any salaried or contractual employee, as any part of their job duties, undertakes to influence the outcome of an executive, legislative, or administrative action.<P>

The employee would be required to register as an attachment to the
business' registration.  (Section 560.210 of the Code explains exemptions
from the Act).  The Secretary of State's Office does not have the statutory
authority to make the determination as to whether a business falls within
the purview of the Act and parties unsure as to whether the Act applies to
their business should consult with their lawyer. All registration
statements expire on December 31, and must be renewed by January 31.  The
primary purpose of this Act is to disclose expenditures (travel and
lodging, meals, beverages, entertainment, gifts and honoraria) on behalf of
officials by businesses subject to the Act.  Violations are a business
offense; parties convicted may be prohibited from lobbying for 3 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Registration Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Businesses must file a Registration Statement with an attachment for each employee who lobbies solely on behalf of the business.  It is not necessary to file an attachment for contractual lobbyists who are registered on their own or with another entity. (The Index Department provides a free "lobbyist packet" which contains rules, registration and reporting forms, and "A Guide to Lobbyist Registration and Reporting," with a copy of the Act.)
</DD></DL>

<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registered, authorized agents are responsible for filing a semi-annual expenditure report by July 31 for the period of January 1 through June 30, or the final day of the General Assembly session, and an annual expenditure report by January 31 for the entire previous calendar year. Reports must be filed even if the business did not make reportable expenditures.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII.  Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registration fee for the business: $50, plus $50 registration fee for each salaried employee lobbying on behalf of the business (contractual lobbyists with other clients pay in conjunction with their own registration).  Registration statements and expenditure reports received within 15 days of a filing deadline must be accompanied by a $50 late filing fee.<P>

Registration statements and expenditure Reports received after 15 days of a
filing deadline are subject to an additional $100 penalty.<P>

<center><h3>TIPS for using the WORD SEARCH function</h3></center>

Be careful spelling the word(s) you enter!  It will search for exactly what 
you specify.<p>  

The search is not case sensitive.  For example, if you type 'INCOME', the 
system will return a list of documents that have 'INCOME', 'Income' or 
'income'.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>
-->

1996 Outstanding Year for Film, Television Production in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO,  ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that 27 film and television productions provided temporary jobs for more than 25,000 Illinois residents and pumped $100 million into the state's economy in 1996.<p>

"The Illinois film industry is thriving," the Governor said.  "We are seeing the results of the rebuilding efforts of the Illinois Film Office in film and television productions such as 'Chain Reaction,' 'A Thousand Acres," 'My Best Friend's Wedding,'  'ER,' 'Early Edition,' and 'Chicago Hope.'  Hollywood is investing in Illinois because of our willingness to accommodate the demands of the film marketplace and the excellent cooperation between labor unions and state and local governmental bodies to meet the industry's needs."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the film industry makes a significant contribution to the state's economy.<p>

"This is only the second year in the 20-year history of the Illinois Film Office that revenue has reached $100 million in actual cash expenditures in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Since 1976, the motion picture and television industry has contributed more than $800 million to the state's economy and provided more than 250,000 temporary jobs."<p>

Some of the highlights of 1996 include "A Thousand Acres," filmed in Rochelle, Creston, and Mendota in September, and "35 Miles from Normal," filmed last summer in Pontiac.  Chicago productions include "Michael," due for release at Christmas; recently released "The Chamber." and 1997 releases such as "Love Jones," "Dogwater," "Hoods," "Reach the Rock," "Home Alone 3," and "My Best Friend's Wedding."<p>      

In addition to big Hollywood productions, which clearly boost the Illinois economy, the Illinois Film Office is seeing strong growth in independent film productions originating in Illinois, a major indicator of the future health of the local film industry.<p> 

The Illinois Film Office, a division of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, is responsible for attracting productions and promoting the film and television industry in Illinois.  Activities include location scouting, acting as a liaison between state and local governments, and providing information that outlines available film facilities and services, ranging from accountants to screenwriters.<p>

Governor Releases $1 Million in Emergency Heating Funds to Help Low-Income Families Re-Establish
Utilities Service
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today released $1 million in state emergency heating assistance to help low-income Illinois families and individuals re-establish utility services.<p>

"With the onset of frigid winter temperatures, thousands of Illinoisans who can't afford the cost of utilities may well find their lives threatened by the bitter cold," the Governor said.  "I have asked that state government tap all available resources to help low-income citizens currently without heat for their homes." <p>

The $1 million released today comes from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Nearly half -- about  $465,000 -- would go to residents of the City of Chicago and Cook County.  The rest will be distributed throughout the state to areas with the greatest need.<p>

Up to $500 a year in emergency funds is available to households that have had utilities disconnected or that fuel suppliers refuse to serve without immediate payment.  The funds also can be used to help pay for repair or replacement of heating systems that do not work.<p>

To qualify, applicants must show that they are low-income households and that they are responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or fuel vendor.  They must also show they have paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

About 6,000 residents already have received emergency assistance through state and federal programs this year.  An additional 95,000 have received one-time payments toward their energy bills.<p>

Additional information about the program is available by calling DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline toll-free at 800/252-8643.<p>

DCCA to Host Competitive Communities Workshops
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL. </strong> --  Illinois communities interested in participating in the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) are encouraged to attend one of three workshops to be held next week.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Edgar's senior advisor for economic development, said the program is designed to give local governments the tools to help themselves become more competitive. <p>

"The Competitive Communities Initiative is one of  DCCA's most popular local government programs," said Kustra.  "Economic development opportunities often hinge on how prepared a community is for growth.  A community of any size or level of economic development sophistication that is determined to improve itself can benefit from the rigorous self-assessment and action plan developed as the result of this program."  <p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said the program is already successfully in place in 30 communities throughout Illinois.<p>  

"CCI helps communities focus on leadership, assess their foundations for growth and build upon past economic development efforts," said Whetstone.  "Mayors and other local leaders have told us that their participation in CCI has helped them identify local development issues and develop consensus."<p>

Application workshops will be held in three different locations during the week of November 18, 1996.  At the workshops, CCI staff members will give a brief description of the goals and objectives of CCI and answer any questions concerning the application process.  Communities do not have to attend a workshop in order to submit an application.<p>

Applications are due no later than December 16, 1996 at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, Office of Local Initiatives, 620 E. Adams Street, Springfield, Illinois  62701.<p>

The workshops will be held at the following locations:<p>

200 Potomac Boulevard<br>
Mt. Vernon, Illinois 62864<br>

</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong> --  Illinois First and The Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. will co-sponsor the Illinois Plastics Summit, to be held November 19, 1996 in Oak Brook, Illinois.  The event will focus on the identification of key issues facing the plastics industry, and offer recommendations to address industry concerns.<p>

"Businesses with a stake in the plastics industry are urged to attend this summit," said Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) director Dennis Whetstone.

Governor Awards $41.5 Million in Grants to Improve Public Infrastructure in 157 Communities Throughout Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded grants worth $41.5 million to help 157 Illinois communities improve and expand public water and sewer systems to meet the demands of economic growth while protecting the state's environment.<p>

"If Illinois communities are to thrive and grow, they must have adequate and safe water and wastewater treatment systems," the Governor said.  "Through the Community Development Assistance Program, smaller communities throughout Illinois can get the help they need to pay for costly improvements to public infrastructure, a financial challenge that few smaller communities can meet on their own.<p>

"Beyond demands of economic growth, improved water and sewer systems also are crucial to protecting the Illinois environment and the health and safety of Illinois residents.  We want to help Illinois communities build a brighter economic and environmental future."<p>

CDAP grants are available to most Illinois communities with populations of 50,000 or less.  The grants are administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

The Governor pointed to projects in Hillsboro and Carthage as examples of improvement needs funded across Illinois.<p>

The City of Hillsboro will receive a $375,000 grant to help improve sand filters at its wastewater treatment plant.  The city has not met Illinois Environmental Protection Agency standards because wastewater volumes have overtaxed the existing filter system.  The improvements will eliminate the discharge of inadequately treated wastewater and bring the plant into compliance with state environmental guidelines.<p>

The City of Carthage will receive $50,000 in CDAP grant funding to help replace a key sewer main.  The existing line is too small to handle current sewage volume.  It is deteriorating and is exposed in several locations along a drainage ditch.  Sewage backups have occurred in several homes in the service area, creating hazards to public health and safety.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the funding is a sound investment in the future of Illinois.<p>

"Smaller communities must be prepared for economic expansion," Kustra said.  "Infrastructure improvements set the stage for development, improve the quality of life, and protect the health and safety of our citizens."<p>

DCCA officials received 308 requests for CDAP funding, totaling $89.7 million.<p>

CDAP grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to cities outside the seven most populous Illinois counties.  Low to moderate income benefit is a primary factor in awarding the grants.<p>

A list of project grants awarded today is attached.<p>

Governor Announces Third Consecutive Decrease in High-Risk Workers' Compensation Rates
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois workers' compensation insurance rates among high-risk employers will be reduced for the third consecutive year in 1997.<p>

"Lower workers' compensation insurance rates help strengthen the Illinois business climate," the Governor said.  "This 10.1 percent rate decrease for 1997 and similar decreases over the past two years are lowering the cost of doing business in Illinois.  That allows business owners to reinvest the savings in their companies, their workforces and our economy."<p>

The rate reduction, requested by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), is expected to save $15.5 million for Illinois manufacturers and businesses involved in the Illinois Workers' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan.  NCCI administers the high-risk pool for about 300 insurance companies serving employers who are unable to buy workers' compensation insurance through the voluntary insurance market.  The high-risk pool insures more than 9 percent of the total Illinois workers' compensation market.  Workers' compensation rates for high-risk employers decreased 6.8 percent in 1995 and 13.6 percent in 1996.  Rates generally are based on the frequency and severity of recent claims.<p>

Illinois Director of Insurance Mark Boozell approved NCCI's rate reduction request today, assuring an overall average 10.1 percent rate decrease next year for companies in the high-risk pool.  The new rates take effect Jan. 1.<p>

NCCI recommended a corresponding 10.1 percent rate decrease for employers in the voluntary market.  "Insurance companies must file their voluntary rates with the Department of Insurance on an individual basis," Boozell said.  "Although voluntary rates can fluctuate above or below the recommended decrease, the level of competition in the market will ultimately determine how much companies charge."<p>

Rates in the voluntary workers' compensation insurance market are roughly 20 percent lower than rates in the high-risk pool, Boozell said.<p>

Governor Announces Auto Part Company will Locate New Plant in Lawrenceville; State Helps to Create About 125 Jobs
</h3>

<strong>LAWRENCEVILLE, ILL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Trim Masers, Inc., an automobile parts manufacturing company, will locate a new plant in Lawrenceville with assistance for the state. <p> 

"I am delighted that Trim masters has joined many, many other companies that have decided to invest in Illinois and create jobs here because of our excellent business climate and quality workforce, " the Governor said.<p>

"More than 360,000 new jobs have been created in our state in just the last four years, reflecting our retooled and re-energized efforts to make Illinois a place where businesses want to expand and locate," Edgar said.<p>

Kentucky-based Trim master will employ about 125 and invests as much as $12 million in the 100,000 square-foot facility at Lawrenceville.  At least two other states were competing for the plant.  Construction will begin next May and is expected to be complete in December 1997.  Trim Masters manufactures seat trim covers, door trim and complete seats for automobiles.<p>

The state, through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, will provide $187,000 in job-training funds and $500,000 in infrastructure assistance to help fund water and wastewater projects.  The City of Lawrenceville will donate the plant site.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the state worked with Lawrenceville area officials to make the project a reality.<p>

"This project was a team effort," said Kustra.  "Assistance at the state and local level was needed to bring Trim masters to Lawrenceville, and we are pleased to see much-needed jobs come to this community."<p>

Lawrenceville Mayor Jerry Harper said residents are excited about the jobs that will be created.<p>

"This announcement gives Lawrenceville an economic shot in the arm," Harper said.  "We wouldn't have been able to land this project without the assistance of the State of Illinois.  The help provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs clinched the deal to bring Trim Masters here, and we are very appreciative."<p>

Philip Ashcraft, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Trim Master, said the company is looking forward to working with the community.<p>

"The enthusiasm of the people in Lawrenceville area was one of the reasons we chose to locate here," said Ashcraft.  "that local support, combined with an excellent labor pool and the incentives offered by the State of Illinois, helped to make locating in Lawrenceville an easy decision for Trim Masters."<p>

Governor Congratulates Eli's Cheesecake Co. on Opening of New Headquarters
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with business and civic leaders in Chicago to celebrate the grand opening of the new $9 million bakery and headquarters for Eli's  Cheesecake Co. in Chicago Industry-Tech Park on the city's northwest side.<p>
  	    
"This opening represents an economic development milestone for the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois," the Governor said.  "First, Eli's reputation is much of the reason people across the country think of Chicago and Illinois when they think of fine cheesecake, and this opening certainly reinforces that connection.  <p>

"But the opening also represents the first project in a plan to redevelop the former Chicago-Read Mental Health Center site.  That creates exciting new opportunities for businesses to relocate and grow within the city of Chicago at costs competitive with the surrounding suburbs.  Eli's is to be commended as the first company to recognize the potential of Industry-Tech Park with the opening of Eli's Cheesecake Co."<p>

The Edgar administration will provide Eli's with a $300,000 Small Business Development Loan for the project through the state Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>  

Eli's Chicago's Finest Cheesecake President Marc Schulman said his company is proud to open Eli's Cheesecake Co. in Chicago.<p>

"The support of the city and the state and the loyalty of our customers made possible the achievement of our dream to build a state-of-the-art facility," said Schulman.  "We appreciate the opportunity to relocate in our current neighborhood, and we have built a true showcase for food products made in Illinois."  <p>         

"Today's event is just the latest example of how our investments in revitalizing economic development throughout Illinois are benefitting our businesses and our citizens," Edgar said. <p> 

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the development of Industry-Tech Park is a true partnership.<p>

"Public and private interests at the state and local level have a stake in realizing our goal of developing Industry-Tech Park," Kustra said.  "With Eli's Cheesecake Co. as an anchor we will continue to work together to build on our initial success."<p>        	

Chicago Industry-Tech Park was formally created in June of 1995 when the state agreed to provide 73 acres of surplus land that was part of the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center campus.<p>        

The redevelopment project is expected to take six to eight years and yield 580,000 square feet for modern industrial facilities, including processing, light-manufacturing and assembly facilities.  When fully developed, DCCA has estimated the park will generate more than $36 million in retail sales, $2.6 million in net state revenues, $2.8 million net local taxes and $100 million in payroll earnings.<p>

Governor Announces $5 Million Investment to Expand, Push Marketing of Illinois Coal
</h3>

<strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a sweeping multi-million-dollar plan to expand markets for Illinois coal and improve the state's coal transportation, export and delivery systems.<p>

"The Illinois coal industry faces some tough challenges.  By moving forward with a sharply focused and aggressive marketing effort, we believe Illinois can solidify and expand its coal market opportunities," the Governor said. <p>

Edgar announced the state will spend $5 million to support coal marketing and transportation improvements, including $2 million for the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign. The grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs goes to the Illinois Coal Development Board.<p>

The proposed Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign includes two main components:  The Market Development Program and the Strategic Projects Program.<p>

The Market Development Program includes coal market research and analysis.  Analysts will identify promising domestic and international markets and provide the Illinois coal industry with information and strategies to tap those markets and to increase the value of Illinois coal.  Market Development analysts also will evaluate improvements needed to more efficiently transport Illinois coal to U.S. and global markets.<p>

The Strategic Projects Program will analyze infrastructure needs to improve coal transportation, export and delivery systems in Illinois.  State dollars will be used to leverage private and public investment to improve infrastructure and to increase coal shipments from Illinois.<p>

For instance, the Strategic Projects Program will look at ways to improve Illinois rail and barge loading facilities.  The idea is to move ore coal at lower costs to the Gulf of Mexico and on to international markets.<p>

"We have an opportunity to greatly expand our domestic markets as U.S. electric utilities restructure to comply with Clean Air Act rules," the Governor said.  "In addition, the global market potential for coal is only beginning to be realized as the demand for coal increases, particularly in developing countries.  This strategic marketing plan will help the Illinois coal industry take full advantage of changing market conditions around the world."<p>

State Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) joined the Governor in announcing the marketing plan.<p>

"I am proud to work with the Governor in developing this plan," Luechtefeld said.  "Coal production is the major economic force in many of the Southern Illinois communities I represent.  This plan will push us toward our goal of developing new markets for Illinois coal and developing systems for the most cost-efficient movement of coal to foreign markets."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said international markets show great promise. <p> 

Working with leaders of the Illinois Coal Association and the United Mine Workers of America, Kustra last year created the Illinois Coal Strategy Group, whose goal is to seek ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and ensure positive impacts on local communities.<p>

"Illinois coal exports are up," Kustra said.  "Exports in 1995 increased 10-fold over 1994 levels and current analysts' projections indicate that we could double foreign export sales by the year 2000."<p>

The Governor asked that the Illinois Coal Development Board act quickly to approve the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign.  The board reviews and approves all coal research, development and demonstration projects, as well as all expenditures from the Coal Technology Development and Assistance Fund and the Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund.<p>

Governor Announces Grant to Boost Economic Development in Red Bud
</h3>

<strong>RED BUD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $500,000 grant that will aid a business development in Red Bud, creating at least 15 new jobs and retaining more than 50.<p>  

"Red Bud is poised for economic growth," the Governor said.  "This Community Development Assistance Program grant is expected to help the city retain one of its most important employers and create exciting opportunities for new businesses to locate in Red Bud." <p>

The $500,000 grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will go to the City of Red Bud.  The city will loan the money to TPC Properties, L.L.C., to purchase the building that houses Total Process Corp., a manufacturer of structural steel, piping and electrical components.  Two Red Bud banks will lend TPC Properties $1.3 million to complete the purchase.  The city of Red Bud will loan TPC an additional $200,000 at no interest to renovate the building.<p>

After acquisition and improvements are completed, Total Process Corp. will sign a long-term lease with TPC Properties and other tenants will be actively recruited for remaining space in the building, now owned by Inter-City Products.<p>

"There is tremendous economic development potential in small communities throughout Illinois," Edgar said.  "My administration is committed to helping small towns and cities realize that potential."<p>

Red Bud Mayor Clement L. Esker said the project will renew optimism in the community's future.<p>

"Red Bud is turning around," Esker said.  "We appreciate the efforts of the Edgar administration to help put our community on the comeback trail.  Red Bud is ready to move on to a brighter future with new growth and job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, called the project an excellent example of public-private cooperation.<p>

"The Edgar administration is a partner in economic development with local governments and the private sector," Kustra said.  "All of us must work together to accomplish our common goal of improving the quality of life for citizens across Illinois."<p>

Governor Commends International Partnership that Resulted in Reopening Sparta Printing Plant
</h3>

<strong>SPARTA, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with community leaders, area residents and Mexican dignitaries in celebrating the re-opening of a printing plant that has employed thousands over the years in Sparta.<p>

"With the opening of Sparta International Printing Co. we congratulate a community and region that never lost hope despite the serious economic setback suffered early this year," the Governor said.  "We also pay tribute to our international partner in this endeavor, Grupa Serla of Mexico, which saw the wisdom in establishing a new printing firm here."<p>

Sparta International Printing Co. (SIPCO), a subsidiary of Grupa Serla, will employ 24 initially and as many as 200 within a year.  The printing plant formerly housed Spartan Printing Co. which went out of business in February after 47 years.  The shutdown put 850 employees out of work.<p>

SIPCO officials say they intend to hire as many dislocated Spartan workers as possible into the new jobs.<p>

The Governor joined other state officials, local leaders, plant workers, officials from Grupo Serla, and Mexico Consul Humberto Zamora-Trevino for the ceremony commemorating SIPCO's opening.<p>

Edgar commended the community for its efforts in finding a buyer for the idled plant.  "You never gave up," he said.  "My administration has bee there for you and, together with our friends at Grupa Serla, we got the job done."<p>

After the Spartan plant closed, the state made available $1 million in Job Training Partnership Act funds to help employees who lost their jobs.<p>

To help the new firm get started, the Edgar administration offered up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program funds for worker training.  The administration also provided $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program funds to the City of Sparta for infrastructure needs at the plant.<p>

"Things looked bleak last winter, but this opening represents a solid beginning on the long road back," Edgar said.  "We owe a lot to the opportunities presented by the NAFTA agreement in 1993.  NAFTA made the result we see here today possible.  We've heard concerns about jobs leaving the United States.  Here's the reality:  A Mexican firm reopens an Illinois plant, hires Illinois workers and looks forward to years of growth.  That's real progress."<p>

DCCA Sponsors Events to Celebrate Illinois Recycling Day
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is sponsoring events in West Peoria and Genoa to celebrate Illinois Recycling Day, October 1, 1996.<p>

"Illinois is proud of its many outstanding recycling programs," said DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  "Our efforts to reduce waste and encourage recycling in our homes, schools, offices and factories are increasingly successful, as these events demonstrate.  Illinois Recycling Day is another opportunity to highlight state programs aimed at producing a better environment for all Illinois citizens."<p>

In West Peoria, a ribbon cutting ceremony is scheduled to kick-off West Peoria's new curbside recycling program.  The City of West Peoria, Illinois' newest municipality, used an $18,000 DCCA grant to purchase recycling bins and to support the project's educational and promotional efforts.  The bi-weekly program will provide all residents of West Peoria the opportunity to recycle a full spectrum of recyclable commodities, including newspaper, plastics, glass and metals.<p>

In Genoa, a ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony is planned at Pace Mat, Inc., a scrap tire-derived material mat production facility.  Pace Mat received a $500,000 DCCA grant to purchase hydraulic presses, tool and die equipment and other related equipment to produce scrap tire-derived mats and mat type products, including gymnasium mats and noise reduction flooring.  Pace Mat has matched DCCA's grant with more than $1.2 million worth of related equipment, engineering and design work and cash.<p>

"The market for recycled products is growing," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Jim Edgar's senior advisor for economic development.  "State government will continue to work with the recycling industry to develop innovative new ways to meet consumer demand, and at the same time improve the environment for our citizens."<p>

As the lead agency charged with supporting waste reduction and recycling efforts in Illinois, DCCA administers a variety of waste management programs, including the Materials Recycling Grants Program, the Used Tire Recovery Program and School Recycling Grants Program.  For more information on recycling programs, call DCCA at 217/785-2800 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

Local Officials Urged to Attend Revolving Loan Fund Workshops
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Public officials, bankers, economic development professionals, revolving loan fund administrators and others involved in financing for economic growth are encouraged to attend one of a series of workshops on the management of a successful revolving loan fund system.<p>  

Effective use of revolving loan fund dollars is critical to stimulating job creation and retention in an era of limited financial resources for economic development.  The one-day workshops have been developed to assist administrators and community representatives in designing and administering a successful revolving loan portfolio at the local level.          
Topics to be covered include revolving loan fund design, credit analysis based on sound lending principles, loan closing and documentation, servicing the loan portfolio and tips on working with problem loans.<p>

The first workshop was held September 17 in Crystal Lake.  In addition, workshops are scheduled on October 9 in Effingham, October 23 in Peoria and November 6 in Carterville.<p>

Each of the workshops will cover the same agenda, with representatives from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association available to answer questions and discuss strategies.  DCCA and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association are sponsors of the workshops, in cooperation with Western Illinois University.<p>

Governor To Lead Trade Mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced he will lead a trade mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong in an effort to solidify relations and expand markets for Illinois firms.<p>

The Governor, First Lady Brenda Edgar and representatives from more than two dozen Illinois businesses, trade organizations and labor groups will meet with business and government leaders in the four countries.<p>

Becky Doyle, Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and Norman Sims, Executive Deputy Director of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, also will be among those accompanying the Governor.<p>

"This mission represents an excellent opportunity for Illinois firms -- large and small -- to explore new market opportunities," the Governor said.  "The countries we'll be visiting are particularly interested in Illinois products and technological assistance in a variety of industrial areas, including our state's number one industry, agriculture."<p>

In each country, the delegation will meet with industrial leaders whose firms have facilities or subsidiaries in Illinois, or who seek to expand trade with Illinois firms.<p>

The delegation leaves for Japan on September 15.  The Japan visit includes a tour and address on the campus of Southern Illinois University - Nakajo campus.  SIU President Ted Sanders will host the Governor's visit there.<p>

Edgar and the Governor of Niigata, Japan, are expected to reaffirm the Niigata-Illinois Educational and Economic Development Council agreement that was signed during the 1980s.  <p>

The slate of industrial meetings in Japan includes talks with leaders of Koito, parent company to Illinois-based North American Lighting, and of Mitsubishi Motors, which oversees several Illinois-based facilities.<p>

In South Korea, the Governor will meet with Prime Minister Soo Sung Lee, and with U.S. Ambassador James Laney.<p>

In South Korea, the mission also will meet with the chairman of Samsung, which recently announced a distribution center in Bolingbrook, and with the chairman of Lucky Goldstar, which owns controlling shares in Zenith Corporation, a Chicago-based firm.<p>

The trip to China includes meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and a Chinese vice premier.<p>

In China, the delegation's schedule includes visits with officials from Motorola, Deere & Co., and Ameritech.<p>

In Hong Kong, Edgar will meet with Gov. Chris Patten, and British Trade Commissioner Francis Cornish.<p>

The delegation also has meetings scheduled with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, and China Aerospace International Holdings.  Edgar also will witness the signing of an agreement between DCCA and the Hong Kong Metal Merchants Association.<p>

The delegation is scheduled to return to Illinois September 28.<p>

"We expect this trip, like our previous trade missions to Mexico, Europe and the Middle East, to broaden our export horizons, a long standing priority of our administration," Edgar said.<p>  

"We were pleased to be invited by leaders of each of the countries we'll be visiting.  As we improve our business relations abroad, Illinois' export industry should grow.  That means a stronger Illinois economy, and more good-paying jobs for Illinoisans right here at home."<p>

Edgar Administration Announces Grants to Aid Small Manufacturers in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- The Edgar administration announced today that a $2.67 million grant from the National Institute for Standards and Technology, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants, will enable the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center to expand and improve its technical assistance for small- and mid-sized manufacturers throughout Illinois.<p>
 
IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The grants mean greater access and more comprehensive support for all of the nearly 9,700 small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area that are not currently served by the federal government.  The federal grants supplement existing state programs that serve all 24,000 industrial firms in Illinois.<p>

"The manufacturing sector in Illinois is of critical importance to the future of the state's economy," said Dennis Whetstone, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, which will provide $600,000 of the state's commitment.  "At the same time, small and medium-sized manufacturers employ large numbers of Illinois workers.  By providing greater support for this crucial segment of our manufacturing base, we will both improve the state's economy and increase the number of good jobs available to Illinois workers."<p>

"The state of Illinois with support form NIST, has invested for more than three years in developing the state's manufacturing service system," said Bob Weinstein, interim executive director for IMEC.  "These investments and the grants announced today will let IMEC be established as an independent, not-for-profit corporation to provide substantive assistance to Illinois manufacturers."<p>

The $2.67 million NIST grant, through the U.S. Department of Commerce, can be awarded annually for up to six years.<p>

The balance of the $1.2 million commitment from the Edgar administration comes through the Illinois Board of Higher Education.  The center also gets about $200,000 in cash grants and fees from private firms, along with about $1.3 million through in-kind contributions from private firms.<p>

The total $2.7 million in state and local support represents the matching funds needed to qualify the center for the $2.67 million federal grant announced today.<p>

The president of the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Sally Jackson, applauded the public-private partnership that resulted in the center's expansion.  "I commend Governor Edgar for his strong leadership in forging innovative public-private alliances that will assure continued economic expansion in Illinois," Jackson said.<p>

Bradley University President John Brazil commended the cooperative effort among Illinois businesses, institutions of higher education and the state and federal governments that led to the establishment of IMEC.  "Bradley is proud to have been able to play a facilitating role in the creation of the IMEC," Brazil said.  "We are committed to the success of IMEC and pledge our full cooperation and continuing support for the fulfillment of its mission."<p>

IMEC will be based in Peoria, with sub-centers on the campuses of Bradley University in Peoria, Rock Valley College in Rockford, and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  Field extension offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, and Edwardsville.<p>

The federal grant announced today doubles the center's annual budget.  It will help the center expand its offerings in existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  Areas under consideration for the new offices include Champaign-Urbana, Decatur, Effingham and Quincy.<p>

The expansion means that more than 80 percent of the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers outside the Chicago area will be within 40 miles of an IMEC office.<p>

"In the first year, we expect to reach at least 1,000 manufacturers in providing some level of service," Weinstein said.  "We expect to link with all the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers at some point.<p>

"Being part of the national network with NIST allows us to meet the specific needs of our area's smaller manufacturers while leveraging national resources that previously had not been available to us.  In addition to these national resources, the establishment of IMEC brings together a partnership of Illinois higher education institutions, research laboratories, business assistance centers, employer and trade associations and private sector companies who are committed to the continued growth and vitality of Illinois manufacturing," Weinstein said.<p>

Edgar Statement about State & Federal Grants for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Centers
</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar issued the following statement about the state and federal grants announced today for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center:<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger.<p>

"Only a diverse and supportive economic climate for small businesses can create the good-paying manufacturing jobs Illinoisans need and want.<p>

"This first-year federal grant for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center, coupled with the Edgar administration's financial support over the past few years, means our state's small- and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

"The establishment of the center as an independent, not-for-profit corporation, and its planned expansion to better serve companies across the state shows the positive impact of public/private partnerships as we in Illinois continue to lead in our efforts to foster innovative, cost-effective ways to help Illinois businesses improve."<p>

Governor Visits Excel Railcar; Notes NAFTA's Benefits to Company
</h3>

<strong>KENNEY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today commended Excel Railcar Corporation on its success in promoting trade between Illinois and Mexico.  The company, one of the fastest-growing Hispanic companies in the U.S., has been a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).<p>

On a tour of the firm's plant in Kenney today, the Governor also announced new agreements the firm has signed, which will enable Excel to begin exporting Illinois grain and grain products to Mexico next year.<p>

"In supporting passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we were convinced that the agreement would be important, not just for large exporters, but also for small businesses like Excel Railcar Corporation," the Governor said.  "Excel's experience has shown that our convictions were right on target.  The company is one of our state's most enthusiastic partners as we promote trade between Illinois and Mexico. <p>

"Illinois offers a wide range of personalized assistance to help companies develop their export potential.  From one-on-one assistance through our network of International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, to participation in trade and catalog shows and trade missions coordinated through our International Business Division and its foreign offices, Illinois is linking businesses with the resources they need to become successful in the global marketplace."<p>
 
Eugene Constance, President of Excel Railcar Corporation, often serves as a consultant to other small businesses entering the Mexican marketplace.  Constance said the state has been instrumental in helping his company broaden trade relationships. 	<p>

"I had the privilege of attending a trade mission to Mexico with Governor Edgar in March," he said.  "The contacts I made during that trade mission have already resulted in inquiries from Mexican companies and other U.S. firms, particularly Illinois firms, that have an interest in exporting to Mexico.  The state's trade office in Mexico City also has been extremely helpful.  Its director, Raymundo Flores, truly has a finger on the pulse of the business climate in Mexico."<p>

Excel Railcar Corporation, headquartered in Naperville, was founded in 1980 to provide railcars on full-service leases for the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets.  Since then, the company has leased more than 1,500 new and refurbished railcars to companies using them for international service between the U.S. and Mexico.  Its Mexican customers include Cemex (cement), Vitro (glass) and Apasco (cement).  Excel this year also entered the U.S. railcar leasing market.  <p>

Growth led Excel to reactivate its railcar repair facility at Kenney in 1995, enabling the company to refurbish and repair its own fleet and other railcars.  The Kenney plant employs seven and expects to expand to 15 employees in late 1997.  Excel also employs 14 at its Mexico City subsidiary.<p>

Zenith to Expand in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined Peter S. Willmott, Chief Executive Officer and President of Zenith Electronics Corporation, in announcing the company's plan to build a $100 million state-of-the-art, picture tube manufacturing facility in Woodridge, creating about 280 full-time jobs.<p>

The company also will invest $80 million in its Melrose Park manufacturing facility to automate existing television picture tube production lines and to install a new line for computer display tubes (CDTs).  The expansion and modernization program is expected to create 120 new jobs in the Melrose Park plant, where the company currently employs more than 2,800 workers.<p>

"For nearly eight decades, Zenith has been an important member of the Illinois business community," the Governor said.  "In that time, the company has grown to be a worldwide electronics leader that employs more than 4,000 workers in Illinois.<p>

"Obviously, in choosing a location for this expansion, Zenith had many options, both in the U.S. and Mexico.  Its decision to expand in Illinois proves once again that our state has the skilled workers, excellent infrastructure and positive business climate needed by companies growing for the future."  <p>

Willmott commended state and local authorities on their assistance in making the firm's expansion plan possible.  "We at Zenith are proud of our reputation as an Illinois business leader, a reputation that no doubt will be enhanced by our new state-of-the-art operation in Woodridge," Willmott said.  "We appreciate the tremendous assistance from the State of Illinois, Will County and the village on this important Zenith competitiveness initiative."<p>

The new Woodridge facility will enable Zenith to add a new production line in Illinois to make 32- and 35-inch color picture tubes, and ultimately, wide-screen tubes for digital and high-definition television sets.  This, coupled with improvements in the company's Melrose Park plant, will help Zenith be more competitive.<p>

Both the Governor and Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, met with Zenith officials as the company considered locations.  Kustra said Illinois will provide job training assistance, road improvements and tax incentives to assist Zenith with the expansion.  <p>

"Our state is committed to helping businesses expand and grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "We have developed programs to build upon our excellent resources to ensure that Illinois remains the location of choice for tomorrow's business leaders."<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $600,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) grant funds over the next two years to assist the company in training its workers.  In addition, the Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT) will provide up to $429,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the cost of construction of an access road from Internationale Parkway in Woodridge to the new Zenith site.  The Village of Woodridge will also contribute to the road funding and will provide utility tax rebates to the company.  Will County and Valley View School District #365 also have granted property tax relief to Zenith.<p>

The new Woodridge facility will include 325,000 square-feet of floor area on a 70-acre site.  The Melrose Park plant is being expanded by 70,000 square-feet for the new CDT line.  The modernization program there also will include automating various          components of the existing picture tube manufacturing lines.<p>

Zenith Electronics Corporation employs more than 15,000 workers worldwide, including 4,000 in Illinois.  U.S. operations include the company's corporate headquarters and research center in Glenview, the Melrose Park color picture tube plant, and a printed circuit board fabrication plant in Chicago. <p>

Construction is expected to be completed in 1997.<p>

Breakfast Meetings Help Small Businesses Learn About Environmental Compliance, OSHA
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Environmental regulations, safety and health requirements, plus many other local, state and federal requirements, are often seen as burdensome to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  In an effort to help ease compliance and understanding, the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is teaming with the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) to host a series of regulatory compliance breakfasts in nine locations around the state.<p>

At the breakfast meetings, experts from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; Illinois State Fire Marshal's office; and DCCA's On-Site Health and Safety Consultation Program, Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and First Stop Business Information Center will discuss environmental compliance and OSHA's most frequently cited standards.  Topics include safety and health training, hazard identification, emergency preparation, the impact of the Clean Air Act amendments on small business, underground storage tank requirements for 1998, an update on the status of the LUST fund, and the new Brownfield legislation's impact on cleanup.<p>

After the presentations, participants will be able to discuss their concerns one-on-one with the regulatory experts.  These informal, confidential consultations will be for informational purposes only.  No punitive actions will be undertaken as a result of the consultations.<p>

The breakfast meetings will begin at 7:30 a.m. and conclude at noon.  Cost to attend is $25.00 per person and  pre-registration is suggested.  To register, or for further information, contact Dave Voepel of the NFIB at 217/523-5471 or Annette Lingleo of DCCA at 800/252-3998 (TDD users call 800/785-6055). <p>

DCCA Welcomes State Fair Visitors to the Ethanol Exposition
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) invites fairgoers to visit the Fifth Annual Ethanol Expo and register for a chance to win a John Deere Gator all-terrain vehicle provided by the Illinois Corn Growers' Association, CIBA and Brownfield Network.<p>

The Ethanol Expo will provide fairgoers with free popcorn and ice water, courtesy of Archer Daniels Midland Corporation; Growmark, Inc.; the Illinois Corn Growers' Association; DCCA; the Illinois Department of Agriculture; Midwest Grain Products, Inc.; and Pekin Energy Company.<p>

"Illinois is the leading producer of ethanol fuel in the country," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "This exhibit gives visitors a chance to learn more about this clean alternative fuel, and our aggressive promotion and demonstration programs."<p>

Fairgoers can take a break from the heat by sitting in the comfort of the air-conditioned "Corn Bus," one of the 14 ethanol-powered buses currently operating in Peoria.  The Greater Peoria Mass Transit Authority is the first in the nation to use ethanol-fueled buses for transportation.  The Corn Bus operates on 93 percent ethanol and is painted to resemble an ear of corn, serving as a moving reminder of the benefits of ethanol fuel.<p>

Friday August 16, the Expo will feature Ford Motor Company.  On display will be the 1996 flexible-fueled ethanol-powered Ford Taurus.  In addition to the Taurus, the Expo will also feature Ford's recycling display and one of its flexible-fuel vehicle engines.  Ford Motor Company is one of the leading manufacturers using recycled materials in the production of its vehicles.  The Expo also will feature the pre-production E-85 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and several E-85 Chevrolet Lumina autos.<p>

The Ethanol Exposition is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily throughout the 1996 Illinois State Fair, August 9-18.<p>

The average grant award will range from $2,000 to $7,000.  Eligible applicants must provide a cash or in-kind match of 10 percent.<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION GRANT FOR DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
</h3>





<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $3 million grant to help offset the City of Chicago's expenses for hosting the 1996 Democratic National Convention, bringing the state's total contribution to the event to nearly $7 million. <P>

"Illinois is fortunate to have an opportunity later this month to showcase our State and the City of Chicago to the world," the Governor said.  "It should be a major boost for the local economy, as well with the 35,000 visitors we expect producing $360 million in economic benefits.   <P>

"Our investment in helping the city put on a premier event will pay immediate dividends as the convention takes place.  In the future, tourism should increase because of heightened interest in Chicago and Illinois as travel destinations."<P>

The $3 million grant to the City of Chicago was awarded through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.  <P>

In addition to the fiscal year 1997 grant announced today, the City of Chicago received $2.75 million in fiscal year 1996 and $1.2 million in fiscal year 1995 for convention activities and planning.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant program is designed to help attract national and international events to Illinois. <P>

"Tourism is a $16 billion industry in Illinois," Kustra said.  "To help keep those numbers growing, this supports public/private partnerships that are key to bringing major conferences, conventions and sporting events to our communities."<P>

The private sector grant program, funded entirely by taxes generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for tourism promotion.  Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment.<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES CREATION OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL
</h3>

<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the creation of the Illinois Small Business 100, a council of small business owners who reflect the unique diversity of the 617,000 small businesses in Illinois.<P>

"Small businesses are the backbone of the state's economy," the Governor said.  "They play vital roles as job creators, employing millions of Illinois citizens, and they provide tremendous opportunities for those who have the determination to work hard and succeed.  And we are seeing some of the most dramatic growth in small businesses owned by women and minorities.	<P>

"Through this council, my administration is forging an even stronger relationship with small business--one that is designed to foster a better understanding of the ongoing issues and challenges facing this important segment of our economy.  We will work together to promote business growth and expansion in a low-tax, common-sense climate that does not choke economic growth."   <P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the small business council will have the ability to communicate the most pressing concerns of small business directly to state government.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will develop a site on the World Wide Web for the council that will include links to the members' E-mail, business pages, chambers of commerce and trade organizations," Kustra said.  "Members will be regularly polled on regulatory and small business issues, creating a sounding board for sound economic development policies."<P>

In conjunction with announcing the creation of the council,  the Governor also today presented the first Governor's Illinois Business Leadership award to Campagna Turano Bakeries, Inc. of Berwyn.  <P>

In the nearly half century since it was founded, Turano has grown from a small family business into a nationally known company, servicing accounts ranging from fast food outlets to fine dining establishments and from small neighborhood grocery stores to the largest supermarket chains.<P>

ALCOA CHOOSES DANVILLE FOR NEW PLANT SITE
</h3>





<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Alcoa on the company's decision to invest $48 million in a 165,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Danville, initially creating 35 new jobs with the potential for further growth.<P>

"Illinois is beating the competition for new industry," the Governor said.  "Alcoa reviewed more than 100 sites in five Midwestern states before making a final decision, and we are delighted that this facility is coming to Danville.  Our commitment to providing a skilled workforce and maintaining a high quality of life in our communities played key roles in Alcoa's choice of location."<P>

Alcoa's Aerospace/Commercial Rolled Products Division has purchased nearly 96 acres of land south of I-74 in Danville's Southgate Industrial Park.  The facility will house an automotive aluminum sheet finishing operation and feature state-of-the-art technology and equipment.<P>

Tim Wilkinson, Vice President of the Division, indicated that a site search had been underway since May.<P>

"Our need was for speed and Danville is a community with a vision and the strategies to meet our needs," Wilkinson said.  "The educational facilities are exactly what we need and there is a strong sense of family values here.  Danville is clearly the number one place to build a facility in the Midwest."<P>

Danville Mayor Robert E. Jones and Vicki Stewart, President of the Danville Area Economic Development Council, praised the team effort that brought the facility to Danville.<P>

"Funding and timely completion of all infrastructure to the site was of vital importance to this project," said Stewart.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide funding totaling nearly $1 million for road, sewer and water line development.  DCCA also has committed to provide up to $70,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds for worker training at the new facility.<P>

Alcoa's expansion is prompted by expected growth in the North American automotive market.  The Danville facility will provide just-in-time delivery to customers in the U.S. and Canada.  <P>

A groundbreaking for the facility is planned later this fall.<P>

WEBER TO EXPAND IN ILLINOIS, CREATE 225 JOBS
</h3>





<STRONG>HUNTLEY, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Palatine-based Weber-Stephen Products Company will invest up to $14 million to build a 300,000 square-foot manufacturing and distribution facility for its barbeque grills, creating 225 jobs and significantly expanding the company's presence in Illinois.<P>

"Illinois continues on a record-setting pace for business expansions and relocations," the Governor said.  "Weber is the most recent company to recognize that our friendly business climate, sophisticated transportation system and support of worker training are excellent reasons to stay and grow in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, unveiled the project at ceremonies in Huntley.<P>

"We weekend barbecue experts look for the best grills for our backyards.  When Weber looked around for the best place to expand, Weber found it right in its own backyard.  Today's announcement is a tribute to the strength and productivity of the Illinois workforce," Kustra said.<P>

"We are delighted to be expanding our operations into Huntley and look forward to a long relationship with the village of Huntley," said Jim Stephen, President of Weber-Stephen Products Company.  "We are thankful to the State of Illinois for its assistance."<P>

Huntley Village President Jim Dhamer commended the cooperation of state and local officials in putting the project together.  "Everyone involved in bringing this facility to Huntley put in long hours and showed tremendous determination.  I am thrilled that the Weber-Stephens project will soon become a reality."<P>

In conjunction with The Prime Group, Inc., Weber will build a combined manufacturing facility and Midwest/international distribution facility on the 33-acre site, located two miles north of the Northwest Tollway and Illinois Route 47 in Huntley.  Construction will begin this month with completion of the buildings expected in the second quarter of 1997.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide a $287,500 Industrial Training Program grant for worker training at the new facility.  In addition, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide $530,000 for improvements to Illinois Route 47 and construction of Oak Creek Parkway from Rt. 47 to the site.<P>

George Stephen invented Weber Kettle in the late 1950s.  Now headquartered in Palatine, Weber-Stephen manufactures charcoal and gas grills and accessories that are internationally distributed.<P>

<H3 align=center>GOVERNOR AWARDS GRANTS TO ASSIST HOMELESS ILLINOISANS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced nearly $1.7 million in grants to assist 50 not-for-profit organizations in 34 communities in providing emergency assistance to homeless people.<P>

"Homelessness is a tragedy that exists in both urban and rural areas," the Governor said.  "We are fortunate to have a number of excellent organizations that provide homeless people with both temporary shelter and services that can help them become self-sufficient.  These grants will help many of the organizations continue to provide these valuable services."<P>

A Hillsboro project is an example.  A Salvation Army survey of agencies and law enforcement officials in Montgomery County found nearly 275 cases of domestic violence had been reported, and more than 300 orders of protection filed during 1995.  The closest available shelter for victims of domestic violence is more than 50 miles away.  The Salvation Army will receive a $73,799 grant to assist in renovating the second floor of its building in Hillsboro to serve as a shelter facility for victims of domestic violence.	<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants were awarded through the Emergency Shelter Grants Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"Without these grants, many facilities would find it difficult to provide services," Kustra said.  "The grants not only help with essential operating costs, but also help underwrite some of the expenses for food, transportation and medicine, as well as programs designed to help homeless people identify and address their problems."<P>

Federally-funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program provides funding for projects that help homeless people in communities outside Cook County.  Grants are awarded on a competitive basis to projects that demonstrate clear need, an immediate ability to utilize the grant, and complement existing homeless shelter activities.  The maximum grant is $75,000 and must be matched by an equal amount from other sources.<P>

A list of grantees is attached.<P>

<H3 align=center>GRANTS HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
REMOVE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. </STRONG>-- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $1 million to help 15 Illinois communities renovate public buildings to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.<P>

"Many small communities face financial hardships in renovating public buildings to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act," the Governor said.  "These grants provide local governments with the funds they need to proceed with the necessary renovations.  We want to ensure that regardless of their disabilities, all citizens may access public services."<P>

The grants are made available through the Removal of Architectural Barriers component of the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  <P>

Projects to renovate the Tuscola Public Library and the Joy Village Hall are examples.  <P>

Tuscola's library was built in 1903 with funds from the Carnegie Foundation.  The historic building is a two-story structure accessible only by stairs, with floors connected by narrow, steep stairways.  The City of Tuscola will receive a $145,000 CDAP grant to assist with the costs of installing an elevator, accessible restrooms, and constructing an accessible parking area.  <P>

Joy's village hall is the location for village board meetings and is the office of the village clerk and president, police department, and maintenance superintendent.  Citizens also pay village utility bills in the building.  The village will receive a $15,000 CDAP grant to install an entrance ramp and handrails, renovate the restroom to make it accessible, and install accessible parking.<P>

"CDAP grants are one of Illinois' most important tools to help small communities meet the needs of their citizens," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "This component was developed to ensure that even in small communities, public buildings comply with the provisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act."<P>

The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Applications for ADA grant funding were awarded following a competitive review that looked at a community's justification of project need, financial need, and eligibility of the activities outlined in the project implementation plans. <P>

Funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), CDAP grants are awarded by DCCA to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under this component is $150,000.  <P>

<H3 align=center>OUTDOOR RECREATION SUPER STORE EXPECTED TO BOOST ILLINOIS TOURISM</H3>

<STRONG>GURNEE, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World on the company's decision to build a 125,000 square foot super store featuring shopping and entertainment facilities at Gurnee Mills Mall.<P>

"Tourism is an important industry in this state and contributes nearly $16 billion to the Illinois economy every year," the Governor said.  "Gurnee Mills Mall has quickly become a leading travel destination, and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will lend new appeal for those who enjoy the abundant natural resources of Illinois and the entire Upper Midwest.<P>

"My administration and Bass Pro Shops also share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation.  Since 1991, we have significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling, and acquired and begun the development of site M in central Illinois, at more than 15,000 acres the largest property for outdoor recreation owned by the state.  Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a perfect match."<P>

In addition to separate departments for activities such as fishing, hunting and camping, the store will feature such attractions as a four-story natural stone waterfall and a rough-hewn log cabin with a turning waterwheel and stocked trout pond.<P>

The store will be the company's third in the nation and first in the Upper Midwest.  It is expected to open next spring and will employ about 300 workers.<P>

My administration and Bass Pro Shops share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation," Edgar said.  "Since 1991, the state has significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling.  In addition, we have acquired and begun the development of more than 15,000 acres of site M in central Illinois, the largest property for outdoor recreation and nature presenvation owned by the state.<P>

"Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a good match because we understand the importance of preserving open space and recreation opportunities for future generations," the Governor said.<P>

The Gurnee Mills Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will be modeled after the company's flagship store in Springfield, MO, ranked as Missouri's number one tourist attraction with more than four million visitors annually.  Bass Pro also supports numerous conservation efforts at the state and national levels. 	<P>

John L. "Johnny" Morris, President of Bass Pro Shops, said the company conducted an  extensive search of the Chicago and Milwaukee markets and chose Gurnee Mills as the best possible location for the new store.<P>

"There are significant numbers of fishing, hunting and outdoor enthusiasts in these markets, and we look forward to providing them with a great retail experience," Morris said.<P>

Laurence C. Siegel, Chairman and CEO of the Mills Corporation, said, "Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will be a great addition to Gurnee Mills.  It's a terrific blend of entertainment and shopping, with a great commitment to customer service."<P>
  
Developed in 1991 by the Mills Corporation of Washington, D.C., Gurnee Mills Mall is the Midwest's largest enclosed discount/outlet center, combining manufacturer's outlets, department store outlets, specialty store outlets and value discount retailers.<P>

Governor Announces $1.3 Million in State Recycling Program Grants
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced more than $1.3 million in grants to help Illinois communities, businesses and organizations expand or establish recycling programs.<p>

"Recycling is an important part of our effort to promote a clean environment," the Governor said.  "These grants will help us reduce our reliance on landfills by encouraging the collection and processing of recyclable commodities and supporting the practice of recycling in the home and workplace."<p>

The grants provide capital needed to improve and expand recycling services to Illinois consumers.<p>

Administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), the grants will fund 30 projects, including residential recycling projects such as curbside and multi-family collection programs, commercial programs for business, health care, educational and recreational facilities, and primary processing facilities.<p>

Grants are awarded competitively and may total no more than 50 percent of a project's cost.  Individuals may receive up to $50,000 for a residential or commercial project, while primary processing facilities may receive up to $100,000.  An amount equal to 10 percent of the money awarded must be used to purchase products containing recycled materials.<p>

DCCA's recycling programs are funded through the Solid Waste Management Fund.  Revenues in the fund are generated by a surcharge on the tipping fee on landfill disposal and are earmarked specifically for the programs. <p> 

Since the recycling grants program began in 1987, more than $12 million in state grants has been awarded to 316 recycling projects -- projects which have attracted more than $52 million in matching funds.  The 30 new projects are expected to attract more than $12.5 million in matching funds.<p>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the U.S. Department of Labor has approved his request for $5.7 million in federal job training assistance to help more than 400 workers dislocated by the closings of five Southern Illinois coal mines.<p>

"Although we agree that a clean environment is important, the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have had a devastating effect on the Illinois coal industry," Edgar said.  "We are working diligently to find new markets and explore clean coal technologies that will enable us to regain our market share.  In the meantime, we must ensure that miners who have lost their jobs can receive the training and other services they need to continue to be productive workers."<p>

The $5,755,360 grant was approved by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and was allocated from Clean Air-related national reserve funds under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  <p>

The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 416 miners dislocated from the Zeigler Coal Company's Old Ben Mine #24 near Benton and #26 near Sesser, Arch of Illinois' Captain Mine in Percy, Freeman United Coal Company's Orient Mine #6 in Waltonville, and Consolidated Coal Company's Rend Lake Mine near Sesser.<p>  

Job skill assessment, career counseling, job search assistance, relocation assistance, vocational/occupational skills training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance will be available to dislocated workers.  Because the dislocation was related to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, eligible workers also will receive needs-related payments.  <p>

These payments enable dislocated workers enrolled in training or education programs who have exhausted their unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to continue receiving an amount approximately equal to the UI benefit or the poverty level, whichever is higher.<p>

Training will be administered through the Management, Training and Consulting Corporation (MAN-TRA-CON) Service Delivery Area #25 in Zeigler.<p>

Grant to Help Displaced AATCOM Workers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois will work with the State of Missouri to administer a $5.85 million federal grant intended to provide job training and assistance to workers dislocated by the closing of the Army Aviation and Troop Command facility in St. Louis.<p>

"Last year, when the Department of Defense issued its recomendations for base closures, we successful argued the case for keeping several Illinois military facilities open, including Scott Air Force Base and the Rock Island Arsenal," the Governor said.  "Because approximately 800 of the 4,200 workers employed at the AATCOM facility were Illinois workers, we also teamed with the State of Missouri to try to keep that facility open, to no avail.  Now we must do all we can to help the workers being dislocated to find new employment.  <p>

"Illinois officials worked closely with their Missouri counterparts to pursue federal assistance for the workers who will lose their jobs as a result of this closing.  This grant ensures that these workers will be able to access the services they need to find new, productive employment."<p>

Edgar was notified of the grant's approval by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  Funds were allocated from Title III Defense Conversion Program funds under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 workers who do not transfer to other defense installations or retire.<p>  

Under terms of the grant agreement, the State of Missouri will receive the grant, and will contract with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to provide services to the Illinois workers affected by the closing.  <p>

Services to be provided include assessment of job skills, career counseling, job search assistance, job development and placement, classroom training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance. <p>

Because the dislocation was related to a base closing, workers can be eligible for assistance up to 24 months prior to the closure date.<p>

Training will be administered through Madison County Employment and Training Department (Service Delivery Area 22) and the St. Clair County Intergovernmental Grants Department (Service Delivery Area 24). <p>

Closure of the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command in St. Louis is slated for completion by December 15, 1997.<p>

Governor Approves Sales Tax Break for Oil Drilling, Exploration Equipment
</h3>

<strong>MT. VERNON, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation eliminating the sales tax on equipment costing less than $250 used for oil field exploration, drilling and production. <p> 
 
"This legislation will save companies involved in Illinois oil-drilling about $1 million a year, giving them new funds to maintain and expand their investments in Illinois," the Governor said.  "It gives this industry the same tax benefits other industries in Illinois already enjoy."<p>

The legislation, similar to a bill the Governor signed on Monday for the coal industry, eliminates the sales tax on equipment in the oil exploration industry costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

Chief sponsors of the measure, House Bill 2703, were Reps. John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon), Terry Deering (D-DuBois), Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Ron Stephens (R-Troy), Gwenn Klingler (R-Springfield) and Thomas Holbrook (D-Belleville) and Sens. Harry "Babe" Woodyard (R-Chrisman) and William O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon).<p>

It is effective immediately.<p>

Edgar Signs Kustra-Backed Coal Legislation; Measure Provides Tax Relief
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today lauded Governor Jim Edgar for signing into law coal legislation granting tax fairness and relief to Illinois' coal producers.<p>

The legislation is a product of Kustra's "Coal Strategy Group" formed in 1995 to identify ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal.  The group is comprised of leaders of the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies.<p>

"Our coal producers and miners are doing their best to meet the current challenges of today's marketplace," said Kustra.  "The tax savings will help to make the cost of Illinois coal more competitive with Western coal and encourage coal producers to invest in new equipment."<p>

The legislation signed by the Governor removes a current 6.25 percent tax on purchases of coal mining equipment and spare parts valued at less than $250.  Kustra noted that similar thresholds on the purchase of farm and manufacturing equipment were removed by the legislature in the 1980s.<p>  

"Today we are extending the same tax fairness enjoyed by other Illinois industries to coal.  I am grateful to Governor Edgar, the legislature and members of the Coal Strategy Group for making today's signing a reality," said Kustra.  "The elimination of this use tax is the first of many recommendations the strategy group will make as we look to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and work to ensure its positive impact on our local communities."<p>

Kustra also commended the legislation's chief sponsors, Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) and Representative Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro) for securing legislative passage of the measure.<p>

Governor Signs Tax Relief Bill for Illinois Coal Industry
</h3>

     <strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation saving Illinois coal producers about $2.5 million a year by eliminating the remaining sales tax on coal mining equipment and spare machinery parts.<p>

     "The coal industry in Illinois continues to face some very tough challenges," the Governor said.  "This legislation gives our coal producers the same tax benefits other industries already enjoy, and these tax savings will free up capital resources for maintenance, investment and potential expansion."<p>

     The legislation, developed by a coal task force organized by Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, eliminates the sales tax on coal mining equipment costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

     "This legislation is good for Illinois coal miners, it is good for Southern Illinois, and it is good for Illinois as a whole," Edgar said.<p>

     Edgar noted the Illinois coal industry has annual sales of about $1.5 billion and employs more than 6,600 workers in the state.  Another 20,000 jobs are supported by the coal industry.<p>

     "Today's bill signing is the best example of the good that comes when industry, labor and government work together to keep our workers and industries competitive," Kustra said.  "I am grateful to Gov. Edgar, the legislature and members of the coal strategy group for making this a reality."<p>

     Chief sponsors of the legislation, Senate Bill 1361, were Sens. Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville), Bill O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon), and Jim Rea (D-Christopher) and Reps. Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Bill Black (R-Danville), Terry Deering (D-Nashville), John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon) and Ron Stephens (R-Troy).<p>

     It is effective immediately.<p>

State to Assist Mine Workers Affected by CIPS Fuel Switch
</h3>

     <strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) to move immediately to assist workers affected by Central Illinois Public Service Co.'s plan to cease taking delivery of high-sulfur coal from the Delta mine near Harrisburg.<p>

     "Our response to this announcement is already underway," the Governor said.  "State government agencies will coordinate efforts to begin providing unemployment and job training assistance to the Delta mine workers, and we have applied for federal assistance under provisions of the Clean Air Act.<p>

     "While we applaud CIPS's effort to lower customers' utility costs, we are disappointed that it comes at the expense of Illinois mine workers and their families.  My administration is committed to finding new markets and exploring new technology that will shape a brighter future for the Illinois coal industry."<p>

     CIPS announced today that it will switch to burning out-of-state coal at its Newton Power Station Unit 1 in Jasper County.  CIPS had purchased 1.3 to 1.5 million tons of coal annually from the Delta mine of Amax Coal Co., a Cyprus Amax Minerals company.<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, explained that once the displaced workers are identified, DCCA will deploy a Rapid Response Team to visit the Delta mine and conduct pre-layoff meetings.<p>

     "Services provided to Delta workers will include assessments of job related skills, job development, search and placement, and supportive services such as child care and transportation allowances," Kustra said.  "Workers will also have access to classroom and vocational training, and IDES will make staff available for on-site filing of unemployment claims."<p>

Governor Congratulates Illinois Company for Largest Stamping Press Built in North America
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL. </strong>- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulaed Chicago-based Allied Products Corporation on the production of the largest automotive production presses ever built in North America, an order that added 100 jobs to the company's payroll.<p>

Three of the giant "A"-sized presses will be manufactured by Allied's Verson Division on Chicago's southeast side, two for shipment to a Chrysler production plant in Mexico and the third for use at Chrysler's Belvidere plant in northern Illinois.<p>

"The critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement argued it would cause the United States to export jobs across the border," the Governor said.  "Today is proof that NAFTA is creating good jobs for Illinois workers.  We are producing the goods that are necessary to produce goods throughout the world."<p>

"Illinois is an international powerhouse in the production of industrial machinery," Edgar said.  "Allied has made a tremendous contribution to our global reputation by being the first North American manufacturer of the "A"-size press, the largest machine tool made."<p>

Stamping presses make parts, such as fenders and hoods, from flat sheets of metal, usually steel.  The size and weight of 12 railroad locomotives, the presses are used primarily to make large body parts for automobiles and trucks.<p>

"We are also proud that Chrysler plans to use one of these presses at the Belvidere plant right here in Illinois and that two Illinois-made presses will be shipped to Mexico," Edgar said.   "This is a significant example of how the lowering of trade bariers is creating economic opportunity for Illinois companies and their workers."<p>

In 1995, the export of industrial machinery by Illinois companies reached $8.3 billion dollars, a 15 percent increase over 1994.<p>

Allied Products CEO Richard A. Drexler said the quality of the Illinois workforce has been a leading factor in the company's success.<p>

"Allied Products has been headquartered in Illinois for more than 30 years," Drexler said.  "The superb teamwork of our employees and our suppliers, coupled with the support of state and local governments, has enabled us to attain this milestone."<p>

The Verson Division of Allied Products Corporation is the only remaining American-owned-and-operated builder of heavy metal-forming presses.  Approximately 650 people are employed at the company's Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility.<p>

Hometown Awards Honor Contributions of Local Volunteers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Gov. Jim Edgar tonight congratulated winners in the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards, which recognize volunteer efforts that better the quality of life in Illinois communities.<p>

"Illinoisans have a strong sense of community," the Governor said.  "If there is a problem to be solved, or work to be done, we accept the challenge of changing things for the better.  Even the simplest project can make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens. The volunteers honored with these awards have planted gardens, tutored students, sponsored plays and festivals, and built libraries, shelters and police stations.  They are an inspiration to us all, and this is our opportunity to show our appreciation for their efforts."<p>

The Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy, was awarded to Woodford County for its "Heart House" project, selected as this year's project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism in Illinois.<p>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a homeless shelter in Woodford County.  Funded with donations, Heart House was opened in a former fraternity house near the Eureka College campus.<p>

When the fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  The result is a homeless shelter valued at more than twice its cost that provides needed services totally without tax support.<p>

In all, the Governor presented awards to 73 projects.  In addition, a special award was presented to Palos Hills, which has received an award every year since the program's inception.<p>

The Governor's Hometown Awards competition is administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

More than a hundred applications were submitted applications for this year's awards.  A group of volunteer judges reviewed the applications, judging them on the basis of local need and participation, continuity of the project and results.  The judges personally visited the communities they selected as finalists before making the final ranking decisions.<p>

Awards were presented in eight categories based on community participation.  Eligible projects involve economic development, community service, community facilities, human enrichment, achievements for or by youths and achievements for or by senior citizens.<p>

First place winners of general awards, youth awards, senior awards and economic development awards received commemorative plaques and road signs recognizing their achievements.  Second, third and fourth-place winners received plaques.<p>

A list of the 1996 winners is attached.<p>

Governor Announces Water and Sewer Planning Grants
</h3>

SPRINGFIELD, IL - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 26 communities throughout Illinois will share $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund planning activities for local water and sewer system improvements.<p>

"Adequate infrastructure is the foundation of community development," the Governor said.  "Improvements to local water and sewer systems enhance a ocmmunity's quality of life and its ability to attract and retain business.  These planning grants help local governments through the first stage of that improvement process."<p>

Edgar said a project in eastern Illinois is an example.<p>

Champaign County applied on behalf of the unincorporated area of Wilbur Heights for a sewer study.  The low-income neighborhood of approximately 80 homes is served by private septic systems, which are experiencing difficulties due to the soil type and small lot sizes.  Alternatives to the individual septic systems will be studied, including connection to existing treatment facilities in a neighboring city.<p>

Units of local goverment may apply ofr up to $25,000 for planning activities which will result in infrastructure improvements to water, sanitary or storm sewer systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said CDAP funds are especially important to smaller communities.<p>

"Infrastructure improvements are expensive," Kustra said.  "This program helps to remove the financial barriers a small community may face in upgrading their water and sewer systems."<p>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with population of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<p>

At least 51 percent of a proposed project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<p>

A list of communities receiving CDAP Planning Assistance is below.<p>

Governor Joins in Groundbreaking for $37.5 Million SuperValu Distribution Center
</h3>

     <strong>OGLESBY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined company and local officials in breaking ground for a $37.5 million Supervalu Inc. regional distribution center in Oglesby, serving a dozen states and creating more than 275 new jobs.<p>

     "This project is a terrific example of the economic development potential of Illinois' smaller communities," the Governor said.  "Our central location, high-quality transportation system and commitment to investing in infrastructure improvements continue to be major factors in attracting distribution centers and other facilities to Illinois. <p>

     "Supervalu expects to become the largest employer in the Oglesby area, with the likelihood of additional expansion.  State and local officials worked closely with this company to give Oglesby and the entire Illinois River Valley a significant economic boost."<p>

     Plans call for the 308,000 square-foot facility in LaSalle County to distribute more than 11,400 general merchandise and health and beauty care items to 1,500 stores in 12 states served by Minneapolis-based Supervalu, a leading food distribution company and the nation's 14th largest food retailer.<p>

     Jeff Noddle, President and Chief Operating Officer of Supervalu's wholesale food companies, said the new facility is an essential component in the company's plans for the future.  <p>

     "Supervalu's new multi-tiered distribution network will make major changes in the way food is distributed to our customers, and we believe ultimately this will have an effect on food distribution in this country," Noddle said.  "Today we celebrate the realization of many hours of hard work and much support from the State of Illinois, Oglesby Mayor Greg Cullinan, and many other representatives of Oglesby."<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the resources of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) were tapped to assist in the project.<p>

     "Our assistance with these infrastructure improvements was one of the key factors in bringing Oglesby and Supervalu together," Kustra said.  "Sanitary sewer, water main and roadway improvements are required to build and operate this facility."<p>

     DCCA will award the City of Oglesby a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to help fund the improvements.  <p>

     The Illinois Department of Transportation has committed $1.2 million in Economic Development Funds toward the cost of improving County Highway 23 and Mallick Road that will provide access to the Supervalu facility.<p>

     The roadwork includes intersection improvements at County Highway 23 and Mallick, new traffic signals and drainage work along Mallick Road.  In addition, a Tax Increment Financing District was created at the local level to facilitate the project.<p>

     The Midwest distribution center is the second of three Supervalu regional distribution facilities to be developed as part of the company's strategic reinvention, a multi-year process called ADVANTAGE from Supervalu.<p>

     Construction on the Oglesby site will begin immediately.  The company expects to begin shipping from the new facility in early 1998.<p>

Conference to Honor Top Illinois Exporters
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today urged established Illinois exporters as well as companies considering marketing their products or services abroad to attend the second annual "Crossing International Borders" conference May 16 in Chicago.<p>

"Illinois exports are at an all-time high," the Governor said.  "Our efforts to provide export assistance to Illinois companies helped boost sales of Illinois products in the global marketplace to more than $32 billion in 1995, as increase of 23.6 percent.  This conference is part of my administration's commitment to continued export excellence and even greater success for Illinois business."<p>

Highlights of the conference include presentation of the 1996 Governor's Export Awards to outstanding Illinois exporters and the keynote luncheon speech by Casey Cowell, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of U.S. Robotics.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, will open the conference.<p>

"The international marketplace holds tremendous opportunities for Illinois companies," Kustra said.  "Whether a business is a new to exporting or a sophisticated global company, 'Crossing Illinois Borders' is designed to help them explore the potential for overseas investment and export growth."<p>

The conference is the result of a public/private partnership between the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and Arthur Andersen, the leading global accounting firm.<p>

Governor Joins in Opening of New Ameritech Cellular Services Facility
</h3>

<em>RANTOUL, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined in ceremonies marking the official opening of a $2 million Ameritech Cellular Services call center at the former Chanute Air Base in Rantoul that is expected to create as many as 200 new jobs.<p>

"This facility is another milestone in Chanute's economic comeback," the Governor said.  "Working as a team, we have made aggressive efforts at the state and local levels to market the redevelopment potentials of Chanute, and those efforts are being rewarded with the creation of new jobs.<p>

"Ameritech has also cited the quality of the workforce in the Rantoul area as one reason it chose to locate here.  I am delighted that a company with Ameritech's record of excellence in customer service has given central Illinois worker such a strong vote of confidence."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the opening of the Ameritech facility is another indicator of the healthy economic climate in Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech has recognized our efforts to make Illinois a great place to do business for their company, and for the increasing number of companies which rely on access to state-of-the-art communications technology," Kustra said.  "Our strong economy has helped companies such as Ameritech market their products to Illinois customers, which in turn has produced the need for expansion, and new job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Explosive growth in the number of cellular and paging customer s in central Illinois prompted Ameritech Cellular Services to search for a site for the call center.  Chanute's 90,000 square foot former weather training facility underwent extensive renovation to create the new center.<p>

"Rantoul is thrilled with Ameritech's investment at the Aviation Center," said Rantoul Mayor Katy Podagrosi.  "I hope that Ameritech Cellular continues its growth here and throughout the region."<p>

The center is expected to provide 150 jobs by the end of 1997, and eventually in expected to employ as many as 200 people.<p>

"Ameritech's growth and investment in Rantoul reflects the leadership of Gov. Edgar and the General Assembly in developing a fully open and competitive telecommunications marketplace," said Doug Whitley, president of Ameritech Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech commends that leadership and the investment that the state itself is making to help train our expanding work force in Rantoul."<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $210,000 in worker training funds through the Industrial Training Program (ITP).<p>

Responding to billing inquiries and fulfilling customer requests such as the addition of new cellular features are among the services to be provided by Ameritech paging and cellular associates.  Requests from central Illinois customer were previously routed to operations in Chicago.<p>

Lt. Governor Kustra Announces Production of Chrysler Neon for Overseas Markets
</h3>

<em>BELVIDERE, IL</em> - Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today joined Chrysler officials at the Belvidere Assembly Plant to unveil a new right-hand-driven Dodge and Plymouth Neon designed for export to overseas markets.<p>

"Consumers in the global marketplace have come to expect quality and value when they purchase products made in Illinois," said Kustra, who heads economic growth and job creation efforts in Illinois.  "With record-setting exports in 1995 of $32.6 billion, Illinois has become a leader in producing the goods and services in demand abroad.  I am confident the new Neon will be another example of the manufacturing excellence of our Illinois companies and workers."<p>

The Belvidere Chrysler facility will be able to produce approximately 90 right-hand-drive models daily, or 32,000 annually, for shipment to markets in eight counties: Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, Cyprus, Cayman Islands, and Thailand.<p>

Chrysler invested more than $500 million in the plant to produce the first Neon, which rolled off the Belvidere assembly line in November of 1993.  The company subsequently announced plans to invest an additional $20 million in capital improvements and add 300 jobs at the Belvidere facility.<p>

Kustra noted that the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has provided $5.9 million dollars in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds to ensure employees of the Belvidere plant have the necessary skills to work in state-of-the-art auto plant.<p>

"Chrysler made a tremendous commitment to Illinois when the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the Neon," Kustra said.  "Our commitment was to provide Chrysler workers with the hi-tech skills needed to build the best possible automobiles.  It was a win-win proposition, and we are seeing the results in this announcement."<p>

The Chrysler Belvidere plant currently employs 3,700 workers and produces approximately 267,000 Dodge and Plymouth Neons annually.<p>

"The addition of right-hand-drive Neons to Belvidere will add incremental units to our production, but it means more than that," said Belvidere Assembly Plant Manager John Felice.  "Our ability to produce left and right-hand drive vehicles on the same line affords us additional flexibility in terms of responding to the global marketplace." <p>

Governor Announces Buyer for Spartan Printing Plant
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that a Mexican company will invest $6 million in the purchase of the former Spartan Printing facility in Sparta, Illinois, creating 300 new jobs and ensuring the continued  economic health of the southern Illinois community.<p>

"This is great news for Sparta and southern Illinois," the Governor said.  "The closure of Spartan printing was a severe blow to this small community, but our determination to find a buyer for the facility and provide new job opportunities for the affected workers has paid off.<p>

"My administration has also recognized the importance of maintaining excellent economic relationships with our top trading partners, including Mexico.  I am pleased that those ties have contributed to creating more Illinois jobs."<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will invest $1 million in the purchase of the Spartan Printing facility.  The company will also invest a minimum of $5 million in the purchase of state-of-the-art printing equipment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will be eligible for up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Grupo Serla will be encouraged to make every effort to re-employ individuals previously employed at the Spartan Printing Company.  In addition, DCCA will provide a list of those employees to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. for consideration for re-employment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. is also eligible for up to $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) funds.  The funds would be granted to the City of Sparta, which in turn would loan the funds to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V.<p>

Spartan Printing shut down earlier this year, laying off more than 800 workers by early February.<p>

DCCA has received $1 million in federal emergency funding from the U.S. Department of Labor to assist dislocated workers in returning to the workforce.<p>

Governor Edgar directed his staff to become personally involved in the negotiations leading to the purchase of Spartan Printing, including traveling to Mexico City to conclude an agreement.<p>

Lt. Gov Awards Grants for Multi-Company Network Demonstration Project
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL </strong> --  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra has announced that multi-company network demonstration project grants have been awarded to the Center for Governmental Studies at Northern Illinois University and the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.<p>

"This initiative is designed to improve the competitiveness of Illinois' small, medium-sized and mature firms," said Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "In multi-company networks, firms join forces to accomplish what they cannot do on their own." <p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) administers the program.  DCCA Director Dennis R. Whetstone explained that two key types of assistance are emphasized in the projects.<p>  

"Network broker training will prepare individuals to act as leaders in establishing manufacturing networks," Whetstone said.  "The brokers will link manufacturing firms to each other in order to promote cooperation.<p>

"Network planning and development will provide for activities which increase the capacity of firms across the state to establish networks or better operate existing networks, which then link them to key markets or public sources of assistance." 	<p>

The Illinois Chamber will oversee the Southern Illinois Linkage Study Project, which will receive $85,000 to inventory, classify and analyze the existing products, manufacturing processes, inputs and outputs of the manufacturing sector in the southernmost 30 counties in Illinois.<p>  

"Assisting businesses in the Southern Illinois region is a major priority for the Illinois Chamber," said Sally A. Jackson, President and CEO of the Chamber.  "We commend the participants for taking this progressive step in economic development.  More business and job creation are our goals, and we are very happy to have a leadership role in this effort."<p>

The results of the inventory will be linked to DCCA's Industry Analysis System, in order to provide a more comprehensive database for brokers and firms to use in building networks.<p>   	

The project is a partnership between the Illinois Chamber, Southern Illinois manufacturers, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Illinois Power, GTE, Carbondale Business Development Corporation, Williamson County Marketing Committee, and the Electric Cooperatives of Southern Illinois.<p>  

The Center for Government Studies at Northern Illinois University will receive $69,920 over two years to deliver broker training services.  The Center will utilize the services of USNet, a program which will supply consultants to train brokers and Center staff.  The Center will coordinate and facilitate broker training, provide technical assistance to networks, and conduct other activities to encourage the development of multi-company networks across the state.<p>  

The grant also serves as the required matching funding for a federal grant which has been provided to USNet to assist states in multi-company network development.<p>

Once the demonstration projects are concluded, the techniques learned will be transferred to local and regional economic development organizations to help them incorporate network development in their day-to-day operations. <p>	  

Anyone interested in further information about the demonstration projects may contact DCCA's Office of Program and Policy Development at 217/524-5696 or TDD 800/785-6055.<p>

Governor Unveils New Economic Development Web Site
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> -  Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a World Wide Web site that puts Illinois' technology and economic resources at the fingertips of manufacturers.<p>

"Illinois is becoming a national leader in developing unique ways to encourage economic development," Governor said.  "The new Illinois web site, using the technology of the Internet, will help companies locate and utilize sources of technical and business modernization assistance that can help them become more competitive.<p>

"It will help market the products of Illinois suppliers to manufacturers in the state and throughout the world.  It promotes economic development through a unique partnership between the public and private sectors, and it sends a clear signal that Illinois cares about manufacturing and is open for business."<p>

The site, designed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is the first of its type in the country to be electronically connected to a major on-line manufacturing publisher.<p>

The URL address for the site is http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/illcoalition.  Under an agreement with Thomas Regional Directory Company, Inc., Illinois will be the first state in the nation to connect its technology and business resources for manufacturers to the new on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Directory for the North Central Tri-State Region, the publisher's popular industrial buying guide for Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.<p>

"When I talked about this new venture in my State of the State address in January, I said i  will help attract new industry and jobs to Illinois by publicizing the expertise and skilled workers readily available from our universities and colleges, Argonne, Fermilab and other institutions," Edgar said.  "I am confident this one-stop shopping site will help make Illinois even more attractive to business expansion and job growth."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the site creates a virtual work space for manufacturers.<p>

"When fully completed by June, the site will enable interested companies to learn about the broad range of technical and business modernization assistance offered to small and medium-sized manufacturers through COMPETE, Illinois' statewide manufacturing extension network," Kustra said.  "Another highly innovative feature of the site is its direct connection to an electronic database providing a comprehensive listing of the technology resources in Illinois of use to manufacturers."<p>

The database is being developed with $175,000 in state grant funds by Argonne National Laboratory and more than 30 universities, community colleges, laboratories, research institutions and industrial organizations, collectively called the Manufacturing, Engineering, Research and Training Coalition (MERTC).  When finished this summer, the MERTC database will enable manufacturers to search a broad range of topics, such as computer-aided design, environmental issues in manufacturing, quality control and ISO-9000 certification.<p>

Users visiting the on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Network Directory (TREND) industrial buying guide will be able to review and order the products and services of thousands of Illinois manufacturers.  They will also be able to click on buttons throughout the site marked "Illinois Manufacturing On-Line" that connect them to the COMPETE web site.  Likewise, manufacturers using the COMPETE web site can directly connect to TREND.<p>

"The two-way Internet traffic between TREND and COMPETE will increase the use of both sites and will make it easier for manufacturers to access the Illinois resources and products that can help improve their business performance, " Edgar said.  "This project is the ultimate in one-stop shopping and confirms that Illinois is a leader in the use of technology to encourage job creation and economic growth.<p>

KUSTRA ANNOUNCES JOB RETENTION INITIATIVE
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Citing recent pro-business legislation and national studies that rank Illinois as a top location for business expansion, Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today announced a new initiative to retain Illinois jobs by alerting companies to new advantages to staying in Illinois.<p>

"In recent weeks, three national surveys ranked Illinois and the Chicago area among the top locations for business growth, "Kustra said.  "A few months ago, Industry Week magazine did the same.  There has been a sea-change in business that keeps getting better."<p>

"Illinois companies considering a relocation or other change affecting Illinois jobs could be strongly influenced by the vote of confidence expressed in these impartial survey results.  In the next year, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will contact 1,000 Illinois businesses to make sure they've heard about the great new business climate in Illinois, the new legislation enacted and the consistently high rankings we have earned.<p>

"By analyzing Dunn and Bradstreet data and looking at sales trends, we will target companies that are likely to outgrow their current facilities or show other potential need for the state's attention.  We'll make sure they know what they already have here in Illinois, and we'll make sure they know how DCCA can help them prosper in the years to come."<p>

The surveys reflecting Illinois' economic strength are:<p>
	
CFO Magazine, in January 1996, ranked Illinois among the top ten states for effective business retention strategies.  Said CFO: "Some states are doing a better job at (business retention) than others... While there is no way to scientifically rank the quality of retention efforts... 10 states, based on interviews with tax experts, stand out for their diligent efforts to cater to home-based companies."<p>

Site Selection Magazine last month published its annual survey of business relocations and expansions.  Illinois ranked in the top five, up form 21st just two years ago.  The Chicago metropolitan area ranked first in the nation among metro regions.<p>

Atlas Van Lines, the moving company, in recent weeks released a study of corporate executive relocations it was hired to perform.  The Chicago metro area ranked among the top destinations for corporate executives.<p>

Industry Week Magazine last summer surveyed its readers.  Illinois was preferred as a relocation and expansion site more than any other Midwest state, ahead of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.  Chicago was ranked as the third-most-popular city in the nation, beating out 16 other cities.<p>
	
"Taken together these surveys show an indisputable trend," Kustra said.  "We are reaping the benefits of our economic development policies emphasizing the things most important to business retention growth-including worker training, infrastructure improvement, export development, regulatory reform, and high-technology initiatives.<p>

"New legislation enacted in Springfield has given our state the most aggressive business growth strategy in a generation.  We are attacking unemployment insurance and workers comp cost. We are putting a stop to silly lawsuits without sacrificing legitimate legal rights.  We are holding the line on taxes.  Illinois has a whole new environment for business growth and we need to make sure business knows it," Kustra said.<p>

COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS TO INVEST IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, WORKER TRAINING AND TOURISM
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today recommended a $774.6 million budget for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to help Illinois businesses continue to thrive and increase their export capability in a strong and expanding state economy.<p>

The budget will provide additional assistance to business, invest more dollars in worker training, maintain community development projects and promote tourism throughout the state.<p>

"The Illinois economy is very healthy," the Governor said.  "In the past year, we have seen our unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in two decades.  Some of our most prominent corporate citizens, including Motorola and McDonald's, have announced major expansions, and national studies have ranked Illinois and the Chicago metropolitan area among the most attractive in the country for business expansions and relocations.<p>

"To continue our economic momentum and increase our competitiveness, we must be willing to renew our commitment to invest in the services and programs that have encouraged growth.  This budget allows us to train more Illinois worker, improves our ability to help companies and communities seeking assistance and expands our highly successful tourism promotion efforts."<p>

The Fiscal Year 1997 budget request includes $40.2 million in general revenue funds.  The budget also includes $600.4 million in federal funds and $134 million in other state funds.<p>

A highlight of the fiscal 1997 budget request is $39.2 million to fund business development programs.  The Regional Industry Development and Building and Sites initiative is designed to enhance DCCA's working relationships with local economic development officials and improve responsiveness to all in-coming business expansion, retention and location inquiries.  The Building and Sites component will allow the department to more accurately represent facilities and development sites to business prospects.<p>

"This budget makes an important investment in our businesses and our workers," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "Increased funding for worker training will help keep businesses in Illinois and make our workforce more competitive.  Worker training funds suffered severe cuts in the early '90s, but this increase recognizes many of our recent successes are due in large part to productive and well-trained workers."<p>

The high quality of the Illinois workforce is a key factor in business expansion and retention.  To keep pace with the demand for worker training, funding for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) will total $15 million, and increase of $2.75 million.<p>

"As technology in the workplace has advanced, so has the need for worker training," said DCCA director Dennis Whetstone.  "The ITP program has been highly successful in ensuring that the quality of Illinois workers is second to none, providing direct grants to individual companies and supporting multi-company networks of small and medium-sized suppliers.  This increase will give nearly 5,000 workers at approximately 350 companies the opportunity to upgrade their job skills."<p>

DCCA's International Business Division will use a budget allocation of $3.5 million to promote the exporting of Illinois goods and services throughout the international marketplace.<p>

An additional $200,000 in funding is provided to continue technology transfer and business modernization efforts provided for in the state's Technology Advancement and Development Act.<p>

The request also includes $2.3 million to fund the state's network of Small Business Development Centers, which provide one-on-one assistance to entrepreneurs.<p>

In addition, DCCA's fiscal 1997 budget request projects $237.2 million for federally funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, which assist dislocated workers, economically disadvantaged youths and adults, older workers, and other who face barriers to employment.<p>

Tourism and film programs will receive $33.4 million under the Governor's budget proposal.  An increase of $1.4 million in tourism promotion funds, generated exclusively by the Illinois hospitality industry, will be used by the Bureau of Tourism to attract major national and international events to the state, develop a heritage-cultural tourism program, increase individual contact with Illinois travelers through a direct marketing effort and handle increasing call volume to the 1-800-2CONNECT hotline.<p>

In addition, $13.6 million has been allocated to administer the Office of Energy Conservation, promoting the efficient and environmentally safe use of Illinois' energy resources.<p>

Appropriations for community development programs that assist low-income Illinoisans and provide services to local governments are proposed at $376.7 million.<p>

The budget proposal also includes $17.8 million for Coal Marketing and Development, of which $2 million will leverage more than $9 million in federal funds for a low emission boiler demonstration project to promote the continued use of Illinois' vast coal resources.  The budget also includes $600,000 in coal bond funding for an ethanol-powered fuel cell bus project and a corn-to-ethanol research pilot plant.<p>

</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today urged Illinois businesses and trade organizations to apply for the 1996 Governor's Export Awards.<p>

"International trade is one of the foundations of the Illinois\rquote  economic growth," the Governor said.  "The Governor's Export Awards recognize companies that have made outstanding contributions to this key segment of Illinois' diverse economy and encourage other firms to expand into overseas markets."<p>

"Our aggressive export assistance programs aid Illinois firms in trading with new established markets.  A recent $450,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development, one of only eight such grants awarded this year, will help businesses target emerging markets, including China And Mexico.  All of these efforts reinforce Illinois' status as an important presence in the global marketplace."<p>

"Illinois firms have what it takes to compete in the global marketplace," Kustra said.

Illinois exports consistently outpace the nation, thanks in part to our commitment to helping businesses maximize their export opportunities."<p>

The Governor's Export Awards program is administered by DCCA.  Awards will be given in three categories:  New to Export, awarded to Illinois companies that have successfully exported Illinois products for one to five years; Continuing Export Excellence, awarded to Illinois companies successfully exporting for more than five years; and Export Awareness and Development, recognizing Illinois-based not-for-profit organizations involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export awareness.<p>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES ENERGY GRANTS TO HELP 13 HOMELESS SHELTERS
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar announced today that $259,000 has been awarded to 13 homeless shelters to reduce their utility bills.<p>

"This is the fourth consecutive year the state of Illinois has provided funds to make homeless shelters more energy efficient and less expensive to operate, the Governor said.  The money saved on heating and lighting bills can be put into services that help homeless families and individuals get back on their feet.<p>

Support for the energy grants comes form the Homeless Shelter Energy Conservation Program operated By the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and taxpayers' contributions to the Homeless Assistance Fund administered by the Department of Public Aid.<p>

"The combined effort of DCCA and Public Aid allows the State to upgrade homeless shelters and  reduce their annual operating expenses, which frees up funds to serve people in need every day of the year," said State Public Aid Director Robert W. Wright.<p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said, "The cost of major energy improvements often exceeds the financial means of community organizations.  Offering this assistance is an investment in the future of these facilities and the homeless families and individuals they serve."<p>

Frank Marshall, operations manager for the Chicago Christian Industrial League, said, "A portion of the grant will allow us to insulate on of our nine buildings that was constructed more than 80 years ago.  We expect a major energy cost savings which we'll be able to reinvest into our job training programs."<p>

"A new, efficient lighting system that we will install will mean a savings of $7,400 a year," said Russell Kinzinger, executive director of the Home Sweet Home Mission in Bloomington.  "Money provided by the state for these improvements allows us to replicate savings over the years."<p>

Rebecca Payne, executive director of the Woman's Center in Carbondale, said, "We're delighted to receive funding from the state, which has been instrumental in supporting homeless shelters with these energy grants."<p>

Since fiscal year 1993, the state has provided a total of $1.1 million for 64 energy conservation projects at homeless shelters.<p>

This year taxpayers can again help the homeless by contributing $1 or more to the Homeless Assistance Fund on line 15d of the 1040 - Illinois individual income tax form or on line 7d of the 1040EZ form.  Taxpayers using the Illinois Department of Revenue's TeleFile program also cam make a contribution.<p>

Contributions are either deducted from a tax refund or added to the taxes owed.<p>

CHICAGO METRO AREA RANKS FIRST IN NATION FOR FACILITY LOCATION AND EXPANSION; ILLINOIS IN TOP FIVE
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the Chicago metropolitan area is ranked first in the nation in the categories of metropolitan area new/expanding facilities, and new manufacturing plants, in a n annual survey conducted by Site Selection magazine.  Illinois as a whole ranked in the top five in both categories.<p>	

"Illinois isn't just a great place to do business, it is becoming the place to do business," the Governor said.  "We offer manufacturers the advantages of a central location, an excellent transportation system and a superior workforce.  We invest in highly valued infrastructure improvements and worker training and we have enacted significant pro-business reforms that encourage growth.<p>

"Hundreds of companies have located new or expanded facilities in Illinois during the past year, more than half of them in the Chicago metropolitan area.  These expansions have created thousands of job opportunities for our citizens.  There is no better testimony to the overall success of our economic development policies."<p>

Site Selection ranked the Chicago metropolitan area first among metropolitan areas for new and expanded facilities with 265, and first in metropolitan area new manufacturing plants with 101.<p>

In the category of statewide new and expanded facilities, IIlinois is ranked fifth, with 451.  In the category of statewide new manufacturing plants, Illinois ranks fourth, with 142.<p>

"During the past two years we have seen our rankings improve dramatically, reflecting the economic comeback that Illinois has made," Edgar said.<p>

The survey also notes the strongest regional contender for new plants and expansion was the East North Central Region, led by Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.<p>

The Site Selection rankings echo the recent findings of other national surveys.  Illinois was first in the East North Central region in a relocation and expansion study conducted for Industryweek.  The same study ranked Chicago second only to Atlanta when companies were asked what major cities they would consider for new or additional sites.  In addition,  Illinois remains the corporate-transfer capital of the Midwest, according to a survey of household-goods shipments by Atlas Van Lines.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has worked diligently to assist companies expanding or locating new facilities in Illinois.<p>

"It's clear our efforts to build public/private partnerships and be more responsive to our business customer have paid off, " Kustra said.<p>

Published by Conway Data, Site Selection has tracked industry location trends for more than four decades.  The annual tally is based in the company's New Plant Database, which counts new and expanded corporate facility investments of at least $1 million, involving at least 20,000 sq. ft. and employing 50 or more workers.  The annual survey of new and expanded manufacturing facilities appears in the February issue.<p>

</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the state has received $1 million in emergency funding to assist the more than 800 workers affected by the closure of Spartan Printing in Sparta.<p>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation he called for in his State of the State message to help spur business growth and expansion through a $128 million cut in unemployment insurance taxes.<p>

"Coupled with an automatic $123 million reduction through the existing tax rate formula, this legislation means a savings of a quarter billion dollars this year for Illinois business," the Governor said.  "That money can bolster business growth and expansion rather than sitting idle in a government trust account."<p>

Illinois employers will save an average of 18 percent on their 1996 unemployment insurance tax bills because of the reduced rates.<p>

"With the state's unemployment levels at a 21-year low, we had fewer unemployment insurance claims, leaving a higher-than-expected balance in the U.I. trust fund, "Edgar said.  "This legislation strengthens our economy and gives Illinois employers a competitive edge -- without jeopardizing the fund or benefits for the unemployed."<p>

The year-end trust fund balance was $1.6 billion, $600 million higher than projected in 1992, based on a consensus of economic forecasts.  Unemployment insurance taxes are collected quarterly from employers and deposited in the fund, which can only be used to pay benefits to unemployed workers.<p>

"We will begin immediately to process the new tax rates, and statements will be mailed to all Illinois employers before the end of the month, " said Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Illinois Department of Employment Security.  "The new rates apply for the entire year of 1996."<p>

Under the legislation, the minimum rate is decreased to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent, and the maximum rate drops to 6.8 percent form 8.2 percent.  The rate applies to the first $9,000 in annual wages paid to an employee.<p>

The legislation is effective immediately.<p>

Chief Sponsors of the measure, House Bill 1740, were Reps. Terry Parke (R-Hoffman Estates), Verna Clayton (R-Buffalo Grove), Bernard Pedersen (R-Palatine) and Ann Hughes (R-Woodstock)  and Sens. Chris Lauzen (R-Aurora), Dave Syverson (R-Rockford), Martin Butler (R-Park Ridge), Dick Klemm (R-Crystal Lake) and Dan Cronin (R-Elmhurst).<p>

GOVERNOR UNVEILS PLAN TO ENHANCE CHICAGO'S POTENTIAL FOR ATTRACTING MEGA CONVENTIONS, ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS AND ATHLETIC EVENTS WITHOUT RAISING OR ADDING TAXES
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled his plan to enhance the potential for attracting mega conventions, entertainment shows and athletic events to Chicago by further expanding the McCormick Place complex.<p>

"Without raising taxes or creating new taxes, we have a tremendous opportunity to build a facility that will create thousands of jobs and bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy of the Chicago metropolitan area and the State of Illinois each and every year,"  the Governor said.<p>

Edgar pointed out that Chicago currently does not have the facilities to accommodate many of the largest conventions and assemblies.<p>

He said the entertainment and convention center he is proposing could allow the city to attract national and international meetings of such groups as the Promise Keepers, which would bring nearly $70 million into the city; Alcoholics Anonymous, which would bring nearly $50 million; the Youth Gathering of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which would bring more than $40 Million, and the Lions International convention, which would bring more than $30 million.<p>

"A super city should be able to host a Super Bowl.  The enclosed facility I am proposing will accommodate a Super Bowl, the Final Four and other events that could bring tens of thousands of people to Chicago.  These events would showcase a world-class city and a great state."<p>

Edgar said, "The facility also would offer the Chicago Bears a state-of-the-art home in which to battle for a Super Bowl berth.<p>

"As I have said repeatedly, I want to keep the Bears in Chicago, but I don't want to subsidize a professional sports team or build a football stadium.  Under this proposal, the Bears will help pay for a facility that can be used for many, many other purposes -- a facility that will attract millions and millions of people to events that have nothing to do with shoulder pads and helmets and pay huge dividends for the city and the state."<p>

The Governor said he is counting on the Bears to help fund the extension of McCormick Place.  "We need the backing of the Bears.  We need the backing of the Legislature.  And we need the backing of the Mayor of Chicago," the Governor said.<p>

"I am optimistic that support will be forthcoming.  It is difficult to imagine that we would not seize this great opportunity to launch an initiative that will create thousands of jobs."<p>

The Bears and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would share the cost of constructing the center, which is expected to take four years.<p>

The Bears would provide $175 million, and the authority would provide $185 million.  In addition, the authority would construct and operate a $50 million parking garage and garner all the revenues from it.  It also would contribute $5 million in construction-related administrative costs.<p>

The City of Chicago and the State of Illinois would contribute $25 million each for land acquisition and infrastructure costs.<p>

"The state has provided infrastructure for economic development initiatives throughout the state and typically called upon local governments to do their share.  This is consistent with that policy.  It is consistent with what we did at the United Center, and we will work together with the United Center to assure that it will continue to realize its full potential."<p>

The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would fund its share by fully utilizing revenues from taxes paid primarily by visitors to Chicago.  The taxes were supported in 1991 by the Governor, the Mayor and the Legislature to expand McCormick Place.  They are pledged at their current rates to bond holders through the year 2029.  However, they will produce a surplus that can be used to add the enclosed facility proposed by the Governor without raising or creating any new taxes.<p>

GOVERNOR TARGETS HEATING ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO EMERGENCY RECONNECTIONS DURING FRIGID WEATHER
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today ordered that $5.2 million in heating assistance funds be targeted toward re-establishing utility service for low-income Illinois households that are currently without heat.<p>

"This week's record-setting bitter cold has dramatically heightened the urgent need for emergency heating assistance," the Governor said.  "For those with no utility service, the frigid weather is life-threatening.  Our immediate priority must be to reconnect low-income residents who do not have the financial means to re-establish electrical and heating service on their own.<p>

"I have directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to work with local organizations to meet the current demand for emergency services before making funds available for other forms of assistance."<p>

Of the $5.2 million in Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $1.8 million will be allocated to the City of Chicago.  The remainder of the funds will be distributed throughout the state on the basis of population, poverty, heating degree days and fuel costs.<p>

"Emergency assistance is available to eligible households that are disconnected from their primary and/or secondary utilities, or where a supplier has refused to deliver fuel without immediate payment," Edgar said.  "This assistance may also be available to help households with repair or replacement of inoperable heating systems."<p>

The amount of emergency assistance is the minimum amount necessary for reconnection of energy services.  Emergency assistance payments may not exceed a total of $500 per year per household, and eligible households are limited to one emergency assistance payment for the primary energy source and one for the secondary energy source.<p>

Applicants must prove that they are low-income, responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or the delivered fuel vendor and have made a "good-faith effort" to maintain their energy services.  A good-faith effort is defined as having paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

LIHEAP funds may also be used to provide a one-time payment to utilities on behalf of eligible households.  The payment is applied toward a participant's energy bill.<p>

Including the $5.2 million, Illinois has received $50.2 million in federal LIHEAP funding to assist low-income residents during the current winter.  Approximately 7,000 residents have already received emergency assistance.  An additional 140-,000 have received energy assistance.<p>

Even with the addition of the latest round of funding, the federal government has provided only two-thirds of last year's funding, when $74.7 million was used to assist 13,000 residents with emergency reconnection assistance and 210,000 residents with energy assistance.<p>

For information about the program, residents may call DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline at 800/252-8643 or 800/419-0667 (TDD).<p>

<h3>GOVERNOR AWARDS REHABILITATION GRANTS TO IMPROVE HOUSING IN 31 ILLINOIS COMMUNITIES</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded $7 million in grants to assist 31 Illinois communities in efforts to renovate substandard housing.<p>

"Safe, decent housing is important to the well-being of all Illinois families," the Governor said.  "home repairs, such as replacing a roof for making plumbing and electrical improvements, are often beyond the budgets of low-income families, as well as too costly for those with disabilities and senior citizens surviving on fixed incomes.<p>

"These grants will help smaller communities throughout the state rehabilitate hundreds of aging and unsafe homes.  They represent an investment in better living conditions for thousands of people, and they represent a commitment to a better overall quality of life in Illinois."<p>

Examples of the grant program include rehabilitation projects in Carbondale, Newton and Monmouth.<p>

Carbondale will receive $350,000 to assist in rehabilitating 28 homes.  This year's grant continues efforts to improve housing the northeast section of the city, where nearly a third of the homes are more than 40 years old.  Improvements will include roof repairs, upgrading electrical and plumbing systems and correcting other deficiencies.<p>

Monmouth will use $188,000 to implement a housing rehabilitation program.  Twenty home located in the south central section of the community are targeted for assistance.  Nearly half of the homes in the neighborhood were constructed prior to 1940, and lower income residents have had difficulty in maintaining the integrity of their homes.  Improvements are designed to bring the properties up to code.<p>

Newton, in Jasper County, will use $194,500 to undertake the second phase of a housing rehabilitation project for 15 owner-occupied homes.  Local officials surveying the targeted area reported extensive deterioration of the modes, single-family frame structures.  All of the homes have common problems such as damaged roofs, inadequate wiring and out-dated plumbing and heating systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the housing rehabilitation grants represent just one component of the Community Development assistance Program (CDAP) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

"Smaller communities across Illinois continue to benefit from this program," Kustra said.  "CDAP grants are awarded for a number of different purposes - they include making public infrastructure improvements, encouraging business development, and providing greater accessibility to government buildings.  Today we are announcing assistance to upgrade substandard housing.<p>

"All of these components fit together to help local governments make their communities better places to live, work and raise a family."<p>

The community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD. The maximum grant is $400,000.<p>

<h3>GOVERNOR APPLAUDS PRODUCTION OF NEW ETHANOL POWERED FORD; ALSO AWARD JOB TRAINING GRANT</h3>

CHICAGO, ILL. --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined officials from Ford Motor Company and the corn industry in launching production at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant of a redesigned flexible fuel Ford Taurus optimized for the use of ethanol.<p>

The Governor also awarded the company an $800,000 job training grant to upgrade the skills of nearly 3,000 workers at the plant, the Chicago Stamping Plant and five supplier companies.<p>

"Illinois continues to be the nation's leader in promoting the production and use of ethanol," the Governor said.  "Illinois has the largest government fleet of ethanol-powered cars in the country.  We are the top producer of ethanol fuel, and motorists in Illinois pump more ethanol blended-fuel into their gas tanks than in any other state.<p>

"Ford's production of a new vehicle designed specifically for optimal operation with ethanol is another milestone in efforts to increase the use of this clean, renewable fuel derived from corn.  We are especially proud that a vehicle that can run on ethanol produced from Illinois corn is being manufactured by Illinois workers right here in Chicago."<p>

The new flexible fuel Tauruses are optimized for the use of E-85 fuel, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline.<p>

Rand Griffin, Chicago Assembly Plant manager, said "The Taurus in known to meet a wide variety of customer needs, a tradition that has made it America's best selling car for four years in a row.  With out latest flexible fuel Taurus, customers will have another way of making this car fit for their lifestyles."<p>

The Illinois Department of Central Management Services (CMS) has already ordered 40 of the flexible fuel Taurus models, and additional orders are expected.  Currently, there are 139 ethanol-powered vehicles in the state fleet.  Local governments throughout the state have purchased an additional 25 ethanol vehicles through CMS.  The state has also established 11 ethanol refueling stations for the government vehicles.<p>

 Vic Riddle, President of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, voiced appreciation for Edgar's efforts on behalf of ethanol.<p>

"The Governor has been a champion for this Illinois-made fuel.  He has put the backing of his administration and his political influence behind ethanol at the state and national level,"  Riddle said.<p>

Up to 6,000 of the ethanol-powered vehicles are expected to be produced.  The Chicago Assembly Plant produces a total of more than250,000 vehicles a year which are distributed throughout the United States and 17 other countries.<p>

The $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant will be used by Ford to train employees in areas such as the use of technical equipment, preventive maintenance and leadership skills.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant strengthens the state's partnership with Ford.<p>

"The Edgar administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge."<p>

The Industrial Training Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), is a state-funded program that assists employers with the training and retraining of their workforce.  ITP grants may be awarded to individual employers, as well as multi-company employee training projects.<p>

  Governor Applauds $38 Million Deere Development Project                  
</h3>





<EM>MOLINE, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined local officials in announcing a $38 million development project that will create 260 jobs in the Quad-Cities area and rejuvenate Moline's downtown area with the headquarters for John Deere Health Care.<P>

"This development project will pump millions of dollars into the Quad-Cities economy," the Governor said.  "The jobs to be created will provide opportunities for area citizens in field ranging from health care administration to retail, hotel and restaurant management.<P>

"There was intense competition from other states for the centerpiece of this development, the headquarters for John Deere Health Care, but this fast-growing corporation preferred to stay in Illinois.  Our willingness to make the needed investments in infrastructure improvements and worker training to help the Illinois economy grow has once again made the difference.  We are proving yet again that Illinois is a good place to do business."<P>

Richard Van Bell, President of John Deere Health Care, said the company was pleased to be located in a state with progressive job training programs for its citizens.<P>

"We commend Governor Edgar and the State of Illinois for supporting this project, which is an example of what government can do for the common benefit of its people," Van Bell said.  "This is a cost-effective way to upgrade the skills of our employees, which will improve their service and productivity, therefore having a strong impact not only on John Deere Health Care, but also our community and the state of Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said there was outstanding community cooperation in bringing the project together.<P>

"The public/private partnership we have seen demonstrated in pulling this complicated project together is a tribute to the leadership of those involved," Kustra said.  "All of the components in the development fit together to produce a complex that will create jobs and spur economic development."<P>

The development plan calls for the construction of a 100,000-square-foot building to serve as John Deere Health Care's corporate headquarters.  It will house 300 current employees, as well as another 100 employees to be added later.<P>

Another 160 jobs created by the development will be in the tourism-driven retail, hospitality and restaurant industries.<P>
	
Adjacent to the office building will be a 15,000-square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion that will serve as a destination point for the company's out-of-town visitors.  The pavilion will feature displays and historic exhibits and is expected eventually to draw up to 400,00 visitors.<P>

The development also includes a new Community Transportation Center that will serve as an intercity bus transfer center and a staging area for bus tour groups.  A first-class hotel is also planned to accommodate overnight visitors to the downtown area.<P>

The City of Moline, the Rock Island County Metropolitan Transit District, Renew Moline and the Quad Cities Civic Center Authority are all committing substantial resources to allow the development plan to move forward.<P>

The State of Illinois is providing more than $1 million toward the project, including a $600,000 loan to the City of Moline through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' public infrastructure program.  Up to $300,000 in job training funds also will be allocated over three years to assist John Deere Health Care with Worker training.  In addition, DCCA also has approved a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant for the program to rejuvenate the downtown area.<P>

The Illinois Department of Transportation also is expected to provide assistance for infrastructure improvements at the Arsenal Island Bridge to accommodate traffic flow and increased demand for parking. <P>

Governor, Motorola Announce Location of Worldwide Sector Headquarters in Elgin                    
</h3>




<EM>ELGIN, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined Motorola officials in announcing the company will locate the worldwide headquarters of its Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS) in Elgin, investing more than $40 million in a northwest suburban plant and creating 1,500 jobs.<P>

"Illinois' reputation as a great place for high-technology firms to do business continues to grow," Governor said.  "Illinois is becoming known as the Silicon Prairie because we deliver on our promise to provide the well-trained workforce, infrastructure improvements and excellent transportation system these companies require.<P>

"Motorola's steady expansion in Illinois has created thousands of high-quality jobs, and demonstrates the confidence of this communication giant tin our economic development policies.  This new expansion will further strengthen Illinois' partnership with a valued corporate citizen."<P>

Robert Growney, Executive Vice President, Motorola Inc., and President and General Manager of MIMS said, "the anticipated growth of Messaging, Information and Media Sector compelled us to find a site where we could support this opportunity.  The site in Elgin provides the ideal environment for us to significantly grow our business.  The interest and support from the State of Illinois, Kane County and the City of Elgin made it an easy decision for us to stay in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, said the facility will be a tremendous asset to the area.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) worked diligently to make this project a reality," Kustra said.  "MIMS produces some of Motorola's most innovative products, and we expect the Elgin facility to attract some of our best and brightest Illinois workers as the global demand for the latest in communication technology continues to skyrocket."<P>

The MIMS site meets the investment and job creation requirements for designation as a High-Impact Business Zone, providing the company with $1.7 million in tax exemptions.  In addition, DCCA has allocated $1 million for worker training through the Industrial Training Program.<P>

The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide up to $1.9 million for area infrastructure improvements, and the Illinois Toll Highway Authority will contribute an estimated $200,000 for roadway modifications.<P>

Kane County and the City of Elgin have also committed to invest in transportation improvements in order to make the project feasible.  In addition, an overall transportation plan already in place for the region contributed to Motorola's decision to locate in Elgin.<P>

The MIMS headquarters will be built on a 130-acre parcel near I-90 at the northwest corner of Elgin.  The facility will include general office space, manufacturing, and research and development.<P>

When completed in 1997, it will consolidate 750 jobs currently scattered throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, with an additional 1,500 jobs to be added by the year 2000.<P>

Illinois Communities Awarded Grants to Upgrade Public Water and Sewer Systems                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 87 communities throughout Illinois will share more than $22.6 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund improvements to local water and sewer systems.<P>

"Public health and safety, and the potential for economic growth, depend on our ability to maintain adequate public infrastructure systems," the Governor said.  "My Administration has made infrastructure improvement one of the cornerstones of Illinois's' overall economic development policy.  These grants will provide cities and towns with the financial tools to make much-needed improvements.<P>

Edgar said a project in Fulton County is an example.<P>

Boil orders are often issued in the city of Farmington because of severely encrusted watermains that frequently break or lose pressure.  Farmington will receive a $350,000 grant combined with city funds to make the necessary water system improvements including replacement of water mains and construction of a new water tower.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said growth in rural areas depends in part on maintaining Illinois' high standards for public infrastructure.<P>

"Adequate water and sewage treatment systems are an important selling point for communities hoping to attract new economic development to their areas," Kustra said.  "Assisting local governments in making these improvements is a sound investment in the future of our state."<P>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds form the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the six large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<P>

A list of the communities receiving CDAP public facilities and design engineering grants may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142. (TDD 800/785-6055).<P>

          Governor Announces $2.75 Million Tourism Grant to Help Chicago Host Democratic National Convention          
</h3>




<EM>CHICAGO, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $2.75 million tourism promotion grant to assist the City of Chicago with expenses in hosting the Democratic National Convention next summer.<P>

"The 1996 Democratic National Convention promises to showcase Illinois to the 35,000 delegates, alternates, staff, guests and media representatives expected to attend, and to an international audience following the activities," the Governor said.  "This grant is part of our commitment to the City of Chicago to be a partner in hosting a world-class event.<P>

"Sixteen cities competed for the economic benefits and prestige that hosting the convention will bring.  A spirit of teamwork in the public and private sectors helped win the convention for Chicago, and we will continue to work together to prove that Chicago was the right  choice, "Edgar added.<P>

The economic impact of the convention is expected to reach an estimated $122 million.  The grant to the City of Chicago Office of Budget Management is made through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.<P>

Other grants through the program this year include:<P>
<ul>
<li> $25,000 to the City of Chicago/Department of Cultural Affairs to assist with costs from hosting the fourth International Congress of Educating Cities<p>

<li> $28,961 to the Rockford Area Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs form hosting the 1996 ASA Men's Nationals 40 & Over Softball Tournament<p>

<li> $25,546 to the River Bend Growth Association, headquartered in Alton, which will assist with the expenses of hosting the 1996 U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Golf Championship.<p>

<li>n $18,400 grant to the Quad Cities Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs associated with hosting the NCAA Division I Women's National Invitational Softball Championship was announced earlier.<p>
</ul>
Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the grants are an important part of Illinois' overall tourism promotion effort. 
"Tourism continues to set new records in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Last year alone, travelers to our state spent nearly $16 billion and the travel industry employed more than 240,000 workers.  It just makes sense to encourage development of more public private partnerships to keep those numbers growing."<P>

The Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, funded entirely by revenue generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for the Tourism Promotion Fund.<P>

Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment for efforts to attract major national and international events to Illinois.<P>

Wal-Mart to Build Distribution Center in Olney
                    
</h3>




<EM>OLNEY, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will build a Midwestern Distribution Center in Olney, creating up to 250 new jobs within 18 months and as many as 400 fully operational.<P>

"Illinois is a leader in the warehousing and distribution field," the Governor said.  "our strong central location, coupled with an excellent transportation network, has already made Illinois the choice for nearly 300 Fortune 500 companies that have major regional or national distribution centers in our state.<P>

"One of the world's premier retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is known for carefully scrutinizing every detail when making location decisions.  I am delighted that the company's exhaustive review found Olney and Illinois to be the best location for this new facility."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, praised the public/private cooperation that made the project possible.<P>

"Officials for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) worked closely with Olney Mayor Tom Fehrenbacher and Stan Wieber, Director of the Richland County Development Corporation, to pull together state and local resources to help this company make its decision," Kustra said.<P>

City officials, the Richland County Boar, the Olney Township Board and Road Commissioner, the East Richland School Board and the Illinois Eastern Community College Board also assisted in making needed Enterprise Zone changes.<P>

The private sector played a crucial role in making the project possible, as well.  Central Illinois Public Service Company, the local GTE office and Norris Electric Coop all agreed to make utility improvements necessary to service the facility.  The First National Bank of Olney agreed to provide temporary office and storage space to Wal-Mart to enable the project to get up and running quickly.<P>

"This type of cooperation between the state, the community and the private sector demonstrates the depth of Illinois' commitment to helping businesses achieve success," Edgar said.<P>

DCCA will award a $640,000 Community Development Assistance Program grant to the City of Olney, which will be combined with $900,000 from the City to extend water and sewer lines to serve the new facility.  DCCA will also provide a grant of up to $250,000 from the state's Industrial Training Program to assist in training the new workers.<P>

IDOT will provide $300,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the roadway improvements needed to serve the site.  The improvements will include the construction of turn lanes form U.S. 50 into the Wal-Mart facility, and an eastbound truck acceleration lane from the site onto U.S 50.  The Department will also provide $90,000 for the necessary engineering and plan preparation for the project, as well as construction supervision.<P>

In addition, city and county officials have agreed to extend the Olney/Richland county Enterprise Zone to include the site, a move that will enable Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to benefit from state and local sales tax exemptions and other incentives.<P>

The 830,00-square-foot warehouse and food distribution center will serve Wal-Mart's Supercenter grocery stores throughout the Midwest.  Construction is expected to begin next spring, with completion slated for spring 1997.<P>

  Illinois Film Office Sets New Hi-Tech Production Guide Standard                 
</h3>




Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs director Dennis Whetstone announced today that the Illinois Film Office, working with Chicago based Brand X Filmworks, will soon distribute the Illinois Production Guide on CD-ROM.<P>

"The Illinois Film Office is responsible for ringing motion picture and television production to film on-location in Illinois.  Illinois is the first state in the country to digitize their resource manual, vastly expanding the amount and accessibility of information available to national production executives," said Whetstone.<P>

Brand X Filmworks has developed a custom application as an alternative to the printed 250 page Illinois Production Guide.  The CD-ROM offers easy reference on the set, on the road, or anywhere.  The user still has access to the names of local companies and individuals, in addition to newly enhanced information including catalogs, credits, and photographs.  Thousands of easily searchable answers will be at the film industry's fingertips.  Filmmakers will now be able to customize their resource information which can then be printed or saved.<P>

Beginning in October, 2500 discs will be distributed free of charge to motion picture and television industry leaders around the country.  The list will include production executives at the major studios in Los Angeles, independent production companies nationwide, cable producers, location managers, production managers, producers, directors, anyone who might have a say in deciding where a picture will shoot.<P>

"As the competition for on-location production dollars continues to grow, the Illinois Film Office must take an increasingly pro-active position in the marketplace," said Suzy Kellett, director of the Illinois Film Office.  "In addition to offerings the local production industry the opportunity to use the cutting edge technology of CD0-ROM to sell themselves more effectively, the Illinois and Chicago Film Offices have been actively promoting the State through other mediums."<P>

The first Illinois/Chicago Screenwriter Competition has just been completed to rave reviews.  In October, the Film Offices and Chicago labor leader conducted 22 meetings in Los Angeles on a joint sales trip.  Recently a 15-member industry Task Force Was formed to examine the local filming infrastructure and develop an industrywide national marketing campaign.  The Illinois Film Office has dedicated a staff member to be a Community Liaison responsible for monitoring locations and maintaining relationships with location contacts.<P>

All of these activities are designed to keep Illinois in the limelight as an on-location filming choice, because Kellett believes, "If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes."<P>

   Illinois Chosen to Implement One-Stop Career Center Network                
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</EM> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois is one of seven states chosen by the U.S. Department of Labor to implement a One-Stop Career Center Network.<P>

Illinois was awarded a grant of nearly $6.7 million form the U.S. Department of Labor to fund activities during the first year of the three-year project.<P>

"Illinois has always been at the forefront in designing services to help our citizens prepare for rewarding, productive careers," the Governor said. "It is natural, then, that our state should be leader in implementing the new One-Stop Career Center Network concept.<P>

"Two years ago, we started initial planning to consolidate career-related services administered by various agencies and educational institutions under one roof.  Our goal is to make it easier for people who need these services.  Rather than driving all over town, people can visit one place to get the information they need about a wide range of services, from unemployment assistance to job training and educational programs.<P>

"Already, we have opened full-service centers in Decatur, Rockford and Mattoon, and are well on the way to consolidating services in dozens of other communities around our state.  This grant will help us speed up that process so that people throughout our state will benefit from One-Stop Career Centers."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said state officials worked closely with local service providers to design the Career Center Network.<P>

"Although each center will be customized to fit local labor market conditions and customer needs, they will offer a standard set of high quality employment, unemployment and training services.  They also will make maximum use of computer and telecommunications technology to link center, increase program access and ensure efficient service."<P>

During the three-year implementation period, Illinois plans to establish 55 full-service centers and 93 satellite offices.  It is anticipated that 40 new centers will be operational by the end of the first year.  At the end of the three-year development period, people throughout the state are expected to be served by a Career Center.<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs, which administer Illinois' Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, said the centers will build upon JTPA's programs to help displaced and disadvantaged workers train for new employment.<P>

"Besides making services convenient to clients, we have built in a new component to tailor our services to the needs of the business community,"  Whetstone said.  "These centers will offer businesses and clients easy access to labor market information, making it possible for clients to match their skills with the places that need those skills.  Center staffers will also work with local businesses to ensure that participants are being trained in skills that those businesses need."<P>

Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Department of Employment Security (IDES), said the success of the early one-stop centers has been encouraging, both for the public and for the staff people who work in the centers.<P>

"Illinois has worked hard on its plan for a one-stop system of employment and training centers, and we are proud to have been selected as one of the states to fully launch this program, which offers comprehensive services in one location and also provides cost savings for the people who foot the bill, the Illinois taxpayers," Doherty said.<P>

Armstrong to Expand In Kankakee                    
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated officials of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. on their decision to undertake a $36.5 million expansion at the company's Kankakee facility, retaining 350 jobs.<P>

"My administration has made economic development a top priority in Illinois," the Governor said.  "In our efforts to convince Armstrong to expand in Illinois, we have seen a strong partnership both between state agencies and between state and local government to keep jobs in Illinois.  By choosing Kankakee over other sites, Armstrong has signaled its confidence in our quality workers, our excellent infrastructure and our competitive business climate."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, personally worked with Armstrong World Industries Inc. to help convince the company to choose Illinois for its expansion.<P>

"We have many tools to help companies grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "From enterprise zones to low-interest loans, infrastructure assistance and workforce training programs, our programs are designed to meet the needs of individual employers, both new companies and firms expanding for th future.  The bottom line is job - retaining jobs for current workers and attracting new jobs for tomorrow's workers.  I am pleased our negotiations with Armstrong World Industries Inc. have resulted in today's announcement."<P>

The Kankakee plant, located at Hobby and Brookmont Avenues, is among Armstrong's oldest vinyl tile production facilities, in operation for more than 47 years.<P>

The project will include construction of a new distribution center and a new commercial floor tile line.  Improvements are slated for completion during 1996.<P>

Several state agencies and officials were involved in the negotiations with the company.  The final incentive package is expected to include tax benefits from the company's location in the Kankakee River Valley Enterprise Zone and worker training assistance through the state's Industrial Training Program administered by the Department of commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

In addition, the company is expected to receive financial assistance through the Linked Deposit Program administered by State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, as well as low-interest financing through the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  The Illinois Department of Transportation is working with the company to meet its roadway needs.<P>

The City of Kankakee also has offered assistance through local Enterprise Zone benefits and tax increment financing (TIF).<P>

Steve Husak, Armstrong's Kankakee plant manager, thanked state officials, Mayor Don Green and the plant's employees for their interest and support.
"Without all their help, these projects would not have been approved for our plant," Husak said.  "These projects are very important to the future success of the tile business.  All of us should be proud the Kankakee plant has been selected for these investments."<P>

Governor Announces Infrastructure Grants                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced $2.9 million in grants it help 10 Illinois communities improve their public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is among government's most important responsibilities," the Governor said.  "Citizens turn to government to ensure that the water they drink is healthy and plentiful, and that waste is safely treated.  These grants will help these 10 communities address infrastructure needs that pose a threat to the health and safety of their residents."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants are awarded through the federally funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

"This program is among our most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and economic development needs," Kustra said.  "With these grants, communities have the funds necessary to undertake public facilities improvement projects needed to preserve the quality of life and help attract new development."<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) which administers the grants, said the 10 projects will be funded through moneys left unspent from other CDAP components.<P>

"These grants are funded through the community Development Block Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development," Whetstone said.  "When we draw up the budget, we allocate our block grant funds among several CDAP components that fund public facilities improvements, planning, housing rehabilitation, economic development opportunities, emergency public facilities needs and other projects.  This year, we determined that the best use for any unspent CDAP funds is to provide grants to deserving communities with qualifying public facilities projects."<P>

Whetstone cited a project in Jerseyville as an example.<P>

Jerseyville's central water supply began operations in 1923.  The average age of water lines in the community is 50 years.  One section"washed out" in 1989 due to its proximity to Otter Creek, and other sections often experience breaks, threatening the reliability of the city's water supply.<P>

Jerseyville will receive a $360,000 CDAP grant to assist with installation of new transmission mains, valves, hydrants and other system needs.<P>

CDAP grants are provided to communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under the Public facilities component is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

A list of communities receiving funds may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142 (TDD 800/785-6055). <P>

</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated company officials on the announcement that Hoopeston Foods, Inc. will purchase the Pillsbury plant in Hoopeston, retaining 50 jobs with plans for further growth in the future.<P>

"The City of Hoopeston has a long and proud tradition in the food processing industry," the Governor said.  "When Pillsbury announced plans earlier this year to close its Hoopeston plant, we began working with local officials and economic developers to find a buyer for the facility.  Thanks to this close cooperation, coupled with innovative programs from both the state and community, Hoopeston Foods will keep the food processing tradition alive in Hoopeston."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the project was made possible inpart by a $650,000 Participation Loan provided by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"This program enables the state to work with private lenders to make capital available to businesses like Hoopeston Foods that are creating and retaining jobs in our state," Kustra said.  "Our funds made it possible for the company to obtain conventional financing at a rate favorable enough to make the project feasible."<P>

The company will also receive a $100,000 participation loan from the Vermilion county Community Development Corporation, and a $100,000 loan form the city's revolving loan fund.  American National Bank and Trust, Chicago is the primary lender.<P>

John Steele, Hoopeston Foods, Inc. President, said the state and local support was critical to the project.<P>

"Financing of this project would not have been possible without a great deal of state and local assistance," Steele said.  "It has been a true public-private partnership to retain and grow a long-standing business in this community."<P>

Steele also thanked Hoopeston Mayor Robert Ault and the Hoopeston City Council, and Vicki Stewart of the Danville Area Economic Development corporation for their Assistance with the project.  Stewart, who said the state's involvement with the project was responsible for retaining invaluable manufacturing jobs for the Hoopeston community, commended Senator Harry "Babe" Woodyard and Representative William B. Black for their support.<P>

        Twenty-seven Communities Awarded Grants; Funds Help Plan Public Facilities Improvements            
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $500,000 to help 27 Illinois communities initiate formal planning for future improvements to public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is one of the foundations of economic development," the Governor said.  "While Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) public facilities grants can help many smaller communities fund critical improvement sot water and sewer systems, some communities lack even the funds necessary to compile the plans needed to seek the grants.<P>

"For that reason, we have developed a separate CDAP component specifically to help fund these planning efforts.  Once plans have been developed, the communities will be in a position to seek future assistance to actually undertake the improvements needed to meet their public facilities needs."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the need is always great.<P>

"Communities know when they have a public facilities problem; however, finding the best and most efficient solution to the problem may not be within their reach," Kustra said.  "Through this program, we can provide assistance that will enable many smaller communities to investigate the various alternatives and develop plans to solve their water and sewer needs."<P>

Projects in Biggsville and Stockton are examples.<P>

Biggsville, population 349, has no sewer system.  Many of the existing septic systems discharge into a community tile constructed in the 1920's, creating a hazard to public health and safety.  The village will receive a $10,800 grant to study various alternatives to collect and treat the sanitary sewer discharge.<P>

The wastewater treatment plant in the Village of Stockton is inadequate to meet its needs, placing the community on restricted development status.  Its water system is also insufficient, causing a threat to public health and safety.  Two major employers are particularly affected.  An egg washing and separating plant that has large wastewater treatment needs has been forced to cut back production and lay off workers to reduce its wastewater discharge.  An automotive systems manufacturer moved some of its production to another community because Stockton's labor force was insufficient - a problem made worse by a shortage of available housing in Stockton and the village's inability to undertake additional housing development to attract new residents.  The village will receive a $21,200 grant to review existing water and sewer facilities and develop alternatives to solve the problems.<P>

CDAP grants, funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are administered by the Department of Commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).  DCCA awards funds to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly form HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available under the CDAP Planning Assistance Grant component is $25,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

<h3>AMERICORPS--HELPING PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

AmeriCorps, a national service initiative administered in Illinois by DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity, is much more than just another service program.  It's a movement that unites diverse Illinoisans in efforts to improve neighborhoods and the quality of life for their residents.<p> 

AmeriCorps seeks to strengthen communities by providing manpower to help meet local educational, human, environmental and public safety needs, particularly those affecting children and young people.  Programs selected for funding recruit and train individuals who are willing to devote at least one year to serving as AmeriCorps members.<p>

Non-profit organizations, units of local government, state agencies, institutions of higher education or partnerships among such organizations are eligible for AmeriCorps participation.  Organizations submit proposals, which are reviewed by the 25-member bi-partisan Illinois Commission on Community Service (ICCS) and then sent for final approval and funding to the federal Corporation for National Service.  Successful proposals outline ways to meet identified needs, develop capacity by involving community volunteers, and have measurable outcomes to benefit the community.<p>

Organizations may apply for one of three different types of grants.  Planning grants provide organizations with up to $35,000 to plan an operational program.  Operating grants require a program design using 10 to 20 members and include funding for member support costs, staff salaries and administration.  The average size of operating grants is $250,000.  Education grants include awards for post-service education.<p> 

Participating organizations must operate an AmeriCorps-type program and bear total cost for the program.  This includes modest living allowances and health coverage for volunteers participating in the program.  Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds.  After completing a year of service (at least 1,700 hours), AmeriCorps volunteer members receive an education award of $4,725 which can be used to help pay off student loans or finance college, graduate school, or vocational training. <p>
 
To date, ICCS has awarded more than $3 million to 13 grantees to develop programs through non-profit and state government agencies.  More than 300 people have been employed as AmeriCorps members throughout Illinois.  These volunteers have renovated 12 homes, tutored 1,500 children, cleaned five Illinois streams, trained 44,000 people in health and  safety, provided 4,000 day care referrals, and delivered case management and assistance to more than 200 homeless individuals.<p>

The ICCS has been assured that funds will be available for AmeriCorps operational grants for the 1997-98 program year.  For further information about AmeriCorps, contact the Illinois Commission on Community Service at 800/592-9896 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS KEY TO THE ILLINOIS ECONOMY</h3>

The Illinois travel industry is flexing its muscles.  Recently, DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism reported that the growth rate of Illinois tourism matched or exceeded the U.S. growth rate for the 13th consecutive time.  By establishing new partnerships within the public and private sectors, expanding the use of technology, and administering an award-winning advertising campaign, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism expects to continue this outstanding growth.<p>

Tourism's success reflects positively on the overall Illinois economy.  During Calendar Year 1995 (the most recent data available), domestic and international travel within Illinois showed a direct economic impact of $16 billion -- a 3.2 percent improvement over the $15.5 billion spent in 1994.  This includes an 8.75 percent increase in international travel to Illinois, which is now the sixth most popular U.S. state for overseas visitors.<p>

Besides the direct economic impact, tourism generates jobs; in fact approximately one in 10 Illinois workers is directly or indirectly dependent on tourism for employment.  In 1995, the Illinois travel industry employed 335,500 workers and contributed to the need for another 354,700 indirect jobs.  The travel-generated payroll in Illinois was $5.8 billion, an increase of 3.8 percent over 1994.<p>  

Travel is also good for the state treasury.  Travelers in Illinois contributed $3.7 billion in taxes during 1995.  State hotel/motel taxes, a portion of which fund all Illinois tourism programs, were up 10 percent during that time, reaching $111.7 million.<p>

The Illinois Bureau of Tourism is working with its Illinois travel partners to continue this record of success.  In addition to the successful "Million Miles from Monday" campaign, the Bureau administers a sophisticated travel counseling system that enables customers to customize travel plans with a simple phone call (1-800-2-CONNECT, TTY users call 800/406-6418); a web site (www.enjoyillinois.com) that gives users trip ideas, trip planning opportunities and updates on festivals and events; and an ambitious international marketing initiative that targets travelers in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The Bureau also administers the Tourism Matching Grant program, the Tourism Private Sector grant program, and the Illinois Convention and Visitors Bureau grant program, which provide assistance to local units of government and local organizations to help promote and market travel-related activities in their areas.<p>

New technologies being implemented by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism enable the Bureau to identify Illinois' best tourism customers, thus making it easier to target efforts toward motivating them to travel in Illinois.  These technologies, combined with the Bureau's other activities, should help to keep Illinois at the forefront in travel industry growth.<p>

<h3>ENERGYWISE HOMES OF ILLINOIS GETS TOP BILLING IN SUN-TIMES ARTICLE</h3>

DCCA's EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program recently received front-page status in the Chicago Sun-Times weekend HOMELIFE section.  The story, which pointed out ways the program can help homeowners save substantial dollars while promoting energy conservation, has been a real boost to efforts to educate the general public about the benefits of home energy conservation.<p>

The story, written by Hilary Anderson, focused on energy-efficient mortgages that use standardized ratings to determine the energy efficiency of both newly-constructed homes and existing dwellings.  By qualifying for an Energy Edge Mortgage (EEM), those who purchase energy-efficient homes often can extend their debt ratios, thus enabling them to purchase a higher-priced home because of its lower monthly energy costs.  Energy Improvement Mortgages (EIMs) that finance improvements that make existing homes more energy efficient also are available to many current homeowners and those seeking to purchase such homes.<p>

To qualify for the special mortgages, homes must undergo an energy audit, conducted by a certified home energy rater.  These raters collect data on the home's energy efficiency and enter the data into a computer at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling.  DCCA then issues a home energy rating and a report that recommends areas where energy improvements could be made.<p>  

The ratings may be used by homeowners or builders to assist in qualifying for the special loans, but they also can be used as important informational tools in helping homeowners identify ways to increase a home's energy efficiency.<p>

For more information about the EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program, contact John Marley at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling at 217/785-2007 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>IMA ANNOUNCES TEAM EXCELLENCE AWARD COMPETITION</h3>

Move over Bulls, Blackhawks and Bears -- a whole new kind of team spirit is sweeping Illinois, and it's saving Illinois companies thousands of dollars every year.  Employees of Illinois companies are teaming together to develop innovative ways to improve quality, reduce costs and build enthusiasm on the job.  These impressive efforts are deserving of recognition, and they're getting it through the Illinois Team Excellence Award.<p>

The Illinois Team Excellence Award was founded by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association to provide a forum for Illinois employees to show how their involvement, teamwork and innovation make Illinois businesses more competitive and successful.  In the past four years, nearly 100 companies have illustrated their team projects in 15-minute presentations to audiences of peers, program judges and the public in the competition for this Illinois team-based quality award.<p>

Everybody wins in the Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Team players whose ideas have worked to better the company take to the stage with their projects and shine in the spotlight.  Companies supporting teamwork demonstrate and publicize their commitment to employee empowerment.  The program is an active exchange among the state's most innovative companies and employees, sharing ideas for a strong and healthy business climate in Illinois.<p>

Since excellence knows no boundaries, the program welcomes all Illinois businesses, be they manufacturing, service, government agencies, educational institutions and health care providers.<p>

This year, the Illinois Team Excellence Award program culminated in the IMA's Quest for Excellence, a day of teaching, training, learning and celebrating people and quality held in October in Rosemont.  Nine teams that had advanced from the regional stage of the competition polished their team presentations for one more performance to a record-breaking crowd.  While teams presented their projects throughout the day, breakout sessions featured expert speakers on issues such as management practices in the 21st Century, organizational survival in the next century, recognizing and rewarding employees and continuous quality improvement.<p>

In the end, Motorola, Quartz Products Division, of Schaumburg claimed the large company title, and Craftsman Custom Metal Fabricators, Inc. of Schiller Park netted the top small company prize.  The silver medal in the large company division went to Caterpillar Inc.'s Aurora plant, and bronze to Brach and Brock Confections of Chicago.  Rockford's Zenith Cutter Co. claimed the silver in the small company division, and Alpharma of Chicago Heights took home the bronze.<p>

Companies of all shapes and sizes with a plant or headquarters in Illinois are invited to participate in the 1997 Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Entry forms will be available in February.  A video of the 1996 Illinois Team Excellence Awards also is available from the Illinois Manufacturers' Association at a cost of $9.00.  <p>

For an application or more information about the Illinois Team Excellence Award program, contact Jane Frech, vice president of Public Affairs, at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, 220 E. Adams St., Springfield, IL  62701-1123.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS KEY TO THE FUTURE OF ILLINOIS COAL</h3>

Developing new export markets for Illinois coal is key to the future of the coal mining industry in our state, according to a new report, Export Markets for Illinois Coal, prepared for DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).<p>

The report notes that global demand for coal will rise dramatically over the next decade as more countries turn to coal for electricity generation.  In particular, the Atlantic market is expected to grow by 20 to 30 million tons.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Gov. Jim Edgar's senior adviser for economic development, said, "Our goal should be to identify where Illinois coal can be competitive and target those markets.  There are some 'niche' markets we should be able to penetrate -- markets where Illinois producers can deliver the coal efficiently and where the quality of our coal matches the demand of the buyers."<p>

Aggressive industry marketing resulted in a ten-fold increase in Illinois coal exports in 1995, reaching a record 2.7 million tons, with Morocco, Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark as major buyers.  Kustra noted that a new $2 million initiative, recently announced by Gov. Edgar, will be instrumental in OCDM's efforts to further market Illinois coal to prospective buyers.  The funds will be used to develop information and contacts that Illinois coal producers can use to target specific foreign markets.  <p>

"The Illinois coal industry continues to face many challenges," Kustra said.  "We are committed to working closely with the industry to help promote Illinois coal exports.  Exports represent not only a realistic marketing objective, but a potential stabilizing force in these challenging times."<p>

<h3>FEDERAL GRANT HELPS EXPAND TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED ILLINOIS MANUFACTURERS</h3>

Small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois just got a better tool to help their efforts to utilize new technologies to modernize and expand for the future.<p>

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recently awarded a $2.67 million grant that, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants and in-kind contributions from private resources, will help the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center (IMEC) expand and improve its services. IMEC, located at Bradley University in Peoria with sub-centers on the campuses of Rock Valley College in Rockford and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, is part of DCCA's statewide Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois.  IMEC field offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield and Edwardsville.  DCCA was a partner both in the creation of IMEC and in the preparation of the successful grant application.  <p>

IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The federal grant will help IMEC expand its offerings at existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  The goal is to ensure that 80 percent of the state's small and medium-sized manufacturers can access an office within 40 miles of their locations.<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger," said Gov. Jim Edgar.  The Governor pointed out that the grant, coupled with his administration's financial support over the past several years, will mean that the state's small and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

IMEC and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois replace the pilot "Project COMPETE" technology extension effort.<p>

For more information about IMEC or the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois, contact Jack MacLennan in DCCA's Office of Business Technology and Competitiveness at 312/814-2366 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>JTPA WINNERS DEMONSTRATE ILLINOIS' "CAN-DO" ATTITUDE</h3>

The Twelfth Annual Illinois Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Awards Banquet, held in Springfield in October, demonstrated once again why Illinois' workforce development efforts consistently lead the nation:  the attitude of JTPA's administrators, participants and the employers whose support of the program makes it all worthwhile.  Those employers include Kraft Foods, Inc. and WQAD-TV, winners of the 1996 JTPA Private Sector Awards.<p>

Kraft, nominated by the Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County (PIC), sponsors numerous programs designed to promote workforce development efforts.  From an education/teacher training program that encourages minorities to pursue careers in education and provides funds to institutions that concentrate on these programs, to contributing staff, funds and products to support PIC's efforts, Kraft has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to the betterment of the state's workforce.  Kraft also is a significant contributor to the Resource Development Campaign, a pool of funds contributed by private sector firms to provide scholarships for people who do not wish to seek public assistance but need financial aid to pursue skills training.  Kraft's leadership has been instrumental in convincing other companies to participate in the workforce development system.<p>

WQAD-TV, Channel Eight, takes its public service commitment to the Quad Cities area seriously.  When Special Projects Director Clifford Brockman heard that federal funding for the area's Summer Youth Program was unlikely, he approached the Workforce Employment and Training Center with a strategy.  The "Kids Count Job Exchange," using television to match job seekers with available jobs, was born.  WQAD staffers wrote scripts, traveled to local high schools to shoot video resumes from participating youths, amd approached businesses to encourage their participation as employers or sponsors.  A live broadcast, backed by phone banks, featured the video resumes and fielded calls from youths and potential employers.  The Kids Count Job Exchange helped ensure that many Quad City-area youths found the jobs they needed.<p>

Businesses like Kraft and WQAD-TV are instrumental in Illinois' efforts to build a skilled, productive workforce.  Also key are the efforts of individual programs, program staffers and participants.<p>

The TARGET program, operated by DuPage Job Training, is an example.  TARGET is designed to give women the ability to set realistic goals and plan a career path leading to economic independence.  The program includes career guidance, employment and training opportunities, life skills training and job search/placement assistance.  TARGET successfully graduated 93 percent of those enrolled in its 1995 program, with 77 percent of those entering employment.  Thirty-four percent were trained and obtained employment in a non-traditional job, far surpassing the U.S. Department of Labor standard of 6 percent. <p> 
Martha Kahle, Field Office Supervisor for the Northwest Suburban Employment and Training Center, Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County, is one of the JTPA staffers singled out for recognition this year.  As Supervisor, Martha has instituted policies in the Center to ensure that clients are served in a professional, courteous environment.  But beyond her administrative duties, Martha often works 12 hour days, Saturdays and Sundays to accommodate the needs of her clients.<p>

Typical of this year's participant winners was Angela Bowers, a single mother of two.  Although she worked in housekeeping at a local hotel, Angie's salary was not enough -- she needed public assistance to feed and support herself and her children.  Angie realized that her high school diploma would not qualify her for the kind of job opportunities she needed.  With the help of the Business Employment Skills Team, Inc. (BEST), the JTPA  provider serving Bureau, LaSalle, Lee and Putnam counties, Angie enrolled at Sauk Valley College studying medical transcription.  Despite her many responsibilities and the tragic death of her father in an automobile accident, Angie earned high grades.  Today, Angie has realized her dream and is employed full-time as a medical transcriptionist at KSB Hospital.<p>

JTPA's stories are often inspirational and always gratifying.  In Illinois, the private sector, state government, area service providers, staff and participants are dedicated to the concept that training, hard work and opportunities can keep Illinois' workforce among the best qualified in the world.<p>

<h3>MAPPING PROGRAM WINS NATIONAL RECOGNITION</h3>

The Mapping the Future of Your Community Program, administered by the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs (IIRA) at Western Illinois University and sponsored by DCCA and the Governor's Rural Affairs Council, recently received the 1996 Innovation Award from the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO).<p>

MAPPING, which is an acronym for Management and Planning Programs involving Non-metropolitan Groups, is a series of community-based strategic visioning and planning sessions designed to help rural community leaders create a long-term focus ad action plan for community and economic development.  Since its inception, the program has worked with approximately 50 communities, as well as more than 20 school districts and health agencies to help them develop integrated decision-making plans.<p>

Norman Walzer, IIRA Director, said MAPPING is an exciting program because it is based on local initiatives and incorporates University talent in addressing local needs.  "We're trying to create a seamless approach," Walzer said.  "We start with the MAPPING program to help a community set its vision.  This can lead to participation with DCCA's Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) or Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra's Main Street program, helping community leaders take the necessary steps to develop that vision.  Another step may be to bring in a Peace Corps Fellow to provide the necessary technical expertise to help the community further develop its goals and objectives."<p>

Steve Kline, director of the MAPPING effort, said the program often works with clusters of communities rather than individual communities.  "We try to get communities with shared interests to work together; for example, communities within a large rural school district might work together to develop a regional vision, as well as a vision for each community." <p>

Kline said the enthusiasm generated within the communities is encouraging.  "In Havana, community leaders wanted to open a shuttered movie theater.  With permission from the owner, they went in, cleaned up the theater, and held a community meeting there.  They turned on the lights, popped popcorn, and attracted more than 200 people who could see the vision in action and find a way to participate."<p>

IIRA staff work with about six new communities and five school districts each year, as well as following up with technical assistance to communities that have completed the MAPPING program.  A current project involves working with rural communities to help them create community home pages on the World Wide Web.<p>

MAPPING was featured at the NADO national conference as a model program and also will be highlighted in a special report to be distributed to community development professionals throughout the U.S.<p>

Gov. Jim Edgar visited the SIU-Carbondale campus in October to announce a $2 million coal marketing initiative to be administered by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  The new program will help Illinois coal producers expand their sales into growing domestic and international coal markets, and also address infrastructure limitations that affect the production and movement of coal within and out of Illinois.  Illinois coal exports increased to 2.7 million tons in 1995, up from 236,000 tons in 1994.  The new initiative is expected to increase coal exports to 5 million tons by the year 2000.<p>

<h3>APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE FOR GOVERNOR'S HOME TOWN AWARDS</h3>

It's time once again to think about honoring the commitments made by volunteers in Illinois communities by nominating their efforts for recognition in the 16th Annual Governor's Home Town Awards program.<p>

Any local government, community-based organization or volunteer group within Illinois is eligible to enter the competition.  Successful entries typically involve volunteer efforts to make their communities a better place to live, work and do business.  Projects must demonstrate broad volunteer support and participation.  Although projects that span more than one year are acceptable, judges will only examine activities accomplished within the most recent calendar year.<p>

Projects are judged using four criteria:  addressing a specific community need; heavy involvement of volunteer resources; generating results; and community support.  Projects compete against those conducted in communities of similar population size.  Each population category includes specific categories under which projects may apply.  These include General Awards (efforts on behalf of the community at-large), Youth Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's youths and/or projects that directly benefit youths), Economic Development (projects involving volunteers that help create or retain jobs in the community), and Senior Citizen Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's seniors and/or projects that directly benefit senior citizens.)<p>

Communities compete for first, second, third and fourth place awards in each of the categories.  First-place winners compete against each other for the coveted Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy awarded each year to the project most representative of Illinois volunteerism during that year.  Judging is done by a group of volunteers who represent organizations that have won Governor's Home Town Awards in the past.  Awards are presented during a recognition banquet, which will be held in Springfield in June 1997.<p>

The deadline to apply for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards is February 21, 1997.  For further information or an application guidebook, contact Lou Ann Ladage at DCCA, phone 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>1997 COAL CALENDARS NOW AVAILABLE</h3>
<h4>by Barbara Antonini, Office of Coal Development and Marketing</h4>

The 1997 Coal Calendars are now available!<p>

Each year, hundreds of fifth- and sixth-grade students from throughout the state submit essays and art work about the Illinois coal industry and its importance to our state.  The winning work is displayed in the Illinois Coal Calendar, showcasing their efforts.<p>

This year's calendar, the eighth annual calendar, is particularly noteworthy.  J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health at the U.S. Department of Labor, said the calendar reaches out to the mining community and is a daily reminder of the need for safety in our mines.  In fact, McAteer was so impressed with the calendar that he requested the original art work be available for display at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia.  Each poster has been matted and placed in an oak frame for the display, which provides an opportunity for many industry students and international visitors to the Academy to view the ways that young Illinoisans communicate important safety messages.  McAteer also sent personal congratulatory letters to the 25 students whose essays and art work are reproduced in the calendar.<p>

The 1997 Coal Calendar Contest was co-sponsored by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, and the Coal Research Center, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  To request a calendar or for further information about the contest, contact Barbara Antonini, DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, 325 W. Adams, Springfield, IL 62704, phone 217/524-3280 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA EFFORTS RECOGNIZED BY ILLINOIS EPA</h3>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN) recently received 1996 Certificates of Commendation from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) for their work in helping implement the "Clean Break" environmental amnesty program in Illinois.<p>

Clean Break, a recently-completed initiative enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, gave auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties resulting from environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program was founded on the theory that most small business owners want to comply with environmental regulations but need help to determine what those regulations are.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program served as an initial contact for the program, enabling business owners to seek information on a confidential basis.  The Illinois Small Business Development Center Network sponsored numerous local seminars to explain Clean Break and helped with intake.<p>

The IEPA's Certificate of Commendation recognizes individuals or groups for outstanding contributions to protection of the environment or other significant achievements in Illinois.  DCCA also receoved a Certificate for its work during 1995.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS F.I.R.S.T. PROMOTES ILLINOIS' POSITIVE BUSINESS CLIMATE</h3>
<h4>by Peter W. Ramirez, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. (Focused Industrial Retention Support Team) is off and running.  Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a joint effort that brings together the resources of DCCA and Argonne National Laboratory, NORBIC (North Business and Industrial Council), Chicagoland Enterprise Center, ComEd, People's Gas and the Chicago Tribune to identify and assist manufacturers interested in expanding, modernizing, relocating, training, retraining or developing new technologies.<p>    

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a pro-active effort that specifically targets manufacturers in Northern Illinois.  Initially, businesses are contacted with an outreach letter from Gov. Jim Edgar, which is followed up by a phone call from Illinois F.I.R.S.T.  After an initial screening, a Client Summary Sheet is filled out that establishes the position of the company and the problems and challenges it faces.  Resources and information are then provided to assist with the client's needs, with all activities tracked and recorded, and files monitored constantly.  In addition, a follow-up survey is sent to each client to provide Illinois F.I.R.S.T. with client satisfaction information.<p>  
 
The response of the manufacturing community to this pilot effort has been gratifying.  Using both marketing efforts and a direct mail campaign, Illinois F.I.R.S.T. has contacted 320 manufacturers.  To date, 70 of these businesses have received information or technical assistance with expansion support, environmental issues, integrated management support, production evaluation, relocation and site selection, training, workers compensation and turnaround services.<p>  

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. continues to work with the private sector to expand its efforts.  The partnership has engaged the Society of the Plastics Industry, American Plastics Industry, and the American Electronics Association to host industry summit meetings to discuss the needs of these specific industries.  It is working with the DuPage Area Association of Business and Industry to assist with client screening and intake.  And nearly two dozen additional professionals have agreed to provide pro bono services in their areas of expertise<p>.

For information about Illinois F.I.R.S.T., contact Peter W. Ramirez in DCCA's Bureau of Business Development at 312/814-5252 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TQM TEAMS MAKING A DIFFERENCE</h3>
<h4>by Karen Ruwe, DCCA Division of Fiscal Management</h4>

DCCA's efforts to incorporate the principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) into the agency's processes are beginning to show an impact that will benefit the agency's clients, as well as streamline DCCA's internal processes.  The efforts of the Grant Processing Team, for example, are expected to cut the time it takes for DCCA to process grants, thus improving the grants cycle for external clients.<p>

The Grant Processing Team set out last spring to review the manner in which DCCA processes and awards grants.  The Team conducted both cycle time and quality defect studies to determine where changes could be made.<p>

The Team's review resulted in the elimination of Financial Commitment Committee (FCC) approval for all grant programs that currently have an approved internal review process in place.  With the aid of the Chief Internal Auditor, quality review processes were documented and approved for most grant programs.  These steps are expected to cut grant processing time by approximately two weeks per grant.<p>

The Grant Processing Team also recommended standardizing the agency's grant boilerplates.  DCCA's Legal office, working with representatives from program and fiscal staff, has already completed work on standardizing boilerplate sections that are the same in all agency grants.  Meetings are currently being held to complete program-specific boilerplates.  It is expected that boilerplate standardization will lower the chances that incorrect boilerplate sections are used, and thus lessen the time needed for grant review and copying.<p>

The Grant Processing Team continues to look at new ways to streamline and improve DCCA's grant processes.  Areas now being considered for study include further automation of the review and approval process, and paperwork reduction efforts.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS BUSINESSES LEARNING TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS</h3>
<h4>by Don McGee, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling </h4>

Businesses are often large users of energy.  To help them identify energy conservation practices that can help them reduce energy usage, DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling and Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS), have joined with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIU-C) to establish a prototype energy educational project for regional businesses.<p>   

The new program, Creating Energy Management Opportunities for Industry (CEMOI), under direction of professor Manohar Kulkarni, PE, Ph.D., of the SIU-C Department of Mechanical Engineering and Energy Processes, provides businesses with on-site energy inspections conducted by the university's graduate and engineering students.  Each student receives specialized energy training from DCCA Energy staff and CIPS service representatives to teach ways to identify immediate, low-cost and no-cost dollar savings for businesses.<p>  

As part of the service, Illinois businesses receiving an energy inspection from CEMOI staff are provided an executive summary of the findings.  Participating businesses will receive an "Energy Analysis Report" identifying potential dollar-saving opportunities that require no financial investment or a small investment.  CEMOI also will develop and maintain, free of charge, an Energy Resources Directory, which will include information about private sector energy service providers in their region, as well as governmental and educational resources that are available to assist area businesses.<p>  

This fall, CIPS sponsored a CEMOI kick-off luncheon at the SIU-C Incubator.   Professor Kulkarni reported that in just the preliminary phases of the program, eight businesses receiving services have already realized an average savings of $1500 per business or 10 percent of their annual costs, with a maximum of a five-month payback on investment.<p>   

It is hoped that, with DCCA's assistance and regional support from the private sector, the CEMOI program will eventually become a self-sustaining business assistance program in Southern Illinois.<p>

The CEMOI office is located in the SIU-C Incubator facility at 150 East Pleasant Hill Road, Carbondale, IL  62901-6890, phone 618/453-2067.  Or, for further information, contact Don McGee at DCCA at 217/785-2862 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA WINS 1996 "WEB WARRIOR" AWARD</h3>

DCCA's Internet home page is winning recognition for its business savvy.  The page recently was named as the Sixth Place Winner of the "1996 Web Warrior Award" by Fuld & Company Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a pioneer in the field of competitive and regional intelligence that provides assistance to economic development organizations and utility companies to help them define their competitive advantages.<p>

Fuld & Company selected DCCA's site after a review of more than 100 Websites from around the world.  Using as its criteria Clarity, Strategic Focus, Business Climate, Depth of Resources, and Access to Information, company officials examined the sites from the corporate CEO's perspective and what that individual would need to know when considering relocating or expanding a facility in a region.  The company noted that, "With more than 50 million worldwide users and over 600,000 businesses on-line, the World Wide Web is today's global marketplace.  To effectively compete in this new arena, economic development agencies need to provide relevant, timely and targeted information to business leaders and investors."<p>

In reviewing DCCA's Website, Fuld & Company noted, "The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs wants your business in Illinois and they have the professional staff, relevant information, and assistance programs to help make your decision an easy one.   This is a no-frills, hands-on site that provides good, detailed information and access to individual assistance to help you find the right location."<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS DISLOCATED WORKER PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO WIN RECOGNITION</h3>

Illinois continues to lead the way in promoting excellence in its services to dislocated workers.  Recently, six more of Illinois' 26 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) were certified as members of the Enterprise, joining nine of their Illinois counterparts as members of this prestigious organization.  Today, nearly 58 percent of Illinois' SDAs are Enterprise members; nationally the average is only 25 percent.  The only states even close to Illinois in membership are Florida, where 48 percent of the state's organizations have won recognition, and Texas, where 34 percent of organizations are members.<p>

What is so important about Enterprise membership?  Selection to the Enterprise signals that a dislocated worker organization is dedicated to providing excellent services to its clients.  To receive membership in the Enterprise, an organization has to achieve at least an 80 percent placement rate for those enrolled in dislocated worker programs, meet or exceed the employment standard for Governor's reserve and national discretionary projects, achieve a rate of at least 75 percent on a standard customer satisfaction survey administered by an independent research firm, and demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in 10 quality management dimensions.<p>

Enterprise membership also is rewarding for those organizations that achieve it.  Members benefit from advanced training and assistance provided by nationally-recognized experts and their peers.  In fact, even the process of applying for membership has benefits because the organizations can get important feedback from the independent customer satisfaction survey.<p>

Illinois' leadership is nothing new.  Illinois has long been recognized as a leader in administering the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program.  Between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1996, 30,588 dislocated workers were served by Illinois' dislocated worker programs.  Of the 17,577 who completed the program, 8,623 re-entered the labor force at an average wage of $10.48 per hour.<p>  

Last year, nine Illinois organizations were named as Charter Members of the Enterprise -- more than any other state.  Equally significant, although only about 4 percent of the nation's SDAs are in Illinois, Illinois SDAs account for nearly one-tenth of the nation's Enterprise members -- a significant measure of the quality of Illinois' services.<p>

<h3>DCCA TARGETS "ORPHAN WASTES"</h3>
<h4>by Angie Adkins, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling</h4>

DCCA's Technology and Practices Demonstration Program (TPDP) has taken on the issue of so-called "orphan wastes" in Illinois.  Orphan wastes -- discarded materials other than conventional recyclables, such as aluminum and tin cans, glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and paper -- often have the potential to be recycled, but face obstacles due to collection and processing problems.<p>  

The Bureau of Energy and Recycling recently awarded grants to the DuPage County Solid Waste Department and a Springfield paint store as part of its effort to encourage more recycling of orphan wastes.<p>

Studies have shown that construction and demolition wastes may contribute up to one-third of the wastes disposed in landfills.  At present, only clean sources of concrete and asphalt rubble from highway construction are routinely recycled as aggregate.  The DuPage County Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Project will identify quantities and types of debris generated in the construction and demolition process, and identify and implement opportunities for recycling.  <p>

DuPage County will contract for waste audits of a number of selected construction sites that volunteer to participate in the project.  Each contractor will receive the results of the audit, educational materials on methods to separate and prepare wastes for recycling, a directory of recycling service providers, and an analysis of the potential savings in waste disposal costs.  The contractors also will be surveyed at a later date to determine whether recycling activities have increased, and by what amount.<p>

The $64,488 grant will pay for subcontractor costs to conduct the waste audits and to develop educational materials for construction and demolition contractors.  Project results will be used to create two documents -- a Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Manual, and a Directory of Construction and Demolition recycling service providers in the Chicagoland area.  The USEPA has agreed to pay for costs associated with publishing the manual and directory.<p>

A $15,474 grant to Friedman's Wallpaper and Paints in Springfield will enable the firm to purchase a Mobile Earth Safe Paint Can Crusher.  Up to 90 percent of the waste collected at IEPA's household hazardous waste collection events has been leftover paint.  A mobile can crusher can promote recycling by eliminating hand scraping, paint fume inhalation, drying time and storage consideration.  <p>

Under the project, citizens may bring leftover paint cans to Friedman's or other participating drop-off locations.  The cans are placed in the mobile can crusher, which can crush up to 15 cans at a time.  Excess paints, as well as the cans, are retrieved for recycling, with the cans sent to a local recycler for further processing.<p>

Because the equipment is mobile, it can easily be transported to other Springfield-area communities for paint can recycling drives.<p>

For further information about the Technology and Practices Demonstration Program, contact Angie Adkins in DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling, at 217/785-2808 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>HENDERSON, COIL NAMED "ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS OF THE YEAR"</h3>

Two DCCA staffers were recently singled out for special awards for their efforts to promote the state's economic development.<p>

Craig Coil, Manager of DCCA's Industry Development Division, was named "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Development Council (IDC) during its fall conference held in Chicago.  Tom Henderson, who manages several DCCA programs including the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program, was selected as "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA) at the organization's conference, which was held in conjunction with the IDC conference.<p>

Coil, who joined DCCA in 1988, heads a staff of 18 project managers and regional representatives who work to help businesses locate, expand and prosper in Illinois.  During Fiscal Year 1996, projects undertaken by the Industry Development staff culminated in a capital investment in Illinois totaling more than $1.2 billion that will create nearly 9,000 jobs and retain more than 14,000 jobs.<p>

IDC President Lori Healey said Coil was nominated by several colleagues.  "Craig works hard and has earned the respect of his peers across the state.  We felt he demonstrated the qualities we look for in an exemplary professional in the economic development field."<p>

The IDC has presented the award annually for more than a decade.<p>

IEZA President Jeanne Gustafson said the organization unanimously chose Henderson as the first recipient of its new award.  "Tom has served as an excellent ambassador for the State of Illinois and has initiated and coordinated several partnerships between local and state levels," she said.  As examples, she cited a contract between DCCA and the IEZA for training of local enterprise zone administrators, a joint effort to place an ad in Expansion Management magazine and an Industrial Park survey. <p>   

Henderson, an small business owner who served as an internal auditor for the Illinois Department of Transportation and in numerous private banking positions before joining DCCA,  is an active member of the IEZA, the American Enterprise Zone Association, the Illinois Tax Increment Association and the IDC.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF ILLINOIS' ECONOMY</h3>

Exporting continues to grow in its importance to the Illinois economy.  Every dollar of exports generates four cents in state tax revenue.  Equally impressive, one in eight jobs in Illinois (and one in four manufacturing jobs) is dependent on exporting.  In  1995, more than 453,000 Illinoisans were employed in jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.<p>

For the most part, these are both high-paying and permanent jobs.  Exporting companies tend to pay employees higher wages than plants that produce only for the domestic marketplace.  Exporting companies also tend to be larger than others; on average they are four times as large in employment and six times as large in sales.  Companies that export experience high worker productivity, estimated at 30 to 50 percent higher than in non-exporting companies.  Further, value-added per employee is up to 33 percent greater in exporting plants than in non-exporting plants, and sales per employee tend to be 50 percent greater in exporting companies than in non-exporting firms.  <p>

Export-related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois.  Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, substantially exceed the U.S. average.<p>

In addition, exporting companies are more innovative.  Exporters adopt new technologies far more frequently than non-exporters and report more significant benefits from doing so.  This tendency is especially strong in fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and transportation equipment -- key industrial sectors in Illinois.<p>

DCCA is serious about its efforts to help Illinois businesses expand their exporting opportunities.  With five International Trade Centers located throughout the state, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, and foreign trade offices in Brussels, Belgium; Hong Kong; Tokyo, Japan; Mexico City, Mexico; Warsaw, Poland; and Budapest, Hungary, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and seasoned companies alike enter the export marketplace and build upon their exporting potential.<p>  

The efforts are working.  Illinois ranked fifth in the nation among the top 10 exporting states in 1995 -- the second consecutive year our state improved its ranking.  Illinois' export growth is evidenced by double-digit export increases in 1993, 1994, and 1995  (24.6 percent, 20.2 percent and 23.6 percent respectively.)  Illinois exports reached an all-time high of $32.6 billion in 1995, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1994 and nearly double the 13.8 percent increase of all U.S. exports for the same period. <p>

<h3>BIDC WINS NATIONAL HONORS</h3>

As part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, the National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA) recently created two new awards recognizing researchers' contributions to the success of state economic development programs.  The  Illinois Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) program, administered by DCCA, won an Honorable Mention in the national competition.<p>

The Illinois Business and Industry Data Center is an innovative way to use an existing program to make it easier for small businesses, independent contractors, and entrepreneurs to access the statistical data they need to make critical business decisions.  Modeled after the U.S. Census Bureau's State Data Center and Business and Industry Data Center, the BIDC is a network of 28 local and regional affiliates, many from colleges and universities, regional planning commissions, public libraries, and small business development centers.<p>  

Local affiliates deal directly with small businesses and other end users of data.  Regional affiliates collect and disseminate information to both end users and local affiliates.  Regional affiliates also prepare quarterly regional analyses that can be distributed to businesses and development offices statewide.<p>  

The BIDC program magnifies DCCA's ability to serve the research needs of entrepreneurs and the Illinois small business community by enabling users to get information locally and tap the resources of a multitude of organizations throughout the state.<p>

NASDA selected the BIDC for recognition from 21 applicants.  In naming BIDC for the Honorable Mention, NASDA said the project demonstrated a key contribution to state economic development efforts, a unique approach to utilizing researchers as part of the economic development team, a potential for applicability in other states, support for economic development across program areas, and the ability to measure success for the research component of the activity, as well as the activity itself.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS COAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD AWARDS <br>
COAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FUNDING</h3>

Illinois continues to advance clean-coal technologies that allow for the environmentally sound, cost-effective use of our state's high-sulfur coal.  Most recently, the Illinois Coal Development Board awarded more than $3 million for the performance of 34 laboratory-scale research projects and two development-scale, clean-coal technology projects.  DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) will issue grants for these projects which will be monitored by the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI).<p>

Research into clean-coal technologies is essential to the future of Illinois coal because without these technologies, the market for Illinois' high-sulfur coal will erode.  Most of the basic and applied research is performed at universities, private research institutions and national laboratories.  The research is divided into five categories: coal preparation (cleaning), gas cleanup, coal-related wastes (by-products) management, conversion and combustion.<p>  

Two of the recently awarded projects are development, or proof-of-concept, projects.  The first will test a coal/water slurry in cyclone boilers at the SIPCO power plant in Marion, Illinois.  This technology will help to reduce nitrogen oxide levels (NOx), as well as some sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate in the flue gas.  NOx and SO2 are considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency as major contributors to acid rain.  The second development project will test high-sulfur coal in a flue-gas scrubber that will remove SO2, NOx , and very fine, respirable particulate.  Both projects are highly leveraged, so the Illinois Coal Development Board receives a significant "bang for its buck."<p>

Both projects are in step with the goals of the Board, which is chaired by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  The Board believes the time is now to build on existing markets and open new markets for Illinois coal, particularly since more stringent Clean Air Act emission limitations for SO2 will be enforceable in 2000 and 2005, and projected NOx-emission reductions loom on the horizon.  Illinois coal has many advantages, such as a high Btu rating, or heating value, but the high sulfur content is a clear disadvantage.  And, although many current, coal-fired, power company compliance strategies include use of clean-coal technologies, they also include switching to low-sulfur Western coal, which leads to a significant loss in Illinois coal sales contracts and related jobs.<p>  

This makes clean-coal technology research even more important.  The Board, the OCDM and the ICCI are faced with difficult decisions in determining which types of clean-coal technologies and marketing strategies to advance.  But, thanks to grants such as these, new technologies are being tested and, as technologies are advanced, more companies are projected to put them in place, thus rejuvenating the Illinois coal industry in the post-2005 period.<p>  

For more information about the funding of the research and development projects, contact Michael Purnell of DCCA's Office of Coal Development & Marketing at 217-785-0010 (TDD: 217-785-0211).<p>

<h3>LINCOLN FOUNDATION AWARDS PROMOTE ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE</h3>

Continuous improvement -- both in products and services -- is the key to organizational success in today's competitive global economy.  The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, which is privately supported, is helping encourage Illinois organizations to undertake continuous improvement programs and quality excellence by means of self-assessment tools, best practice workshops, conferences, and the relatively new Award for Business Excellence (ABE).<p>  

Similar to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, but adapted to the needs of Illinois, the ABE focuses on seven areas deemed essential for organizational success:  leadership; information and analysis; strategic planning; human resource development and management; process management; business results; customer focus and satisfaction.  The award is accessible to both small and large organizations in industry, service, health care and education.  Starting in 1997, the Award will also be available to state and local units of government.<p>

Participation in The Lincoln Foundation program provides a number of important benefits to organizations.  First, by using the Foundation's self-assessment guidelines, organizations can assess their operations against the Foundation's criterial of excellence.  Second, by attending best practice workshops put on by the Foundation, organizations can benchmark their performance with Lincoln Award winners, who share their experience with others.  Third, should an organization decide to apply for a Lincoln Award, it will receive valuable feedback about its operations from more than 60 leading experts from corporations and academia who serve as Lincoln Award examiners and judges -- at a nominal cost to the applicant.  And finally, participation in a continuous improvement program sends a strong signal to employees, customers and competitors that an organization is committed to excellence.  <p>

The actual process for applying for the ABE is explained in an Application Guidelines Book, available from The Lincoln Foundation.  At least five examiners review each application.  A panel of trained judges reviews the examiners' findings and determines finalists, who receive site visits.  Judges then determine if there are winners; winners receive awards at a formal ceremony in December.  Throughout this process, all application information is kept strictly confidential; only the names of Award winners are ever made public.<p>  

All organizations who apply for a Lincoln Award benefit, even if they do not receive an award.  This is because each organization submitting an application receives a detailed written feedback report that assesses its strengths and identifies areas for possible improvement.<p>  

Honeywell's Micro Switch Division in Freeport, and Cash Management Services at The First National Bank of Chicago, were last year's inaugural winners of the Industry and Services Awards.  Two new sectors -- Education and Health Care -- have been added this year, and Government Sector Awards will be added in 1997.<p>

The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence is currently reviewing applications for the 1996 Awards, which will be announced in November.  For further information, contact The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, 820 W. Jackson Boulevard, Suite #525, Chicago, IL  60607.<p>

<h3>NEW ORGANIZATION WILL ADVOCATE FOR ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESSES</h3>
<h4>by Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Saying, "Small business is big business in Illinois," Gov. Jim Edgar recently joined with many of the state's leading entrepreneurs to publicly announce the formation of the Illinois Small Business 100 (ISB100), a new advocacy group designed to provide insight, direction and guidance to the Illinois small business community.<p>

Their job is an important one.  Illinois has more than 617,000 small business owners, representing a diverse range of industries and services.  In fact, 85 percent of Illinois companies employ less than 100 people and, therefore, are classified as small businesses.<p>  

The ISB100 has targeted Internet services as an important way to communicate with Illinois small businesses. DCCA is facilitating the creation of the ISB 100's home page on the Internet, which will include a statement of purpose, as well as hotlinks to ISB 100 members' E-mail addresses, chambers of commerce and trade organizations.  Plans also call for creation of an ISB 100 newsgroup on the Internet to poll members about regulatory and business issues.  In addition, the ISB 100 plans to meet annually to discuss long-term plans and programs to assist in business development.<p>
 
Members of the group were selected from nominees submitted by trade associations, professional organizations, the Illinois Small Business Development Network, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and others.<p>

<h3>CAMP ENTREPRENEUR COMES TO ILLINOIS</h3>
<h4>by Susan Nicol, Office of Women's Business Development</h4>

Encouraging young women to pursue their dreams of entrepreneurship is one of the driving forces behind Camp Entrepreneur, an award-winning residential camp held each summer at Seton Hill College in Pennsylvania.  This year, DCCA's Office of Women's Business Development, in partnership with DePaul University's Department of Management, successfully coordinated Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago in Illinois.<p> 

In recent years, the original Camp Entrepreneur has provided comprehensive exposure to the principles of business ownership to more than 100 young women graduates.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago was designed as a week-long commuter day camp for young women in Cook County entering their junior or senior year in high school who have expressed interest in owning their own businesses.<p>

During the week, Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago campers participated in hands-on seminars presented by local business professionals who volunteered to work with the students in areas such as marketing, financing, management and effective decision making skills, business communications and technologies, utilization of resources, and creating a professional image.<p>

A highlight of the week was a full day devoted to site visits to Chicago area businesses that are owned and operated by women. The campers benefited from the presentations and discussions from a diverse group of women business owners who shared their experiences, and offered information and insight campers will reflect upon for the rest of their lives.  Another highlight was the campers' development of their own business plans, which were presented to a panel of business experts on graduation day.  Drawing upon newly acquired inspiration, their plans reflected the cumulative knowledge and skills they gained throughout the week, as well as true entrepreneurial approaches.  The panelists were unqualifiably impressed! <p>  

Historically, young women have not been exposed to entrepreneurship as a viable career option, nor have they been introduced to business skills.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago graduated 16 future leaders who are now positioned to recognize that they have the ability to run their own businesses, and they are equipped with the tools necessary to visualize their own futures and to create their own opportunities.<p>

With rave reviews from this year's graduates, sponsors, staff, and Chicagoland media, the Office of Women's Business Development and DePaul University are already talking about next year's program.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING CENTERS <br>
PROVIDE "ONE-STOP" ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS</h3>

All over Illinois, a quiet revolution is taking place in the way our state delivers employment and training services.  In March 1994, the first Illinois Employment and Training Center (IETC) opened, bringing together Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) services with those administered by the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES).  Within a few months, four more centers opened, and more than a dozen  centers were added during 1995.  The timetable is moving even faster today, thanks to a special grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to spur development of additional IETCs throughout the state to help both workers and employers easily access the employment, training and related social services information they need.<p>

IETCs are truly "one-stop" shops.  In the past, a dislocated or disadvantaged individual might have to travel all over town or between several different communities to access needed services.  He or she might need to visit an IDES office to register for unemployment insurance, a Service Delivery Area office to sign up for training and other services under JTPA, a Community College to register for classroom coursework, and to various other agencies to sign up for other services.  Likewise, some employers found it necessary to go to more than one location to obtain the kind of statistical information they needed to find skilled workers, and to access a pool of qualified potential employees.<p>

The IETC concept has changed all that.  IETCs consolidate these services under one roof.  For example, within a few minutes after walking into the IETC, a displaced worker can register for unemployment insurance, access computer job banks, sign up for JTPA programs, review a community college catalog, and receive the kind of detailed, one-on-one assistance needed to help get back into productive work.  At the same time, employers have access to qualified applicants, using Illinois' largest applicant database.  Staff at the IETC can identify individuals who meet a business' specific needs, from managerial to high-tech, to administrative support, and refer the best qualified candidates for the job.  Professional staff in the IETC also can help with specialized services, such as staff recruitment for mass hiring, customized training, and outplacement assistance.  The latest in statistics on the workforce and its skills is available, enabling businesses to locate potential employees.  In addition, employers can work closely with the local IETC to ensure that, as training programs are developed, they are tailored to meet the needs of the local employment community, creating a bank of potential employees armed with the skills local companies need.<p>

IETCs will also be a source of the latest labor market information (LMI) for schools, libraries and students.  LMI products will be available on-site and will be distributed by the IETC in hard copy and via computer.  Students and dropouts may also use the IETC to obtain career counseling and to learn about "second chance" education programs.<p>

IETCs offer an ambitious array of services.  They can provide career counseling to help workers assess their skills and research areas where those skills are needed.  They can help workers analyze their interests and pinpoint training that can help them learn the skills they need to follow their dreams.  They can even help students identify internship and apprenticeship opportunities that can lead to potential employment.<p>
 
Already, more than 40 IETCs are providing services to clients around the state.  <p>

More than 120 other agencies also are located in the IETCs, helping provide a truly comprehensive range of services.  Plans call for 55 full-service centers in Illinois by 1997, with more than 90 additional satellite facilities. <p>

It's easy to locate the IETC nearest you.  Check the IETC section on DCCA's home page on the Internet at http://www.ilcommerce.com/.   You'll find detailed information on the various centers, including addresses, hours of operation and telephone numbers, plus a detailed listing of services available to both employers and employees. <p> 

If you don't have Internet access, you can call 888/FOR-IETC (TDD users call 312/793-3184) to learn the location of the IETC nearest you.<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR<br>
Dennis Whetstone</h3>

Economic development is clearly a priority in most communities.  Knowing successful economic development techniques, however, may not always be so clear.   That's why, in October, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), along with the Illinois Development Council (IDC), will again sponsor the Basic Economic Development Course, designed to help economic development practitioners and community leaders help their communities become more competitive in the process of economic development. <p>

The Basic Economic Development Course is an intensive five-day course, directed by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and coordinated by DCCA's Rich Funderburk and Mary Renner.  Among sessions to be taught are building the foundation of a competitive community, influencing investment location, supporting existing business, stimulating international trade and entrepreneurship.  On Thursday, October 24, a special session will be held on "Servicing the Prospect."  That session is open to anyone interested in attending, even those who cannot attend the other sessions.  All sessions are taught by well-respected economic development professionals from throughout the United States, including Certified Economic Developers David Richmond of Shelbyville, Indiana; M. L. DuBrow of St. Louis; and Dean Whitaker of Holland, Michigan; consultants Kate McEnroe of McEnroe Consulting, Atlanta, Georgia; David Kolzow of Fluor Daniel Consulting, Greenville, South Carolina; and Eric Canada of Blane, Canada Ltd., Wheaton; John Quinn of the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, Carbondale; Doug Dougherty, executive director of the Governor's Rural Affairs Council; Michael Boer of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce; and Jeff Markland of DCCA's Office of Local Initiatives.<p>  

Participation in the Basic Economic Development Course provides graduates with a basic education that they can take back home and use in helping their communities become more successful in the economic development competition.  It also is the first step toward accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC), because graduates become eligible to attend the Economic Development Institute through the University of Oklahoma, where they can earn the coveted Certified Economic Developer accreditation.<p>

The October course will be the third Basic Economic Development Course DCCA has co-sponsored this year.  Already, nearly 100 DCCA staff people have completed the course, as well as staff people from many of our economic development partners, such as Small Business Development Centers, Community Action Agencies and others.  I feel that the course has been instrumental in helping DCCA staff to better serve you.<p>  

I heartily encourage economic development practitioners, local officials, chamber of commerce executives and others interested in making their communities more competitive to attend the next Basic Economic Development Course.  The course will be held October 21-25 on the campus of the University of Illinois-Springfield.  Registration should be made through the Office of Continuing Education, Campus Box 1084, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL  62026.  For further information, contact Dr. Robert Koepke at SIU-Edwardsville, telephone 618/692-2142, or Mary Renner at DCCA, 217/785-6097 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>SMALL BUSINESSES RECEIVE A "CLEAN BREAK"</h3>
<h4>by Annette Lingleo, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Nearly 300 Illinois auto body, auto repair and printing businesses have found it easier to comply with environmental laws, thanks to the Clean Break program, an initiative undertaken by DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).<p>

Clean Break is a program that gives auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts, while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties for environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program is based on the belief that most small business owners sincerely want to comply with environmental regulations, but need help in determining what the requirements are.  <p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program has served as the initial contact for the program, allowing business people to ask confidential questions while remaining anonymous to the enforcement agency.  Once a business owner feels comfortable in coming forward with environmental concerns, on-site technical assistance visits are arranged with the IEPA experts, who walk through a facility with its owner, discussing the business' specific requirements.  At that point, the owner can choose to go forward with the amnesty compliance agreement, working with the IEPA to set up a reasonable period of time in which to make corrections and achieve compliance with environmental rules.<p>

The Clean Break program was enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, which studied the challenges faced by small businesses in complying with federal clean air standards and other environmental rules.  To date, the program has received overwhelmingly positive response, and plans are now being made to expand it to serve other business segments.<p>

Clean Break also has had another benefit.  Working directly with small business owners gave IEPA officials a first-hand look at the impacts of various rules on businesses.  For example, many wastes from auto body and auto repair shops, such as oil filters and paint filters, are classified as "special waste," subject to additional disposal rules and regulations.  The IEPA discovered that the waste still ended up in the same place, but only after the business filled out mounds of paperwork.  The agency is now using the information it gathered to examine and correct rules that placed extra burdens on businesses while adding no protection to the environment.<p>	

To learn more about Clean Break, contact DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance helpline at 800/252-3998.<p>

<h3>STATE CLEARINGHOUSE NOW LOCATED AT DCCA'S CHICAGO OFFICE</h3>

Illinois organizations that receive federal funding are familiar with the State Clearinghouse.  Also known as the State Single Point of Contact, the State Clearinghouse must review all applications for federal funds before an organization may be eligible to receive those funds. <p> 

What organizations may not know, is that the State Clearinghouse is now a part of DCCA.  Administered by the staff of the Office of Policy Development, Planning and Research, the State Clearinghouse has recently moved to DCCA's Chicago Office.<p>

All correspondence with the State Clearinghouse should now be directed to:<p>

Virginia Bova, Single Point of Contact, DCCA, James R. Thompson Center, 100 W. Randolph, Suite 3-400, Chicago, IL  60601, phone 312/814-6028, fax 312/814-1800 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<hr>
<h3>WHAT IS THE STATE CLEARINGHOUSE?</h3>

Each year, the federal government awards billions of dollars in grants to fund a myriad of projects.  To ensure that state and local governments have a say in those projects, Executive Order 12372 was enacted in 1983, requiring federal agencies to designate certain programs and projects to be eligible for review by the states.  The Executive Order allowed each state to design a process to simplify giving state and local elected officials an opportunity to review and comment on these proposed projects.  Illinois created the Illinois State Clearinghouse, housed at the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), to handle this process.<p>

The process has several steps.  First, local grant applicants are encouraged to contact the State Clearinghouse prior to submitting an application to determine whether the grant they seek has been selected for review.  If so, the grant applicant submits the project proposal to the federal government, and sends the State Clearinghouse a standard form that includes basic project and program information.<p>

While federal officials begin reviewing the project, the State Clearinghouse assigns a State Application Identifier (SAI) number and distributes the project to reviewers representing 19 Regional Planning Commissions and 23 other organizations located throughout the state.<p>

Reviewers have 30 days in which to comment.  Any comments are submitted to both the State Clearinghouse and the applicant.  If no unfavorable comments are received, the State Clearinghouse issues a sign-off letter to the applicant, the applicable Regional Clearinghouse and the federal agency, noting the proposal's compatibility with state, regional and local development plans.  If negative comments are received, the sign-off letter will include suggestions on ways to address the compatibility defects.  Negative comments do not, however, prohibit an applicant from continuing the application process.<p>

The Illinois State Clearinghouse keeps on file a list of current grant applications submitted by various state agencies.  The State Clearinghouse also provides review for Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental assessments.<p>

<h3>NEW REPORT ANALYZES UTILITY RESTRUCTURING; EFFECT ON COAL</h3>

<em>by Dan Keefe, DCCA Division of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

As the electric utility industry moves away from regulated service and closer to a competitive marketplace, the Illinois coal industry faces an uncertain future, according to a new report from DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).  The report, "Illinois Coal Industry White Paper:  Understanding Electric Utility Restructuring," prepared by the Center for Regulatory Studies at Illinois State University, has been well-received by both coal and utility industry professionals as a thorough analysis of restructuring issues and their potential impact on coal markets.<p>

Just as telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking and natural gas industries have undergone deregulation, the electric utility industry is now being targeted by free-market policymakers whose primary objective is to bring down the cost of electric services by allowing market forces, rather than government regulators, to set the price of these services.  Federal and state governments are working to accomplish the goal by considering various scenarios for replacing regulation with competition.<p>

The OCDM White Paper discusses several possible outcomes of the various restructuring efforts.  First, there likely will be consolidation of electric utilities as they seek more efficient operating structures (for example, the proposed merger between Central Illinois Public Service Company and Union Electric.)  Second, most jurisdictions will move from the traditional rate-of-return regulation (cost plus profit), to a performance-based regulatory system where costs are separated from revenues, thus giving utilities incentive to reduce costs.  Third, many expect development of regional power pools, where spot market transactions, administered by an Independent System Operator (ISO) are prevalent.  Fourth, due to separation of electric utility generation, transmission and distribution functions, consumers will have greater choice in both the type of service they receive and from whom they receive it.  Finally, the generation sector of the electricity market is likely to become competitive first, since federal policy decisions over the last 20 years have largely negated the monopoly characteristics of power production, wholesale power transactions and resource additions.<p>

It is difficult to predict what these changes will bring to the Illinois coal industry; however, in the near term, some observers predict that with an emphasis on efficiency, existing coal-fired power plants will increase production because of their lower marginal generation costs.  This would trigger an increase in coal sales.  Still, over the long-term, it is likely that older, less efficient coal-fired generating plants could be retired or converted to natural gas.<p>

Thus, the newest challenge facing Illinois coal is to retain as much existing market share as possible, while seeking out new markets for this efficient fuel.  Nearly all electric utility restructuring analyses project a near-term gain, mid-term loss, and long-term benefit for coal as the cost-effective fuel of choice for baseload electricity generation.  OCDM will continue to work with the Illinois coal industry to ensure that this valuable commodity plays a prominent role in a restructured electric utility marketplace.<p>

For more information about the OCDM White Paper, contact Dan Keefe in DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, at 217/782-6135 (TDD:  217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>MEXICAN COMPANY OPENS SHUTTERED SPARTA PLANT</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar awarded a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to Sparta Mayor Greg Aitken, as representatives Pedro Booth and Sergio Guarneros of Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. looked on.  The grant is part of an $860,000 package of state assistance to assist Grupo Serla in renovating the former Spartan Printing plant.  The plant, which had been shuttered since February, is expected to employ at least 300 workers when it opens early next year.  Grupo Serla, Mexico's leading producer of Spanish-language textbooks, intends to target the U.S. market and also will pursue contracts with customers of the former Spartan plant. <p>

<h3>CONFERENCE HELPS SMALL AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES <br>
BECOME SUCCESSFUL EXPORTERS</h3>
<em>by Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio, DCCA International Business Division</em><p>

More than 650 business people learned valuable information to help them become successful exporters during the second annual Crossing International Borders conference, recently held in Chicago.  The conference, cosponsored by DCCA and Arthur Andersen, in collaboration with 22 international associations and agencies, provided exporters with the best and latest information on becoming effective exporters.  It also featured presentations by the managing directors of Illinois' foreign offices, who provided market updates on the Far East, North Asia, the Americas, Western Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as presentations by professionals from Arthur Andersen and other companies.<p>

Participants in the conference were greeted by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone, who spoke on the challenges and rewards of doing business overseas.  Luncheon featured remarks from Casey Cowell, co-founder of U.S. Robotics, a leader in the manufacture of information access products, who discussed his company's international strategy.  Participants had their choice of 36 concurrent workshops which covered the current status of trade agreements, export financing, legal concerns, customs issues, the human resource factor, reducing taxes, finding overseas distributors, protecting intellectual property, foreign sales corporations and international franchising.  The conference concluded with an International Export Forum, which featured the opportunity for one-on-one consultation with the experts.<p>

A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Governor's Export Awards.  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra presented the awards to 15 Illinois companies and associations, representing four categories.  Winners of the "New to Export" award included Westell International, Sabratek Corporation, Total Process Corp. and Visiontek.  "Continuing Export Excellence" awards went to Prince Castle, Inc.; The Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Fluid Management L.P.; Frasca International, Inc.; and DICKEY-john.  Awards for "Export Awareness and Development" were presented to the Automotive Exporters' Council, the National Housewares Manufacturers Association; Central Illinois Exporters' Association and the Illinois Wheat Association.  Winners of the "Community Service Recognition Award" were the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and JETRO Chicago.<p>

Illinois is the fifth-largest exporting state in the nation, with nearly 500,000 jobs linked to exporting.  The "Crossing International Borders" conference can help even more Illinois businesses become better exporters.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS OPENS PUBLIC E-85 REFUELING FACILITIES </h3>

DCCA's Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy works closely with Illinois agricultural organizations and automobile manufacturers to promote and expand the use of ethanol as a clean-burning, renewable transportation fuel.  The recent opening of the three public E-85 refueling stations will play an important role in that effort.<p>

In June, Mitch Beaver, Deputy Director of DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling,   participated in grand opening ceremonies at the E-85 station in Dwight at Exit 220 on Interstate 55.  With remarks from U.S. Congressman Tom Ewing, state Sen. John Maitland, Chet Boruff of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, Mike Lockhart of Growmark, Inc., Vic Riddle of the Illinois Corn Growers, and Beaver, the ceremonies highlighted the partnership that has helped to encourage expansion of ethanol usage.<p>

Ethanol is important to Illinois.  Our state leads the nation in the production of ethanol, and ranks first or second in the production of corn each year.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling assists this industry by managing numerous ethanol test and demonstration projects, and sponsoring the research and development of new and innovative technologies to help reduce ethanol production costs.  Among its projects are partnerships with General Motors and Ford Motor Company to field-test flexible-fuel vehicles designed to operate on either traditional gasoline or E-85 fuel -- a mixture of 85 percent denatured ethanol with 15 percent natural gasoline added to aid in fuel combustion.<p>

The new Dwight station, owned and operated by Livingston County FS and supplied by Growmark, is one of three E-85 stations now open to the public in Illinois.  Others include a SuperAmerica E-85 station in Des Plaines and a Mobil station in Springfield.  Plans call for up to 40 E-85 stations in Chicago, Rockford, Peoria, the Quad Cities and other communities in Illinois and throughout the Midwest.<p>

<h3>IEZA CONFERENCE OFFERS VALUABLE TRAINING</h3>
       
DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone joined Jeanne Gustafson, President of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA), and Tom Henderson, DCCA's Enterprise Zone program manager, at the Illinois Enterprise Zone Administrators' Training Session, held in June in Springfield.   More than 150 communities were represented at the conference, which featured sessions on incentives, zone marketing, reporting requirements, zone alterations and use of the Internet.<p>


<hr>
<h3>DCCA IMPLEMENTING "TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT"</h3>

Total Quality Management, or TQM, is a philosophy being embraced in many industries today.  TQM involves the entire workforce, tapping the knowledge and expertise of individual workers at all levels of responsibility to help find better, faster and more efficient ways of doing a job, whether it be manufacturing widgets or providing a service.<p>

Over the past year, DCCA has been incorporating the TQM philosophy into its programs and services.  Since June 1995, 120 DCCA employees have completed TQM training to help them understand the philosophy and procedures involved in the TQM process.  This training has helped 15 TQM "teams" begin work on studying various DCCA processes and procedures, researching and developing recommendations to streamline these activities while improving quality of the services provided to both internal and external customers.  For example, teams have studied the contracting process, grant processing, payroll procedures, policy letters and other processes and procedures undertaken daily within the department.  Ten teams have already submitted their recommendations for change to Director Dennis Whetstone and top management for their approval, and steps toward implementation of their recommendations have begun.<p>

TQM is expected to have many benefits for DCCA.  The philosophy brings DCCA's employees directly into the front line to help identify barriers to quality service and uses their expertise to develop ways to break down those barriers.  In addition, by improving the quality of its processes, DCCA will be able to serve its customers in a more timely and less cumbersome manner.  Finally, TQM gives DCCA's employees a sense that they are important members of a team working together to make the agency a better place.<p>

<h3>FORUM ADDRESSES RURAL POVERTY</h3>

<em>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</em><p>

Poverty is a problem that knows no geographic boundaries.  According to the 1990 census, poverty is particularly growing in non-metropolitan areas of Illinois.  As populations age and economic opportunities decline, rural communities need assistance to reverse the problem.  Phyllis "Phib" Bell of DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity is one of those actively working to help.  Saying, "We often forget that poverty also occurs in rural areas," Bell recently helped organize the "Pathways From Poverty Forum," held in Collinsville.<p>

The forum, co-sponsored by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the Farm Foundation, and the Rural Sociological Society Task Force on Rural Poverty, attracted more than 120 leaders from state and local organizations in 12 Midwestern states.  Some states sent as many as 15 people to participate in the conference, which was designed to increase understanding and awareness of both the individual and social aspects of poverty and stimulate thinking about steps that can be taken to create "pathways" from poverty.  Another primary objective was to build stronger relationships and facilitate communication among organizations involved in rural poverty.<p>

Forum participants developed a vision statement and action plan to stimulate more job opportunities, involve the disadvantaged in the political process, and increase access to more meaningful educational opportunities in rural areas.  The W. K. Kellogg Foundation has already committed seed funds of $1,500 to support a statewide rural poverty conference in November 1996 to continue advancing rural poverty initiatives.<p>

Members of the Illinois team participating in the forum included Ted Aggen, Mayor of Sterling; Doug Dougherty, Executive Director of the Rural Affairs Council, Lt. Gov. Kustra's office; Betty Green, Director, RIDES Mass Transit District, Rosiclare; Jack Halstead, Senior Editor, Association of Illinois Electric Cooperatives, Springfield; Sue Mahoney, retired teacher, Rosiclare; Jane Pfeiffer, Mayor of Elsah; Jane Poertner, Director, Central Illinois Economic Development Corporation, Lincoln; Ann Heinz-Silvis, Extension Specialist, University of Illinois Laboratory for Community and Economic Development, Urbana; and Randy Sumner, Vice President of Community Affairs, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.   <p>

<h3>GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS</h3>

Although large corporations grab the headlines, small businesses are the driving force behind America's economy.  Obtaining financing for business start-up or expansion, however, can be one of the largest hurdles for entrepreneurs.  DCCA's Small Business Division within the Bureau of Business Development is working to make sure that Illinois small business people know about the many programs available to help them achieve success.<p>

In April, the Division underwrote the costs associated with airing the public television series, "Small Business 2000," on the Convocom network (WMEC-Macomb, WQEC-Quincy and WSEC-Springfield/Jacksonville).  Each of the half-hour programs included news stories and regular features on marketing, law and technology, as well as special presentations on home offices, professional practices, book reviews and reviews of the latest in computer software.  <p>

Throughout May and June, the Division hosted a series of Lenders' Forums at locations throughout the state.  The forums featured officials from several government lending agencies, including DCCA, the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA), the U.S. Export Assistance Center (USEAC) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The forums gave bankers and other commercial lenders insight into DCCA's Participation Loan Program, the USEAC's Export Working Capital Loan Program, SBA's Low-Doc program, and IDFA's Direct Loan, Microloan and Industrial Revenue Bonds.  Participants got a look at upcoming changes and forecasts about the financing programs, as well as an opportunity for one-on-one discussions.<p>

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has provided more than $500 million in business financing, helping small businesses retain more than 35,000 Illinos jobs and retain nearly 48,000 jobs.<p>

<H3>WOODFORD COUNTY SHELTER <BR>WINS 1996 GOVERNOR'S CUP</H3>

The 1996 Governor's Home Town Awards are now history, and Woodford County has taken home the coveted Governor's Cup as the project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism this year in Illinois.<P>

At the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards banquet on June 13 in Springfield, more than 70 projects from nearly 90 communities received awards thanking them for their efforts to improve their communities and make Illinois a better place to live, work and do business.  Of those, Woodford County's project, "Heart House," was judged as the outstanding volunteer effort of the year.<P>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a shelter for homeless people in Woodford County.  They realized that the problems of homelessness and domestic violence  exist in small towns as well as large cities.  Using donated funds, the volunteers opened Heart House in a former fraternity house located near the Eureka College campus.  But problems soon developed.  The national fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter at the college, forcing Heart House to seek new quarters.  After assessing its options, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  Their efforts resulted in a new shelter facility valued at more than twice its cost that provides services to its clients without any tax support.<P>

In the 15 years since its inception, the Governor's Home Town Awards program has rewarded many Illinois volunteers like those from Woodford County.  Awards are presented in categories based on population, so that projects compete against activities undertaken in communities of similar size.  Four sub-categories of awards are presented in each population category:  general awards, awards for projects for or by youths, awards for projects for or by senior citizens, and economic development awards.  First place winners in each category receive commemorative road signs and plaques noting their achievements; other winners receive plaques.  All first place winners are eligible to compete for the Governor's Cup.<P>

Judging also is done by volunteers.  This year's judges were all volunteers who had participated in projects that won awards in the 1995 Governor's Home Town Awards competition.  The judges review all applications, then make site visits to finalist communities.  Following the site visits, the judges reconvene to make their final selections and determine the winner of the Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy.  <P>

Applications for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards will be available in late fall.  For further information, contact Lou Ann Ladage at 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<P>

<H3>JOB TRAINING LOSES AN ICON</H3>


The Illinois job training community lost an icon with the May 7 death of Samuel C. Bernstein, often called the "father" of the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act.<P>

Bernstein was working for the Legislative Reference Bureau when he accepted a challenge from then Gov. Henry Horner to develop legislation required by the federal Social Security Act.  In 1937, Bernstein's legislation was enacted, giving Illinois an unemployment compensation law.  <P>

In subsequent years, Bernstein served in numerous state roles, including labor director and commissioner of Illinois employment security.  During the 1970s, he served as assistant to the mayor of Chicago for manpower.  He was a labor adviser to three U.S. presidents, and, until his death, was a consultant for Kane, McKenna and Associates and Target Group, Inc.  He also had been an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois - Chicago.<P>

Bernstein is survived by his wife, Dena, two daughters, one son, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.<P>

<H3>COAL CALENDAR CONTEST WINNERS NAMED</H3>

About two dozen Illinois school children and their families gathered at the Executive Mansion in Springfield in April to receive their awards as winners in the eighth annual Illinois Coal Calendar Contest.<P>

"This contest was established to highlight the rich heritage and tremendous importance of Illinois coal and coal mining," said John S. Moore, chief of DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  "Through this program, young people learn that Illinois' most abundant natural resource -- coal -- can be a safe and environmentally friendly energy source for the future."<P>

Moore joined Taylor Pensoneau, vice president of the Illinois Coal Association, in presenting the winning students with their prizes.  Each winner received a $50.00 U.S. Savings Bond and a certificate of achievement signed by Gov. Jim Edgar.  The winning posters and essays will be included in the 1997 Words and Pictures About Illinois Coal Calendar, which will be available in the fall.<P>

More than 1,200 fifth and sixth grade students from across the state entered this year's competition.  Essay winners included Katie Bochenska, Wood Dale; Kira Essmann, Earlville; Sarah Hamel, Earlville; Katie Kelly, Wheaton; Kyle Ostendorf, Savanna; Bret Owsley, LaHarpe; Shannen Painter, Lomax; Mattie Pesavento, Staunton; Anna Jo Ristow, Cissna Park; Amy Swanson, Savanna; Sarah Talkington, Minooka; and Clint Worley, Staunton.  Poster winners included Courtney Beattie, Mark; Allison Campbell, Ewing; Luke Cloud, Gillespie; Kristen Czarnecki, Wheaton; Mark Dimalanta, Lockport; Ross Frye, Shumway; Steven Isaacson, Carman; Kevin Kamien, Lockport; Leslie Kearby, LaPrairie; Laura Mahrt, Morton; Pat Naurecki, Wood Dale; Sarah Sisterson, Lockport; and Jayna Williams, Harrisburg.<P>

<H3>AMERITECH OPENS FACILITY IN RANTOUL</H3>

Gov. Jim Edgar joined Ameritech officials and workers at ceremonies marking the official opening of the company's $2 million Ameritech Cellular Services call center in Rantoul.  The center, which is expected to create approximately 200 new jobs, is located in a fully renovated facility that formerly housed a Chanute Air Force Base weather training facility.  DCCA is providing up to $210,000 in Industrial Training Program funds to assist in training workers at the center.<P>

<H3>ILLINOIS FILM BUSINESS EXPERIENCING STRONG REBOUND</H3>
<EM>by Ron VerKuilen, Manager, Illinois Film Office</EM><P>


1996 has been a strong rebounding year for the Illinois film business!  January started off with a bang (literally!) when director and native son Andy Davis ("The Fugitive," "The Package," "Code of Silence," Above the Law") returned to Illinois to film "Chain Reaction" starring Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.  The film opens in late August and features Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory and Barrington Hills.  Chicago also doubles for Washington D.C. (see if you can spot the Field Museum or the Museum of Science and Industry!)<P>

In March and April, two television series -- "EZ Streets" and "Early Edition" -- were shot here.  Scenes were shot for a new series produced by Chris Columbus ("Home Alone", "Only the Lonely" director), as well as for "ER" and "Chicago Hope," which regularly return to film scenes.<P>

A sizeable chunk of the movie "Michael," starring John Travolta, Andie MacDowell and William Hurt is being filmed in Illinois.  The latter two play tabloid journalists in search of the archangel Michael, played by Travolta.  Also this spring, the adaptation of the John Grisham novel, "The Chamber," has filmed in Chicago with local actor Chris O'Donnell and Gene Hackman.   In addition to these high-profile stars, Larenz Tate and Nia Long star in an independent film, "Love Jones," directed by Chicagoan Ted Wicher.<P>

During the summer, filming will begin on "My Best Friend's Wedding," starring Julia Roberts, Dermott Mulroney and Carmen Diaz; "Gangsters," set in 1930s Harlem, directed by Bill Duke and starring Lawrence Fishburne; and the Miramax feature, "Stepping in the Dog Water," directed by and starring David Schwimmer of "Friends."<P>

That's not all!  John Hughes Productions, in conjunction with Universal Pictures, will be filming a small town movie in Illinois called "Reach the Rock."  Robert Altman will direct a feature film, "The Wild Card," for MGM Studios that stars Woody Harrelson.  Scouting is underway for a feature film, "The Good Guys," starring Don Johnson as a con man who joins the FBI to expose the mob!<P>

Meanwhile, the Film Office staff is working with a number of projects that have a distinct possibility of filming in Illinois.  We take the calls, make the scouts, pass on information, and plead Illinois' case with crews, talent, labor, hotel managers, etc. to welcome the film and television business to Illinois.  This, along with a full plate of steady business with local independent filmmakers, commercial makers, documentary films, educational films, music videos and other projects, keeps the Illinois Film Office hopping!<P>

The film business is cyclical.  Local labor has made adjustments to appeal to Hollywood.  Market forces seem to be smiling on Illinois right now.  And luck always plays a part.  But the Illinois Film Office continues to work hard to attract the film dollar to Illinois.  We're having fun!  The nights and weekends get a bit full at times, but it's worth it to have the film business back strong in Illinois.  <P>

<H3>STUDENTS WIN ILEED YOUTH AWARDS </H3>


DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone presented a plaque to teachers Terry Bachenheimer and Dawn Drost and their students from Hunting Ridge Elementary and Energy Club in Palatine during the ILEED Youth Awards for Energy Achievement Program luncheon in Springfield.  More than 250 students and teachers from 60 Illinois schools received recognition this year for their outstanding efforts toward furthering energy and environmental education.  Of the 25 schools that won special State Awards, four advanced to the National Youth Awards program for Energy Achievement held in Washington D.C.  Hunting Ridge advanced to the national program for its project studying wetlands and the effects of tampering with the environment. <P>

ILEED (Illinois Energy Eduction Development) is an energy/environmental education program designed to teach and motivate students to learn more about energy and environmental concerns through school and community projects.<P>

<H3>DCCA GRANTS HELP IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC SERVICES</H3>
<EM>by Amy Zachary, Bureau of Community Development</EM><P>


Passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a giant step forward in raising public awareness of the needs of those with disabilities.  But for many small governments, the cost to remodel and retrofit public buildings can be prohibitive.  The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) Removal of Architectural Barriers component can make such improvements affordable.<P>

Each year, DCCA solicits CDAP applications from local units of government -- cities, villages, townships and counties -- in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive their funds directly from the federal government.  Removal of Architectural Barriers grants of up to $150,000 are available annually to assist local governments in paying for efforts to remove physical barriers that restrict accessibility to basic and essential local government services.  For example, a local unit of government might undertake ramp construction, restroom renovation, elevator or chairlift installation, or designate parking for those with disabilities.  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis, with projects such as improvements to courthouses; city, village or town halls; municipal centers; local government annex buildings; libraries and health departments given top priority.<P>

Since the program began in 1993, 162 units of local government have shared $7 million in CDAP grant funds.  An example is Effingham County, which submitted an application on behalf of projects in the county courthouse, county building, and health department, as well as projects in Mound Township, Douglas Township, the Village of Beecher City, the Town of Mason, the City of Altamont and the Village of Watson.  Effingham County received a $48,000 CDAP grant, which it leveraged with nearly $625,000 in local funds to undertake various improvements, including parking, door hardware, signage, door openers and buzzers, audible/visual alarms, grab bars, restroom renovation, new controls on drinking fountains, and audible controls and tactile instructions for an elevator.<P>

Thirty-three communities have submitted applications for $1 million in CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants this year.  DCCA expects to award the grants later this summer.<P>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS:  ANOTHER TOOL<br>
FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<em>by Dale Fesser, DCCA Division of Loan Administration</em><p>

Construction of a new "spec" building in an industrial park.  Financing for a grocery store in a small town.  A business expansion loan to a participant in a "Create Your Own Business" contest.<p>

What do these have in common?  They all are projects completed by various Development Corporations -- regionally-based organizations capitalized partially through DCCA grants -- that provide financing to supplement commercial lending and support economic development in Illinois.<p>

Development Corporations are as varied as their clients.  They may specialize in development and rehabilitation of real estate, investment in or lending to businesses, or related activities.  Most often, Development Corporations are public and bank sponsored and funded financial institutions.  They serve as a source of supplemental business capital for small businesses whose credit requirements cannot be adequately served by conventional lending institutions.<p>

Of the 43 Development Corporations in Illinois, 34 have received DCCA assistance totaling approximately $2.24 million matched by more than $7.5 million in private investment.  Those 34 Development Corporations already have financed more than 89 projects.  Their loans and investments have leveraged private sector loans and investments of more than $59.1 million with total investment of more than $71 million.  Projects funded through state-assisted Development Corporations have resulted in the creation and retention of more than 3,600 Illinois jobs.  The impact will continue to grow as the original loans are repaid and the recaptured funds are used for new loans for future economic development projects.<p>

The Development Corporation program is particularly important to DCCA's strategy to help strengthen regional economic development efforts in rural areas.  Development Corporations are financial intermediary organizations.  By creating new "extra market" institutions, DCCA helps to eliminate the traditional gaps found in asset-based lending at the local level.  At the same time, DCCA itself is taken out of the direct lending business, resulting in more effective delivery of services, greater local access to capital for small and medium-sized Illinois firms, better lending decisions and a better match between the individual needs of businesses and communities.<p>

To learn more about the Development Corporation program or obtain the name of a Development Corporation serving your area, contact Dale Fesser, Development Corporation program manager, at 217/524-0165 (TDD:  800/785-6055) or by E-mail at dale.fesser@accessil.com.<p>

<h3>GREAT PRINTERS PROJECT EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES; PROTECTS ENVIRONMENT</h3>

Protecting the environment is an important concern for everyone.  Today, more than ever, businesses and government must work together to make pollution prevention a key consideration within the nation's industries.  DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program is part of a team working on a major initiative to help establish pollution prevention as a standard business practice within the lithographic printing industry -- the Illinois Great Printers Project.<p>

Lithographic printing uses a variety of materials and potentially hazardous chemicals, generates wastes and consumes energy.  Although the average small print shop is not a major pollution source, the impact of hundreds of such businesses is substantial.  The Illinois Great Printers Project is researching ways to help printers prevent pollution at the source by focusing on customer demands, regulatory requirements, and access to technology and financial resources.  <p>

A steering committee, which includes representatives from DCCA, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Printing Industry of Illinois and Indiana (PII), and the Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center has identified five groups integral to the project:  printers, customers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, and technical assistance.  <p>

Over the past year, each group has been working to develop programs and policies that can help incorporate pollution prevention into the standard business practices of the lithographic printing industry.  For example, activities undertaken by the Customers group include working with the printing industry to develop environmentally sound printing specifications.  The Suppliers group is working with the printing industry to identify environmentally-friendly materials and equipment, promote and disseminate information concerning environmentally sound alternatives, develop a standard form containing product information and environmental benefits, and adopt a standard protocol to identify potentially hazardous chemicals.  Among its activities, the Regulatory Agencies group is trying to revise existing environmental assessment policies to ensure they support and provide incentives for voluntary auditing and pollution prevention.  The Technical Assistance group is working to establish a Resource Center that would provide pollution prevention information to the lithographic printing industry.<p>

Assisting with the efforts is an Advisory Committee of representatives from the printing industry, printing supply industry, printing customers, financial institutions, citizens groups, relevant government agencies and environmental organizations.  This committee provides a sounding board for exploring relevant issues and reviewing the activities being undertaken.<p>

Although much work remains to be done, educating the public is seen as a key to the project's ultimate success.  Criteria are now being developed under which printers may be designated as "Great Printers."   Efforts will be undertaken to publicize the meaning behind the Great Printers designation and encourage consumers to seek out these printers for their printing services.  It is hoped that the educational effort will reward Great Printers by increasing their customer base.<p>

Illinois is one of four states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, designing pilot programs to standardize pollution prevention as a business practice in the lithographic printing industry.  It's all part of a larger effort started in 1992 by the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Printing Industries of America.  Called the Great Printers Project, this effort aims to create a business environment conducive to pollution prevention for an entire industry sector, thereby helping to expand a strong regional printing industry while retaining a clean Great Lakes ecosystem.<p>

<h3>TOURISM ADS WIN AWARDS, GET RESULTS</h3>

It's summer and time to get away for a weekend or that badly needed vacation.  DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism is out to help you find the perfect getaway in Illinois.  An aggressive television advertising campaign hit the airwaves April 1 reminding tourists that they can travel a "Million Miles from Monday" right in our state.<p>  

The television campaign already has earned both critical acclaim and impressive tourism gains.  The 1995 "Million Miles from Monday" campaign was named the best tourism campaign of the year in a worldwide competition at the New York Festival -- the only U.S. campaign to make the finals.  It also won acclaim as the Best Creative of the Year at the Chicago International Film Festival, and won the 1996 ATLAS Award from the Association of Travel Marketing Executives.<p>

Even more important, the ads have been an integral part of Illinois' success in attracting tourists.  Over the past nine months, calls to the Illinois Travel Counseling System (ITCS) have increased 22 percent compared to the same period a year ago.  Follow-up studies show that 62 percent of callers end up traveling to one or more Illinois destinations.  Since September 1995, calls to the 800 number have broken monthly totals.<p>   

The television ads are part of a $10 million domestic tourism campaign that includes print ads, direct response television and showings of the ads at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.  All of the print ads and several direct response television spots feature the benefits of calling ITCS, which puts callers on the line with an expert travel counselor who can use one of the largest tourism databases in the U.S. to help them with their Illinois tourism plans.<p>

Are you ready for a getaway?  Call 1-800-2-CONNECT and go a "Million Miles from Monday" in Illinois.<p>

<h3>BASIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COURSE<br>
HELPS EXPAND STAFF KNOWLEDGE </h3>

Forty-two DCCA staffers and colleagues from other economic development organizations learned more about the foundations of successful economic development as participants in the Basic Economic Development Course, sponsored by DCCA in March.  The intensive five-day course, presented by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, provided the graduates with accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC) and is the first step toward accreditation as a Certified Economic Developer.<p>

The course included presentations by a wide range of economic development experts from throughout the United States.  Bill Browning, president and CEO of the Heartland Partnership in Peoria, described how to build an effective economic development organization, while Kate McEnroe, a location consultant from Atlanta, Georgia, discussed the use of incentives and tips for working with consultants.  David Richmond, a veteran economic developer from Richmond, Indiana, shared his insight into innovative financing programs.  A highlight of the program was an address by Rick Thrasher, president and CEO of WI/SE Partnership for Growth in Wichita, Kansas.  Thrasher, who serves as first vice chair of the American Economic Development Council, and Lori Healey, president of the Illinois Development Council, joined DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone in awarding certificates of completion to the 42 graduates.<p>

Response to the course was so enthusiastic that DCCA plans to sponsor a second BEDC class in June.  Typical of the comments:  "The BEDC was excellent.  I learned a lot about economic development that I really didn't know.  In addition, it helped me to better understand the overall mission of the agency better than anything I had previously read or heard."<p>

All graduates of the course become eligible to attend further training through the University of Oklahoma toward earning the Certified Economic Developer designation.<p>

<h3>DCCA SUPPORTS RESEARCH USING COAL BY-PRODUCTS<br> 
TO PRODUCE ARTIFICIAL MINE ROOF SUPPORTS</h3>

Research, supported by DCCA through the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI), could soon lead to recycling fly ash, a by-product produced when coal is burned, into artificial timbers to support the roofs of coal mines.<p>

Mining engineering Professor Yoginder P. "Paul" Chugh of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale recently demonstrated the strength of two-foot timbers made of fly ash and other fluidized-bed combustion by-products.  The demonstrations were the first step toward receiving approval from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration to use the new timbers as mine roof supports.<p>

Chugh, chairman of SIUC's mining engineering department, and a team of scientists spent two years developing the timbers.  The timbers are made with about 65 percent fly ash, cement and fibers which are added to give the timbers characteristics similar to wood.  Like ordinary wood timbers, the fibers will "splinter" when the artificial post exceeds its design load capacity, signaling that the timber needs to be replaced.<p>

Chugh says the timbers weigh significantly less than concrete and are as strong as traditional wood timbers.  An economic analysis shows the cost of making the six foot timbers is about the same as making them from wood.  The real benefit comes from conserving trees while using a product that currently goes to landfills.<p>

"Coal-burning utilities from Illinois put more than 3 million tons of fly ash and other coal combustion by-products into landfills each year," Chugh said.  "In addition, more than 60 million cubic feet of wood are used every year as timbers in U.S. coal mines."  Chugh estimates that 2.5 million tons of fly ash would be used each year if every U.S. coal mine switched to artificial timbers.<p>

The study is just one in a series of coal-related by-products management studies being sponsored by the ICCI.  Other projects include using coal combustion by-products in road beds and surfaces, automotive brake shoes and body panels, patio bricks, sewer tiles and flower pots.<p>

<h3>DCCA WORKING TO REDUCE COAL-GENERATED AIR POLLUTANTS</h3>

<em>by Gary Philo, DCCA Office of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) is actively working to help encourage the development and use of new technologies that reduce hazardous emissions from burning Illinois coal.  As part of that effort, the OCDM recently held a workshop on sulfur dioxide and air toxics control, bringing together representatives from many of the state's electric power generating companies with those from state government and the air pollution control industry to discuss the role of advanced scrubber technologies.  <p>

Illinois coal has a high sulfur content, which has caused the state to lose market share in recent years as many coal-burning companies turned to low-sulfur western coal.  OCDM is working to encourage development and use of technologies that can  make Illinois coal environmentally safe to use.  It also is seeking out new international markets that can utilize these technologies to safely burn Illinois coal.<p>
  
The workshop, held in Springfield, particularly focused on various technologies that can help companies meet sweeping emission limitations on sulfur dioxide that will become effective in the year 2000.  Participants also looked at control strategies for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants that may face future regulation.  <p>

Representatives from Central Illinois Public Service Company, Springfield City Water, Light and Power, Illinois Power Company, the Environmental Element Corporation, the Illinois Clean Coal Institute, and OCDM participated in the workshop.<p>

<h3>Small Businesses Drive the Illinois Economy</h3>

<h4>By Roberta Janis and Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Small business is the real muscle of the Illinois economy.  Recent data shows that 85  percent of the new jobs in Illinois were created by small businesses, and nearly 4.4 million Illinois workers depend on small business for their livelihood.<p> 

To achieve business success, today's small business owners have to wear many hats -- that of a banker to secure financing, a marketing expert to reach potential clientele, an accountant to file a myriad of tax returns, and the list goes on.<p>

Fortunately for Illinois' 617,000 small business owners, assistance is readily available. Whether shopping for a marketplace, investigating financial sources or trying to make sense of tax requirements, DCCA's Small Business Division can help.  <p>

The Small Business Division includes 40 Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), 13 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, five International Trade Centers, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, 20 Incubators, an Office of Minority Business Development, an Office of Women's Business Development, an Office of Small Business Environmental Assistance and the First-Stop Business Information Center.<p>

SBDCs counsel, conduct research, and train business people in a wide variety of business topics.  They provide comprehensive information services and access to experts in many fields.  Centers develop and maintain partnerships among community organizations and local, state and federal agencies, providing a focal point for broad networks of public and private resources at the community level.  These partnership programs and activities serve small business and contribute significantly to the economic growth in Illinois.<p>

An example is the new Super 8 Motel in Greenville, Illinois.  Although they had been involved in other successful business ventures, 32-year-old Vicki Ellsworth and her associates turned to the SBDC at Kaskaskia College in Centralia for help in opening the new motel.  The SBDC not only helped develop a business plan and compiled three- and five-year projections, but also helped compile a financial package that included an $800,000 loan guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and $150,000 from the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  After only a few months of operation, the Greenville Super 8 has already exceeded its projections.<p>

Vern Carlsen is another example.  Carlsen worked for 25 years at a Chicago area industrial company, working his way up to corporate vice president.  After the company was sold in 1988, he worked as a salesman for a few years, then became a manager and contract administrator for a Rockford firm.  In that job, he discovered that, although many companies were interested in doing business with the government, they did not want to deal with the paperwork involved.  Carlsen started Sales Assistance Service in 1993 to fill this void.  Sales Assistance Service used the services of the Procurement Technical Assistance Center at Rock Valley College in Rockford, particularly the automated bid service and the specification library.  The company also has begun to use Electronic Data Interchange to receive bids daily.  It is now a successful business that continues to expand. <p> 

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has compiled impressive statistics.  To find out if the Small Business Division can help you, call 800/252-2923 (TDD:  800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>From the Director</h3>

<h4>What is Economic Development?</h4>

DCCA's new mission statement says that DCCA is the "lead state agency responsible for improving the competitiveness of Illinois in the global economy resulting in prosperous, growing industries, rising real incomes and high quality jobs."<p>

But the agency's programs and services encompass a wide range of activities -- tourism, help for local governments, workforce training programs, assistance to low-income people, technology assistance, site and building location assistance, small business assistance, and many more.  How do all these programs fit the definition of economic development?<p>

Think like a mayor.  As mayor, you are vitally interested in the future of your community.  You want it to be a great place for families to live and visit, with prosperous businesses, plentiful jobs, convenient services and a healthy environment.  <p>

You're interested in infrastructure because you know that without access to safe and adequate water supplies and waste treatment, safe roads and other foundations, people and businesses will not want to live in and locate in your community.  You're interested in workforce development because you want to ensure that businesses in your community have the skilled workers they need to stay competitive in a global marketplace.  You also know that the future of your current businesses, as well as your ability to attract more businesses and jobs, depends on a continued supply of skilled workers and adequate infrastructure.<p>

You're interested in maintaining and improving the quality of life for residents in your community.  You want to ensure that low-income families have decent, energy efficient homes in which to live and the ability to pay their winter energy bills.  You want to provide services to homeless people to help them get back on their feet.  And you want to help low-income and disadvantaged people find employment opportunities and learn the skills they need to be productive employees.<p>

You know that if your community is to grow, you need to encourage existing businesses to expand and attract new businesses and jobs.  That's not just large factories -- it's also encouraging entrepreneurs to start new businesses, like the corner cafe, the dry cleaning shop and others that provide the services your citizens need.  <p>

You have a nice community.  You want others to enjoy it.  You're interested in promoting your community and its resources to tourists who will spend their dollars in your hotels and motels, restaurants and shops while enjoying the sights.<p>

If all of these things are beginning to sound familiar, it's because they are all addressed by the programs DCCA administers.  The Bureau of Community Development, for example, helps smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and housing needs through the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs and the Industrial Training Program (ITP) help train people in the skills they need to be productive employees.  Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) programs provide loans to help start businesses that provide jobs to disadvantaged workers, as well as many services to help low-income people break out of poverty.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income families pay a portion of their winter energy bills, while the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) helps low-income families make their dwellings more energy-efficient.<p>  

DCCA's Business Development Bureau provides site selection and technical assistance to help attract new businesses to Illinois, as well as services to help existing businesses grow, such as export assistance.  Through the First-Stop Business Information Center and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and small business owners find answers to their questions, locate business capital, start new businesses and expand existing ones.  <p>

The Bureau of Tourism promotes Illinois and provides assistance to help local communities and regions market themselves in this fast-growing industry, and also promotes Illinois as a site for film and television production.  Coal Development and Marketing programs work to find and market new, environmentally-safe methods of using Illinois' greatest resource.  The Bureau of Energy and Recycling promotes sustainable economic development by encouraging alternative energy resource development such as ethanol; improving energy efficiency in residences, buildings and factories which also helps reduce costs; and by supporting recycling and waste reduction programs, including the expansion of markets for recycled materials.  These programs facilitate the efficient use of natural resources while helping to minimize negative impacts on the environment. <p>
 
What is economic development?  A mayor knows.  He or she knows that a community that looks to the future and addresses its needs will be a competitive community that attracts and keeps prosperous, growing industries.  Those industries will provide high quality jobs that pay the kind of rising real incomes that can fund the parks, schools, infrastructure and other public services that make others want to visit and make the community their home.  With the right help, a mayor can close the circle into a continuous cycle of development.<p>

DCCA was created in 1979 to be Illinois' lead economic development agency.  The various community, workforce and business development programs were merged under the DCCA umbrella for a reason -- because they all are essential components of our state's ability to improve its competitiveness in a global economy.  Today, more than ever, DCCA must recognize its unique ability to be the state's "one-stop" economic development agency.  Understanding that role, and the ways our various programs fit into the overall mission, is the first step toward fulfilling that mission.<p>

<h3>Illinois Ventures for Community Action Provides Crucial Resources</h3>

<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

More than $3.6 million in loans, 616 new jobs and the lowest loan default rate in the nation.  That's a great record, and one the people at Illinois Ventures for Community Action (IVCA) are proud of.<p>

IVCA is a private 501c(3) not-for-profit corporation located in Springfield that works with the 34 local Community Action Agencies (CAAs) in Illinois and other public and private enterprises to facilitate economic development within the state.  In particular, IVCA helps ensure that CAAs have the training and knowledge they need to develop loans to businesses that can create jobs for low-income Illinoisans -- a key component of the federally-funded Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program, administered in Illinois by DCCA.<p>

Formed in 1985, IVCA is administered by a Board composed of representatives from 16 CAAs.  It is directed by CEO Michael Chew, a financial professional and former bank president.  Working closely with DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunities and the CAAs, IVCA helps the CAAs market their loans and loan services, provides lending consultation training and technical assistance with the lending function, and helps maintain coordination with lead lenders in the communities.  Through these services, IVCA is helping CAAs improve the quality of their loan portfolios.  IVCA also explores new sources of capital and tools for economic development activities, such as equity and ownership positions in Illinois businesses, to generate sustainable revenue streams that can be used to support anti-poverty efforts.<p>

For example, IVCA has assisted five CAAs in purchasing their own office buildings, thus enabling them to build a capital asset for the agency while improving creditability in the community through real estate ownership.  Chew considers the building acquisition program for Community Action Agencies to be one of the most important services IVCA performs, saying "The fiscal benefit of real estate ownership equates to immeasurable benefit to the community."<p>

Since its inception, IVCA has closed more than $3.6 million in loans, created 616 jobs, and has the distinctive record of never having a job default loan in its portfolio.  Its loan default ratio is 3.49 percent.  Since 1989, the loan default ratio has been less than one percent.  In fact, according to the Federal Office of Community Services, IVCA has the lowest loan default rate of any loan program it monitors.<p>

DCCA's partnership with Illinois Ventures for Community Action is one way DCCA is working to find innovative ways to strengthen local efforts and provide communities access to resources for physical and social infrastructure improvements.<p>

<h3>
Workshops Help Illinois Businesses<br>
Explore Export Opportunities
</h3>

Illinois businesses that want to explore the export marketplace or need information about expanding their exporting potential can obtain valuable assistance at a series of regional workshops scheduled over the coming months in Illinois.<p>

The DCCA-sponsored workshops are geared toward export opportunities in six of the 10 Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) -- markets identified as being particularly receptive to goods and services offered by U.S. companies.  The six markets deemed particularly receptive to Illinois-made products and services include South Africa, Korea and the Pacific Rim, China, Poland and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Latin America, and Turkey.   The workshops are made possible through a Market Development Cooperator Program grant awarded to Illinois by the U.S. Department of Commerce -- one of only eight such grants awarded this year.<p>

Illinois' network of International Trade Centers (ITCs) and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, two components of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN), will coordinate the workshops.  Each workshop will offer participants a chance to learn about the specific export opportunities in each market and experiences of companies already exporting to that country.  In addition, representatives from DCCA's International Business Division will discuss export assistance services offered in various Illinois pavilions scheduled for BEM trade shows, as well as assistance offered in locating potential agents and distributors.<p>

Upcoming workshops include a May 29 seminar at Bradley University in Peoria to discuss strategies for success in Korea and the Pacific Rim, and a May 30 seminar at the College of Du Page in Glen Ellyn focusing on International Quality Standards as they relate to markets in Poland, Korea and China.  Other future workshops will be held at Bradley and College of DuPage, as well as at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and  NORBIC in Chicago.<p>

For further information about the workshops, contact Roberta Janis at DCCA at 312/814-7170 (TDD:  312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>DCCA Establishes Business & Industry Data Center Program</h3>

Small business people will be able to conveniently access census data and other usable information through a new service being established at DCCA.  The Business and Industry Data Center Program (BIDC), designed to enhance the BIDC program started by the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1988, will give small business people, independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois an easy way to obtain statistical data and other sources of practical information. <p>

Statistics can be very important to small business people in planning, marketing, managing and expanding their businesses.  The BIDC program will utilize a system of five regional affiliates in Illinois to collect and provide basic information to the small business community, complete complex analyses as needed and perform regional economic analyses.  A system of three to five local affiliates in each region will deal directly with small businesses and other data users, providing basic census, economic and demographic information; data prepared by the regional affiliates or the state; and technical assistance with basic data interpretation.  The BIDC program also is affiliated with DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, which offers services and products designed to help new and existing businesses determine regulations applicable to their business activity and general start-up information. <p>

A few examples of BIDC assistance include information on commonly-offered  employee benefits in selected industries; listings of office furniture manufacturers; county economic profiles; trade show listings; numbers of Illinois businesses in select SIC codes that have sales of more than $1 million; city population, income and growth projections; ACT scores by school district; and numbers and sizes of warehouses in a county.<p>

For more information about the BIDC program, contact one of the BIDCs or phone Ed Taft at DCCA, 217/785-7545 (TDD:  800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS KEEP COMMUNITIES GROWING</h3>
<h4>By Jay Bales, DCCA Bureau of Community Development</h4>

Over the past 14 years, DCCA has awarded $83 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to 177 local units of government throughout the state to help them provide low-interest loans to businesses locating or expanding within their boundaries.  Approximately $50 million of those funds are already back in circulation, helping more than 1,600 businesses obtain the capital they need to start or expand operations in the communities.  And that's just the beginning.  As those loans are repaid, their dollars also will be used for future business opportunities.<p>

It's all thanks to Revolving Loan Funds, administered by local communities, that are capitalized with moneys repaid by businesses that received the original loans funded through CDAP economic development component grants.<p>

Here's how it works:  DCCA receives Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The funds are used to provide a variety of grants to units of local government in communities with populations under 50,000 that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  CDAP grants range from public facilities grants, that help small communities meet their water and sewer needs, to economic development grants, that help communities attract and retain businesses and their jobs.<p>

When DCCA awards a CDAP economic development grant to a community, the community may use the funds to make infrastructure improvements needed by a business, such as extending water and sewer lines or access roads.  Or it may choose to use the grant funds to provide a low-interest loan to the business.  If a loan is made, the community creates a locally-administered Revolving Loan Fund, which is capitalized by the loan repayment funds.  These Revolving Loan Funds, or RLFs, provide a valuable source of business capital for future business development.<p>

There are many RLF success stories across the state.  For example, the City of Saint Elmo received a $375,000 CDAP economic development grant in 1982.  Since then, the city has made 33 loans totaling $601,811 with a minimal amount of defaults.  The City of Lacon has received two CDAP grants in the amount of $174,180.  From the "recaptured" funds it has made 20 loans totaling $184,172.68.  These "second generation" loans have resulted in 120 jobs being created or retained!<p>

A local government does not have to receive a large CDAP grant to have an effective RLF.  The City of Athens received a $40,000 CDAP grant in 1985.  In the decade since, the city has made six loans totaling $78,300 -- nearly twice the amount of the original CDAP grant.<p>

While most RLFs do not make large loans, their contributions often are an integral part of a business' overall financing package, leveraging larger amounts of private sector dollars.  In particular, CDAP RLF dollars can be an important source of "gap financing" for small, rural businesses.<p>

For more information on CDAP RLFs, or to learn which communities have an active RLF, contact Jay Bales at 217/785-6181 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR.....</h3>

A few weeks ago, Gov. Jim Edgar recommended a $774.6 million budget for DCCA for fiscal year 1997.  I'd like to tell you a little about that budget request and what it means for DCCA's customers.<p>

First, it's important to note that the bulk of our budget request -- $600.4 million -- is federal funds.  Those funds are essential to the training of our workers, the infrastructure of our communities, and the well-being of our citizens.  We're asking for $237.2 million for JTPA for next year as we continue to open new One-Stop Career Centers, and $376.7 million for community development programs like CDAP, LIHEAP, IHWAP and CSBG that help build our infrastructure, attract and retain businesses, and help improve the quality of life for low-income citizens.<p>

We're also asking for $40.2 million in state general revenue funds.   This includes $15 million for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) -- a $2.75 million increase that would enable DCCA to help upgrade the skills of nearly 5,000 more workers from 350 additional Illinois companies.<p>

We're looking at $39.2 million in funds for our business development programs.  Illinois has been very successful in recent years in attracting and retaining businesses and their jobs -- Motorola and McDonald's, for example, have announced projects that will create thousands of new Illinois jobs over the coming years.  But the fact is, Illinois is competing against other states every time a business looks to locate or expand.  We need to have the tools to win that competition.   This budget will enable DCCA to enhance its working relationships with local economic developers and improve our ability to respond to business inquiries.<p>

Our export potential is great.  We're asking for $3.5 million to promote exporting of Illinois' goods and services in the global marketplace.  Illinois is a leader in technology development.  We're asking for an additional $200,000 to help us continue our efforts to transfer these technologies to the workplace to help our businesses expand and modernize to meet the global challenge.<p>

Tourism, one of the fastest-growing industries, will continue to prosper under the $33.4 million budget we've outlined.  These funds will enable us to continue our successful tourism advertising campaign, "Illinois -- A Million Miles from Monday," as well as grant programs to help our communities promote tourism opportunities.<p>

We're working to promote the efficient and environmentally-safe use of Illinois' energy resources, and have allocated $13.6 million to that end.  Another $17.8 million is earmarked for projects designed to utilize and develop new markets for one of Illinois' greatest resources -- coal.<p>

Over the coming weeks, the General Assembly will be considering the Governor's budget request.  It is my hope that you will take a few moments to consider the importance of DCCA's programs and services to your businesses, jobs and communities.  We welcome your support as we work to secure the resources we need to make Illinois the best place to live, work and do business.<p>

<h3>FIRST-STOP MAKES GOVERNMENT ACCESSIBLE TO BUSINESS</h3>

Illinois has a new and exciting service to help entrepreneurs and business owners access the state regulatory and assistance information they need to achieve success.  It's DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, working to improve Illinois' business climate by making it easier for entrepreneurs to comply with state business requirements.<p>

First-Stop, established in 1994 under the Business Assistance and Regulatory Reform Act, includes a number of services and products designed to meet the needs of new and existing businesses.  For example, First-Stop offers the Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs to help new and existing businesses determine the regulations and services applicable to their business activity.  The Directory is a comprehensive resource with nearly 500 profiles from more than 40 state agencies that document virtually every business license, permit, certificate and registration required by the State of Illinois, as well as the various state assistance programs available to help businesses. <p>

First-Stop also offers Starting a Business In Illinois, a comprehensive handbook for those looking to start and do business in Illinois.  The handbook includes general local, state and federal business requirements, a feasibility checklist and a business plan outline. <p>

In the coming months, First-Stop will be improving and expanding its services. "Business Bios," which will give specific, detailed regulatory information for virtually every industry, are currently being updated and expanded.  Also in the works is a comprehensive database, which will inventory business licenses, permits, certificates and registrations required by the State of Illinois.  In addition, First-Stop, with the help of business owners, associations and state agencies, will embark on a new path to search out and identify existing state laws that are burdensome, duplicative or onerous.<p>

First-Stop's effectiveness lies not only in its ability to give start-up and regulatory information to Illinois' businesses, but also in its connections to other business assistance centers.  Local assistance for new or existing businesses is available through the Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN).  The BIDC works to enhance the ability of small business people to plan, market, manage and expand their businesses by providing them with access to statistical data and other sources of practical information. The ISBDCN seeks to increase the competitiveness, profitability and growth of Illinois businesses in a global market through Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, International Trade Centers, and NAFTA Opportunity Centers.<p>

First-Stop's Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs and Starting a Business in Illinois are available through the World Wide Web (http://ww.accessil.com/dcca/) or the Access Illinois electronic bulletin board (217/787-6255, settings ANSI, 8, N, 1).  Clients also may receive this information free of charge by contacting the First-Stop Business Information Center directly at 800/252-2923 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>ITP HELPS SUPPLIERS IMPROVE QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY</h3>

"We have to team in excellence to prevail."  Those were the words of Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, commenting on the firm's latest effort to help its Illinois suppliers improve their quality and productivity, in turn helping Deere maintain and improve its own competitiveness in the global economy.<p>

A driving force behind this partnership is Illinois' Industrial Training Program (ITP), administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Gov. Jim Edgar recently participated in ceremonies awarding a $574,709 ITP grant to Deere to assist the company in providing training to 4,065 workers from 136 Illinois Deere suppliers.<p>

In its early days, ITP provided state-funded grants to manufacturers like Deere to help them train new employees and upgrade the skills of current workers.  But it became increasingly apparent that a training void existed for small and medium-sized manufacturers.  Thanks to changes in the program enacted in 1992, ITP now provides grants to trade organizations, company consortia, and community colleges, as well as original equipment manufacturers that use the funds to offer training opportunities to workers from their Illinois suppliers.  Deere, for example, has received more than $2.2 million in ITP funds since fiscal year 1993, which it has used to help train nearly 14,000 workers from its Illinois supplier companies.<p>

The program has been a great success.  Everett "Bud" Pierce, President of McLaughlin Body Company in Moline, a Deere supplier that has participated in the training program since 1993, said, "Training is more important than at any time in our careers.  As suppliers, we need to reduce costs and improve productivity.   The fact that we as suppliers can find training that enables us to better service our customers makes the program very valuable."<p>

Jerry Norquist, Manager of Safety and Training for Rockford Products Corp. of Rockford, another Deere supplier, agreed.  "Feedback we're receiving from our customers throughout their quality audits confirms that progress is definitely being made in that direction.  Our quality costs and delivery measures are showing significant improvement trends.  We're gaining market shares.  The education and training made available to our workforce through this program is a major contributor to our organizational development."<p>

ITP grants provide up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  The remaining costs are leveraged with private investment.  Deere provides five categories of training to its suppliers:  supply management, financial; operations improvements; skilled-based; and employee development.<p>

Diana Bump, Education and Training Facilitator, from Reliable Power Products, Franklin Park, said ITP training provided through Deere allowed her company to maximize its training dollars and include more employees.  "During our first year of involvement with this training program, 141 employees participated in 26 different classes.  Benefits of the program that have already been realized and measured are improved customer satisfaction, with shipment compliance improving from 91.4 percent to 97.2 percent.  Job instruction time has been reduced by one-third.  Computer efficiency has improved by 30 percent as a result of the computer skills class, with stress levels being reduced about 70 percent.  In one product area, cycle time has been reduced by 30 percent and our work in process inventories have been reduced by 50 percent overall."<p>

Gov. Edgar said ITP is an important part of the state's effort to ensure job opportunities for its people by helping Illinois businesses improve their competitiveness in the global marketplace.  "It's particularly crucial that we assist small and medium-sized businesses, because that's where most of the job growth will be as we move into the 21st Century.  It's critical to Deere that they have businesses that supply them with the highest quality work products, and important to us in Illinois that our small and medium-sized businesses are able to improve their productivity.  These training dollars will help these suppliers do business with other international companies around the world."<p>

Becherer commended the Governor and the state for having the foresight and the wisdom to stand behind the Industrial Training Program.  "When there is something like this program that provides both an incentive for us and our suppliers to work together on programs to enhance capabilities of suppliers, it provides another competitive edge that is needed in the very competitive markets in which we operate today worldwide."<p>

<h3>
"CROSSING INTERNATIONAL BORDERS" CONFERENCE<br> 
FEATURES TIPS ON EFFECTIVE EXPORTING
</h3>

Exporters and companies interested in exploring the global marketplace can get valuable tips to help them achieve success at this year's "Crossing International Borders" Conference, to be held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers on May 16.<p>

The conference is co-sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division and Arthur Andersen.  Registration is $95 per person through May 9 or $125 per person following that date.  For conference information or registration, contact Arthur Andersen at 312/507-9664 or Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio at DCCA at 312/814-2325 (TDD 312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>SCRAP TIRES PROMOTE RECYCLING; PROVIDE SAFER PLAYGROUNDS</h3>

Every year, more than 12 million old tires are scrapped in Illinois, creating a breeding site for disease-carrying mosquitoes, providing a potential fire hazard with the possibility for dense fumes of toxic smoke, and filling up valuable landfill space.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling is working to encourage recycling of those old tires in ways that can end the hazards while providing useful products.<p>

One very successful effort is a program that utilizes chips made from recycled scrap tires as a loose playground cover.  The tire chips provide a safer playground surface  because their rubber content has a shock-absorbing quality.  They also help keep maintenance costs down.  Tire chips allow for fast drainage, last for years without rotting or decaying, plus they retard weed growth, reduce dust and mud, are clean and non-toxic, do not produce leachate, and do not attract animals or insects.<p> 

This year, the Used Tire Recovery Program provided $260,000 in grants to 106 public and private schools, day care facilities and park districts to help them purchase the scrap tire playground surfacing material.  Grants of up to $3,600 were provided, with grant recipients required to match at least 40 percent.  Grant funds are generated by a state surcharge on the retail purchase of new automotive tires in Illinois.  The funded projects will use more than six million pounds of scrap tire chips, which equates to recycling more than 300,000 automotive tires.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS TOURISM GOES ON-LINE</h3>

Wouldn't it be convenient if you could instantly access information on almost any Illinois tourism destination?  Wouldn't it be ideal to browse through this information any time of the day or night, any day of the week, from the comfort of your home? <p> 

Well, it's possible.  Thanks to the Internet and your computer, potential Illinois travelers can get the information they need conveniently and quickly.<p>

DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism, working closely with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising agency, has developed a new site on the World Wide Web that can help consumers learn about events, sites and activities, lodging, restaurants, sports, weather forecasts, what's on tap at theaters and museums, and just about anything else needed to plan a weekend getaway or a complete vacation.<p>

The tourism database is user-friendly and can be reached from two locations.  At the heart of the new site, accessible by clicking on the Illinois Tourism button on DCCA's home page (http://www.accessil.com/dcca/) or clicking directly to the Illinois Tourism homepage (http://www.enjoyillinois.com), is the Trip Planner.  It includes detailed trip planning information on food, shopping, golf, lodging, special events, outdoor recreation, packaged discounts, etc.  The information in this section is created through tourism's Illinois Travel Counseling System's toll-free hotline database (1-800-2-CONNECT).  The data will frequently be downloaded into the website, ensuring detailed, current travel information.<p>

There's also a What's New section to inform users of upcoming content; Inside Insights, providing first-hand suggestions from real people who have explored and traveled in Illinois; Maps, which includes maps of Illinois regions, biking and hiking trails and special interest maps; Front Lines, with up-to-the-minute data on weather, sports and theater; and a sophisticated Search Engine to easily sort through it all.<p>

No longer will potential travelers have to make separate calls to get information on golf courses and hotels, Cubs schedules, or whatever other activities they might choose.  One visit to the Illinois Tourism website will connect these travelers with all of the answers, enabling them to customize their vacation plans in Illinois.<p>

Future plans also call for development of special contests, meetings and convention information, and the opportunity to purchase Illinois merchandise through tourism's retail outlet, Illinois Marketplace, located at Chicago's Navy Pier.<p>

Obviously, offering these benefits through the Internet is a great convenience to travelers.  But it also is an important tool for the state.  In addition to bringing consumers closer to the information they need to travel in Illinois, the Internet helps Illinois develop a relationship with consumers and generate a customer database by gathering E-mail addresses.<p>

Tourism is big business in Illinois.  In 1994, travelers spent nearly $16 billion in Illinois, contributing more than $995 million in state and local taxes, $1.7 billion in federal taxes, and generating more than 241,000 jobs with a payroll of $4.8 billion.  The Internet can help make travel in Illinois even more convenient and accessible, and help this important industry continue to grow.<p>

<h3>ITP GRANT HELPS KEEP QUALITY AS "JOB ONE"</h3>

Nearly 3,000 workers at Ford Motor Company's Chicago Assembly plant and its Illinois supplier firms will learn new skills to help them be more productive employees, thanks to an $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant announced by Gov. Jim Edgar during a January visit to the plant.<p>

The grant, the latest in a series of ITP awards to Ford since Fiscal Year 1989,  highlights the important relationship between DCCA and Illinois companies in providing the training needed to keep Illinois worker skills among the best in the world.   ITP grants are an investment in Illinois workers that can help tip the scales in favor of Illinois when companies make location, expansion or modernization decisions.<p>

Ford, for example, has been manufacturing automobiles in Chicago since 1914, and started production at the Torrence Avenue facility in 1924.  Over the years, the plant has been expanded and modernized, currently producing the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles.  The Chicago Assembly plant supplies vehicles throughout the U.S. and exports vehicles to 17 countries.<p>

A commitment to quality has always been foremost.  In July 1995, Ford awarded the Chicago Assembly Plant its Ford Q1 (Quality 1) designation.  That commitment, coupled with exacting export requirements demanded by established international quality standards, makes it necessary for Ford to continuously provide training programs to upgrade the skills and knowledge of its workers.<p>

Using its latest ITP grant, Ford will work with equipment suppliers, Ford personnel, and local schools and universities to develop and conduct training activities.  Included in the training is problem solving, continuous improvement methods, statistical process control, communications techniques and leadership skills.  Preventive maintenance systems, quality operating systems, computer skills, technical equipment courses and online production operations training are also part of the total training plan.  A heavy emphasis will be placed on process improvement and international quality measurements, such as ISO 9002.<p>

In its quest to ensure that "Quality is Job One," Ford also is inviting many of its Illinois supplier companies to participate in the training program.  Those companies include the Ford Chicago Stamping Plant in Chicago Heights; Certified Tool of Elk Grove Village; ELCO Industries, Inc. of Rockford, ITW Deltar Insert Molded Products in Elk Grove Village; Littlefuse, Inc. in Des Plaines; and MacLean-Fogg Company of Mundelein.<p>

This supplier training is a relatively new aspect of ITP.  In its early years, the program was restricted to Illinois manufacturers to assist with training and retraining costs.  In 1992, the program was expanded to include multi-company and intermediary organizations -- community colleges, original equipment manufacturers like Ford providing training to workers from their Illinois supplier network, business and industry associations, labor organizations, and strategic business partnerships -- among those eligible for grant funding.  This new emphasis enables today's ITP to reach out to a broader segment of the Illinois business community, particularly small and medium-sized companies with similar training needs.<p>

Since its inception in Fiscal Year 1979, the Industrial Training Program has provided nearly $168.7 million to help train more than 287,000 Illinois workers.  Entirely funded through state General Revenue Funds, the grants reimburse companies or organizations up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  By providing grants to multi-company and intermediary organizations, ITP funds are training more workers than ever before while lowering per-worker training costs.<p>

In speaking of the Ford grant, Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, provided insight into the overall importance of ITP to the continued strength of the Illinois business community.  "The Edgar Administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge." <p>

<h3>TOP 10 TIPS FOR WRITING SUCCESSFUL CDAP APPLICATIONS</h3>

The Public Facilities component of DCCA's Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is one of the most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address infrastructure needs that pose potential threats to public health and safety.  Public Facilities grants are just one component of CDAP, a federally-funded program administered by DCCA's Bureau of Community Development, that provides grants to local units of government in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  But since CDAP Public Facilities grants are awarded on a competitive basis, it is crucial that communities submit the best possible application.  DCCA staffers often participate in workshops and seminars to help grantwriters refine their skills.  The following is a Top 10 List of their tips to help communities prepare more competitive applications:<p>

1.  Give your grantwriter sufficient time to prepare your CDAP application.  CDAP is a federally-funded program with complex requirements.  Make sure your grantwriter has enough time to thoroughly research and document the information in the application.<p>

2.  Know what you're sending.  Many communities hire grantwriters to prepare their applications, but ultimately the local government submitting the application is responsible for its contents and completeness.  For example, if other leverage is part of the project, be sure that leverage is in place before seeking the CDAP grant.  If it is not, your application will not be favorably reviewed.<p>

3.  At least 51 percent of the benefit from CDAP Public Facilities projects must be provided to low- and moderate-income (LMI) people.  Make sure the LMI documentation matches the actual project benefit area.  For example, if only a particular neighborhood of a community will be served by a project, income surveys or census data should only reflect that area, not the entire community.<p>

4.  Write a complete project summary narrative.  If you are proposing to extend water mains to serve a rural area, for example, include specific information about the condition of the private wells that are inadequately serving the area.  Survey the residents of the area -- are 20 of the 25 currently trucking in water or purchasing bottled water?  Include information about the age of an old city system that needs to be replaced.  How many breaks has it experienced in the past two years?  Does your community need a new water tower?  If so, include information about average daily water use or low water pressure and its effects on residents.<p>  

5.  Include a Project Location Map.  It doesn't have to be blueprint quality; it just needs to illustrate the entire project area and show the proposed improvements.<p>

6.  Document the existing threat to public health and safety.  Include "internal" reports, such as repair bills, citizen complaint records or letters, water quality test results, numbers of boil orders, data on breaks, engineering reports, as well as "external" documents, such as historical correspondence from the IEPA, or letters from the health department referencing test results and inspection results of the targeted area.<p> 

7.  Demonstrate financial need.  Why does your community need a grant?  What is your financial indebtedness?  Do you have bonding capacity?  What are current user rates for water and sewer services; could they be raised?  You must submit a copy of your most recent government audit with your CDAP application.  Be sure that if you have incurred additional debt since that audit was prepared, you inform us of that debt. (DCCA's Office of Local Government Services can conduct a financial analysis to help communities determine whether they need CDAP assistance.)<p>

8.  Demonstrate community effort.  What efforts has your community made to address the problem on its own?  Have you continually made repairs to an antiquated water treatment facility?  Have you exhausted local resources making sewer main repairs?  Have you contacted other funding sources, such as RECDS (FmHA), the Rural Bond Bank, the IEPA or local financial institutions?  If you have, and you've been turned down for help, indicate that in your application.  This tells us that you have taken the initiative and CDAP may be your only option.<p>

9.  Document project readiness.  CDAP guidelines now state that project readiness is a "project threshold."  In other words, if your application does not demonstrate that the proposed project is complete, appropriate and achievable, we may not review it further.  Be sure you review all of the project readiness guidelines and address them in your narrative:  a Preliminary Engineering Report that breaks down the project and its costs in detail; properly executed Agreements and Assurances, such as intergovernmental cooperation agreements; Firm Financial Commitments -- according to new CDAP guidelines, a minimum of 25 percent leverage must be "firmly" committed and documented according to the guidelines in the CDAP application; and Site Control, such as a signed commitment from a property owner for an easement or parcel of land and copies of any permits needed.<p>

10.  Document past CDAP performance, informing us of your timely and efficient completion of any past CDAP projects.  If your community experienced problems completing a past project on time, document circumstances beyond your control which might have delayed the project.<p> 

Every year, DCCA receives applications requesting nearly two times more in CDAP Public Facilities grants than funds available.  A complete, detailed application can increase your community's chances of success.  For further information, contact the CDAP staff at 217/785-6142 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>DCCA, REGIONAL PARTNERS, REPRESENT ILLINOIS AT SAE '96</h3>
<h4>by GeorgeAnn Madison, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>
	
This year's Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Exposition, held last month in Detroit, celebrated an important milestone:  the 100th Year Anniversary of the automotive industry.   Illinois, among the nation's leading automotive industry locations, was well-represented at the show through a booth manned by DCCA's local economic development partners and sponsored by DCCA's  Regional Economic Development Partnership Program (REDPP).<p>

REDPP provides funds that enable local and regional economic development professionals to attend various in-state and out-of-state trade shows to promote their communities and Illinois.  SAE '96 was one example of the kinds of expositions that are targeted for REDPP funding -- expositions that reach top prospects, both national and international, from Illinois' most important industries.<p>

Recognized worldwide as the leading exposition supporting a network of the automotive industry's top executives, engineers and company representatives, the SAE International Exposition is the oldest assembly of high-level industry personnel and suppliers and holds the honor of being the industry's largest and most prestigious automotive event.  Each year this event draws 850-plus supplier exhibits and includes more than 100 companies from outside North America showing their wares to an audience of more than 40,000 engineering professionals including 3,200 from overseas.<p>

A highlight of the Illinois booth was a Mitsubishi Eclipse convertible donated for the exhibit by Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America, Inc., Normal.   The flashy auto helped attract attendees to the Illinois booth, where they were able to meet one-on-one with economic development personnel.  The contacts are important for both sides -- they enable industry professionals to learn about Illinois and offer Illinois economic developers an excellent opportunity to develop a list of qualified industry contacts and meet with industry decision-makers.<p>

SAE '96 also showcased another feature of REDPP.  The program enables participants to use portions of their funding for pre-show promotional efforts.  Illinois' exhibit, for example, was featured in a pre-show issue of Automotive Engineering (an organized pre-show promotional manual), as well as the Exhibitor's Manual (an on-site show directory).  These advertising efforts also had a two-pronged benefit -- they encouraged exhibitors to visit the Illinois booth, while providing Illinois exhibitors with access to a mailing list of all registered attendees at the SAE'96 Expo for future contact.<p>

DCCA and its local and regional partners will follow through on the leads they received at the SAE '96 Expo by mailing letters to contacts, providing an overview of Illinois' resources and attributes.   It's just one example of ways DCCA is working with local economic developers to attract and retain key industries and their jobs.<p>

<h3>ENERGY ASSISTANCE HOTLINE CAN BE A LIFELINE</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

To some, handling more than 40,000 calls annually on DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline would seem a tedious job.  But to the staff of the  Division of Economic Opportunity, particularly Support Services staffers, Esther Reed, John Ray, and Jan Stehlin, it's an important and rewarding service.<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline is an information and referral source for those individuals seeking assistance with their heating bills, home weatherization, and other emergency services offered through the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and Community Services Block Grant Programs.<p>

Established in 1979 near the same time as DCCA's creation, the Hotline started as two phones with headsets installed in a separate room at the Department's offices. Then as now, staffers took calls from individuals wanting to know what the energy assistance and weatherization programs were all about, program eligibility requirements, and information on where they could apply.<p>

Although some people call to express complaints, Reed says, "The rewards come when you can help people such as Mr. Jenkins who writes, "My blood level is monitored weekly being on blood thinner. I get cold. I am 60 years old...Right leg amputee up to hip...I am wheelchair bound. Please help." <p>

Besides answering questions about DCCA's programs, Hotline staffers also retain a listing of other agencies' toll-free numbers, including those of Public Aid, Mental Health, Aging, and the Department of Children and Family Services.  Well-established communication channels also are maintained with the state's electric and gas utilities, including Commonwealth Edison, People's Gas, CILCO, and Illinois Power.<p>

Reed is proud of the work she and other DCCA staffers do.  "We're a small operation with only one phone line, but we probably touch every segment of the state's social services network.  We are a lifeline for a lot of needy people across the state."<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline number is 800/252-8643 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<center>###</center>


Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra recently convened a "Coal Strategy Group" of leaders from the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies, including DCCA.  The group will discuss ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal thus ensuring a positive impact on local communities.<p>

<H3>NEW AND EXPANDING BUSINESSES CHOOSING ILLINOIS</H3>

More and more, Illinois is the location of choice for new and expanding
businesses.  Over the past few months, Gov. Jim Edgar has announced several
impressive projects that will create hundreds of new jobs for Illinois
workers.  Among the companies choosing to expand in Illinois are Motorola
and U.S. Robotics -- high technology companies that are contributing to
Illinois' emergence as the "silicon prairie."<P>
     
Motorola recently chose Elgin for the worldwide headquarters of its
Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS).  The $40 million plant is
expected to create 1,500 jobs.  At the official ceremonies announcing the
project, the Governor said, "Illinois is becoming known as the Silicon
Prairie because we deliver on our promise to provide the well-trained
workforce, infrastructure improvements and excellent transportation system
these companies require."<P>

MIMS is a world leader in the manufacture of cutting-edge communications
products associated with pagers and wireless communications.  The
headquarters will be built on a 130-acre parcel near I-90 in Elgin.  It is
slated for completion in 1997.<P>

U.S. Robotics is one of the world's leading suppliers of products and
systems that provide access to information.  The company designs,
manufacturers, markets and supports remote access servers, enterprise
communications systems, desktop/mobile client products and modems.  Gov. Edgar recently participated in
dedication ceremonies for the company's new $30 million manufacturing and
operations facility in Morton Grove, and announced that U.S. Robotics will
continue its investment in Illinois through expanding its Mt. Prospect
facility.<P>

The new Morton Grove plant employs more than 1,400 workers.  Constructed on
a 23-acre site, the 302,000 square-foot plant received a High Impact
Business designation from DCCA, enabling the company to realize an
estimated $1.3 million in business incentives, including an investment tax
credit and an exemption from state utility taxes.  DCCA also provided
$500,000 in job training assistance through the Industrial Training Program
(ITP).  The $40 million Mt. Prospect expansion, expected to create 1,500
jobs, also received a High Impact Business designation from DCCA, which
will provide an estimated $2.1 million in business incentives, as well as
commitment from DCCA to provide training assistance to workers.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser,
said, "As the world-wide demand for information access devices continued to
escalate, we will work with U.S. Robotics and other high technology firms
to ensure that Illinois is a place where these companies can thrive."<P>

Illinois is not only the choice for high-technology industries; it also is
attracting investment from global leaders like McDonald's Corporation,
which is undertaking one of the largest business retention and expansion
projects in the state's history.<P>

McDonald's, which operates 17,400 restaurants in more than 86 nations, will
expand its Oak Brook headquarters, adding as many as 7,000 new jobs over
the next 20 years to the 3,000 jobs currently at the facility.  Mike
Quinlan, McDonald's Chairman and CEO, said," With its excellent business
climate and emphasis on infrastructure improvements, Illinois provides us
with a strong foundation from which we can maximize our Oak Brook home
office support to our global food service business.  We appreciate state
and local government officials working together to support our investment
in Illinois."<P>

Three other recent announcements also solidified Illinois' strength as the
choice for business locations and expansions.<P>Menard, Inc. operates more than 100 retail stores in nine states, including
more than 30 stores in Illinois.  DCCA staff worked closely with company
officials for several months to settle on a location for a new distribution
facility to serve the company's needs.  That search ultimately led to
Plano, where the area's infrastructure (close proximity to rail, three
major interstates and an airport) made it an ideal location for a $20
million distribution center that will serve up to 80 Menard's Home
Improvement stores throughout the Midwest.   The new facility, which will
be completed in two phases, is expected to employ at least 300 people.
GE Lighting, a long-time corporate resident of Mattoon, announced plans in
December to invest $100 million in new production lines at the company's
lamp manufacturing plant.  The modernization project, which will be
assisted through $650,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds
provided by DCCA, is expected to create 50 new jobs during the next four
years.  An additional 150 jobs will be upgraded and 400 jobs will be
retained at the Mattoon plant, which will produce some of the company's
most sophisticated lighting products.<P>

And Moline's downtown area will benefit with John Deere Health Care's
announcement that it will undertake a $38 million development project,
including a 100,000 square-foot building to house John Deere Health Care's
corporate headquarters, a 15,000 square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion
and a new Community Transportation Center.  Plans also call for a new
first-class hotel to accommodate overnight visitors to the area.  Three-
hundred current John Deere Health Care employees and 100 new employees will
work in the new headquarters.  The Pavilion will feature displays and
historic exhibits and is expected to draw up to 400,000 visitors annually.
The Transportation Center will serve as an intercity bus transfer center
and staging area for bus tour groups.  The downtown development project is
being undertaken with more than $1 million in state assistance, including a
$600,000 loan to the City of Moline through DCCA's public infrastructure
program, up to $300,000 in job training funds to assist John Deere Health
Care with worker training, and a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant.
The Illinois Department of Transportation is also expected to provide
infrastructure assistance to help accommodate increased demand for parking
and increased traffic flow on the Arsenal Island Bridge.<P>

<H3>BRAZILIAN TRADE MISSION HIGHLIGHTS ETHANOL USE</H3>

As the nation's leading producer and consumer of ethanol, Illinois has a
vested interest in the development of ethanol-fueled vehicles for use both
here and abroad.  In keeping with that goal, Norm Marek of DCCA's Bureau of
Energy and Recycling recently participated in a Brazilian trade mission
designed to further efforts to develop and utilize more ethanol-fueled
vehicles in the U.S. and other nations.<P>

Marek joined Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Nebraska Gov. Benjamin Nelson
and 15 others, including representatives from two Illinois corporations
that are leading ethanol suppliers, on the six-day Brazilian trade mission.
Participants toured a giant sugar and alcohol production facility at Barra
Bonito and inspected new ethanol/gasahol/flexible fuel vehicles at the
General Motors do Brasil factory at Campanis.  They also attended a
conference on Brazil's experience using ethanol as a transportation fuel.<P>

"Brazil sees a great future for ethanol, especially with known petroleum
reserves dwindling," Marek said.  "Many of their thoughts echoed the
thoughts of those in the Governors' Ethanol Coalition."<P>

A highlight of the trade mission was the announcement by Gov. Thompson that
a cooperative work agreement has been reached between the Governors'
Ethanol Coalition and the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil on the worldwide
promotion of ethanol.<P>

Marek plans to regularly correspond with his Brazilian counterparts to
share information about current ethanol projects underway in Illinois and
keep up with new developments in Brazil.  "I was particularly impressed by
the discussions with the GM-Brazil engineers.  They're currently working on
a compressed natural gas (CNG)/ethanol flexible fuel vehicle.  This could
be an ideal project for Illinois, as it would help to bridge the gap
between ethanol and CNG factions."<P>

<H3>DCCA ANNOUNCES TENTATIVE 1996 CDAP DEADLINES</H3>

DCCA's Bureau of Community Development has set tentative deadlines for
communities to apply for the 1996 round of grants available through the
popular Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

CDAP is a federally-funded block grant program that provides funds to units
of local government, such as cities, villages, townships and counties, that
have  populations of 50,000 or less and are not located within one of the
seven urban counties (Cook, Lake, DuPage, Will, McHenry, Madison and St.
Clair) that receive funds directly from Washington.  Grants are available
for a wide range of projects that benefit low- and moderate-income people,
such as economic development projects that help create new jobs, public
facilities projects that address threats to public health and safety, and
housing rehabilitation.<P>

1996 programs and application deadlines include:<P>

<EM> Economic Development</EM> - Grant funds up to $500,000 are available.  Local
governments may use the funds to loan to a business locating or expanding
in the community to pay for machinery and equipment, working capital, or
building construction and renovation.  As loans are repaid, funds are
deposited into a locally-administered revolving loan fund to be used for
future economic development projects in the community.  Economic
Development grants may also be used to fund infrastructure improvements
directly related to the location or expansion of a business in a community.
These grants are awarded on an as-needed basis throughout the year.<P>

<EM> Planning Assistance</EM> - Local governments may seek grants up to $25,000 to
fund planning activities for future public facilities improvements,
including studies, analyses, data gathering, identification of
implementation actions and preparation of specific plans.  Applications are
judged on a competitive basis and are due on April 16, 1996.  A total of
$500,000 has been allocated for the 1996 round.<P>

<EM> Removal of Architectural Barriers</EM> - Grants up to $150,000 are available to
help local governments remove architectural barriers that restrict those
with disabilities from accessing publicly-owned buildings.  Applications
are judged on a competitive basis and are due on May 6, 1996.  A total of
$1 million is available in 1996.<P>

<EM> Public Facilities Construction/Design Engineering</EM> - Local governments may
compete for grants up to $50,000 for design engineering and up to $400,000
for public facilities construction projects needed to address threats to
public health and safety, such as inadequate water systems or unsafe sewage
treatment facilities.  In 1996, $1 million has been allocated for Design
Engineering grants and $20,860,570 has been earmarked for Public Facilities
Construction grants.  The deadline to apply is July 30, 1996.<P>

<EM> Housing Rehabilitation</EM> - To help ensure that safe, decent housing is
available for low- and moderate-income citizens, local governments may
compete for Housing Rehabilitation grants.  The grants, up to $400,000, are
used to upgrade and expand housing stock in the community.  Applications
are due on October 15, 1996.  A total of $7 million has been allocated for
this component.<P>

<EM> Emergency Public Facilities</EM> - Grants of up to $100,000 are available to
assist local governments when emergencies strike.  Grant funds may be used
to undertake projects that improve public infrastructure and eliminate
threats to public health and safety.  As emergencies may strike at any
time, grants are available on an as-needed basis.  DCCA has allocated $1
million for these grants during 1996.<P>
     
DCCA is also undertaking a three-year transition effort toward a goal of
starting the CDAP Program Year on January 1 of each calendar year.  This
effort is designed to enable DCCA to more expeditiously obligate and expend
CDAP funds.  Program years will be as follows:<P>

Program Year 1995 - June 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1996 - April 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1997 - January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997<BR>

To ease problems associated with compressing Program Year 1996 and the
early start of Program Year 1997, DCCA will use its unfunded, eligible
Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications as the projects to be
funded under Program Year 1997.  This means local governments that
submitted Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications will not have to
re-submit them in Program Year 1997.<P>

Local governments may contact DCCA to receive CDAP application materials
and guidelines.  Contact Kay Wallwork at DCCA, 620 E. Adams, Springfield,
IL  62701, phone 217/785-7546 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).  For further
information about the Community Development Assistance Program, contact
Jean Thomas at 217/782-6136 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<P>

facilities grant application!<P>

<H3>MACLEAN, VER KUILEN NAMED TO KEY POSTS</H3>

Two DCCA veterans have recently been appointed to management positions in
the agency.  Ron Ver Kuilen, whose 15 years at DCCA have included service
as a field scout and manager of the Film Production Unit, has been named
Director of the Illinois Film Office.  Margaret MacLean, who joined DCCA's
International Business Division in 1991 and served as an international
marketing specialist and export promotion officer, has assumed the post of
Division Manager.<P>

As Film Office Director, Ver Kuilen will oversee the state's efforts to
market locations, talent, labor and production expertise to the national
and international film industry.  It's a big job -- since the film office's
inception in 1975, 523 productions have filmed in Illinois contributing
more than $700 million direct cash to the state's economy.<P>

Ver Kuilen has already served as project coordinator for more than 200
productions, including "Home Alone,"  "Field of Dreams," and Groundhog
Day."  But his work is not all glamorous Hollywood lunches and escorting
movie stars.  Most of it involves working with labor, government, business
and community leaders to ensure that doors open for filmmakers, such as
convincing building superintendents to leave the lights on at the Wrigley
Building for a special nighttime shot.  Ver Kuilen has also worked nights,
weekends and even Christmas Day to help filmmakers achieve the effects they
want.<P>

A native of Milwaukee, Ver Kuilen holds bachelor's and master's degrees
from  Northeastern Illinois University.  He is a member of the Association
of Film Commissioners International, manager of his softball team, and was
named 1994's "Facilitator of the Year" by Screen Magazine.<P>

Margaret MacLean's background serves her well as Managing Director of the
International Business Division.  A graduate of Dartmouth College, MacLean
has studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong through a program
sponsored by Yale University, and at Scripps College in Claremont, CA.  She
also completed a year in Tokyo studying the Japanese language.  She is
conversant in Japanese, Chinese and French.<P>

MacLean comes to her post after five years with the Division, where she
advised Illinois manufacturers on export strategies for Asian markets,
researched and analyzed trade issues, developed and maintained contacts and
relations with government and business officials in the U.S. and Asia,
provided training for small business exporting under NAFTA, orchestrated
official visits for foreign dignitaries, and coordinated trade shows and
trade missions overseas.<P>

As Managing Director, she oversees operations of the state's six foreign
offices, and manages a staff of international trade professionals
headquartered in Chicago and Springfield.  Under her direction, the
Division also is administering a $450,000 grant awarded through the federal
government's Market Development Cooperator Program.  As one of only three
states to receive the grant, Illinois is using its funds to provide direct
financial assistance to enable Illinois companies to participate in trade
missions and trade shows overseas.<P>

<HR>
<H3>DCCA'S "ON THE WEB"</H3>

Internet users "surfing" on the World Wide Web can now access information
about DCCA's programs and services!<P>

Located at http://www.accessil.com/dcca/, or through the State Agencies
pick on the State of Illinois home page (http://www. state.il.us.), DCCA's
home page is designed to give Internet users quick, easy access to program
summaries; fact sheets detailing important statistics and information about
Illinois; community profiles; legislation affecting small businesses; and
calendars detailing program deadlines, workshops and other important
information.  In addition, users can access the First-Stop Business
Information Center of Illinois, a new DCCA service that offers valuable
assistance to start-up and small businesses.  First-Stop provides
businesses and individuals with access to information and referral
assistance to guide them through the permitting, licensing and regulatory
processes.  First-Stop also can link them to other available resources that
can help them comply with government regulations and enhance their
competitiveness.<P>

Over the coming months, DCCA will be making other additions and
improvements to its Web site.  One of the most exciting is the anticipated
February debut of a new Illinois Tourism pick specifically designed to help
users plan travel in Illinois.<P>

DCCA also continues to make information available through the Access
Illinois bulletin board system.  Anyone with a PC, modem and communications
software can utilize Access Illinois by calling 217/787-6255, settings
ANSI, 8, N, 1.  The only charge to bulletin board users is for the cost of
the telephone call.<P>
