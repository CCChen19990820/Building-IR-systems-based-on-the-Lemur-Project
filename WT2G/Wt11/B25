Views On Science, Other Issues</font></H1></center>
<P><h4>Government action or inaction on
science and technology issues are vital
to the future of the U.S., but such issues
are rarely discussed in the heat of a presidential campaign. Where do the candidates
stand on research funding? How
would they work to improve science and
mathematics education? What do they
propose to do about controversial environmental issues?</P>
<P>In the belief that readers wish to be
better informed about the candidates'
views on these and related issues,
<i>C&amp;EN,</i> has it has for the past six presidential elections, submitted questions
to
the campaign headquarters of the major candidates. Each question below is
followed by complete responses from
both the Democratic candidate, President Bill Clinton, and the Republican
candidate, former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.</h4></P>
<hr noshade>


<H3><font color="red"><i>How will you prioritize science and technology programs as they compete
for
fewer and fewer discretionary dollars?</I></H3></font>
<P><font color="006400"><big><b>CLINTON:</font></big></b> This Administration
is
committed to a balanced budget by
2002. However, within this envelope,
we are continuing strong support for our
highest priorities, which include science
and technology. The Administration's
commitment is, and has been, to sustain
priority investments in research, education, and the environment, while making
the difficult choices needed to continue
our success in deficit reduction. In the
past three years, the science and technology budgets have increased each year,
and the budget deficit has already been
reduced by 60%. Preserving a vibrant research and educational enterprise and
balancing the budget are responsibilities
to future generations that we cannot and
will not fail to meet.</P>
<P>The Administration's track record and
most recent budget proposal are a very
real indication of priorities. The most recent budget for fiscal 1997 proposed
increases for federal civilian R&amp;D funding,
as traditionally defined, by more than
$1 billion over 1996, and pegs total federal R&amp;D spending at roughly $73
billion. The budget proposes $14 billion
overall for fundamental research, an increase of $278 million over 1996. This
includes a 4% increase for the National Science Foundation on the civilian side,
and
maintains our defense-related fundamental
research activities.</P>
<P>We have continued our support for
technology investment to create new
jobs and new industries. We proposed a
15% increase for the Advanced Technology Program at the Department of Commerce,
and a similar increase for its Manufacturing Extension Program, which - 
in partnership with state government - 
helps small businesses take advantage of
new technologies to make them more
profitable in this globally competitive
world. Funding for breakthrough technologies for clean cars is up 5%, new
building and construction technologies
are up 20%, and we are applying information technologies to make our roads
and highways safer and less crowded,
including a $337 million program of
new technology partnerships aimed at
the 75 most congested urban sites in
the U.S.</P>
<P>We have also proposed increases for
environmental research, including an 8%
increase for research aimed at understanding and predicting global climate
change and its consequences; $72 million for the Environmental Technology
Initiative (a public-private partnership);
increases of $88 million for renewable
energy and $133 million for energy efficiency; and $115 million (a 21% increase)
for the Environmental Protection
Agency's Science To Achieve Results
(STAR) program, a merit-reviewed grants
program for promising new environmental research that includes collaboration
with other agencies such as NSF. We
have continued our strong support for
the space program, including national security space activities and the National
Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration's International Space Station, Mission
to
Planet Earth, and the Reusable Launch
Vehicle program.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><b><big>DOLE:</font></b></big> Basic research, science education,
and transfer of federally funded research to American industry will be the
priorities of my science and technology
policy initiatives. We can accomplish
these important functions while pursuing
deficit reduction and balanced budgets,
which are part of my commitment to providing expanded opportunity for all citizens
through a better, vibrant economy.
While federal science spending represents
an investment, it is not immune from contributing to deficit reduction, particularly
in areas of technology development not
tied to national security.</P>
<P>Without question, the basic science
and technology research base of this
country is without peer in the world,
and the Dole Administration will strongly support the scientific community and
work to strengthen it. Rarely is government so cost-effective. This nation's
sponsorship of basic science has led to
breakthroughs that have enhanced the
quality of life for our citizens.</P>
<P>We must continue supporting the
strong and vital scientific and education
communities and ensure the funding stability that scientists and engineers require
in order to pursue their research
and development objectives.</P>
<P>Also, the Dole Administration will work
closely with the basic research communities in our universities, government,
and
the private sector to ensure the continuity
of funding so vital to sustainability of our
research enterprise.</P>
<P>We will take steps to accelerate the
flow of basic research from our universities to American industry. And we will
help resolve the gap between government funding of the initial research and
the subsequent development being supported by the private sector by changes
to our tax code, regulations, and other
government intrusions into the industrial
community that have contributed to industry backing away from investments in
and support of basic research, technology development, and production of advanced
and innovative technologies. I am
committed to ensuring that federal support for our basic research and associated
education programs does grow.</P>
<P>While I would protect and expand
funding for basic research, I am concerned about funding for technology development
beyond basic research, where
the funding agency appears to act more
as a venture capitalist, trying to pick winners in the technology race, rather
than
letting American industry play its natural role. I would redirect this funding
to
basic research while encouraging American industry to cooperate with our research
universities through tax and other incentives.</P>


<H3><I><font color="red">Government-industry technology research partnerships have increased
substantially in recent years. Do you favor this type of research and why?</font></I></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> The primary means
of government-industry cooperation should be the
transfer of technology to industry from
federally funded programs. I have been a
champion of this technology transfer
throughout my years in Congress. I sponsored the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which
set up the technology transfer programs
from our research universities, which
proved so successful in areas like genetics research.</P>
<P>Industry will invest in R&amp;D if given the
right incentives, such as the R&amp;D tax credit and the reduction of capital
gains taxes.
Regulations also need to be reformed, especially those of the Food &amp; Drug
Administration, which would bring effective new
drugs to patients more promptly. Removal
of unnecessary regulatory hurdles will also
encourage American biotech firms to invest more in research when they see a
clear path for producing and marketing
their products.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> Our Administration came
to office with a conviction that technology is the engine of economic growth
and
job creation. We have improved the business climate for investment in technology
with practical plans for balancing the
budget, continuing research and experimentation tax credits, providing funding
for shared research activities, streamlining regulation, expanding markets for
U.S. products abroad, and protecting U.S.
businesses from unfair foreign trade
practices.</P>
<P>Even in the best business climate, however, there
will always be research that
benefits the nation as a whole but that
cannot pay adequate returns to private investors. The federal government has
a
long tradition of supporting research in
partnership with industry to deliver products for agriculture, health care,
the Internet, and other critical areas.</P>
<P>Intense competition in world markets, uncertainties
growing out of deregulation of telecommunications, electricity, and many other
major markets, and
changes in the market for defense technology have, if anything, increased the
need for carefully selected and well-managed federal investments in both basic
and applied programs. The nonpartisan
Council on Competitiveness and many
other business organizations have understood the need to maintain federal applied
research programs.</P>
<P>The Administration's programs are designed to
balance the budget while maintaining a strong portfolio of investments
in basic and applied research. Our interest in making the most effective use
of
federal funds has led us to rely on research partnerships with businesses,
which can both share the burden of research costs and be positioned to convert
innovations into investments that
create growth and jobs. While we have
shifted research priorities to ensure that
federal program support goes where it is
most valuable, the shifts have been prudent, and backed by careful review from
the academic and university community.
The cost-shared Advanced Technology
Program in the Department of Commerce, for example, is a highly competitive
program that allows innovative U.S.
firms to develop technologies that might
otherwise be developed first abroad. The
program, however, represents less than
1% of the civilian R&amp;D budget.</P>
<P>Arbitrary and ideological cuts in federal applied
research programs - including
partnership programs - have been and
will be resisted by our Administration.
Such cuts would undermine a historic
American success story and deal recklessly with a vital investment in America's
future science and technology enterprise
and growth potential.
</P>


<H3><font color="red"><i>What role would the president's science adviser and the Office of
Science &amp;
Technology Policy play in your Administration?</I></font></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> The science adviser
will continue to be the president's principal counselor on all
matters relating to science and technology. That individual will carry
out the three critical functions of
this important position: to advise
the president and the Cabinet; to
ensure coordination across our scientific and technical agencies; and
to foster collaboration both here at
home and across our national scientific enterprise - public and private,
state and federal - and with our international partners. The science adviser
will maintain linkages across
the science and technology community and keep the president informed of major
advances.</P>
<P>John H. Gibbons has served as a
model science adviser and director
of the Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy over the past four years.
He has put in place for the president a coordinating council of scientific and
technical agencies, the
National Science &amp; Technology
Council, and has guided an eminent
team of outside advisers, the President's
Committee of Advisers on Science &amp;
Technology, who have provided this Administration with strong direction. The
Administration has employed the National Science &amp; Technology Council mechanism
to provide broad strategic R&amp;D priorities to the agencies, helping them
to
function as a "virtual federal R&amp;D enterprise" in areas of overlapping
interests and
complementary programs. These roles of
the science adviser are pivotal, as science
and technology now permeate our everyday life and the world economy to an unprecedented
extent. The role of the president's science adviser will only grow in
importance.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> I would expect that my science
adviser would have an enhanced role
in a Dole Administration. I have seen examples of close collaboration between
presidents and their science advisers since
the Eisenhower Administration. President Clinton has largely ignored his
science adviser and does not really
work with his Science &amp; Technology
Council; having the vice president
participate is no substitute.</P>
<P>It will be especially critical for the
science adviser to work with the director of the Office of Management &amp;
Budget to ensure coordination of all
of our science and technology policies, especially as we implement our
plans to reorganize Cabinet agencies
and to eliminate the Departments of
Energy and of Commerce. And I
would strengthen the role of the Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy
to include vigorous support for those
fields of science and technology that
will be important for national security, such as intelligence, counterterrorism,
and counter-drug operations.</P>
<P>As president, I will convene the
leaders of the scientific research community at a national meeting to learn
from them how the Dole Administration can provide motivation, incentives, and
any other advantage that
will cause industry to support strong research laboratories and more cooperation
with our research universities, so together
we can provide important technology to
our citizens and successfully meet foreign
competition. I see the relationships between federal and state government, research
universities, and industry as the key
to the future of our research enterprise.
The science adviser and the Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy will help
direct
and coordinate these activities.</P>


<H3><I><font color="red">If it became necessary to abolish some federal science agencies in
order to
balance the budget, which would you choose?</font></I></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> Federally supported
basic research would continue to grow in a Dole
Administration. Key agencies and programs at the National Science Foundation,
the National Institutes of Health,
and the Department of Defense will continue to be the major components of our
strategies. It is critical that our plans to
reorganize Department of Commerce
and Department of Energy programs be
executed. By reducing redundancy and
eliminating waste, we should be able to
actually spend more money on basic research even as we remain devoted to
achieving balanced budgets.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> This Administration continues
to attach high priority to public
investments in research and education.
We are also committed to deficit reduction which, among other benefits, would
stimulate further private-sector R&amp;D. The
year-by-year challenge is to support investment 
priorities as the deficit is eliminated by 2002. In the first three years of
this Administration, the deficit has been
reduced by 60%, while the federal R&amp;D
budget has increased each year.</P>
<P>As the federal budget is brought into
balance, the research budgets for both
NIH and NSF and for environmental research across the agencies have been
protected. This reflects the Administration's commitment to biomedical research
that will ultimately return enormous benefits to Americans' health, as
well as to maintain federal support for
America's research colleges and universities, the bedrock of our science and
technology enterprise. While our commitment is, and has been, to sustain priority
investments in education, the environment, research, and technology, we will
have to make difficult choices. Nevertheless, concern about the out-year projections
should be tempered by the track
record of the past few years. Furthermore, national economic performance
will determine the availability of additional resources. By agreement, current
out-year spending forecasts are guided by
the Congressional Budget Office economic forecasts. Our economy has proved far
stronger than these projections. If strong
economic performance is sustained, for
which continued deficit reduction is centrally important, then substantial pressure
on nondefense discretionary spending
will be relieved.</P>


<H3><font color="red"><I>The national laboratories of the Department of Energy are in a state
of flux.
How do you think these valuable resources should be utilized?</I></font></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> The Department
of Energy national laboratories have been enormously productive in contributing
to
agency core missions and to national
goals. They must continue to do so.
Among the federal agencies, DOE has
prime responsibility for research in subatomic physics, for developing enabling
technologies aimed at an environmentally responsible energy system, for maintaining
the safety and reliability of the
nuclear weapons stockpile through a science-based program, and for environmental
remediation. The laboratories have
unique capabilities that are essential
parts of the national research infrastructure, such as the cutting-edge
accelerators and reactors used by
15,000 academic, industry, and government scientists.</P>
<P>The end of the Cold War and the
imperative to make government
more efficient have focused increased attention on streamlining
the laboratory structure. Progress
has been made. For example, DOE
laboratory personnel levels have
dropped by 7% since fiscal 1993
while preserving the core programs
and indeed responding to new
challenges (such as science-based
stockpile stewardship). The department has created the Laboratory Operation
Board, composed
of high-ranking department and
laboratory officials and of experienced private-sector individuals,
to oversee the continuation of the
streamlining process. Under Laboratory Operation Board auspices,
laboratory missions are being systematically reviewed. A fresh look
is being taken at how other sectors, particularly academia, can partner more
effectively with the laboratories in carrying
forward their missions. Our goal is to
preserve their responsibilities to the department and the nation, while realizing
the streamlining needed to meet budgetary constraints</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> I am committed to reorganizing
the function of two large government departments that support science:
Energy and Commerce. Too often,
money goes to support the overhead of
government agencies, rather than to
the researchers. The necessity for finding additional savings everywhere in
government to help reduce the deficit
mandates a complete review of how to
make the government's science support
infrastructure more coherent, to avoid
reducing funding for basic research
itself.</P>
<P>DOE has for the most part gotten out
of the nuclear weapons development
business, which was one of the main reasons it was created in the first place.
I
believe the mission of the national labs
needs to be closely scrutinized. There
have been many studies and plans purporting to address new strategies,
but to date these have not resulted
in the execution of meaningful reforms. There is still too much duplication,
redundancy, and waste, and
the labs are competing with each
other and with the private sector,
with no significant improvement
in the important areas of accelerating tech transfer and international
trade.</P>
<P>The national labs will be transferred from DOE
to the Department of Defense in my Administration, and not eliminated - as
some
in the opposing political camp have
unfairly suggested. While we review the mission of DOE labs, it
will be important to review the laboratories associated with the Department
of Defense, NASA, the Department of Transportation, and
other government agencies. We
must avoid duplication and waste
throughout the government so that
we can increase the effectiveness
of our federal investment in basic
research.
</P>


<H3><font color="red"><I>How would you develop the science and technology needed to lessen
the
chance of terrorist use of chemical or biological weapons in the U.S.?</I></font></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><b><BIG>DOLE:</BIG></B></font> Efforts have
been under way within
the national laboratories
for some time to improve
both our detection and
prevention of terrorist activities in these as well as
more conventional forms.
The explosions at the
World Trade Center and
in Oklahoma City, the
saga of the Unabomber,
and the chemical warfare
contamination problems
stemming from the Persian Gulf War have given
an edge to those efforts
and have contributed to
their solution. This effort
will obviously be an ongoing priority.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> Science
and technology provide
critical capabilities to this
Administration's battle
against terrorism. New
approaches are being developed to detect chemical or biological
agents rapidly, to protect the public safety
personnel who must respond to a chemical or biological attack, to treat individuals
who have been exposed to these
agents, and to decontaminate and certify the safety of an affected environment
afterward. Simulation and modeling tools
help assess our vulnerability to such attacks and identify the most effective
ways
to reduce these vulnerabilities. In addition
to the development of new equipment, increased attention is being devoted to
assembling and exercising teams of trained
personnel who can respond to chemical
or biological attack. Rapid detection, treatment, and decontamination of a chemical
or biological attack will not only reduce
the damage that such an attack would
cause, but would also lessen the incentive
for anyone to attempt to
conduct one.</P>
<P>Science and technology
complement other aspects
of this Administration's
antiterrorism policy that
range from improved intelligence to block such
threats before they materialize to effective law
enforcement that will increase the chances of
identifying and capturing
terrorists to a full range
of diplomatic and military responses available to
respond to states or nonstate groups found to be
responsible for aiding terrorist attacks. Related measures can make it more
difficult for terrorists to
acquire the means to carry out chemical or biological attacks. These include
ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention,
an international treaty
that requires states to
criminalize the development and production of chemical agents and that controls
international trade in specialized precursor
chemicals used in their manufacture. New
regulations are being developed by the
Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention
to restrict shipment of dangerous disease-causing organisms to only those scientists
with legitimate need and appropriate facilities to work with them.</P>


<H3><font color="red"><I>Should the U.S. change its intellectual property law to conform to
other systems and, if so, why?</I></font></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font>This Administration
has
worked diligently to protect the fruits
of American creativity. Although the intellectual property laws of many other
nations are not now nearly as effective
as ours, several positive international
developments have already been fostered successfully by this Administration.
The General Agreement on Tariffs&amp;
 Trade Uruguay round agreements
that established the World Trade Organization (WTO) included an Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights. All WTO members
must adhere to the agreement that establishes comprehensive standards for
the protection of intellectual property
and the enforcement of intellectual
property rights in member countries.
Each WTO member must apply the substantive obligations of the world's most
important intellectual property conventions, and supplement those conventions
with substantive additional protection to ensure that critical enforcement procedures
will be available in
each member country to safeguard intellectual property rights. This provides
added protection for U.S. technology
abroad.</P>
<P>Some changes in our own intellectual
property laws are being advanced to improve protection offered in the U.S. A
legislative change under consideration by
Congress is the publication of patent applications 18 months after their filing
date. All of the major patent systems
throughout the world, except the U.S.,
provide for the publication of patent applications 18 months from the earliest
effective filing date. Given the ever-increasing
need for worldwide patent protection, the
current U.S. system does not favor domestic inventors. Japanese and European
inventors are able to obtain an early disclosure of U.S. and other technology
in
their own languages. In the U.S., however, domestic inventors do not have
the benefit of an English-language publication of the technology disclosed in
a
patent application until the patent is
granted. Given that over 40% of U.S.
patent applications originate from
abroad, this puts U.S. inventors at a
clear disadvantage in relation to their
foreign counterparts. Whenever a feature of a foreign system could be adopted
in the U.S. to improve our own system, it should be seriously considered,
not for the sake of global harmonization
alone, but more importantly, to offer
our inventors the best system possible
to protect their intellectual property
most effectively.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> The worldwide protection
of
U.S. intellectual property rights has been
in the first rank of our trade priorities for
more than a decade. The intensely competitive atmosphere in every part of the
information and communications arena requires that the strongest measures be
taken to stem international piracy of U.S. intellectual property, and I would
continue
to insist on recognition of U.S. patent and
trademark rights as the bedrock of any ongoing trading relationship. A variety
of other countries have developed systems that
basically aid and abet intellectual property
theft, and it will be a continuing priority of
my trade negotiators to bring those countries into conformity with our own and
the developed world's practices.</P>


<H3><font color="red"><I>U.S. students rank low internationally in their knowledge of science
and
technology. What steps can be taken to revitalize their interest?</I></font></H3>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>DOLE:</big></B></font> The need to attract
more able
students, including women and minorities, into science and technology has been
evident
for several decades. We
must broadly strengthen
science education, from kindergarten through graduate
school. This does not mean
the federal government
should take over the direction of local schools' science programs. The primary
responsibility for scientific literacy is in the local schools. Often, the federal
government has made
things worse. For instance,
in the Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 program,
national history standards
were developed that had no
mention of Edison or the
Wright brothers. How can
we get our children excited
about becoming scientists
and engineers if they are
taught a history where scientists and engineers are
unimportant?</P>
<P>What the federal government can do is continue
its
support of science programs on television, and
encourage industry's cooperation. Many of today's young scientists
got their introduction to science with
programs like "Ask Mr. Wizard." NSF
has supported summer institutes for
public school teachers and for high
school students, and programs to allow
undergraduate students to
work on university research
projects. These programs all
encourage our best students to consider careers in
science and engineering.
They provide opportunities
to women and minorities,
who have been underrepresented in science and
engineering. The Westinghouse National Science Contest, with four-year scholarships
as prizes, created a
marvelous focus at a national level.</P>
<P>The federal government
should also support development of curriculum material
to be delivered to schools
using new technologies like
the Internet. This can provide educational opportunities to students wherever
their schools are located - 
particularly in rural areas
and the inner city, where
school budgets can't support large science programs.
And we should devise programs that encourage businesses to donate computer
equipment, provide teacher
support, and help the schools maintain
the computers.</P>
<P>The government, through the National Science
Foundation and other science-related agencies, has a responsibility to
explain and foster science and technology understanding. Increasing scientific
literacy is part and parcel of increasing
literacy at all levels. By maintaining and
improving that awareness, we will increase the number of talented students
in science and technology.</P>
<P><font color="006400"><B><big>CLINTON:</big></B></font> The vast majority of
high-quality 21st-century jobs will be
those performed by "knowledge workers." Our children must be provided
math and science education, kindergarten through 12th grade, at world-class
standards, and access to higher education must be expanded. A milestone in
the Administration's commitment was
passage of "Goals 2000: Educate America
Act" in March 1994. This legislation commits the federal government to
helping
advance standards-based instruction as
the key tool in systemic reform of math
and science education, while leaving implementation of those standards (such
as
selection of curriculum materials and testing methods) to state and local discretion.
In addition to raising student achievement
in math and science, Goals 2000 also addresses the professional development
of
teachers.</P>
<P>Success in this effort will require the
grassroots commitment of many individuals and institutions in our society, with
the federal government being mainly a
facilitator. Industry is playing an important role by communicating the skills
needed for the 21st-century jobs they are
creating and the importance of that skill
base in making business decisions, such
as location of new research centers of
manufacturing capacity. Colleges and
universities need to reexamine their role,
from teacher training to direct faculty involvement to setting their own math
and
science requirements in a way that lifts
precollege standards. We need a shared
national commitment to high educational expectations.</P>
<P>Strengthened kindergarten through
12th-grade math and science education
will provide many more young people
with the chance to pursue scientific and
technical careers. Our commitment to
university-based research as the core of
our basic science and engineering enterprise will continue to provide opportunity
for the finest graduate training available anywhere in the world.

ChemCenter may be the newest electronic
information service from ACS, but it is certainly not the first. In the
1960s, before the Internet existed, CAS had already computerized the
registration of new chemical substances, and this became one of the
first scientific databases available for remote online searching. In
the early 1980s, in cooperation with scientific organizations in Europe
and Japan, CAS developed the STN International Network to offer
searching through a graphically distributed network that to this day
remains unique in many respects.
</P>


<P>Of course, something as ambitious and complex as ChemCenter is
never really complete, and new material and contributors are being
added every day. Lorrin Garson, chief technology officer for ACS
Publications, has been involved in the development and use of computer technology at ACS since 1974. He says, "We've been working on the
delivery of electronic products for the whole time I've been here."
</P>


It all started by creating databases to store the information
in the ACS journals, and even though there was no viable technology to
deliver the information electronically at the time, he says, "It was
well understood that we would eventually do this." Great technology
like the Web, super PCs for the masses, HTML (hypertext markup
language), and all the other goodies that we take for granted today
were not even dreamed of in the early seventies. Although ChemCenter
was put together in record time, Garson points out that it was "the
culmination of over twenty years of work, and not something that
happened overnight."

could provide
information on the whole ACS (American Chemical Society) to its members

<center><h3><a href="auth.html">Robert T. Martinott</h3></a></center>
<p>The American Chemical Society was founded
in 1876 and, like the science and industry it serves, ACS has been
growing ever since. Today, it is the largest scientific society in the
world devoted to a single discipline, offering an almost bewildering
array of resources, products, and services to the chemical community.
Technical databases and journals, books, magazines, advisories, career
guidance, and other resources are available to members and other
interested parties. However, it has always been difficult, for me at
least, to fully appreciate the scope of ACS and the myriad departments
and services it comprises. Of course, the information has always been
there - somewhere. 
</P>


<P>Every division and product area of the Society produces many brochures,
booklets, direct mailings, and other material to let you know what is
going on and what is available. Some divisions, notably the ACS
Publications Division and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), have had
Web home pages on the Internet for almost two years. Until recently,
however, there was no single source that could provide information on
the whole ACS to its members and to the world at large. Well, that's
all over now!
</P>

<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">OPEN SESAME</font></h3> 
Enter ChemCenter, an "open sesame," not only to ACS but to
the whole spectrum of chemistry, chemical-related data, education, and
products, and even to the Internet universe beyond. Simply punch in
<b><a href="http://www.chemcenter.org">http://www.chemcenter.org</a></b>  on your Web browser and be impressed - I know
that I was. Surfing ChemCenter is something like peeling an onion layer
by layer, with one major difference: Unlike the onion that gets
progressively smaller as you go, the more you peel ChemCenter, the
bigger it becomes. In fact, ChemCenter could become the one-stop
shopping URL (uniform resource locator) for all your professional and
personal needs. 
</P>


<P>ChemCenter is up and running largely thanks to the efforts of staff at
CAS in Columbus, OH, the ACS Publications Division, and the Information
Services group at ACS in Washington, DC. Last summer, they were faced
with the monumental task of having to create an umbrella home page for
all of ACS, and it was wanted yesterday. In a remarkably short time,
ChemCenter was completed and online in time for the ACS Fall National
Meeting in Orlando, FL. 
</P>


<P>During the initial implementation, staff in Columbus focused on
developing the overall technical infrastructure while staff in
Washington focused on scientific and technical content. CAS was able to
draw on decades of experience in electronic information retrieval <b>(see
sidebar)</b>. 
</P>

<hr noshade>
<h3>TO SIDEBAR: <a href="evol.html">The Evolution of ChemCenter</a></h3>
<hr noshade>


<P>A major problem has been the sheer size of a full-scale
production system. "It is one thing to put up an occasional article
from a magazine; it is quite another to provide access to the full
22,000 pages a year in the <I>Journal of Physical
Chemistry</i>, for example, or the 18,000 pages of
<I>Biochemistry</i>," says Lorrin Garson, chief
technology officer for ACS Publications. When you take into account the
twenty-nine magazines and journals, half a dozen newsletters, and who
knows how many other information booklets and releases that ACS
produces, you begin to get an idea of what such a project entails. As a
result, many ACS publications are not yet fully online, but they will
be soon. The same is true for dozens of other ACS offerings and
programs that appear in their own ChemCenter pages. The material is
descriptive and provides all the necessary information about contacts,
but it is not yet fully interactive. 
</P>


<P>Another problem has been the need to correct certain misconceptions in
the minds of the users. Many customers are members or librarians who
believe this is something that mimics print in terms of content,
usability, and pricing. However, the content, convenience, and
usability of online journals and other data exceed what is offered by
the print media. 
</P>


<P>"If you look, for example, at supporting information," says Garson,
"a lot of that material would be pretty hard to put in print." And,
he admits, "We're having a hard time trying to establish pricing and
access control for this stuff." Although electronic access to the
journals was free during the initial introduction period, as of January
1997, users must subscribe to them. Yet there is no doubt that the ACS
presence on the Web is being well received. When the Publications Web
site first went online in January 1995, the number of hits per month
was in the hundreds. Now, the number of hits is about a million a month
and growing. 
</P>


<P>To try to describe in any detail all of ChemCenter's features in a
short article like this would be futile. Besides, the only way to
really appreciate what ChemCenter can do for you is to spend some time
browsing through it. ChemCenter is still very much a work in progress
and will undoubtedly undergo many changes, improvements, and additions.
However, here is a sampling of the services and new features that are
attracting so many users.
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">PUBLICATIONS</font></h3>
The <I>Journal of Physical Chemistry</i>, one
of science publishing's oldest journals, became ACS's first
interactive Internet journal on 1 June 1996. Articles are available for
searching and browsing, and the Web version has streamlined
capabilities to search for words in title, text, or abstract. You can
browse a cumulative table of contents, conduct author name searches, or
look up articles by manuscript or page number. 
</P>


<P><I>Biochemistry</i> and <I>Environmental
Science & Technology</i> have also debuted on the World Wide Web.
The user can access peer-reviewed research, and articles through 1996
are full-text searchable. In addition, a quarter-million pages of
supporting information have already been downloaded to the Web, and the
response to the site has been overwhelming. 
</P>


<P>The supporting information consists of scientific calculations, tables,
charts, and other supplementary sources that substantiate the
scientific research presented in ACS journals and allows readers to
review how authors of papers reach their conclusions. No other
publisher offers this service. 
</P>


<P>Three ACS journals available on CD-ROM are <I>The Journal
of Organic Chemistry</i>, the <I>Journal of the
American Chemical Society</i>, and
<I>Biochemistry</i>. Each CD-ROM contains every aspect
of the original journal page: chemical structures, equations, spectra,
schematic diagrams, tables, mathematical equations, and even
photographs and graphics. A powerful search engine makes finding what
you want a snap, and the high-resolution images (sharper and clearer
than on standard CDs) ensure crisp reproductions from your laser or
color printer. 
</P>


<P>If you can't wait to see what's in the upcoming issue of your
favorite ACS journals, you can view the tables of contents (TOCs) of
all ACS journals before you receive your copy in the mail. Journal
subscribers get the additional benefit of being able to search and
browse the full year's worth of TOCs of the journal to which they
subscribe. 
</P>


<P>The CAplus Table of Contents Service from CAS is an even more
ambitious system. The source material for the CAplus TOC is the more
than 1,350 key chemical journals from the CAplus database. Each time a
new journal issue is entered into the database, a TOC is created and
sent to you in the form requested: hard copy, fax, Internet mail, or
STNmail. CAplus is updated each business day, ensuring that you get the
most recent information as fast as possible. No other TOC service can
do it faster. 
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">DIGGING DEEPER</font></h3>
There are so many other databases, information sources, and
search engines under the ChemCenter home page that I can just skim over
them. For example, the ACS Books Department is on the Net with a home
page that provides access to lists of recent titles and a Gopher
catalog of all the books available from ACS, searchable by author,
title, or subject. The site also provides guidelines and other services
for prospective authors. 
</P>


<P>CAS offers a link to its databases on STN using traditional STN Express
software for holders of regular STN accounts. In addition, it has a
special service for Internet users, called Chemical Patents Plus, which
allows anyone to search for and purchase copies of patents without
setting up an STN account. CAS plans more Internet-oriented access to
STN databases through ChemCenter in early 1997.
</p>
<p>
<img src="cc.gif" align=right hspace=6>
<h3><font color="00008B">ELECTRONIC SHOPPING</font></h3>
If you are looking for lab equipment, reagent chemicals,
or what-have-you, ChemCenter is on top of that, too. The Publications
Division has its Product Information Network (PIN) with online catalogs
of such things as audio/video products and science teaching resources. 
</P>


<P>A new offering is the online version of <I>Analytical
Chemistry's LabGuide</i>, which allows
you to browse through the alphabetical listings or search for a
specific product, service, or company. Web sites and e-mail addresses
provided by advertising companies can be reached simply by clicking on
the desired item. 
</P>


<P>If you are searching for chemicals, the place to look is in CHEMCATS.
Available from CAS on the STN International network, CHEMCATS includes
more than forty catalogs (with more to come) from chemical suppliers
worldwide. Simply enter the name of a chemical or chemical supplier, or
start with a chemical structure search to find the name or CAS Registry
Number. In minutes, or even seconds, CHEMCATS will find the product and
supplier information you need in a growing database of more than
200,000 catalog records and 138,000 CAS Registry Numbers. 
</P>


<P>As I write this article, work is ongoing to make
<I>Chemical & Engineering News's Chemcyclopedia</i>
available on ChemCenter as well. You will also be able to access this
respected source for the purchase of chemical products. 
</p>
<br clear="all">
<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">FINDING MORE</font></h3> 
A click on the Chemistry Resources icon brings up a large
selection of other point-and-click Web sites and directories that are
of interest to chemists. As I write this, there are links to sixty-two
sites under the general headings of Starting Materials, Other
Professional Societies & Scientific Organizations, and Science
Smorgasbord. That number is sure to grow rapidly, and the ChemCenter
group is actively seeking suggestions and URLs from users. 
</P>


<P>To go beyond purely chemical areas and enter the larger world of the
Internet, you can choose the Search icon. It is aptly named, because
some of the most powerful search engines on the Internet are
represented there. For starters, you can tap into the Library of
Congress; or, if you are looking for somebody's e-mail address
anywhere in the world, there are seven people-searching services,
including Bigfoot and Switchboard, that will find it for you. 
</P>


<P>To find company and business Web sites, there are ten "Yellow Page"
directories to choose from, including The Global Yellow Pages, World
Wide Yellow Pages, and the WWWeb Business Yellow Pages. 
</P>


<P>And finally, to really get out there and surf the Web, there is a long
list of the best-known and most powerful starting points available. You
can click onto WebCrawler, Magellan, Lycos, YAHOO Hotlist, and many
more - any one of which can get you started on a journey into
cyberspace.
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">PROFESSIONAL SERVICES</font></h3>
ACS is a membership organization and, as such, provides unique
services to chemists. For example, ACS Career Services enhances the
professional and economic status of members by providing one-on-one
career assistance; direct contact with employers; and information on
employment data, trends, and issues. Programs are offered in Career
Assistance, Employment Services, Workshops and Presentations, Workforce
Analysis, Videos, and Publications. 
</P>


<P>Newly online is the ACS Job Bank, a joint effort of the Department of
Career Services and the Publications Division, which was the hottest
item on ACS Web sites in 1996. It allows ACS members to search for jobs
available to chemical professionals through classified and display ads
from <I>Chemical & Engineering News</i>. Updated
weekly, the ACS Job Bank provides links to other online job banks; the
Web home pages of major companies are also included.
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="00008B">TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT</font></h3>
If ever there was a case of a picture being worth a thousand
words, this is it. The only way to learn about ChemCenter is to go
there and see it for yourself. Bear in mind that it is a work in
progress. As you browse, you will find many requests for comments,
suggestions, and contributions. This is your ACS, and you are invited
to be a participant in the development and growth of ChemCenter.

<img src="feet.gif" align=left hspace=6>
<h2><i><font color="green">Your feet are where the buck stops, and they deserve care and
attention before they put you out of business. A 1930s radio jingle for
shoe cream advised that "If you wore shoes upon your head, you'd
make sure they look neat." There's a lesson there for feet</font></i></h2>
<center><h3><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/tcaw/96/dec/authfeet.html">
Trevor Smith</a></h3></center>
</p>
<p>
It is hard to concentrate on work
if your feet hurt. Foot ailments vary from trivial to serious, so
let's look at avoidance, self-treatment, and when to seek help.
</p>
<p>
<h3><font color="maroon">PAMPER YOUR FEET</font></h3>
We live in a society that regards shoes as a fashion symbol;
looking good takes precedence over function. When you buy your next
pair of shoes, visit the store late in the day when your feet are
largest. "Our studies have shown that feet expand about one size
(one-third inch) in length and width after only about thirty minutes of
continuous activity," says Harry Hlavac, a podiatrist in Mill Hill,
CA. 
</P>


<P>Check shoes for quality of stitching and gluing. Put your hands in them
and feel for lumps and bumps. Try on both shoes of each pair you look
at, walk around, and climb stairs, if possible. Suitable shoes should
fit well and be comfortable in the store; don't buy them if they feel
marginally acceptable. You may believe they will be okay once you break
them in, but that may not happen. Shoes that you have been wearing for
a while should be kept in good repair. 
</P>


<P>If you have trouble finding a comfortable fit because of problems such
as bunions or hammertoes, find a store that has a pedorthist, a
specialist trained to match problem feet with appropriate shoes. In
extreme cases, you may be advised that the best solution is a
custom-made shoe. Although this option is more expensive than regular
shoes, it is less expensive and less traumatic than foot surgery. 
</P>


<P>Sock material is important. If you always have dry feet, you can wear
anything. If your feet are often damp or sweaty, wear polypropylene or
acrylic socks and avoid cotton. Cotton is hydrophilic and clings to
water like limpets on rock. It provides a permanently damp environment
for your feet that encourages fungal infections and blisters.
Polypropylene and acrylic are hydrophobic, wick sweat away from your
skin by capillarity, and carry it to the outside of the fabric surface
where it can evaporate. 
<h3><font color="maroon">SELF-TREAT SORE SPOTS</font></h3>
Corns and calluses are a thickening of the top layer of
skin. A callus tends only to spread outward, but a corn tends to grow
inward as well. Because they are in only the stratum corneum, which is
dead tissue, you can simply get rid of them. Soak your foot in warm
water to soften the tissue. Then pare away carefully with a sharp
blade, or smooth away with a pumice stone, callus file, or even
sandpaper. Corns and calluses are reactions to pressure and friction,
so look for the cause. If you find tight spots in your shoes, stretch
them or take them to a shoe repairer or a pedorthist to be stretched.
You can also try wearing thicker socks or loosening shoelaces, or apply
pads such as Moleskin, lamb's wool, or Second Skin to relieve
pressure. 
</P>


<P>Warts look similar to corns but are caused by viral infections and can
spread by contact. Warts tend to grow inward and can contain folds of
healthy tissue, so avoid cutting or abrading them. You can ignore small
warts that do not cause pain, and they will probably disappear within a
couple of years. A favorite site for a wart is the ball of your foot,
and the pressure can cause pain. You can treat a plantar wart with
salicylic acid preparations from the drugstore to kill infected tissue.
Apply the preparation for a couple of days, then scrub the area with a
small brush and soapy water for a minute, twice a day for two days.
Repeat the cycle for a couple of weeks and longer, or as long as it
continues to work. If the treatment does not seem to work, or the wart
grows rapidly and spreads, visit a podiatrist or a dermatologist. More
aggressive treatments include burning, freezing, or, as a last resort,
surgery. 
</P>


<P>Blisters are the end result of friction that causes an
inflammation in which the outer live skin layer, the epidermis,
separates and forms a fluid-filled sac. This usually contains watery
plasma-like fluid, but it sometimes fills with blood. You can puncture
a painful intact blister with a flame-sterilized needle. Pierce the
blister close to its border with healthy skin, squeeze out the fluid,
and cover with a sterile dressing. If the blister has already burst,
more friction can make it raw. Clean the area with your favorite
antiseptic. Avoid covering burst blisters with simple dressings,
because these do not absorb pressure. To protect the area from more
damage, cut doughnut-shaped pads of Moleskin or Molefoam, which will
transfer pressure to the surrounding area. Alternatively, use Second
Skin or Compeed. These excellent products have mechanical properties
similar to those of skin, and they cushion and protect your blister. 
</P>


<P>Always remember to use antiseptics on burst or punctured blisters to
guard against infection. Because blisters are caused by friction, you
need to check your shoes for tight spots. Check that your socks or hose
are not wrinkled; seams can be another trouble source. Damp skin has
higher friction than dry skin and is more likely to lead to blisters.
You can lower friction with a lubricant; the finest is petroleum jelly.
This sounds messy, but it works. 
</P>

<hr>
<h2><font color="00008B"><center>WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT REGARDS SHOES AS A
FASHION SYMBOL; LOOKING GOOD TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER FUNCTION</center></font>
</h2>
<hr>


<P>Cut toenails straight across, not curved, so you do not leave little
spikes of nail against your skin that can grow inward. If you do
develop a painful ingrown nail, you need to have a small piece of nail
cut away from the edge. If you are very confident of your manual
skills, you can do this yourself, but you must use antiseptic
afterward. Unless you know what you are doing, let a podiatrist handle
ingrown nails. In some cases, after repeated unsuccessful treatments,
chronic ingrown nails may have to be removed surgically. 
</P>


<P>If you stub your toe, you can develop a black toenail. This often
happens to runners and devotees of jumping sports who have poorly
fitting shoes and jam their toes. The black appearance is caused by
bleeding under the nail. Open a paper clip and hold it in a pair of
pliers while you heat it to red heat in a flame. Touch the top of your
black nail with the hot paper clip. The nail will melt painlessly and
release the blood, which should save your nail. If the appearance does
not bother you and your black nail is painless, you may ignore it. A
new nail will grow and eventually push out the damaged one. 
</P>


<P>Among the many fungal infections that plague feet, the most common is
athlete's foot. You do not have to be an athlete to pick up athlete's
foot; all it takes is exposure to the fungus. This wretched organism
thrives in warm, moist areas, usually beginning between your toes. At
first, you experience redness and itching. If you do not take care of
it quickly, your symptoms will grow worse. You will develop scaling and
cracks and, as the infection increases, you may end up with blistery
sores. 
</P>


<P>At the first sign of athlete's foot, use an over-the-counter topical
antifungal ointment. You must be persistent with treatment because the
fungus is in your skin, not on the surface. Apply sufficient medication
to cover all the skin so the ingredient can penetrate, and continue
treatment until you have no symptoms at all. Be careful to avoid
reinfection; the fungus spreads enthusiastically in damp environments.
You can dry your feet more thoroughly after showers and baths by using
ethyl rubbing alcohol as a jet from a squeeze bottle. If self-treatment
doesn't work and your symptoms persist or worsen, a podiatrist or
dermatologist may recommend prescription medication.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color="maroon">SEEK PROFESSIONAL CARE</font></h3>
You will not receive good help from most primary care
physicians for foot pain caused by anatomical or biomechanical defects.
Your best choices are a podiatrist or an orthopedist. 
</P>


<P>The five podiatric medical schools in the US provide training that
leads to the degree Doctor of Podiatric Medicine. Such doctors are
specialists at least equivalent to those who choose regular medical
schools and obtain an M.D., then go on to become orthopedic surgeons
who specialize in feet. Podiatrists tend to have better knowledge of
biomechanics and more experience in the advanced surgical procedures
required to correct foot problems than do orthopedic surgeons. However,
some orthopedic surgeons become foot specialists, and you can identify
these by their membership in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle
Society. There are far more podiatrists than orthopedic foot
specialists. 
</P>


<P>Here are the principal problems that need expert help. 
</P>


<P>Between foot strike and toe off, during walking or running, your ankle
rolls in slightly in a motion called pro<hp>nation. Low-arch feet
pronate excessively, and high-arch feet underpronate (or even rotate
outward, a tendency called supination). Repeated abnormal foot
rotations can cause pain in your feet and sometimes in your legs. The
more physical activities you enjoy, the more likely you are to develop
overuse symptoms. Abnormal rotations can be corrected by orthotic
inserts in your shoes. 
</P>


<P>Your big toe and second toe should be about the same length. Then the
load-bearing centers of your foot are behind your big toe, your fifth
toe, and the middle of your heel. Some people have an abnormally short
bone in their big toe, which makes their second toe look much longer
than their big toe. This is called Morton's Syndrome, or Morton's
Foot. A short big toe displaces load bearing from behind the big toe
toward the smaller toes. In very active people, this can cause pain in
feet and legs. This also can be countered by orthotic inserts in your
shoes. 
</P>


<P>In a bunion, the bone at the base of your big toe grows bigger and
moves away from the other bones. While this bone moves outward, the
bone at the end of the big toe moves toward the smaller toes. Your big
toe is then bent and often pushes the second toe up or down, out of its
way. The increased pressure causes blisters, calluses, and painful
inflammation. You can counter these symptoms by wearing shoes with
wider toe boxes and by not using the lowest eyelets for laces. Cutting
a hole in the top of the shoe makes more room for a swollen joint. You
can also have orthotic inserts made to rearrange the forces on your
foot, or you can have shoes custom made. As a last resort, you can have
the whole area surgically reduced, fractured, and reset to correct the
misalignment. 
</P>


<P>Hammertoes are bent where they join the rest of your foot. This
makes the middle joint of the toes rise, so it rubs on your shoes,
causing pain, calluses, or corns. Again, you need roomier shoes and
perhaps pads to absorb the pressure. If hammertoes become a problem you
no longer wish to endure, they can be surgically fractured, grooved,
and reset in correct alignment. It is often said that bunions and
hammertoes tend to be inherited. But these defects are not known in
barefoot populations, and 90 percent of the cases occur in women, who
often wear pointy, flimsy shoes. It seems more likely that the only
thing that is inherited is a tendency to wear inadequate shoes, and
over many years bad shoes realign the bones in your feet. 
</P>

<center><img src="foot.gif"></center>

<P>In addition to choosing well-fitting, comfortable shoes, you can also
exercise your feet for strength and flexibility. Here's a routine
recommended by Paul Taylor, a podiatrist in Silver Spring, MD:
<ul>
<li>Sit down and spread a towel in front of you. Grip an edge of
the towel by curling your toes around it and lift it a few inches off
the floor. Hold five seconds, then let go. Switch to the other foot,
and continue to alternate feet until they begin to feel tired. 
<li>Sit down and flex your foot up and down vertically to stretch
your ankle. Next, keep your heel still and turn your foot from side to
side to stretch your ankle. Repeat each move thirty to forty times for
each foot.
<li>Stand with your feet twelve to eighteen inches apart. Turn
your ankles until you are standing on the outside edges of your feet.
Slowly turn your ankles until you are standing on the inside edges of
your feet. Bend your knees a little if this feels better. Repeat twenty
to thirty times.
<li>Take a band of stretchable material. Loop the band over your
toes to join your feet. Sit down and raise your legs straight out in
front, ankles about five inches apart. Keep your heels still and turn
your feet outward against the resistance of the band, then turn your
feet inward. Repeat twenty to thirty times.
<li>Walk around on your toes for up to five minutes. Now walk on
your heels for up to five minutes. 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If your feet are in good shape, you should be able to
perform these exercises without discomfort. Build slowly until you can
complete three sets of each two or three times a week. You can also
massage tired feet with your thumbs, and whirlpool treatments feel
good, too.

Mexico's Economic Recovery<br>
Spurs Chemical Trade</center></h1>

<hr noshade>
<p>
<P>Strong domestic economic recovery 
and continuing expansion of trade
with its northern and southern
neighbors has brought an apparent end
to Mexico's recession.</P>
<P>But Mexico is still coping with the
fallout of political commotion even as it
strives to strengthen its role in the international community. Various incidents
during 1996 epitomized the nation's
growing pains.</P>
<P>One example is the collapse and restart of the
Mexican government's attempt to put its petrochemical industry
into the hands of private investors. After several months of studying legal
aspects, the government called off its
initial plan - which called for eventual
100% private ownership - because of
the political and public outcry against
it. In October, the government outlined
a new plan that will allow domestic and
foreign private investors to take up to a
49% ownership in the 61 petrochemical
plants operated by Petr&oacute;leos Mexicanos (Pemex).</P>
<P>However, some of the other economic actions taken
by the Mexican government have encouraged the nation's expansion. Those actions
include the December 1995 devaluation of the peso
and the promotion of political and free-market economic reforms.</P>
<P>In 1995, according to statistics reported by
Banco Nacional de M&eacute;xico (Banamex), Mexico's gross domestic product
(GDP) declined 6.2% from 1994 and the
annual inflation rate in 1995 was 52%.
That compared with a GDP growth of
4.5% in 1994 and an annual inflation rate of 7%.</P>
<P>For the first half of 1996, GDP grew
3%, compared with a 5.5% decline in the
same period in 1995. In August, the inflation rate stood at 30.6%, compared
with 41.6% in August 1995.</P>
<P>Overall export growth, a desired result
of the peso devaluation, continued into
1996. Through August of this year, Mexico's overall exports totaled $61.3
billion, up 19% from the same period in 1995. In
all of 1995, Mexico's exports topped
$79.5 billion, up 31% from 1994.</P>
<p>But Mexico's economic turnaround is
best portrayed by the return of import
growth in 1996. Through August, Mexico's overall imports were $56.5 billion,
a 20% rise from the same period in 1995.
For full-year 1995, imports declined 8.7%
from 1994 to $72.5 billion.</P>
<P>Banamex estimates that exports will
total $94.5 billion in 1996 and $108 billion in 1997. Imports, it says, will
reach $87.7 billion this year and $103 billion in 1997.</p>
<P>Banamex pegs Mexico's return to economic growth
to the recovery of the
country's manufacturing sector. "The rate
of growth of the manufacturing industry is
expected to surpass that of GDP, owing
both to the continuing impulse given by
exports and the consolidation of certain
domestically oriented sectors, particularly
those producing basic goods," according
to the statistics report.</P>
<center><img src="mextrade.gif"></center>
<P>Consolidation refers to industries or
companies that sustain strong export
levels and that increase total and domestically oriented output. This requires
capacity expansion and the penetration of new markets through product
diversification.</p>
<P>Mexico's chemical industry is participating in
the economy's recovery. According to statistics reported by the
Asociaci&oacute;n Nacional de la Industria Qu&acute;&inodot;mica (ANIQ),
Mexico's chemical industry association, in
1995 the industry's total exports grew
50% from 1994 to $3.71 billion. Chemical
imports declined 1.4% to $4.72 billion.
For the first six months of 1996, chemical exports reached $1.79 billion and
imports were $2.69 billion. ANIQ's statistics do not include pharmaceuticals.
</p>
<P>The U.S. remains Mexico's largest
chemical trade partner. More than 65% of
Mexico's chemical imports come from the
U.S., and more than 50% of its chemical
exports go to the U.S. The next largest
trading bloc for Mexico's chemical imports - at more than 16% - is the
European Union. And in terms of chemical exports, its next largest export
partner - at more than 18% - is South America.</P>
<img src="mexchem1.gif" align=left hspace=6>
<P>Reflecting the state of Mexico's economy in 1995,
U.S. exports of chemicals to
Mexico - including pharmaceutical products - declined almost 2% from
1994 to $4.27 billion. U.S. imports of chemicals
from Mexico, however, rose a whopping
27% to nearly $1.3 billion. U.S. exports
of chemicals to Mexico could reach
$5.15 billion in 1996, rebounding about
20% from the 1995 level. And Mexico's
exports of chemicals to the U.S. could
rise about 16% to reach $1.5 billion.</P>
<P>Based on data through July, U.S. exports to Mexico
are being led by inorganic chemicals, dyeing and coloring materials, medicinal
and pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, plastics, and other
miscellaneous chemical products, all
growing at double-digit rates over the
same period in 1995. Leading Mexico's
exports to the U.S. are inorganic chemicals, dyeing and coloring materials,
medicinal and pharmaceutical products,
essential oils, plastics, and other miscellaneous chemical products - again
growing at double-digit rates over the same period in 1995.</P>
<P>But the turmoil surrounding the attempts to privatize
Mexico's petrochemical industry has no doubt hurt the trade
of one product segment, organic chemicals. Through July, U.S. organic chemical
exports to Mexico were only 3.6% greater than in the 1995 period, and Mexico's
exports of organics to the U.S. grew less
than 0.5%.</P>
<P>Prospects for the chemical industry
look brighter as the Mexican economy
grows stronger, however. And the implementation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement has played a part in
both the recovery of the Mexican economy and growth of the Mexican chemical
industry.</P>
<P>"NAFTA will make Mexico and the
U.S. very, very strong trading partners as
we continue to build into the near future," says Thomas A. Smith, president of
Eastman Chemical's Latin American operations, based in Mexico City. The
continuing growth in trade promoted by
NAFTA, he explains, has softened the
peso devaluation's effect on imports and
Mexico's domestic market.</P>
<P>"When the peso was devalued, the
companies that did manufacture in Mexico had much more of a capability to export
[on a] lower cost-of-goods basis. The
domestic market contracted to the point
that people were forced to look to the export markets. And those that could
export - those with goods of [superior] quality - did pretty well."</p>
<P>Chemical trade between Mexico and
its other NAFTA partner, Canada, remains
small compared with trade between Mexico and the U.S., but it has grown
substantially on a percentage basis since the trade pact's passage.</P>
<P>Using statistics from ANIQ, Mexico's
chemical exports to Canada totaled
$32.3 million in 1995, up 151% from
1994, again a reflection of the drop in value of the peso. Canada's chemical
exports to Mexico totaled $57.3 million in 1995, up just 2% from 1994.</P>
<P>But in the first six months of 1996
alone, Canada's chemical exports to Mexico were $42.3 million, no doubt helped
by the recovery of Mexico's domestic economic situation. Mexico's chemical
exports to Canada were $15.4 million in the first six months of 1996.</P>
<P>Chemical industry consultant Kline &amp;
Co. of Fairfield, N.J., in a report on Mexico's chemical industry, says it "will
sustain outstanding growth during the next
10 years," now that the Mexican economy is back on track. Kline sees a
"continuing pattern that began with the decade of the 1980s, [when]
the nation's
chemical industry recorded an annual average growth rate in excess of 9%, while
its national GDP grew at only 1% during
the same period.</p>

Slowing Economies Mean Less<br>
Growth For Chemicals</center></h1>

<P>Petrochemical producers from Japan, North America,
and other areas have traditionally been able to
count on the countries of East and South
Asia to absorb their surplus production in
times of slack demand at home. Very
soon, however, as numerous new facilities
come on-line in this region, creating a supply near at hand, it will become
increasingly difficult to sell to Asia.</P>
<P>Demand still outpaces chemical production capacities
in the region - a situation that will continue to exist for many
products. However, demand from overseas suppliers for major petrochemicals
will tend to stabilize or diminish considerably, said petrochemical consulting
firm Chem Systems at its annual Asian
conference in Singapore in November.
An extreme example of this trend is the
key polyester intermediate purified terephthalic acid (PTA), for which East
Asia, particularly South Korea, could become an
exporter as early as 2000. Moreover, the
most important country that will carry
over a deficit in petrochemical production
is China, a notoriously unpredictable buyer. As a result, chemical exporters
from the U.S. and other countries will gradually
turn their attention to other parts of the world.</p>
<P>With the exception of Japan, in 1996
the economies of Asia have grown more
slowly than in previous years. China,
which seems to have been reasonably
successful in slowing down its overheating economy, has seen its gross domestic
product (GDP) grow about 8% this year,
down from nearly 10% last year.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Singapore repeatedly has
been revising downward its growth forecasts to a current 7% for 1996, which
will be off from last year's 8.3% economic growth. Recent unofficial estimates
put Thailand's GDP growth at 7% in
1996, down from 8.6% last year; the
country's newly elected government has
pledged to make the economy its top
priority.</P>
<P>South Korea is getting worried because its economic
growth has slowed to
7.6%, which falls short of the 10% that it
had grown accustomed to in years prior
to 1995. In Taiwan, the growth in manufacturing appears to have leveled off
in the past two years, and GDP growth this
year will be a disappointing 5.7%. Many
in Asia are questioning the sustainability
of the fast growth rates of the past, and
there is talk of structural problems in
many of the economies.</P>
<P>But Asia is nonetheless expected to
remain the world's fastest growing region. Chem Systems, for instance, estimates
GDP growth to remain strong at
7.9% yearly in East Asia (minus Japan)
over the period 1995 to 2000, compared
with 2.4% for the U.S., 2.0% for Western
Europe, and 3.2% for Latin America. Consequently, most growth in supply and
demand of petrochemicals will originate
from Asia, excluding Japan. GDP growth
and the demand for petrochemicals are
closely related.</P>
<center><img src="asiaeast.gif"></center>
<P>Operating under a different set of dynamics than
its neighbors, Japan has
emerged from a long recession, with its
economy growing 3 to 4% this year. Several factors, including a weaker yen,
are breathing life into the country's industries. The manufacturing index is up, continuing a trend started last year. And car
production is taking a break from the
downward trend of the past few years:
Based on partial figures through October, about 7.7 million units will likely
be produced in Japan this year, slightly
more than last year. Consumer confidence is perking up, with housing starts
much higher than in 1995.</P>
<P>In contrast, Japan's chemical industry continues
to essentially stagnate. For
the first half of the year, the country's
12 leading chemical firms disclosed financial results that were little changed
from the previous year's first half, although results varied considerably among
producers.</P> <P>Mitsubishi Chemical has blamed rising
naphtha prices - essentially the result of
the weakening yen - for a disappointing
first half. Sumitomo Chemical, which sells
a lot of construction material, reported
that its profit in the first half was up sharply, although its return on sales
remains below 2%. Drug company Takeda Chemical, however, continued to improve
its performance, and its return on sales in
the first half approached 8%, which is
more than double any other firm among
the top 12. For the past few years, Japan's drug firms have indeed been doing
very well. But their performance is expected to decline as the government
reduces its health insurance coverage of
drug purchases by patients.</P>
<P>On the whole, Japan's results are
weaker than one would hope, given that
the industry has been on a restructuring
path for several years. It is particularly
worrisome that Mitsubishi Chemical has
downgraded its profit forecast for the
whole fiscal year by 87%. Mitsubishi
Chemical is one of the leading companies in cost-cutting and restructuring endea
vors.
More than half of its earnings
last year were from strong petrochemical
sales, something that won't occur again
for several years, given the environment
in Asia in 1997 and beyond.</P>
<P>The Asian market for petrochemicals
performed a few stunts in 1996. Polyolefin prices surged when China, which
buys 25 to 30% of polyolefins traded globally, renewed its buying, which it had
restricted in 1995. But prices soon came
back down, where they appear to be
comfortably settling. Meanwhile, says
Chem Systems consultant Danley B.
Wolfe, the start-up of additional <I>p</I>-xylene
production capacity, coupled with an
easing in demand growth for polyester,
has caused prices of the fiber intermediate to nosedive from $2,000 per ton a
year ago to about $400 now.</P>
<P>Indeed, 1996 is the first year of a cycle in
which the Asian market for petrochemicals is settling into a lengthy slack.
Prices of polyolefins will remain "lousy
until the end of the century," Chem Systems consultant Sam N. Angove predicts.
Slower economic growth in Asia, coupled with the rapid addition of new capacity
next year and until 2000, means
that the profit picture is unpromising. In
coming years, unscheduled plant outages
have become the best hope for those
who long for higher prices.</P>
<P>Major additions to polyolefins capacity in coming
years will be made in the
Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan,
and China. For polyethylene, overall, the
planned expansions worldwide between
1996 and 1999 represent 24% of global
capacity in 1995. About one-third of this
will be built in Asia (excluding China).
For polypropylene, the planned expansions represent 37% of 1995 existing
capacity, with more than one-third of it being built in Asia, Angove says.</P>
<center><img src="japcar.gif"></center>
<P>The profit outlook in the polyester
chain appears less promising than it isfor polyolefins, also because of capacity
expansions. By 1998, Wolfe believes, operating rates for PTA production
facilities will reach a low of 68%. It's a similar situation with
<I>p</I>-xylene, a product whose
market is closely related to demand for
PTA. By 2000, global capacity will reach
about 22 million metric tons, about double 1995 capacity.</P>
<P>With their large excess capacity and
their aggressive approach to exports,
South Koreans have become the price
setters in Asian petrochemicals. The
country will export about half of its annual polypropylene production of 2.2
million metric tons between 1997 and 1999.
It's the same situation for polyethylene,
for which Korea will export about 40%
of its annual output of 3 million metric
tons. Moreover, an enduring surplus of
ethylene over the absorption capability
of the country's derivative plants means
that South Korea will continue to export
unprocessed ethylene in coming years,
although shipments are likely to decrease, Chem Systems Vice President
Steve N. Rothman says.</P>
<P>Among the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, demand for imports will
essentially evaporate in the next three
years as a result of their increased domestic supply. Thus, the effect that
South 
Korea's ability to export will have on international prices will be determined
mostly by China's appetite for imports.
This combination of strong regional supply conditions and unreliable Chinese
demand means that those producing from
other continents will be increasingly
wary of Asia, Angove says. He believes
U.S. producers will look more and more
to Latin America for trade and investment opportunities.</P>
<center><img src="asiasales.gif"></center><br><br>
<img src="asialit.gif" align=left hspace=6><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<P>Other than capacity expansions, supply in Asia
will soon be affected by new
and still-experimental technologies for
producing polyolefins that are on the
verge of widespread implementation. For
instance, Mitsui Petrochemical Industries
and Sumitomo Chemical recently announced their intention to start up inspring 1998 a linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) plant based on metallocene
catalyst technology developed
by Mitsui. In addition to metallocene
catalysts, new second-generation technologies include the use of octene in
gas-phase reactors for the production of
bimodal and broad molecular weight
distribution LLDPE and in situ generation of comonomers.
Between now and
2000, Angove believes, most growth in
capacity for low-density polyethylene
will be based on one or the other of the
second-generation technologies becoming available.</P>
<P>In all this, Japan finds itself in a precarious
situation. For the past few years, its
chemical industry had been able to make
up for weak domestic demand by exporting to nearby Asian countries, where demand
was strong. However, having the
highest costs not only in Asia but also in
the world means Japanese chemical firms
are finding it more and more difficult to
compete against the expanding chemical
industries of Asia, especially for commodity chemicals.</P>
<P>Over time, Chem Systems consultants expect Japan's
petrochemical industry to stagnate. Older facilities will
be shut down and few new ones will
take their place. For example, Japan's
benzene production will shrink at an
annual rate of 1.9% until 2000, says
Wolfe, in sharp contrast with annual
growth of 15.4% in the rest of Asia. As
for styrene, he expects Japan's capacity
to decrease by 400,000 metric tons by 2000.</p>
<P>Overall, expansions in new polyolefin
capacity in Japan will increase by 1.5 million metric tons over the next 10
years, compared with 20 million metric tons in
the rest of Asia. Japan's chemical firms
will continue to invest, but the proportion of overseas investment will increase
sharply. Dogged by high costs and a
shrinking domestic market, overseas investment is becoming increasingly critical
for the Japanese firms.</P>
<center><img src="asiasouth.gif"></center> 
<P>Although the profitability of petrochemicals
in Asia appears bleak for the
next few years, the outlook continues to
be promising for specialty and performance chemicals. "In this region,
demand is explosive," says Damon C. Warmack,
Eastman Chemical's general manager for
Hong Kong and China. "I know it may not
make much sense, but for some products,
GDP growth of 10% might translate into
demand growth of 30%."<br clear="all"></P><br>
<P>"There are examples of consumer
goods manufacturers from foreign countries that build plants in this region
only
to find out, once the facilities come on-line, that they need to import even
more into the region of the very products that the new facilities produce,"
Warmack says. "We are in a market
where new demand is being created
versus substituted from a very low position on the economic ladder. Small gains
in average disposable income can drive
market growth much faster than general average economic data would suggest based
on analysis in a developed
economy."</p>
<center><img src="korea.gif"></center>
<P>Other than growing demand resulting
many plants operating in Asia do not produce the higher quality that local
consumers are increasingly demanding.
Compared with some of the commodity
items that Eastman produces, Warmack
prefers performance chemicals that he
can sell at a higher price, with sales that
grow at a steadier rate, and for which the
competition is not so fierce.</P>
<P>Cycles are inherent to the chemical
industry, and Warmack does not completely trust predictions. Generally, he
finds that people become overly pessimistic in the low phase of the cycle, and
overly optimistic during the peaks. "It's
as if someone were lying in the sun in a
puddle of water. Looking at the sun, the
person feels great, suntanning and all, it's
paradise. But turning around on his stomach, suddenly, it's panic. He forgets
he is
just face down in a puddle and thinks he's drowning."</P>
<center><img src="asiatai.gif"></center>
<P>It's a point of view some consultants
find affinity with. Even after painting a depressing view of the overcapacity
picture in the polyester chain, Chem Systems'
Wolfe still sounds upbeat. "Low prices
will pass through and stimulate polyester
fiber and [polyethylene terephthalate] resin consumption," he
says. Demand forecasts for polyester consumption in Asia are
already robust, and drops in prices might
yield to even stronger consumption than expected.</P>
<P>Indeed, what should one make of predictions concerning
the chemical industry in Asia? And what do consultants
think of the predictions they themselves
make? On this score, Chem Systems is
refreshingly candid. Noting that many
events can occur after a prediction is
made, the company president, Marshall
E. Frank, jokingly announces: "In the 31
years we've been in this business, our
forecasts have ranged between 100% accurate to 100% inaccurate."</P>
<P>Bangkok-based Wolfe, who specializes in the polyester
chain, further relates:"
There is an amazing diversity in Asia. A
few months ago, I was on a flight from
Bangkok to Singapore. On my right side
was one of the [video jockeys] from the
TV music channel MTV (Asia). She was
all done up, excited, cosmopolitan, you
get the picture. On my left was a missionary from Belgium writing a thesis on
the peasant cultures of Hubei, basically
China's least developed province. He had
lived one year among them." Given the
diversity of lifestyles that these two individuals represented, Wolfe wonders
at times how reliable his Asian market predictions possibly can be.</P>
<P>Which is certainly not to say that the
forecasters are consistently wrong. Indeed, many people are willing to pay top
dollar to learn what some of them have to
say. What they have to offer is more
or less the best guess one can obtain
based on the information currently
available. Their bottom line? Polyolefins have entered a period of
oversupply, and demand won't
catch up for about five years. In the
case of <I>p</I>-xylene, PTA, and polyester, the oversupply is more serious
and the next surge won't occur before 2003. And for fine chemicals, a
sector that is not studied by Chem
Systems, the Asian outlook remains
excellent.

Canada's Chemical Production<br>
Set To Build From 1996 Plateaus</center></h1>
<h3><font color="00008B">Elisabeth M. Kirschner</font><br>
<i>C&EN Northeast News Bureau</i></h3>
<hr noshade>
<P>After the heady gains of 1995, Canada's chemical
industry held its
ground in 1996. Production, prices, and shipments hovered near the lofty
levels of 1995 for much of the year but
are expected to strengthen in 1997.</P>
<P>"Shipments are maintaining the record
performance of 1995" for chemicals and
chemical products, says David J. Shearing,
project manager for business development
at the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association (CCPA). Shipments dipped from
the 1995 peak of $21.3 billion to an expected $20.8 billion for 1996. Organic
chemical shipments slipped to $4.1 billion
from $4.5 billion in 1995, and shipments
of inorganic chemicals edged down to
$2.1 billion from $2.3 billion.</P>
<P>"Prospects for next year are for increased
production volumes," Shearing
explains. "Sales could be up or down,
depending on prices. Capital expenditures are up in 1996 and are expected to
rise further in 1997."</P>
<P>Canada's chemicals business tends to
move in concert with the U.S. industry.
Despite a sluggishness in the
economy, U.S. demand is expected to
keep the chemicals sector humming."
There seems to be optimism about 1997.
Because of exports to the U.S., things are
looking positive," Shearing says. "We're
pretty near the peak of the cycle, and
we're optimistic that this could be holding pat."</P>
<P>"We expect continued modest growth,"
says a spokesman for Calgary, Alberta-based
Nova Chemicals, a subsidiary of Nova Corp."
We see continued strong numbers particularly for polyethylene and methanol.
But the current weakness in the styrene
and polystyrene marketplace is not expected to change significantly."</P>
<P>Prices plateaued in late 1995 through
much of 1996. After the highs of early
1995, prices lingered around 130% of
1986 values for chemicals and chemical
products and for overall manufacturing.
Although the subcategory of inorganic
chemicals held at that price level, organic
chemicals - at an estimated price index of
146 - fell from the 1995 level of 158.</P>
<P>Although prices have fluctuated, total
volumes have edged up. And "indications are that some prices firmed up
in the third quarter," says Shearing. "Operating profits were essentially
at a peak in 1995 and down in 1996. Whether those
numbers are confirmed when we get the
final results remains to be seen. As of
September, we were expecting a drop of 2% in sales."</P>
<P>For the Canadian chemical industry,"
exports have risen as a percentage of
our output to be a much more important
part" of the economy, says Shearing. Exports accounted for 44% of shipments
in 1996 compared with 36% of shipments
two years earlier. Exports were up 3% in
1996 over 1995, with imports up 7%.</P>
<P>These results "continue the trend in
specialization on both sides of the border," explains David Podruzny,
CCPA's senior project manager for business development. "We have more exports
and more imports on both sides of the border. That reflects specialized
production, with product shipped from one site,
rather than having a range of products at
many sites."</p>
<center><img src="caimport.gif"></center>
<P>Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (PCS),
based in Saskatoon, which has been on an
expansion rampage, posted third-quarter
1996 net income of $46.8 million, up
103% from 1995. Third-quarter sales totaled $342.1 million, up 59% from 1995.
The growth benefited from the White
Springs Agricultural Chemicals phosphate
operation in Florida, purchased from Occidental Chemical in the fourth quarter
of 1995. PCS is awaiting the completion of
two more acquisitions, U.S. nitrogen fertilizer producer Arcadian Corp. and
a majority share of German potash holding company Kali &amp; Salz.</P>
<P>PCS's potash sales volume for the first
nine months of 1996 declined 6%, with
prices flat. Potash exports were down
21%, but those prices rose 8% year-to-year for January through September. PCS
anticipates increased prices in the non-North American diammonium phosphate
market, firm pricing in liquid phosphates,
and improved potash shipments.</P>
<P>Nova Chemicals had net income plummet in the
fourth quarter of 1995. Although business has improved every quarter since then,
net income for the first
nine months of 1996 totaled only $107 million compared with $310 million for
the same period in 1995. However, Nova started the fourth quarter with
a new acquisition - the plastics business of Arco Chemical, purchased for $163 million.</P>
<P>Nova blames lower styrene prices and
higher crude-oil feedstock costs for the declines in income. "This was
partially offset
in 1996 by higher sales volumes," according to the company. But styrene
nd polystyrene prices are expected to remain flat
because of capacity coming on-line in early 1997 and soft demand in Asia.</P>
<P>Polyethylene prices strengthened and
volumes rose in the third quarter from
the second quarter. Nova says polyethylene prices "appear to have reached a
plateau. Prices may decline moderately,
but strong market demand should provide stability into 1997."</P>
<center><img src="cachem.gif"></center>
<P>In August, CCPA updated its 1994
study of the competitiveness of Canada's
business climate for the chemical industry. The report is used in government
advocacy, says Shearing, to show the industry's competitiveness in North America
and urge legislators and regulators to foster growth.</P>
<center><img src="caoutput.gif"></center>
<P>The provinces of Ontario, Quebec,
and Alberta - home to much of the Canadian chemical industry - are particularly
competitive with U.S. production. "We
are competitive overall in our corporate
income taxes, payroll, and property taxes. Looking at salaries and payroll
taxes, we have an advantage over the U.S.," explains Shearing. "Benefits
cost less in Canada."</p>
<P>Historically, he says, "we have had
uncompetitive construction costs versus
the Gulf Coast." Now, he adds, the cost
of "building a plant in Alberta is just a
few percent higher than on the U.S. Gulf
Coast. If you were to build that [plant] in
Ontario or Sarnia, it might be 8% higher
than on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The higher
cost is primarily due to higher [labor]
costs. We're working with the government to get the construction costs on a
level playing field."</P>
<P>The Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp;
Development (OECD) found that
Canada's recent "growth pause" comes
from the concomitant effects of moderate
demand from the U.S. in a slowed economy, weakened domestic demand, and fiscal
consolidation. "At the same time, however, the recent period has seen
a considerable improvement in Canada's economic
fundamentals," a recent OECD report says."
Over the next 18 months, real gross domestic product should again grow by more
than [production] capacity, which is estimated to be expanding at
an annual rate of around 2.5%."</p>
<P>Shearing says CCPA's efforts now are in"
trying to ensure we maintain our competitive advantages, such as feedstocks
and transportation, and work on any areas
where there is a disadvantage."

<p>
Many years ago, when in grade school,
I read about the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World in my history book
(<I>Modern Times and the Living Past</i>, by Henry W.
Elson). They still fascinate me. To refresh your memory, according to
<I>The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia</i>:
</p>
<p> 
<blockquote>
The Seven Wonders of the World comprise the greatest feats of ancient
technology, architecture, and art as seen by Greek and Roman authors. The list
has changed onlyh slightly since it first appeared (c. 130 BC) in a poem by
Antipater of Sidon in the Greek Anthology. He praises the Pyramids of Egypt,
the Walls and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Artemis at  
Ephesus, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and the
Colossus of Rhodes.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p> 
This list was later amended; the Walls and Hanging Gardens
were consolidated into one Wonder, and the Pharos (lighthouse) of
Alexandria was added as the seventh. And so it has been handed down to
us over more than twenty-one centuries. Thus, list-making is not a new
habit and indeed has been contagious through the ages. In fact, it's
fun and, I submit, educational, as well as inspirational. 
</p>
<p>
<P>But why "seven?" Possibly because seven is a neat way to separate
the wheat from the chaff. Or maybe it was intended to be one wonder for
each day of the week. Anyway, the urge to list seven wonders of
<I>something</i> has continued over the years. And so
we now have the<I> Seven Wonders of the Middle
Ages (1)</i>, as well as the
<I>Seven Natural Wonders of the World
(2)</i>. It's a nice custom carried over the
centuries, one that raises respect for what our ancestors accomplished
with far fewer resources than we and at the same time lays down a
challenge for us. <I>The Seven Natural Wonders</i>, in
turn, put our man-made wonders in perspective. 
</p>
<p>
<P>There is no "official" list yet of the <I>Seven
Wonders of the Modern World</i> that I know of. But candidates
abound: canals (Panama, Suez) . . . bridges (Golden Gate, Verrazano,
Humber) . . . dams (Oroville, Hoover, Rogun) . . . tunnels (Seikan,
Channel) . . . buildings (World Trade Center, Empire State) . . .
trans-Atlantic liners (especially <I>Normandie,
Queen Mary, Queen
Elizabeth, United States</i>) . . . the
electric light . . . the automobile . . . aircraft . . . spacecraft and
space probes . . . radio/TV . . . information systems (printing press,
typewriter, telegraph, telephone, computer, Internet) . . . . Note the
transition in this list from civil and mechanical engineering works to
what, for a better term, I call "electronic works." Draw your own
conclusions. 
</p>
<p>
But which seven of these would <I>you</i> pick? Which
seven would still impress our successors 2,000 years from now, even as
the Pyramids still entrance us, even though (and maybe because) we
haven't quite figured out how they built them? Maybe we should start
thinking in terms of seven times seven? 
</P>


<P>Well, we're not asking you to make <I>that</i> pick.
What we are asking you is to propose none other than the
<i>Seven Wonders of the Chemical World</i>. For chemists and chemical
engineers like you, that should be an easy assignment, right? Well,
play our game and find out.
</p>
<p>
So what should they be? There are so many "invisible" wonders to
choose from, wonders that lie behind all those others, including even
the natural wonders. Surely we would all agree that the periodic table
should be on any such list, just as the Pyramids of Egypt made that
ancient list. Wouldn't we? In fact, it would top mine. But then what?
What are the other six? 
</p>

<P>What all the various wonders have in common is that they all inspire
awe in terms of their size, ingenuity, and/or beauty, or, in the case
of the natural wonders, their overwhelming beauty. They invite
superlatives. They make you proud to belong to the human race and make
you want to excel, even as they make you humble. 
</P>


<P>The<I> Seven Wonders of the Chemical World</i> are at
a disadvantage in one sense. Ordinary folks can't see them, at least
at their working level, certainly not with a chemist's eye. But if
those folks could transport themselves into the molecular and atomic
world, as subatomic Lilliputians, they would see a similar set of
awe-inspiring sights. This is at once the chemist's good fortune,
frustration, and challenge - to get others to see their (your) world as
they see it. 
</P>


<P>In any event, the<I> Seven Wonders of the Chemical
World</i>, in a very basic sense, as I have indicated, underlie
all of those other wonders. And unlike some of the other wonders, they
are not eroding with time. They are in place for
<I>all</i> time. 
</P>


<P>The candidates are many and listing them is relatively easy.
Here's a starter list (in no special order): the periodic table . . .
the atomic model . . . photography . . . synthetic polymers, as in
plastics, hybrids, fibers, and materials . . . pharmaceuticals . . .
nuclear (atomic) power . . . the scanning tunneling microscope . . .
exploration of the nanoworld . . . deciphering of the genetic code and
all that has followed, including gene therapy . . . the green
revolution in agriculture . . . transistor/semiconductors . . .
the laser . . . catalysis . . . . 
</P>


<P>Winnowing any such list down to just seven is a formidable task. And
that's where <I>you</i> come in. With this article,
we are asking for entries to a sort of contest to forge an
"official" list of the<I> Seven Wonders of the
Chemical World</i>. 
</P>


<P>

information:</font></h4>
<ol>
<li>Your list, together with short statements justifying each of
your candidates (e.g., "I think such and such is one of the seven

<li>A short summary statement tying it all together in some fashion. 
<li>Your name, address, title and area of expertise, phone/fax number

Mediocre Year Lays Ground <br>
For Hope In 1997</center></h1>
<h3><font color="red">Patricia L. Layman</font><br>

<hr noshade>
<p>
Last year, there was a sense of surprise
in the European chemical industry
when a slowdown rippled through it.
In 1996, the surprise has been replaced by
disappointment as the hoped-for resumption in growth failed to materialize.</P>
<P>Now, the chemical industry is testing
its forecasters. They are being asked if
the industry's upturn in the latter part of
the third quarter and into the fourth will
continue into a rosier 1997. They are being asked if the strong exports during
1996 will continue to underpin chemical
growth. And they are being asked if the
industry can capitalize on the improving
general economic conditions in the region to support solid growth into the
coming year.</P>
<P>The cautious answer to those questions is a qualified
"yes." As Richard D.
Freeman, corporate chief economist
with the U.K.'s ICI, puts it, "We are looking for a better year next year.
This year
was not a 'bad' year, it was just marked
by slow growth."</P>
<P>Presenting the most recent conclusions of the
European Chemical Industry
Council's (CEFIC) Economic Outlook
Working Party, Freeman says 1997 is
likely to be "a relatively strong year for
chemical production."</P>
<P>Among the factors supporting that assessment
are exports and inventories. "Export demand from outside Europe appears
to be on the increase, and it is expected to
boost production next year," he notes."
Demand in Eastern Europe is reported by
panel members to be buoyant, and exports to Asia are strong."</P>
<P>Meanwhile, after several years of
chemical buyers running down inventories, "stock changes are forecast
to be positive for growth in 1997. Stock levels
are estimated by the panel to be low in
most countries. This is the case both upstream and downstream in the industry,"
says Freeman.</P>
<P>The upshot is that chemical production in 1997
likely will rise by more than
3% rather than the 2% first predicted by
the panel early in the year. This follows
an estimated increase of less than 2% for
1996.</P>
<P>For Western Europe as a whole, general economic
growth in 1996 "has been
disappointingly slow," Freeman says."
The latest estimate is that [gross domestic product] will rise by
a miserable 1.5%.
That is about half the potential rate of
growth and well below the rate needed
to reverse the rise in unemployment."</P>
<P>Theodore S. Semegran, senior vice
president for New York City-based Dean
Witter Reynolds security analysts, notes
that Europe's general economy "continues
to grow slowly. It appears to be maintaining its 2% plus-or-minus pace of 1996
into 1997," he said in recent comments on the
European chemical industry. As he sees it:"
Key positive engines in Europe are the
U.K., Spain, and, to some extent, the
Benelux region [Belgium, Luxembourg,
and the Netherlands]. Key negatives have
been Germany and France."</P>
<center><img src="euracrylic.gif"></center>
<P>He sees two possible scenarios for
1997 in the European economy. One, his"
worse than" current economic scenario,
would reflect attempts by France, Italy,
and others to reduce their government
spending, to enable them to enter the European Monetary Union (EMU) by the
prescribed date - Jan. 1, 1999. Among the
effects of such policy would be government personnel reductions, combined
with the continued personnel cutbacks in
large European companies throughout industry, and still-slow wage growth. These
would all hurt overall European consumer spending.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Semegran says, a"
better than" current economic scenario
might occur with further weakening of
Europe's currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar. For example, "a weakening of 10 to
15% in the German mark to 1.70 to 1.80
per U.S. dollar would almost certainly result in increased exports of chemicals
from Europe," because most chemicals in
the region are priced in German marks.</P>
<P>Tight economic policies have, of course,
been a fact of life for a number of years,
Freeman points out. In fact, he believes they
have been mainly responsible for "a marked
slowdown in the growth of Western Europe since the end of the 1980s."</P>
<P>"Indeed," he says, "Western
European real GDP has risen over the past six years
at an annual average rate of only 1.6%. If
allowance is made for the effects of German unification, the growth rate has
averaged only about 1.3% per year since
1990." This compares with an average annual growth rate of 2.3% in the
period 1979 to 1989, he says.</P>
<P>Recent general economic growth has
been so slow, he says, because fiscal policies in most countries have been
restrictive in an attempt to try to get close to
the Maastricht budget deficit criteria of
3% of GDP in 1997 - a forerunner of policy needed for the EMU entry mentioned
by Semegran.</P>
<P>Moreover, monetary policy - given the
restrictiveness of fiscal policy - has been
too tight in most European countries, Freeman
suggests. And, noting the impact of
inventory changes over the past several
years, he adds, "activity in our economies
has been depressed by the rundown of
the high levels of involuntary stocks which
built up in 1994 and early 1995."</P>
<center><img src="eurchem.gif"></center>
<P>However, he says - with the exception
of Italy - all the main countries are expecting a considerable improvement
in GDP
growth in 1997. As in 1996, these countries are projecting an improvement in
their budget positions next year. However, the CEFIC working party opted for a
cautious consideration for the economy
next year; hence its forecast of 2% growth,
compared with a consensus forecast of
2.3% by various official bodies.</P>
<P>As for industrial production, the CEFIC
group forecasts a stronger pickup than for
real GDP, Freeman says - but certainly,
there is room for growth. Following two
years of strong growth in 1994 and 1995,
all industrial production in Western Europe
is expected to rise only 0.6% this year, according to estimates by the CEFIC
panel. Industrial production was very weak from the
second quarter of 1995 to the second quarter of 1996, primarily because of the
influence of overbuilt inventories.</P>
<P>However, says Freeman, with stocks at
low levels and demand strengthening,
growth has resumed in the third quarter,
and this is expected to continue. The panel
expects industrial output to rise 2.5%.</P>
<P>A similar pattern is emerging for the
chemicals sector of Western European industry, according to Freeman, although
a major difficulty has developed that hinders
forecasting. "The quality of chemical industry statistics is not nearly
as good as those
for the whole economy," he says. "Over the
past 12 months, we have had numerous
large revisions to chemical production data.
The major problem has been in Germany - a significant part of the West European
industry. It is difficult even to get a firm fix
on what has been happening in the industry
this year, let alone get a good basis for forecasting next year's output."</P>
<center><img src="eurmajor.gif"></center>
<P>According to Freeman, the industry in
the region has seen "some important revisions to the data, and there also
has been
some new data. The first effect of the revisions and new data is to reduce the
estimated increase in chemical production
this year. The second is to increase the
growth rate forecast for next year."</P>
<P>The latest data analysis shows that chemical
production tumbled by more than 3%
in the second half of 1995 and recovered
by only about 1% in first-half 1996. Only
strong growth of roughly 5.5% in the second half of 1996 has kept the year from
looking bleak.</P>
<P>One indication of the pickup from lackluster
1995 was the tangential - but significant - increase in consumption
of platinum catalysts in the chemical industry in Europe
this year. Use in 1996 by the industry, particularly for nitric acid production,
 was expected to hit 65,000 troy ounces, up nearly
20% from 1995. That is a larger increase
than estimated for any other world region,
according to the annual interim review
compiled by British precious-metals company Johnson Matthey. The review
indicated that continued, steady growth in catalyst
consumption in the European chemical industry is expected over at least the
next two years.</P>
<P>Chemical industry growth will settle
down somewhat, to a level that is expected to sustain the 3% that the CEFIC
working party forecasts for chemical production for 1997. And if anything, 
Freeman says, "the balance of risks is for
stronger growth of
chemical production
in 1997 than has been
forecast."</P>
<P>CEFIC's observations about the turnaround in
the second half of this past year
are supported by comments from securities
analysts in Western
Europe. For example,
according to the London-based chemicals
analysts at Salomon
Brothers, "companies
are reporting a pickup in demand, with
quarterly volumes above previous-year
levels for the first time in many months."
In their latest report, "Periodic Tables,"
analysts Peter D. Blair and Leslie Chow
say, "This pickup is mirrored in the underlying economic indicators, which
since the first quarter in continental Europe and which have remained strong
in the U.K." Economists at Salomon Brothers now predict slightly above-trend
growth in Europe in 1997, with stable
inflation, they add.</P>
<center><img src="eurdol.gif"></center>
<center><img src="eurecon.gif"></center>
<center><img src="eurmatch.gif"></center>
<P>However, Blair and Chow caution that
although demand recovery in Europe"
should provide a sound basis for earnings
improvement across the board, in the
chemical industry, the supply side of the
equation normally dominates the demand
side. There are risks from increasing capacity in Europe for several products
in 1997, and ethylene should not face the abnormal production problems that
beset the industry in the first half of 1996, taking
out 5% of normal production levels. The
result may well be a polyolefins downturn
during 1997," they say.</P>
<P>That pickup in business has not been
seen universally. For example, when
Royal Dutch/Shell reported its third-quarter results last month, the company
grumbled that its chemicals operations"
show only limited signs of improvement in parts of the business, with trading
conditions remaining difficult. Along
with the industry, change can only come
when there is significant growth in the
industrial economies," the company's
statement says.</P>
<P>Petrochemical producers seem likely
to be among the major winners in 1997,
however, predicts Tony Church, chemicals analyst at London-based Schroders
Securities. According to his recently published comments on the European
chemical industry, "After a confused end to
1996, we expect early 1997 to see a very
sharp upturn in activity and prices, based
on a more confident customer base rebuilding inventories.</P>
<P>"We expect a sharp improvement in
the cyclical chemical businesses in early
1997. There is a better than even chance
that improved economic confidence in
Europe will lead to a disproportionately
positive effect on demand for, and prices
of, heavy chemicals. In total, we believe
that 1997 will see a sharp increase in the
activity levels of the European petrochemical industry, to be followed by a
downturn in the following year."</P>
<P>He added, "This view could be radically
altered by a number of uncertainties: At recent industry conferences, we
judged the mood as one of cautious optimism about 1997, rather than a
flag-waving enthusiasm."</p>
<P>One of the major factors causing the
industry to perk up during 1996 has
been exports, according to Freeman. "Exports of chemicals in the recent
period have been relatively buoyant, given the
weakness of domestic demand," he said."
Growth of imports, on the other hand,
has been fairly weak."</P>
<P>The CEFIC economic panel estimates
that exports rose about 3.5% this year,
and imports were up 2.8%. In 1997,
chemical exports are forecast to increase
4% and imports, 3.5%.</P>
<P>On the basis of the production and
trade forecasts, CEFIC concludes that demand for chemicals in Western Europe in
1997 will increase "at a considerably faster rate than it has done this
year" - a relatively healthy increase of more than 3%.</P>
<P>As the year comes to a close, it is clear
that - as the CEFIC working panel forecast
last year - the rate of growth in capital
spending in the chemical industry in 1996
was less than it was in 1995, which was a
particularly strong year following several
years of tight budget purse strings.</P>
<P>Tracking the chemical industry's capital spending
in Western Europe is complicated by lack of reporting of such figures by
Ireland, Portugal, Greece, and
Switzerland, all countries in the CEFIC
orbit. However, CEFIC's statistics for all
the other Western European countries
over the past decade show that capital
spending grew from about $16.7 billion
in 1986 to a high in 1990 - the height of
the industry's big-spending frenzy - of
approximately $27.2 billion. Subsequently, it has simmered down, decreasing
each year through 1994. In 1995, spending was up smartly from the previous
year to $23.1 billion.</P>
<P>CEFIC's panel estimates, however, that
the increase this year will be 6.7% over
most of the major countries suggests that the
rise in capital spending is likely to be
small - in the range of 2 to 3%. In a sense,
that may reflect lessons learned, suggests
Dean Witter's Semegran.</P>
<P>"Modest chemical and petrochemical
investments by Europeans in Europe are
expected to continue," he says. European producers, he points out, are
concentrating much more on "plant debottlenecking and swapping or buying
assetts of others," than on new plants.</P>
<center><img src="eurwest.gif"></center>
<P>"One of the most obvious new trends
is a rash of major new European projects
by U.S.-headquartered firms - including
Amoco, Exxon, Dow, Union Carbide, and
Eastman," he adds. "U.S. companies seem
to be even more optimistic about their
businesses in Europe than many Europeans. Apparently, Europeans have learned
from past recessions: The many recent
business sales and joint ventures, in lieu of
building new capacity, suggest that many
European companies have learned."</P>
<P>Another lesson the industry has learned
is the cost of overstaffing. Despite the difficulties - legal and cultural - of
cutting back, the industry is continuing what has
been a 15-year trend of trimming employees. CEFIC estimates that employment
in the chemical industry in Western Europe
has fallen nearly 2% this year. Since 1990,
employment in the industry has fallen
nearly 300,000, and it's still on a downward path. Although the CEFIC panel
has not made a precise forecast for 1997, Freeman notes that "the available
country forecasts point to a similar reduction in 1997
as in this year."</P>
<P>The CEFIC panel might not have an
official forecast on employment, but it is
willing to commit itself on the sexier
subject of prices. According to Freeman:"
Reflecting weak demand and excess capacity worldwide, producer prices in
Western Europe are estimated to have
fallen by 1.7% this year. Much of the fall
seems now to be behind us, and prices
have flattened out or are rising a little.</P>
<P>"For 1997, the panel has forecast a
rise in producer prices of 1%,"
he says, adding that the "panel
believes there is a strong probability that price increases will be
better than forecast." In fact,
Freeman adds, among the most
optimistic members of CEFIC's
working party were the German
representatives. "When the Germans begin to talk about rising
prices, you have to sit up and take
notice," he observes.</P>
<P>The disappointments of the
year that is ending have been localized more than in the past.
And continuing the trend that
has developed since the reunification of the country, the major"
sufferer" has been Germany.</P>
<P>For example, at Germany's
Bayer, 1996 will be a good year - no
thanks to its headquarters country. Says
Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chairman,
about 1996: "We have set ourselves the
goal of achieving a new record in 1996.
Although not all our expectations have
been met because the business climate in
Europe - our home market - has remained
cooler than forecast, we are holding fast to
our targets for the year."</P>
<center><img src="eurfix.gif"></center>
<P>Market trends, he says, varied from one
region to another. In Europe, sales grew in
the first nine months by just 2% over the
comparable period of 1995, and "actually
stagnated in local currencies. The chief
cause was weak demand in Germany," although sales volumes were also down in
Spain, Switzerland, Austria, and the Benelux countries.</P>
<P>Schneider may be able to take some
comfort from the experience of his
counterparts at D&uuml;sseldorf-based Henkel,
with its hefty proportion of sales coming
from downstream, consumer products
such as detergents, formulated adhesives, and personal care products.</P>
<P>According to Henkel executives, demand is still
sluggish in Germany, but the
company says it saw signs in the third
quarter of the year that consumer demand
in the country is beginning to pick up.</P>
<P>An increased demand for consumer
products in Germany - as in the rest of
the region - will feed back, eventually,
into increased demand for basic chemicals. And on such a hint, the Western
European chemical industry is founding
its hopes for serious improvements in 1997.

<p>
This past year has been a trying one
for the U.S. chemical industry. Following big earnings gains last year,
major chemical companies have not fared
very well in 1996. This year, earnings are
off from 1995 levels and sales are going
nowhere. Through the first nine months
of this year, earnings from 30 major chemical companies regularly surveyed byC&amp;EN declined 7% from the same period
last year to about $6.0billion on a 1% sales
decline to $66.9billion. Profit margins remained high, however, averaging
9.0%
compared with profitability of 9.6%
through the first three quarters of 1995
(C&amp;EN, Nov. 18, page 12).</P>
<P>The question is: Will next year be any
better? The answer, according to a number of forecasters, is maybe, but only
a little.</p>
<P>This year, the general economy has
been growing, but relatively slowly. Estimates for gross domestic product (GDP)
growth this year hover around 2.5% -
spurred by an apparently anomalous
4.1% growth rate in the second quarter.
Thus, in a highly cyclical industry such as
chemicals, slow growth, if any, could be
expected.</p>
<P>In 1996, production and prices of
chemicals - particularly the big-volume industrial chemicals - have
been down from
levels of a year ago, especially in the latter
part of the year. Shipments of major chemicals have done very little. Raw
material costs have risen. Major end-use markets,
such as housing and automobiles, have
slowed. And lately, the chemical trade surplus, long a big contributor to
chemical company fortunes, has been shrinking.
The result for many chemical producers
has been lackluster sales growth and earnings declines.</P>
<P>In 1996, C&amp;EN estimates that production of
chemicals and allied products increased some 2.5% from last year to an
index of about 128.0 (1987=100). This
compares with almost 3.0% growth in
1995. And for large-volume industrial
chemicals, the production index should
verage about 122.8 in 1996, only a 0.4%
increase. This compares with growth of
2.0% in 1995.</P>
<p>The same picture holds with pricing.
The Labor Department's producer price
index for 1996 averages about 142.1
(1982=100) for chemicals and allied
products, down 0.4% from 1995. And the
index for the more cyclical industrial
chemicals averages about 126.9, a drop of
about 1.5% from last year.</P>
<P>Demand for chemicals, however, has
risen somewhat this year. The industry
shipped some $370 billion worth of
chemicals and allied products during the
year, up 3.2% from last year. But the value of industrial chemicals shipments
dipped somewhat, down almost 1% from
1995 to $185 billion.</P>
<P>This is not surprising because, as the
Chemical Manufacturers Association
points out, the industrial chemicals segment has become a mature industry.
CMA says constant-dollar demand for the
entire chemical industry will grow at a
rate of about 1.2 times GDP growth in
the 1990s. But this includes pharmaceuticals, which the association says will
grow at about 2.7 times GDP growth. Industrial chemicals, however, are averaging
about 0.7 times GDP growth. Thus, a
2.5% rise in GDP translates into less than
1.8% real growth in industrial chemicals.
Over the past four decades, this multiple
of GDP for industrial chemicals has
shrunk from 2.9% in the 1960s, 1.5% in
the 1970s, and 1.0% in the 1980s.</P>
<center><img src="uschem.gif"></center>
<p>Production of petrochemicals this
year has been a mixed picture, with essentially moderate growth to slight
declines, according to data from the National Petroleum Refiners Association.
Production of ethylene, the bellwether
olefin, for instance, through the first nine
months grew 2% over the same period in
1995 to 36.2billion lb. But for propylene, the other major olefin, output
declined 5.9% to 18.5billion lb during the
same period. And on the aromatic side,
production of the highly cyclical benzene fell 3.3% to 1.59 billion gal.</P>
<P>Further downstream, there have been
some mighty gains in plastics production
and demand. The Society of the Plastics
Industry estimates that this year output of
major thermoplastics increased 8.0% from
1995 to 65.7 billion lb, and that shipments grew almost 12% to 69.0 billion
lb. Production of thermosetting resins
grew a more modest 4% to 7.82 billion
lb, and demand also grew 4% to 7.79 billion lb.</P>
<P>Growth in thermoplastics is being
paced by linear low-density polyethylene, with output rising 22% to 6.4 billion
lb and demand growing 27% to almost
7.9 billion lb. Growth rates for other
thermoplastics are much more modest,
but for the most part still respectable.
The next highest in terms of output is
polypropylene, which gained 9.4% to
11.9 billion lb. High-density polyethylene
is the second highest in demand growth,
at 13.8% to 7.88 billion lb.</P>
<P>Fibers, however, continued their
modest ways during the year. According
to data from the Fiber Economics Bureau, shipments of synthetic fibers
through the first eight months of this
year totaled 7.05billion lb, down 0.5%
from the same period in 1995. Within
the group, nylon demand grew 3.1% to
2.11 billion lb, but polyester shipments
fell 3.2% to 2.82billion lb.</P>
<P>One of the big disappointments this
year has been the chemical trade balance. Exports of chemicals totaled about
$62.2 billion, up less than 1% from last
year. At the same time, imports totaled
about $45.0 billion, up more than 11.4%.
Thus, the chemical trade surplus fell
about 19% to about $17.2billion. However, it still will be the largest
surplus of any U.S. industry, according to CMA.</P>
<center><img src="ustrade.gif"></center>
<P>The big problem in foreign trade, as it
was for production, was industrial chemicals - particularly organic chemicals,
exports of which declined about 9% to less
than $15.0 billion. Industry sources say
this decline is largely because of petrochemical capacity coming onstream in
the Asia-Pacific region, thus cutting exports
from the U.S. and other countries to that
area. Exports of other commodities, although in the positive column, had only
moderate growth. Inorganic chemical exports rose only 0.6% to about $4.6 
billion; plastics exports increased about 3% to
$15.6 billion; but fertilizer exports declined about 1.8% to $3.2 billion.</P>
<P>Some specialty chemical categories
posted good growth. Pharmaceutical exports, for instance, finished the year
up 11.5% to $7.3billion. And exports of essential oils, which include
toiletries and cosmetics, grew 10% to a value of about $4.3 billion.</p>
<P>Imports of chemicals this year have been
buoyed by a strengthening dollar against
key currencies, and organic chemicals have
shown the largest dollar growth. Imports
of organics this year grew almost 14% to a
value of some $15.2 billion. This has caused a
$1.8 billion trade deficit
in organic chemicals compared with a surplus of
about the same amount in 1995.</p>
<p>The highest growth in imports was posted by pharmaceuticals,
rising 21% to a value of about $6.7 billion.
This is a category in which strong trade, in
both exports and imports, likely will continue because of the increased foreign
ownership of U.S. drug producers and the
accompanying intracompany trade.</P>
<P>Most other trade categories this year
have boosted imports between 2 and 6%,
with the exception of the "other" sector, for which imports grew
about 20% to $4.7 billion.</p>
<P>For next year, the outlook may be
more of the same. Projections of economic growth in the U.S. are falling below
the 1996 rate. For instance, a survey
of 37 forecasters by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia puts growth of real
GDP at 2.3% next year, compared with
an estimated 2.5% this year.</p>
<center><img src="ustrend.gif"></center><br>
<center><img src="usexp1.gif"></center><br>
<center><img src="usexp2.gif"></center>
<P>In its year-end economic survey, however, CMA
is taking a much harder line,
predicting a 1.8% rise in GDP next year,
followed by 2.3% growth in 1998.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, CMA is almost in agreement with
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank about inflation next year. The
chemical trade group projects 2.9% inflation; the Federal Reserve Bank's
forecasters, 3.0%.</p>
<P>CMA, which surveyed its members
to get a consensus forecast, projects a
5% increase in sales dollars next year,
compared with a 1% rise this year. However, CMA members predict a 10% rise
in net operating income. Interestingly,
for 1996, the consensus forecast was
for a 5.6% increase in net operating income, with producers that have sales
of more than $1 billion projecting only a
0.1% increase. Forecasters from companies with less than $1 billion in
sales, which tend to be more niche producers
or specialty chemical makers, see net
operating income rising a median of
10% this year.</P>
<P>The respondents to the CMA survey
see higher operating costs next year with
feedstock unit costs rising 2.5%, other
energy costs up 2.0%, and hourly wage
increases of 3.3%, so they may be hard-pressed to get the 10% earnings gain
without further cost cutting.</P>
<P>And there are concerns that cost cutting may
mean further cuts in employment. Since the first part of 1994 through
November of 1996, the U.S. chemical industry has lost 51,000 workers. About
8,000 of those cuts came just since January of this year. But the workforce
is apparently an easy place to cut expenses.
And this is confirmed by the CMA survey. Although a weighted average of the
under-$1 billion companies see a 2.3%
rise in employment in 1997, the over-$1 billion companies see a 1.1%
decline. This, however, is less than the 1.9% cut forecast
by the larger producers for 1996.</P>
<P>However, if there is just a 1% further
reduction in chemical industry employment, this would translate into more
than 10,000 additional jobs cut. Although
this may, at first glance, seem excessive,
the U.S. chemical industry is well on the
way there before 1997 even starts with
the announced 1,500 to 2,500 employees that will be let go in the Monsanto
spin-off of its chemical operation (see page 9).</p>
<P>In essence, 1997 may look a lot like
1996: low economic growth, low inflation. And the chemical industry will respond
with only slightly higher economics of its own in production, pricing,
sales, and earnings.</P>
<P>One thing is sure, though. Chemical
producers are going to continue to watch
costs - especially in discretionary areas
such as employment and inventories.

Increase In 1997</big></font></H1>

</p>
<P>Despite generally poor results for
1996 sales and earnings, chemical
companies expect to increase
their R&amp;D spending this year. The decision to increase spending actually
isn't
too surprising since chemical companies
are turning more and more to their R&amp;D
organizations to fuel business growth.</P>
<P>Overall spending on R&amp;D by 26 major
chemical producers surveyed by C&amp;EN
will rise for the first time in five years.
The last increase occurred in 1992, at a
time when the industry hit a low point in
combined annual earnings and companies increased their investments in R&amp;D
an average of 3.7%. The estimated 3.5%
increase for 1997 follows a drop of 1.8%

in 1996. This year, combined spending
by the 26 companies is expected to hit
nearly $3.9 billion.</P>
<P>However, in constant-dollar terms
using 1987 as a base year, spending will
remain essentially flat between 1996
and 1997. But at least the downward
trend of the past several years appears
to have slowed or stopped. In 1997, estimated R&amp;D spending by the companies
surveyed by C&amp;EN will have fallen
about 10% in current dollars and about
24% in constant dollars from its peak in
1990.</P>
<P>DuPont's peak in R&amp;D spending of
$1.38 billion also occurred in 1990. The
company leads the chemical industry in
R&amp;D spending and, for possibly the first
time in 12 years, could have an R&amp;D
spending level below $1 billion. Since
1990, its spending has decreased steadily
and today is 27.5% below that peak year
in current dollars.</P>
<P>DuPont is estimating 1996 and 1997
spending at $1 billion. The company's
sale of its medical products business and
the creation of an elastomers joint venture with Dow in April 1996 brought
1996 spending down about 6% from
$1.07 billion in 1995.</P>
<P>The factors affecting DuPont's results are fairly
typical, since acquisitions
and divestment of businesses played
havoc with the R&amp;D spending figures
for individual companies in this year's
survey. Analysis of year-to-year changes
in spending are complicated by the numerous businesses that have changed
or will change hands between 1995 and
1997.</P>
<P>For 1996, 13 companies increased
their R&amp;D spending, whereas five held it
at last year's levels, and eight, including
DuPont, decreased spending. Six companies say they will not change their R&amp;D
spending in 1997, but 17 now plan to increase spending and only three foresee
decreases in the coming year.</P>
<P>The degree to which companies are
investing in R&amp;D can be seen by looking at spending as a percentage of sales
.
This percentage is expected to remain
steady in 1997 at about 3.3 to 3.4%. A
few years ago, the same group of companies invested as much as 4.5% of their
sales in R&amp;D.</P>
<center><img src="R&D.gif"></center>
<P>Many companies, such as Dow Chemical, DuPont,
and W.R. Grace, have shed
research-intensive businesses, such as
pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals, and
have brought the level of spending as a
percentage of sales more in line with the
current industry average. Spending as a
percentage of sales varies widely from
company to company, ranging from just
more than 1% to nearly 6% and depends
largely on a given company's business
mix.</P>
<P>Missing from C&amp;EN's survey this
year is Monsanto, which has a mix of
drug, chemical, and agrochemical sales.
One of the industry's biggest spenders - more than $600 million per year
in the past several years - the company
chose not to disclose its 1996 figure. It
also declined to predict R&amp;D spending
for 1997, since its split into a life sciences and a chemical company is pending
this year.</P>
<P>Although overall spending for those
companies surveyed is predicted to be
up a few percentage points in 1997, individual company results vary widely,
from
double-digit decreases at Olin and Lubrizol to double-digit increases at Albemar
le,
BetzDearborn, Ethyl, Grace, Praxair, and Union Carbide. In 1996, Crompton &amp;
Knowles hiked R&amp;D spending by
an apparent 271% because of its merger
with Uniroyal Chemical in August. The
company will increase spending about
6% in 1997.</P>
<P>In 1997, Olin, which is selling off several businesses
(C&amp;EN, Oct. 14, 1996,
page 9), expects sales to drop 30% and
R&amp;D spending to fall a commensurate
25%. Lubrizol plans to hold its R&amp;D
spending down by 10.5% as part of the
company's overall strategy to reduce the
complexity of its products and gain better control of its cost structure. Morton
International's spending will decrease
just 3.8%.
</P>

<P>Ethyl's R&amp;D spending fell nearly 15%
in 1996 but will recover nearly 11% in
1997. Much of the increase will come
from its acquisition of Texaco's lubricant
additives business. Praxair's increase of
18% in 1996 and 11% for 1997 comes
largely from the addition of the Liquid
Carbonic business.</P>
<P>At Grace, spending dropped 19% in
1996, reflecting the sale of its health
care, water treatment, and other smaller
businesses. The company will raise its
1997 R&amp;D budget 14%, says a company
spokesman, reflecting "a greater commitment ... to R&amp;D
in its packaging and
specialty chemicals businesses."</P>
<P>At BetzDearborn, R&amp;D spending increased in
1996 and will do so again in
1997, largely because of Betz's acquisition of Grace's Dearborn water treatment
chemicals business last year. Albemarle sold its &agr;-olefins business to Amoco
Chemical in 1996, but with little
apparent effect on R&amp;D spending. Arco
Chemical's planned acquisition of Olin's
isocyanates business is not reflected in its
1997 R&amp;D spending estimate.</P>
<P>Most of the remaining seven of nine
chemical companies that spend more
than $100 million per year on R&amp;D intend to increase spending in 1997. Air
Products &amp; Chemicals, Dow, Union
Carbide, Rohm and Haas, and FMC will
post solid increases in 1997. FMC and
Rohm and Haas will break the $200 million mark, and Union Carbide will move
closer to it. PPG Industries will keep its
R&amp;D spending steady at about $240 million, and Eastman Chemical will spend
just 2% more for a total of $186 million
in 1997.</P>
<P>After three years of falling R&amp;D
spending, Dow will increase its R&amp;D investment 6% to $812 million. Dow's
agricultural products joint venture with Eli
Lilly, called DowElanco, is contributing
more to its R&amp;D spending figure. And
Dow will increase real spending to help
in the commercialization of its metallocene-catalyst-based polymers.</P>
<P>For the 24 companies participating in
both this and last year's surveys, actual
combined spending for 1996 came in
just 1% shy of the total estimated for the
year. Although spending was down
slightly more than predicted last year at
this time, it still suggests that chemical
producers did not face any major upsets
that caused them to pull back from
spending. This year, in the aftermath of
reengineering, R&amp;D managers can be expected again to try to get the most
out of
every budgeted dollar.

<hr noshade>
<P>Combinatorial chemistry--a set of
techniques for creating a multiplicity of compounds and then testing
them for activity--has been widely
adopted by large and small drug discovery companies alike over the past few
years.</P>

<P>The idea of combinatorial chemistry is
to form large "libraries" of molecules en
masse--instead of synthesizing compounds one by one, as has been done traditionally--and
to identify the most promising "lead" pharmaceutical compounds
by high-throughput screening of the libraries. The concept has swept through
the
drug and biotechnology industries like a
tidal wave, leaving few, if any, companies
untouched. It has been the focus of much
academic research as well.</P>

<P>According to David K. Stone, head of
biotechnology research at the investment bank Cowen &amp; Co., New York
City, "Virtually every organization engaged in pharmaceutical research
and development is using some form of combinatorial technology, or claims to
be, and
a host of entrepreneurial companies
have sprung up to supply the industry's
demands for libraries, high-throughput
screening, synthesis methods, hardware,
software, and analytical tools." No drugs
discovered combinatorially have yet
been approved for marketing, although
several are currently in clinical trials.</P>

<P>A synthetic organic chemist in the
pharmaceutical industry used to be able
to make about 100 compounds per year,
at a cost of thousands of dollars per compound, says Mark L. Peterson, vice
president at Advanced ChemTech Inc., Louisville. But the exploding number of
potential drug targets emerging from
molecular biology research such as the
Human Genome Project, as well as the
continuing drive to minimize health care
costs, has created a need to synthesize
more compounds and test them more
rapidly for bioactivity. Combinatorial
chemistry provides this faster and cheaper route to new medicines, says Peterson,
whose company markets automated
systems for solution- and solid-phase synthesis. He spoke at the fourth annual
conference on Exploiting Molecular Diversity: Small Molecule Libraries for Drug
Discovery, held in Coronado, Calif., earlier this month and organized by Cambridge
Healthtech Institute, Newton Upper Falls, Mass.</P>

<center><img src="panlabs.gif"></center>
<h5>Panlabs chemistry associates (from left) Devin Hendricks,
Jennifer Poulos,
and William McFee weigh reagents for
combinatorial synthesis

station

<P>"These are heady days for chemists involved
in combinatorial chemistry," says
Anthony W. Czarnik, senior director of
chemistry at Irori Quantum Microchemistry, La Jolla, Calif. "Large pharmaceutical
companies are, to a site, developing internal groups in this area. Perhaps more
amazingly, biotech companies once comfortable with mainly biology staffs are
hiring combinatorial chemists as the absolute
requirement for chemistry in drug discovery becomes more apparent. Furthermore,
the joy of discovering and inventing really
useful new techniques has energized the
community in a way and at a rate this generation of medicinal chemists has not
experienced before."</P>

<P>Combinatorial chemistry was first
conceived about 15 years ago--although
it wasn't called that until the early 1990s.
Initially, the field focused primarily on
the synthesis of peptide and oligonucleotide libraries. H. Mario Geysen, distinguished
research scientist at Glaxo Wellcome Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.,
helped jump-start the field in 1984 when
his group developed a technique for synthesizing peptides on pin-shaped solid
supports. At the Coronado conference,
Geysen reported on his group's recent
development of an encoding strategy in
which molecular tags are attached to
beads or linker groups used in solid-phase synthesis. After the products have
been assayed, the tags are cleaved and
determined by mass spectrometry (MS)
to identify potential lead compounds.</P>

<P>In 1985, Richard A. Houghten, president of Torrey
Pines Institute for Molecular Studies and chief scientific officer of
Houghten Pharmaceuticals Inc., both in
San Diego, developed
a technique in which
tiny mesh packets, or"
tea bags," act as reaction chambers and
filtration devices for
solid-phase parallel
peptide synthesis.
Houghten later also
discovered positional
scanning, a technique
for rapidly assessing
the biological activity
contributed by different functional groups
in a compound.
Houghten Pharmaceuticals is one of several companies with a
combinatorial drug in
clinical trials--a cytokine-regulating agent
for cancer pain, obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.</P>

<P>The field's original predominant focus on peptide
and
oligonucleotide libraries began to change
about five years ago, when groups such
as those of chemistry professor Jonathan
A. Ellman at the University of California,
Berkeley, and organic chemist Sheila
Hobbs DeWitt at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann
Arbor, Mich., developed the first combinatorial techniques
for producing small organic molecules
with molecular weights of up to 500 or
so - the class of compounds from which
drugs are most often found. The approach conceived by DeWitt and colleagues
provides the basis for automated
synthesizers marketed by a Parke-Davis
spin-off, Diversomer Technologies Inc.,
Ann Arbor, where DeWitt is now vice
president of technical development.</P>

Zhang uses gas
chromatographs equipped

and electron

<P>An emerging trend in the combinatorial field,
according to Peter L. Myers, chief
scientific officer of the combinatorial drug
discovery company CombiChem in San
Diego, is a move away from very large and
complex mixtures of compounds with an
inevitable redundancy of information content. Instead, Myers sees an increased
focus on libraries in which components are
prepared individually ("one compound
per well"), have relatively high purity, and
are focused more rationally on the biological targets at hand.</P>

<P>Such a trend is exemplified in the philosophy
of the new company PharmaQuest, San Diego. President Dale S.
Dhanoa says PharmaQuest's approach involves "synthesis of diverse druglike
molecules as pure, single compounds that can
be rapidly identified in high-throughput
screening as initial lead compounds."</P>

<P>The trend toward more targeted libraries is also
seen in work by senior scientist
Eric J. Martin and coworkers at Chiron
Corp., Emeryville, Calif. "To minimize redundancy and improve screening
efficiency," says Martin, "we initially developed
computational techniques to design libraries with maximum structural diversity.
We
found lots of potent ligands, but in analyzing the properties of the libraries
and hits,
we concluded that many factors besides
diversity impact good library design for
drug discovery." Martin's group has developed a "sequential D-optimal
design" algorithm that facilitates the design of libraries
biased to accommodate the requirements
of specific receptors and the physicochemical properties of orally available
drugs.</P>

<P>Computer programs that achieve similar goals
are being developed by several
companies. "The focusing of libraries interactively for lead optimization
is what
many perceive as the next hurdle in exploiting combinatorial approaches for
drug discovery," says Scott D. Kahn, director of life sciences marketing
at Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego. The
company's software-based approach uses
both structure-activity information from
analog data and structural information
from protein crystallography and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy to
help focus libraries.</P>

<P>ChemSpace, by Tripos, St. Louis, selects compounds
for synthesis in terms of
their collective diversity, their molecular
properties, and how druglike their structures are. Chemical Design Ltd., Chipping
Norton, Oxfordshire, England, has developed ChemIdea, a module for the Chem-X
molecular modeling package that uses biological activity data to identify areas
of unexplored "property space" and to suggest
substituents likely to further enhance activity. MDL Information Systems, San
Leandro, Calif., makes a number of programs
directed at combinatorial applications, including MDL Central Library, which
helps
optimize combinatorial reactions to identify promising library members.</P>

<P>Researchers at ArQule Inc., Medford,
Mass., are using computational analyses,
crystallographic data, and diversity assessment techniques to produce combinatorial
libraries designed to provide
maximal structure-activity relationship
(SAR) data for use in lead optimization.
OntoDiversity--a program marketed by
Ontogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.--helps
design combinatorial libraries by computing the structural transformations undergone
by the "reactive fragments"
used to construct them. And Alanex
Corp., San Diego, uses its LiBrain software to design maximally diverse exploratory
libraries and to guide medicinal
chemists through the succession of optimization steps required to produce viable
drug candidates. The trend toward"
smarter" libraries is very clear.</P>

<P>One of the most persistent debates in
the field of combinatorial chemistry involves the relative advantages and disadvantages
of solid-phase versus solution-phase combinatorial synthesis. Combinatorial
compounds are created either by
solution-phase synthesis or by producing
compounds bound covalently to solid-phase particles. Solid-phase synthesis
makes it easier to conduct multistep reactions and to drive reactions to completion,
because excess reagents can be added and
then easily washed away after each reaction step. But a much wider range of
organic reactions is available for solution-phase synthesis, the technology
used traditionally by most synthetic organic
chemists, and products in solution can be
more easily identified and characterized.</P>

<P>One key factor in favor of solid-phase
synthesis, says Czarnik, is that it makes it
possible to use split synthesis, a technique 
developed in 1982 by &Aacute;rp&aacute;d Furka, organic chemistry professor
at E&ouml;tv&ouml;s
University, Budapest, Hungary, and currently senior research fellow at Advanced
ChemTech. Split synthesis produces large support-bound libraries in
which each solid-phase particle holds a
single compound, or soluble libraries
produced by cleavage of compounds
from the solid support.</P>

<center><img src="covalent.gif"></center>

<P>"To make 10,000 compounds via a
three-step solution-phase method requires 10,000 beakers, vials, or wells,
each used three times," says Czarnik."
There's no avoiding this physical requirement. This necessitates at least
30,000 liquid-handling steps, and more
likely double that many. Making the
same 10,000 compounds on solid support in three steps can be accomplished
using as few as the cube root of 10,000
beakers--about 22 beakers, each used
three times. Some small multiple of 22
liquid-handling steps will be required."</P>

<P>Therefore, says Czarnik, "making lots
of compounds using solution-phase
methods is automation-intensive. The
same project on solid phase can be accomplished without liquid-handling automation
at all." But he believes that both
solution-phase and solid-phase techniques "are useful--period. Each
platform has strengths and weaknesses, depending on the application."</P>
<P>Chemistry professor George Barany of
the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,
who specializes in solid-phase synthesis,
says: "I still think for convenience that solid phase is going to be the
way to go. The
field is still on a learning curve. But certainly you can't do split synthesis
in solution,
and split synthesis gives you orders of
magnitude more diversity. This requires
on-resin screening techniques or cleavable
linkers. The issue is finding the right linkers and the right supports to use."</P>

<P>Stephen W. Kaldor, head of combinatorial chemistry
at Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, and coworkers have developed a
solution-phase "covalent scavenger"
technology that retains some of the advantages of solid-phase chemistry while
greatly reducing some of its disadvantages. The reaction product is formed by
solution-phase synthesis, and unreacted
starting material is then selectively removed from solution via covalent bond
formation to a solid-phase-supported
electrophile or nucleophile. Kaldor
points out that a similar technique was
reported much earlier for removal of reactive impurities from natural product
mixtures by chemistry professor Jean
Fr&eacute;chet and coworkers at Louis Pasteur
University, Strasbourg, France [<I>Tetrahedron Lett.,</I> <B>21,</B>
617 (1980)].</P>

<P>"The concept is very generalizable,
and we have used it with success on dozens of drug discovery projects at Lilly,"
says Kaldor. For instance, his group used
it to optimize an existing noncombinatorial lead compound, resulting in the
discovery of LY334370, a selective serotonin receptor agonist that is currently
in
clinical trials as a central nervous system
agent for treatment of migraine.</P>

<P>The combinatorial optimization procedure took
less than six months, from identification of the initial lead to discovery of
the clinical candidate--a process that
would more typically take one or more
years. Kaldor's group recently reported
the use of covalent scavengers for expedited amine alkylations and acylations
[<I>Tetrahedron Lett.,</I> <B>37,</B> 7193 (1996)] and for the
discovery of novel leads in a whole-cell
antirhinovirus assay [<I>Bioorg. Med. Chem.
Lett.,</I> <B>6,</B> 3041 (1996)].</P>

<P>Related techniques have been developed independently
by at least three other groups--those of John C. Hodges, director of exploratory
chemistry at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research; Daniel L.
Flynn at the Combinatorial Chemistry/
Parallel Medicinal Chemistry Discovery
Unit of Monsanto/Searle, St. Louis; and
Robert W. Armstrong, chemistry professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and director of chemistry at Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif. Hodges
and Flynn presented their techniques in
January at the 2nd Winter Conference on
Medicinal &amp; Bioorganic Chemistry in
Steamboat Springs, Colo.</P>

<P>After solution-phase synthesis of one
molecule at a time, says Hodges, "the strategy for purification, if any,
is trial and error. Chromatography is commonly a first
resort since it usually works. It is time-consuming and expensive, however."</P>

<P>Hodges' technique, called polymer-supported quench,
is designed to purify solutions at each stage of multistep synthesis,
using either polymer-bound reagents or
liquid-liquid extraction. "In rare cases we
must do both," he says, "but that is still
preferable to chromatography when running parallel arrays of 100 or more reactions."
He estimates the cost of a single
purification by the polymer-supported
quench method to be about one-tenth that
of a single purification by flash chromatography (a manual column chromatography
technique commonly used by synthetic organic chemists) because of savings in
solvent and labor.</P>

<P>Flynn and coworkers at Monsanto/Searle
have also found that, after solution-phase synthesis, excesses of reagents
with certain types of molecular
functionality can be sequestered by incubating them with resins having complementary
reactive groups. Simple filtration
then affords solution-phase products free
of the sequestered reactants.</P>

<P>Reagents that are not susceptible to purification
in this manner can be made so
by tagging. The reagents are encoded with
artificial functional group tags of known
identity. After solution-phase synthesis,
Flynn and coworkers incubate the reaction mixtures with resins containing functional
groups complementary to those of
the reagent tags. If conditions are right,
the resins sequester not only the original
reagents but also their by-products.</P>

<center><img src="ugi.gif"></center>

<P>Armstrong and coworkers at UCLA and
Amgen have also developed a technique
called resin capture, a solution-phase
cleanup method similar to the covalent
scavenger and polymer-supported quench
concepts. The technique involves solution-phase chemistry for the first few
steps
in a synthetic sequence, capture of a solution-phase intermediate on a resin,
subsequent solid-phase transformations, and then
release of the product back into solution.</P>

<P>In addition, the researchers are developing high-yield
combinatorial solution-phase syntheses based on multicomponent condensation
reactions such as the
Ugi reaction, conceived by Ivar Ugi of
the Institute of Organic Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at the Technical University
of
Munich, Germany. The Ugi reaction is a
high-yield process in which a ketone, aldehyde, or Schiff base is combined with
an amine, an isonitrile, and an acid to
yield a variety of products, depending on
choice of reactants.</P>

<P>Repligen Director of Chemistry Alan
R. Jacobson and his coworkers in Needham, Mass., are also using the Ugi reaction
in solution--in this case to identify
inhibitors of protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions. They recently
carried out parallel syntheses and assayed the products directly, without the
need for cleanup, in a high-throughput
screen for antagonists of protein-glycosaminoglycan binding. The screen
yielded lead compounds for the development of tumor growth inhibitors and
agents that block angiogenesis (new
blood vessel growth).
</P>

<center><img src="nucleo.gif"></center>
<P>Researchers at Isis Pharmaceuticals,
Carlsbad, Calif., have developed SPSAF (solution-phase simultaneous addition
of
functionalities), a high-yield technique that
permits the generation of libraries containing roughly equimolar amounts of
all components--which can be difficult to
achieve with solid-phase synthesis. The
group recently identified a series of highly
potent antimicrobial leads by using SPSAF
to generate modified polyazaphanes.</P>

<P>Chemistry professor Dennis P. Curran
of the University of Pittsburgh has developed a strategy involving use of polyfluorinated
tags to facilitate solution-phase purifications [<I>Science,</I> <B>275,</B>
823 (1997)]. In
Curran's "fluorous synthesis" approach,
organic molecules are made soluble in fluorocarbon solvents so they can be easily
separated from excess reactants and by-products present after solution synthesis.</P>

<P>A starting material for combinatorial
synthesis is first derivatized with a perfluorinated group. After solution synthesis
has
been carried out, a water-immiscible fluorocarbon solvent is added to the solution.
Because the product is carrying the perfluorinated group, it is extracted preferentially
into the fluorocarbon solvent. The perfluorinated group can then be removed
to recover the purified product.</P>

<P>Curran believes the analysis of phases
of products, reagents, and by-products
could become standard practice in library
synthesis. "In a future six-step synthesis,"
he says, "you might do the first three steps
on a small-molecule substrate, then switch
to the fluorous phase for the next two
steps, and finally do the last one on the
solid phase. The desired products would
then zigzag through various phases in a
planned path that was dictated by the reactions that you were doing, the kinds
of
reagents that were available, and the kinds
of by-products and impurities that you expected at each stage."</P>

<P>Fluorous synthesis is conceptually
similar to a method developed two years
ago by chemistry professor Kim D. Janda
and coworkers at Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, Calif., in which the
polymer polyethylene glycol monomethyl
ether is used as a foundation for combinatorial assembly. The polymer is soluble
in a variety of aqueous and organic solvents and can be precipitated out of
solution by crystallization for purification
purposes after a synthesis.</P>

<P>However, Curran says fluorous synthesis differs
from Janda's technique at
the purification, identification, and analysis stages. "He works largely
with polymer techniques at these stages, while we
work with small-molecule techniques,"
Curran explains. "As an example, we can
analyze our compounds by HPLC [high-performance liquid chromatography]
or
characterize them by MS without ever
cleaving the fluorous label. You can't do
this easily with polymers."</P>

<P>Curran adds: "Our fluorous technique
and Janda's polyethylene glycol method
nicely illustrate the point that ... while
there might seem to be a huge gulf between solid-phase and solution methods,
there is in fact a continuum that is just
beginning to be filled in. Janda's work is
somewhere in the middle, but toward
the 'solid' side. Ours is more over on the'
solution' end. It gets hard to pigeonhole
techniques like the polyethylene glycol
method, fluorous synthesis, resin capture, covalent extractions--and therein
lies their power."</P>

<P>Kaldor agrees that although solution-
phase and solid-phase combinatorial
chemistry might sometimes seem to represent two extremes, "it is not necessarily
an either-or situation. Some of the best
combinatorial chemistry methods that
are currently under investigation involve
hybrid approaches that use the best features of both."</P>

<P>Director of Medicinal Chemistry Mark
J. Suto and coworkers at Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, have found ion-exchange
resins useful as reagents to remove reaction by-products and eliminate
aqueous workup in solution-phase synthesis. For example, they use resin to absorb
excess reagent in reactions of amines with
acid chlorides to produce amides. The resin eliminates an extraction procedure
that
would otherwise be necessary to clean up
the solution of amide product. Reactions
in the presence of a weakly basic resin
have produced products that were more
than 97% pure, compared with an average
61% purity in the absence of resin.</P>

<P>However, the Signal Pharmaceuticals
scientists also employ solid-phase synthesis and have developed a linker that
makes
it possible to add diversity to a molecule as
it is cleaved from a solid support. One disadvantage of solid-phase synthesis
is that a
hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, or other polar
group must be present on a molecule to
be able to attach it to a solid support. This
is a potentially undesirable constraint on
the structure of compounds synthesized
on solid phase, because products retain
the polar group even after they are
cleaved from the support.</P>

<P>Several groups, including that of Ellman and
coworkers, have devised "traceless" linkers that avoid this problem,
because the linkers are removed completely from products during the cleavage
process. For example, Ellman's group recently reported an acylsulfonamide linker
that can be displaced by various nucleophiles to add diversity to a library.</P>

<P>Suto's group has developed an inert
sulfur traceless linker that can likewise
be substituted by a wide variety of nucleophiles to introduce additional diversity.
The researchers currently are using
this chemistry to prepare small heterocycle-based libraries on a solid support.</P>

<P>Many other companies avoid using either solution-phase
or solid-phase combinatorial chemistry exclusively. For example, researchers
at Chiroscience Ltd.,
Cambridge, England, are successfully using an ambidextrous solid- or solution-phase
strategy to generate and optimize
lead compounds with activity as matrix
metalloproteinase inhibitors. These compounds 
have potential applications for
treatment of cancer and inflammatory
diseases.</P>

<P>Chemists at Arris Pharmaceutical Corp.,
South San Francisco, have developed an
inexpensive and simple technique for carrying out aqueous extractions on libraries
made by solution-phase synthesis. The desired product of a reaction is purified
by
eluting the reaction mixture in a commercial sample prep column, which selectively
retains by-products.</P>

<P>But the company also has developed
some innovative techniques for solid-phase synthesis, including react-and-release
chemistry, in which reagents
used to cleave products from the solid
support are incorporated into the product. Arris researchers also have developed
a sequential displacement strategy
that makes it possible to isolate several
different compounds from each solid-phase reaction chamber.</P>

<P>"Substoichiometric amounts of different
cleaving reagents are sequentially reacted with a compound that is synthesized
on a react-and-release type resin, and each
product is individually eluted," explains
Douglas A. Livingston, director of combinatorial chemistry at Arris. "The
number
of compounds available from a piece of
equipment is routinely increased up to 10-fold using this technique."</P>

<P>Considerable effort is also being devoted to
the development of analytical
chemistry techniques capable of keeping
pace with the demands of combinatorial
chemistry.</P>

<P>In pharmaceutical companies, notes
analytical scientist Robyn A. Rourick of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Wallingford,
Conn., it's important to obtain stability,
metabolic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological data on drug candidates as soon
as possible to aid in the selection, optimization, and overall development of
new
drugs. But the advent of larger numbers
of combinatorial drug candidates--compared 
with the number that used to
be produced by conventional synthesis--makes it extremely difficult for
analytical research groups to keep up. Such
groups "cannot simply increase resources 10-fold to assist in the evaluation
of
new drug candidates using traditional
protocols," she says.</P>

<P>As a result, Rourick and coworkers
are developing new analytical procedures for combinatorial drug profiling.
They find that parallel processing by LC/
MS eliminates the need for repetitive
analyses of single compounds. Traditional analysis protocols require scale-up,
extraction, separation, and fractionation of
complex mixtures, followed by spectroscopic analysis of each individual fraction.
LC/MS profiling permits all these
steps to be accomplished by a single instrument, resulting in increased efficiency
and productivity.</P>

<P>For example, metabolic and stability
data can be obtained by subjecting a
combinatorial mixture to forced degradation and in vitro metabolism conditions
and then analyzing the treated sample
with LC/MS. Metabolites and degradation
products will retain most of the substructures of the compounds from which they
are derived, and the chemical ancestry of
these components can be established by
LC/MS/MS. Rourick and coworkers use
this method to develop profiles of each
library compound that can be referenced
throughout the drug development cycle.</P>

<P>Cheryl D. Garr, project manager of synthetic
and combinatorial chemistry at Panlabs Inc., Bothell, Wash., and coworkers
have developed methods for high-throughput sample analysis of Optiverse
screening libraries, which are marketed to
other companies for use in their drug discovery programs. They have developed
an
LC/MS technique for library analysis in collaboration with Perkin-Elmer Sciex,
Toronto, and a preparative-scale HPLC process
for purifying the libraries in conjunction
with the Biotage division of Dyax Corp.,
Charlottesville, Va. High-throughput HPLC
instrumentation developed by companies
such as Biotage are capable of purifying
hundreds of samples per day.</P>

<center><img src="auto.gif"></center>
<h5>Automated tools for combinatorial chemistry include Chiron's multiwash
head system (far left), which generates large numbers of compounds 
simultaneously, and a flash chromatography purification workstation, used by
chemistry associate Julie Stripes of Panlabs.</h5>

<P>In combinatorial chemistry, as in opera,
it isn't over until the fat lady sings--meaning usually that a lead compound
is in the
drug development pipeline. The field has
now progressed to a stage at which several drugs are in clinical trials, and
others are well
on the way.</P>

<P>For example, researchers at Pharmacopeia Inc.,
Princeton, N.J.,
are using encoded combinatorial libraries synthesized on solid phase
to identify aspartyl protease inhibitors. Potential leads have emerged from
libraries
containing a total of about 32,000 compounds that were constructed around a
statine core, using encoded split synthesis.</P>

<P>The encoding technique is based on a
strategy--conceived by chemistry professor 
W. Clark Still and coworkers at Columbia University--in which inert halogenated
compounds are used to record the
chemical reaction history of each support
bead. The tags are analyzed by capillary
gas chromatography to reveal the identity
of active compounds in the library.</P>

<P>"Pharmacopeia has optimized this
method by automating the tag-reading
process and combining the technology
with high-throughput screening of targets of pharmaceutical interest,"
says research scientist Theodore O. Johnson Jr."
Using four dual-channel gas chromatography instruments with electron capture
detectors and autosamplers, between
1,000 and 1,500 tag decodes are routinely performed each month" in Pharmacopeia's
research laboratories.</P>

<P>Johnson and coworkers have
screened the encoded libraries against
the aspartyl proteases plasmepsin and
cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II is a malarial
enzyme involved in the digestion of hemoglobin, and cathepsin D is an aspartyl
protease involved in tumor metastasis
and possibly Alzheimer's disease. The
strategy yielded a family of selective plasmepsin II inhibitors, including one
that
inhibits plasmepsin II at the 100-nM level. The researchers also found compounds
selective for cathepsin D, but
they were not as potent.</P>

<center><img src="graphic.gif"></center>

<h5>Novartis' CGP64222, a lead compound for suppression of human 
immunodeficiency virus replication that was identified combinatorially, is
shown docked to the binding site of TAR RNA.</h5>

<P>Aspartyl protease inhibitors are also
being sought by graduate student Ellen
Kick and coworkers in Ellman's group at UC Berkeley, working with pharmaceutical
chemistry professor Irwin D. Kuntz Jr. and
coworkers at the University of California, San Francisco. The researchers constructed
two 1,000-compound libraries. Dock,
Kuntz's structure-based design program, was used to
help select the building
blocks that went into one
of these libraries. The study yielded compounds that inhibit cathepsin D at
low
nanomolar levels.</P>

<P>Research scientist Eduard R. Felder and
coworkers at Novartis (formerly with Ciba-Geigy's pharmaceuticals division),
Basel,
Switzerland, have identified a highly active
and proteolytically stable hybrid peptoid-peptide oligomer,
called CGP64222. (Peptoids are peptide analogs.) CGP64222 inhibits a key interaction
in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) life cycle, thus
suppressing viral replication.</P>

<hr noshade>
<h3>TO SIDEBAR: <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/970224/evol.html">
'Evolution' used to isolate high-affinity ligands</a></h3>
<hr noshade>
<P>One of the first steps in HIV gene activation
is the binding of HIV's Tat protein to TAR RNA, the Tat-responsive element 
of HIV. Starting from a pool of
more than 3 million compounds synthesized on solid phase, the Novartis group
was able to identify CGP64222 as an effective inhibitor of this interaction.
The
oligomer blocks formation of the Tat/TAR
complex in vitro at nanomolar concentrations and inhibits HIV replication
in human lymphocytes. Studies conducted in conjunction with researchers from
the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, show that
CGP64222 binds TAR by a mechanism
similar to that used by larger Tat-derived
polypeptides. Felder and coworkers are
currently studying simplified analogs of
CGP64222 in an effort to identify compounds with enhanced in vivo efficacy.</P>

<P>Small-molecule (nonpeptide) inhibitors
of Tat/TAR complex formation have also
been identified by Research Associate
Houng-Yau Mei and coworkers at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research. The inhibitors
were found by high-throughput screening of the corporate compound library.</P>

<P>At Versicor, South San Francisco,
mechanism-based design elements are incorporated into the design of libraries.
Screening of a 1,200-member quinazolinedione library has enabled Versicor
scientists to identify several novel antimicrobial lead compounds that inhibit
the&szlig;-lactamase
class of bacterial enzymes. A
focused combinatorial chemistry-driven
SAR study based on these leads is currently in progress.</P>

<P>Molecumetics Ltd., Bellevue, Wash., is
using its Smart Library technology to identify and optimize oral inhibitors
of the clotting enzymes thrombin, Factor VIIa, and
Factor Xa, and the transcription factor NF-<small>K</small>B. A Smart Library is a collection
of nonpeptide small molecules designed to interact with therapeutic target proteins.
The
company is currently testing the thrombin
inhibitor MOL-144 as an anticoagulant for
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and
the NF-<small>K</small>B inhibitor MOL-294 as a potential
asthma treatment.</P>

<P>Researchers also are continuing to attempt using
combinatorial strategies for a
nonbiological application--identifying inorganic catalysts (C&amp;EN, Nov.
4, 1996,
page 37). A recent example is work by
chemistry professor Craig L. Hill and graduate student Robin Damico Gall of
Emory
University, Atlanta, in which polyoxometalates were prepared by parallel synthesis
and evaluated for their ability to catalyze
the aerobic oxidation of tetrahydrothiophene, an analog of the chemical warfare
agent mustard gas [<I>J. Mol. Catal.,</I> <B>114,</B> 103
(1996)]. Previous techniques developed
for the aerobic catalytic oxidation of
thioethers such as tetrahydrothiophene require high temperatures and pressures,
whereas one of the catalysts identified by
Hill and Gall works under milder conditions (95 &deg;C and 1.52 atm).</P>

<P>But most of the big guns in combinatorial chemistry
remain focused on drug
development. Over lunch, one attendee
at the Coronado meeting expressed the
view that the plethora of strategies being
presented seemed overwhelming and
somewhat confusing. "How can you tell
which techniques work well?" she
asked.</P>

<P>All of them work, to one degree or another, replied
Houghten. They are all potentially valuable tools to help speed the
identification of new drugs. If the drugs
that result are safe and effective ones,
that's all that really matters, he said.

<P>For the first time in several years,
it
appears that the light at the end of
the employment tunnel is not from
an oncoming train. In this annual examination of career opportunities for chemists
and chemical engineers, C&amp;EN finds
that the job market looks brighter compared with the past few years - at
most
degree levels and in both industry and
academia. The consensus among many
recruiters, chemistry department chairmen, and college placement directors is
that there will be many more jobs for
chemists graduating in 1997 than there
were in 1996.</P>
<P>This does not, however, mean that
the outlook for employment is rosy. The
job market will continue to be tight for
new Ph.D.s and postdoctoral fellows.
Recruiting is up in these categories, but
since the last three years have been
among the worst in recent memory for
employment, an improved job outlook
may actually only translate into a mediocre market.&rjust;
Downsizing at companies - which nationally has wiped out hundreds of thousands
of jobs, disrupted the lives of employees, and changed the face of employment - has
not spared chemists. In a
recent survey, 46% of 78 companies in
the chemical and pharmaceutical industries indicated that they will be downsizing
in the next 18 months. On the other
hand, the latest annual survey from the
American Management Association shows
that U.S. corporations overall added jobs at
a quicker pace in the past year, which supports the notion that the economy
remains strong.</P>
<P>In this year's Employment Outlook,
C&amp;EN also examines two areas much in
the news: consulting as an alternative career and the status of foreign scientists
in
the U.S.</p>
<hr><br>
<A HREF="empdemand.html"><img src="demandbut.gif" align=left hspace=6></A>

outlook for employment of both inexperienced and experienced chemists and      
chemical engineers.</h5><br><br>
<A HREF="empsalaries.html"><img src="startingbut.gif" align=left hspace=6></A>
<h5>A continuing tight job market is confirmed by preliminary data from the

for hiring, but landing a position will
still take some legwork</I></h2></font></center>
</P>
<H3>Mairin B. Brennan, C&amp;EN Washington</H3>
<P>The sentiment among many recruiters,
chemistry department chairmen, and college placement directors is that there
will be many more jobs
for chemists graduating in 1997 than
there were in 1996.</P>
<P>"Last year was a terrible year for
Ph.D.s and postdocs," says James D.
Burke, manager of research recruiting
and university relations at Rohm and
Haas. "This year will be better. The sense
my colleagues in industry have is that recruiting will be up 20%."</P>
<P>However, given the job market in
1996 - which may well have been the
toughest in recent history for new Ph.D.s
and postdoctoral fellows - that percentage
increase might make this a merely mediocre year for Ph.D.s, Burke concedes.</P>
<P>Not that the job market wasn't on the
mend last year. The streamlining of corporate America that flattened the industr
ial
workforce throughout the early 1990s
showed signs of bottoming out. Many
chemical companies were recruiting quite
vigorously on campus, and some pharmaceutical companies were cautiously
reopening their hiring doors.</P>
<P>The problem last year was the gross
mismatch between the slew of Ph.D.s
who were looking for work and the supply of industrial and academic positions
available. The market for B.S. chemists,
which had been holding up relatively
well, also slowed down. While chemical
engineers and M.S. chemists were entering the job market with relative ease,
B.S.
chemists were finding out that co-op or
summer internship experience is the r&eacute;sum&eacute; line item that opens
the door to
employment at big companies and that
scouting out jobs at small companies
takes considerable effort.</P>
<P>This year, the job market "shouldn't be
looked on as scary" says Burke, although"
it will be competitive," he adds. For the
second year in a row, sales and earnings
are up across the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, he notes. "And
that
breeds confidence. Confidence to do
stay competitive as a company." Nevertheless, most large companies are
looking
carefully at numbers, he says, and they will
fill positions only as
necessary. "It's just
that this year they
seem to feel it's necessary to replace more
people than they have
done in the recent
past."</P>
<P>Ph.Ds also can
look to academic slots
becoming more available this year. "I suspect that many departments have
shrunk
as far as they dare and
will replace further retirees," says Judith
Herzfeld, chairman of
the chemistry department at Brandeis University. However, academic hiring is
fraught
with a number of
complex considerations, including the
cost of bringing a new
faculty member on
board. "I would not be
surprised if hires are
not made unless the fit
is really good," Herzfeld notes. Setup costs
have become so great,
she says, that it is important to wait for a
candidate who is essentially guaranteed to
work out.</P>
<P>The volume of advertising in C&amp;EN for"
positions open," a useful barometer for
tracking demand for chemical professionals,
has been rising fairly steadily this year. By
this yardstick, 1997 is shaping up to be the
best year for jobs since industrial downsizing began clipping positions in the
early
1990s. The volume of advertising for academic positions in 1996 so far reflects
the
pattern set in 1995, which hinted at signs
the market was becoming less constrained.</P>
<P>Moreover, at the American Chemical
Society's recent national meeting in Orlando, the ratio of job candidates (770)
to positions being interviewed for (494) was
better than it has been in a long time, says
John Michael Sophos, a staff associate for
ACS's Department of Career Services. And
the number of interviews being conducted at ACS's regional meetings also is
on
the rise, he says.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>Industrial hiring</H3></font>
<P>On-campus recruiting for industrial
positions has already begun, and "it sure
looks like we've got some more activity"
than last year, says Rebecca J. Simon,
placement director for the school of
chemical sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. "I
guess what
heartens me is that I see a pickup in Ph.D.
recruiting. The companies tell us they're
serious [about hiring]. But it's really the offers that come in that
are proof of the pudding." Simon estimates that Ph.D. recruiting at Illinois
is up 10 to 15% from last
year. Yet her outlook remains one of "cautious optimism," she says,
because "companies are still playing their cards very
tight to the vest."</P>
<P>Even so, "there's a certain 'normalcy'
that has come back as companies realize it
is necessary for them to continue to innovate and to develop," says Rohm
and
Haas' Burke. Industry is experiencing a"
steady-state replacement" of people who
move within an organization, he explains.
In the normal course of events, "people
are promoted or take positions elsewhere
in the organization," he notes. Therefore,
entry-level positions need to be filled so
you have a flow of talented people moving
into and through the organization.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, "students should take
nothing for granted," cautions Burke."
The smaller companies, the ones that
are so darn hard to find, will continue to
be robust employers, especially for bachelor's-level chemists." New graduates
must be prepared to ferret out the hidden opportunities these companies offer,
because "small companies often are too
busy to advertise," says Mary W. Jordan,
senior research analyst at the ACS Department of Career Services. "Yet,
45% of
bachelor-level jobs are coming out of these
little firms," she notes. Jordan was citing
preliminary data obtained from ACS's"
Starting Salaries 1996" (see page 47).</P>
<P>Many companies have stepped up on-campus recruiting
for their co-op and
summer internship programs to ensure a
ready supply of B.S. graduates with appropriate hands-on training. "I
don't ever
remember seeing quite as many summer
opportunities this early in the recruiting
season," says Illinois' Simon. "And our
students are actively pursuing them."</P>
<P>"If there was one piece of advice I
could give to undergraduate students in
engineering and the sciences," says James
W. Brockington, director of university relations for Air Products &amp; Chemical
s,
"it's to
tell them that co-op and summer programs
are very beneficial." Air Products spent a
great deal of time on campus last year
looking for students for these programs,
he notes. The investment paid off, he says,
producing "a very good selection of very
qualified students" to
choose from when
they graduate.</P>
<P>Union Carbide will
hire 25 B.S. chemists
this year from its student employment program, says Donald E.
Gatewood, manager of
recruitment and college relations. And
Dow Chemical "will
hire B.S. chemists from
a pool of students
whom we have already developed relations with," notes Diane R. Dittenhafer,
manager for recruiting
and placement in the
North and East. Neither company will be
recruiting for B.S
chemists on campus
this fall. Nor will many
others, as companies
increasingly restrict
technical recruiting in
chemistry to chemical
engineers at all degree
levels and M.S. and
Ph.D. chemists.</P>
<P>Dow, Carbide,
DuPont, Air Products, Rohm and Haas,
and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the big
chemical companies set to recruit on
campus. Joining them will be petrochemical firm Phillips Petroleum, medium-size
consumer products firm Clorox,
and others.</P>
<P>Carbide will be looking for 25 Ph.D.s
in chemistry and chemical engineering
who are fresh out of graduate school or
have up to two years of postdoctoral experience, says Gatewood. "We obviously
have an interest in catalyst chemists - inorganic, physical organic, or
organometallic - depending on a particular area."
The company hired 37 Ph.D.s last year,
he noted, although it set out to recruit
only 23. If the need for experienced
Ph.D.s develops during the year, "we do
targeted recruiting," he says.</P>
<P>Dow will be looking for chemical and
mechanical engineers, says Dittenhafer,
and a few Ph.D. chemists - in organic
and analytical chemistry and polymer
and materials sciences. DuPont, which
resumed recruiting on campus last year
after recovering from a couple of rounds
of downsizing in 1993, will be hiring
chemists and chemical, mechanical, and
electrical engineers at all degree levels."
DuPont is in an upward trend in hiring," says Robert L. Siegel, Ph.D.
staffing
manager for the company.</P>
<P>At Air Products, "we look very much to
the long term, recruiting graduates for our
career development program," says Brockington. The company will visit
about 40
colleges and universities this year, he says,
seeking out B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. chemical
and mechanical engineers and Ph.D.
chemists who are strong in physical, inorganic, or polymer chemistry.</P>
<P>Procter &amp; Gamble will continue to hire
at a steady to "slightly up" pace, says Joel
Shulman, manager for external relations.
"The bottom line as I see it," he says, "is
that the number of jobs for Ph.D.s in large
companies is a little higher than last year."
But finding them is a lot more work than
it used to be, he cautions. "Now, looking
for a job is a job itself."</P>
<P>Shulman advises graduate students to
pick a research project that allows them
to gain technical breadth to complement
the depth that goes along with getting a
Ph.D. "With the fast cycle times companies have put in effect, newly hired
Ph.D.s need to be able to contribute immediately. Employers are looking for
expertise in a particular area as the first cut.
When they find a person with that expertise, he or she
will need to have ancillary
skills to get hired." A high-octane pedigree
isn't enough anymore, says Shulman, because companies are searching for the
absolutely best person to fill a slot. And
sometimes, that person might be a foreign
national, he notes (see page 58).</P>
<P>Unlike most of its industrial counterparts, P&amp;G
will be actively recruiting on
campus for B.S. chemists in addition to hiring graduates from the company's
co-op
pool. "P&amp;G will be doing a lot of scale-up
this year," says Scott A. Read, manager of
research associate recruiting in the U.S."
So we're looking like crazy for people
who have process chemistry backgrounds." Chemical engineers will be
hired at the usual rate, he says, but "we're
turning over rocks" to find the right B.S.
chemists.</P>
<P>Last year, P&amp;G filled 115 research associate
positions with a combination of B.S.
chemists, B.S. biologists, and graduates of
two-year technology programs. The year
before, the company "hired 200, which
was more than [it had] projected." This
year, he says, the goal is 130.</P>
<P>Eastman Chemical currently is assessing its needs,
but expects it may be hiring
fewer people this year than in 1996, says
Manager of Employment Hoyt H. Denton.
The company will be looking for B.S. and
M.S. chemists and chemical engineers, he
says. Information on employment opportunities at Eastman, the universities at
which the company will recruit, and the
preferred way to submit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; are
available on the Internet (http://www.
eastman.com), Denton notes.</P>
<P>Companies are starting to use the Internet to
post jobs and search for r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, says DuPont's Siegel. "And
I think
that is a dynamic change within the job-search market." He advises students to
put their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s on the Internet in several locations, noting
that "there are a lot
of free places to post them." DuPont
posts positions on its home page (http://
www.dupont.com), although "we don't
put all our jobs on there," he notes. The
Internet is an emerging field, he says, and
an increasing number of jobs for scientists are being posted on it.</P>
<P>This year marks Phillips Petroleum's
third year back on campus, after being absent for about two, notes David Blakemo
re,
manager of employment and college relations. "We've hired modestly over
the past three years, but hiring increased
each year. It's a lot more fun when you're
bringing people in," he admits. Phillips
will be recruiting for chemical engineers
at all degree levels and for a few Ph.D.
chemists - probably analytical.</P>
<P>"We've just finished a month of career
fairs on campus, and we noticed a significant increase in the number of employer
s
that were represented," Blakemore says."
If that's any indication that those employers will be back on campus recruiting,
then I think there's a major shift toward an
improved employment situation."</P>
<P>Clorox will be hiring "enough people
to account for attrition and then a couple
of percent more," says Kelly J. Brodbeck,
project leader, home-cleaning product
development. The company expects to
hire five to 10 chemical engineers in
R&amp;D and 10 to 15 in manufacturing, he
says. "But we'll also be hiring five or six
Ph.D. chemists" with expertise in organic synthesis and physical chemistry.</P>
<P>"Independent leadership skills and
the ability to work with others are basic
traits that we look for," he says. "We're
a fairly small company, so everyone
needs to be self-sustaining." The company recruits mainly from universities
in
California, but also from institutions - including Georgia Tech and Cornell - th
at
have alumni working at Clorox.</P>
<P>Hiring picked up a bit at pharmaceutical firms
last year as the dust of downsizing began to settle. This year, by all accounts,
the pharmaceutical job market
will continue to rebound.</P>
<P>"Most of the major pharmaceutical
companies are hiring chemists in a variety of areas and at all levels,"
says David
M. Floyd, vice president of discovery
chemistry at Bristol-Myers Squibb. One
reason is that companies are continuing
to supplement their efforts in medicinal
chemistry as a way to increase the number of candidates for drug development,
he explains. He believes many of the big
firms will have positions opening up in
process and development this year. "As
in the past, Bristol-Myers Squibb will
have a major presence on campus this
year," he says. The company plans to
add "significant numbers" of Ph.D., M.S.,
and B.S. chemists.</p>
<P>A background in synthetic organic
chemistry is critically important in drug research, he notes. Advantages include
familiarity with computing, automation, and
other areas that are assets in the drug discovery process, he says.</P>
<P>"In terms of cyclical employment for
the pharmaceutical business, I think we're
back in an upswing," says Alan J. Main, senior vice president of research
at Ciba
Pharmaceutical, Summit, N.J. "Many companies actually are hiring a lot
of sales reps
again - they were laying them off a couple
of years ago."</P>
P>Ciba, which is in the process of merging with
Sandoz, will delay hiring until"
everything settles down," he says. Novartis, the company that will result
from the
merger, "will be the number two [pharmaceutical] company in
the world," and
its second largest research center will be
in Summit, Main notes. Novartis, which
Main explains is Latin for "new arts," expresses "our philosophy
for the application of new technology to the biomedical
sciences," he says.</P>
<P>Main believes the market is robust for
Ph.D.s who have strong backgrounds in
chemistry, especially in synthetic organic
or organic chemistry, but who also are
competent in areas such as molecular
modeling or molecular biology. "Everything in the pharmaceutical industry is
done in interdisciplinary teams now," he
points out. "Which doesn't mean that everyone is doing everything. It
means that
everyone brings a bit of expertise to the
team but understands everyone else's science." So chemists need to be
able to talk
about cloning, for example, although they
don't need to be experts in it, he explains.</P>
<P>Technological areas he projects will
grow include X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, combinatorial
chemistry, "and the whole area of automation and robotics." People
with unusual combinations of expertise will be
in demand, he says - people who understand chemistry structures and can
program a robot and do an analysis.</P>
<P>"People should be looking to us for
jobs," says Edward M. Scolnick, president
of Merck Research Laboratories, West
Point, Pa. "We'll be hiring chemists, chemical engineers, biochemical
engineers-
all the disciplines that a drug firm is interested in." The company probably
will
hire more people than it did last year, he
predicts.</P>
<P>Lilly Research Labs and Glaxo Wellcome
also will be hiring this year. Lilly is "opening
up in life sciences, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and statis
tics,"
but
not in chemistry, says
Ph.D. recruiter Joerg
Pfeifer. "Although we
have recruited on campus for organic chemists this year, we have
also delivered the message that our hiring is
tight. But, we're always
looking for outstanding
talent. If we find someone we want to make
an offer to, we will do
what it takes."</P>
<P>Glaxo's U.S.-based
facility at Research Triangle Park, N.C., is set
to hire B.S. and M.S.
chemists - for research
associate positions - and Ph.D.s in organic
chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry, says Corporate Communications Associa
te
William Chapman. Hiring will be up
from last year, he says.</P>
<P>This year's on-campus recruiting at
the University of Colorado, Boulder, is an
indication of the upturn in pharmaceutical hiring. "Four years ago, we
had 18
recruiters interviewing graduate students," says John W. Birks, chairman
of
the university's chemistry and biochemistry department. "Three years ago,
this
dropped to zero. Last year, we had four;
and this year, eight. All of the recruiters
this year represented pharmaceutical
companies, and they primarily interviewed synthetic organic chemists."</P>
<P>At biotechnology companies, R&amp;D
hiring continues to move along, with
some companies adding positions in marketing and sales.</P>
<P>Gilead Sciences, a biotechnology/
drug discovery firm in Foster City, Calif.,
is one example. The company brought
its first product to market this year (a formulation for treating a type of
retinitis),
says Human Resources Assistant Irene H.
Thomas, so it will "be looking for people
with technical backgrounds" to fill sales
and marketing slots.</P>
<P>Gilead is maintaining a 20% annual
growth rate and will be hiring "the usual
across-the-board Ph.D.s," she says, including some in biology, chemistry,
and
toxicology.</P>
<P>"All of our people are finding jobs,"
says Catherine Connor, director of placement for the biotechnology center at
the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
"We have four [Ph.D.s] who would like
to have found jobs by now, but that's not
bad. Times are hard, but they aren't really that hard for those who have done
a
job search. It's a good market." Most
small companies will not recruit on campus, she emphasizes, and that's why peopl
e
really need to do their own search.</P>
<center><img src="C&ENgraph.gif"></center><br><br>
<P>Analytical testing labs traditionally
need B.S. chemists to carry out analyses
and develop new methodologies. "From
what I'm hearing and reading, there are
more B.S. chemists available this year
than [there are] positions," says Carol D.
Hess, executive vice president for Lancaster Laboratories, Lancaster, Pa. "But
I
can't say that we're seeing a glut in the
marketplace. Someone who comes out
of school with a strong grade-point average is not going to have any trouble"
finding a job.</P>
<P>Lancaster Labs, which has 500 employees, "recruits
actively year round," says
Hess. "If we find a good candidate and we
don't have the right position available,
we'll keep them informed when a position
opens up. The environmental part of our
business generally slows down in winter because of the weather in the Northeast.
So
we won't do a lot of hiring until spring."
Lancaster Labs posts its positions on the Internet (http://www.lancasterlabs.com
).
"We're getting r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that way, and that's
working very well," she says.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>Academic hiring</H3></font>
<P>A spot-check of universities around
the country suggests faculty positions are
becoming more available as long-awaited
retirements become a reality.</P>
<P>"If the activity at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is an indicator
of trends," says chemistry department
chairman Edward T. Samulski, "then the
situation for academic job
openings is very dynamic."
Five chemistry faculty members at Chapel Hill retired
in June, he notes, and the
department has been authorized to search for three
replacements this year, "at
a time when there is a general hiring freeze within the
college."</P>
<P>Prospective candidates
will be expected to have interdisciplinary training. The
department is looking for
organic, physical, and analytical chemists who can"
bridge disciplines" with
molecular biology, materials science, and macromolecular chemistry, because"
this is where curricula and
funding seem to be going,"
says Samulski.</P>
<P>An early retirement package offered last year
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has opened up more
than the usual number of
positions, says chemistry department chairman Stephen J. Lippard. MIT is looking
for
the best people in any area, but has "specific needs in theoretical chemistry,
organic chemistry, and inorganic chemistry."
The school hopes to make several appointments this year.</P>
<P>Early retirement incentives offered between 1991
and 1993 at the University of
California system schools resulted in a
fairly constant pattern of hiring during
the past five years, says John C. Hemminger, a chemistry professor at UC Irvine.
Between 1993 and 1996, his department hired five assistant professors
and two full professors - in organic,
physical, inorganic, and atmospheric
chemistry. This year, he says, the department is planning to hire an atmospheric
chemist and a physical chemist.</P>
<P>The University of California, Los Angeles, hired
three junior faculty members last
year - a biochemist and two physical
chemists - and searched unsuccessfully
for an inorganic chemist, says the chairman of the chemistry and biochemistry
department, Charles M. Knobler. "We
hope to make two senior appointments in
organic chemistry this year, and we will
probably be looking for a biochemist next
year," he says. And the search for an inorganic chemist continues. However,
all of
this hiring will not give the department
the number of faculty members it had before the UC system offered its retirement
incentives, Knobler notes.</P>
<center><img src="bsgraph.gif"></center>
<P>The list of chemistry departments with
faculty openings goes on. A sampling:
Duke University, Durham, N.C., is looking
for two junior and two senior faculty
members in chemistry, the latter to fill endowed chairs, says Steven W. Baldwin
department chairman. Michigan State University, Lansing, has five faculty openin
gs
in
chemistry and "has been authorized to fill
all of them," says chemistry professor Harry A. Fick. Wayne State University,
Detroit,
also has five chemistry positions to fill and
will be recruiting "every year for the next
few years," says department chairman
Richard L. Lintvedt. The State University of
New York, Stony Brook, is looking "for
people in bioorganic [chemistry], materials [science], and
physical chemistry" to
fill three positions over the next three
years, says William le Noble, chemistry department chairman.</P>
<P>Harvard University has openings in organic, inorganic,
and physical chemistry,
according to the chemistry department
chairman, David A. Evans.</P>
<P>Johns Hopkins University is looking for a
junior faculty member in physical chemistry
and a senior faculty member in organic
chemistry, notes Paul J. Dagdigian, a chemistry professor there. And Colorado
State
University, Fort Collins, will be looking to
fill a new faculty position in polymer
chemistry, says the chemistry department chairman,
Oren P. Anderson.</P>
<P>"Last year we didn't
search," says Anderson,"
but only because we needed a breather from the terrific strain of putting togeth
er
start-up financial packages" - for the 11 faculty
members the department
hired in the six preceding
years.</P>
<P>And, there's the academic rub. Start-up packages
for
new faculty members can
run from $250,000 to
$500,000 - or more, notes
Duke's Baldwin. Hiring
stakes have become so high
and tenure expectations so
severe that schools are looking for the "sure thing," he
says. Most searches generate
100 to 200 candidates, he
explains, but "interviews
globally tend to focus on the
same subset of five to 10'
outstanding' candidates."
Hence, the repetitive searches, he says.</P>
<P>"With the severe competition for federal
funds, young faculty are generally not tapping into the funding stream until
several
years into their appointments," says Harvard's Evans. "As a consequence,
start-up
funds provided by universities must carry
these individuals for a longer time than was
experienced a decade ago. This situation
naturally breeds a high level of conservatism
in the appointments process. Everyone
wants to hire the 'sure bet.'"</P>
<P>SUNY's le Noble puts it more succinctly:"
We want people with proven grant-getting
abilities," he says. "Three positions are all
we can [recruit for], even though we lost
seven people in the past few years."</P>
<P>Permission to search is no longer trivial
to obtain from one's institution, notes a
chemistry professor who asked that his
name not be used. Among the obstacles,
he notes, are decisions about areas in
which to hire, a debate that "may tax the
collegiality of departments, especially if
searches are hard to come by"; space; and
an ample supply of qualified grad students.</P>
<P>But, "the limiting factor in making appointments
is not vacant positions but setup funds," says UCLA's Knobler. "In a
time when university budgets are still constricted, it is hard to come up with
this
sort of money. And the problem is exacerbated by the increasing difficulty that
young faculty have in obtaining grants."

<center><h2><font color="8B2252"><i>Statistics from ACS survey show no upturn
for new graduates' pay and jobs</i></font></h2></center>
<H3>Michael Heylin, C&amp;EN Washington</H3></p>
<P>There are apparently some anecdotal
signs of an incipient upturn in the
long-depressed state of the job market for chemical professionals, especially
chemists. But any such improvement does
not show up in the latest American Chemical Society annual survey of the salaries
and employment situation for newly graduated chemists and chemical engineers.</P>
<P>According to preliminary data from the
survey - covering chemists and chemical
engineers who graduated between July
1995 and June 1996 - median starting salaries for inexperienced chemistry
graduates continue on the somewhat bumpy
plateaus they have been on since 1991,
with a generally downward bounce this
year. Inexperienced is defined as having
less than one year of technical work experience prior to graduation.</P>
<P>Chemical engineers with bachelor's and
master's degrees continue to post some
starting salary gains, but those gains are not
big. And the median starting salary for inexperienced Ph.D. chemical engineering
graduates is actually down a little this year
from last.</P>
<P>The median base salary for all bachelor-level
chemists responding to the survey
who have nailed down full-time jobs is
$26,000. For M.S. chemists, it is $36,500,
and for Ph.D.s, $46,900. The corresponding
salaries for chemical engineers are $42,000,
$44,900, and $58,900, respectively.</P>
<P>Judging by responses to the survey received so
far, the employment situation
remains particularly challenging for
chemists. The percentage of new B.S.
chemists who were still seeking either
fellowships or full-time employment at
the time of the survey was 22%. This is a
historically high level. Some of those in
this 22% have either temporary or part-time jobs.</P>
<P>The employment situation is less depressed for
chemists with advanced degrees but still not satisfactory - an unusually
high proportion of Ph.D.s are in postdoctoral positions. As has been the case
for some years, the job situation for chemical engineers remains considerably
stronger than for chemists at all degree levels.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>The survey</H3></font>
<P>This annual ACS survey is conducted
by the society's Department of Career Services under the general direction of
the
Committee on Economic &amp; Professional
Affairs. It is based on a questionnaire
mailed to newly graduated chemists and
chemical engineers who reside in the U.S.
Names and addresses of the graduates are
provided by chemistry departments approved by the ACS Committee on Professional
Training and by chemical engineering departments approved by the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers and
the Engineer's Council for Professional
Development.</P>
<P>This year, questionnaires were mailed
to 10,351 chemists and chemical engineers in August. This article is based on
the first 3,015 responses - 2,283 chemists
and 732 chemical engineers. When the
survey is finally closed next month, after
several mail reminders, responses are expected to total well over 5,000.</P>
<P>Complete results will be published by
the Department of Career Services later
this year as "Starting Salaries 1996." It will
be available at $29.95 per copy from the
American Chemical Society, Member Service Center, P.O. Box 9389, Minneapolis,
Minn. 55440-9389; phone (800) 451-9190.</P>
<P>Comments and questions about the
data should be directed to Mary W. Jordan at (202) 872-4433. She conducted
the survey and is senior research analyst
at ACS's Department of Career Services
in Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>An annual survey of this type, dependent on voluntary
responses, cannot
yield precise data on the entire chemistry
and chemical engineering graduating
classes. The rate of response, expected
to be more than 50% when all returns
are in, is reasonably high. But the question of possible biases from differences
in the situations of those who respond
and those who don't cannot be fully resolved. For instance, are new graduates
who have full-time positions more likely
to respond than those who don't?</P>
<P>However, the survey provides at least
a useful comparative indication of the
salary and employment situation for
those just starting out in the chemical
and chemical engineering professions. In
addition, as the survey is done essentially
the same way each time, it identifies significant trends and year-to-year changes.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>Starting salaries</H3></font>
<P>Analyzing and comparing salaries and
salary trends for new chemistry and
chemical engineering graduates is a
tricky business. Care has to be taken to
avoid comparing apples and oranges.</P>

<P>Medians are used to avoid the distortions
that a few very high or very low salaries
can bring to a mean. The median salary of
the group is the salary that is equaled or
exceeded by one-half of the group.</P>
<P>Both individual starting salaries and
salary medians vary sharply with a number of factors. Salaries themselves are
related to degree level, amount of work experience prior to graduation, nature
of
employer, and nature of work. And random year-to-year changes in the composition
of the sample responding can drastically affect medians. This is especially
true for relatively small subsets, such as
inexperienced M.S. chemists who are
male.</P>
<P>The median salary of all inexperienced
bachelor's chemists with full-time jobs responding to the 1996 survey is $25,000.
For bachelor-level chemical engineers, it is
$42,000. At the advanced degree levels,
the chemist-chemical engineer differential
is smaller. It is $31,100 compared with
$45,000 for master's, and $45,600 compared with $57,800 for Ph.D.s.</P>
<P>Some of these differences are due to
the employment profiles of the two
groups. About 90% of the chemical engineers' jobs, but only about 65% of the
chemists' jobs, are in relatively higher
paying industry. The impact of this difference is apparent in the median salaries
for master's and doctoral chemists.</P>
<P>When the samples are narrowed to the
salaries of inexperienced chemists and
chemical engineers working for industry,
the salary differences between the two
groups become smaller. At the Ph.D. level,
the median is $54,500 for chemists and
$58,400 for chemical engineers, and it is
$37,000 compared with $45,000 for master's. However, the big salary advantage
for chemical engineers persists at the B.S.
level - $26,000 for industrially employed
chemistry graduates, $42,000 for chemical
engineering graduates.</P>
<center><img src="shiftgraph.gif"></center>
<P>Variations in the profile of those responding
to the ACS survey over the
years have produced some sharp ups and
downs in starting salary medians. But it is
apparent that there has been little overall
progress for chemists in the 1990s.</P>
<P>For instance, this year's median salary
for inexperienced doctoral graduates of
$45,600 is up only 4% from $44,000 in
1990. For M.S. chemists, there has been
especially wide year-to-year variation during this five-year period. But the
median
for this year, $31,100, is also up only 4%
from the 1990 level. Salaries for B.S.
chemists have shown steadier, if modest,
growth over the period - from $23,000
in 1990 to $25,000 this year. All of these
comparisons indicate substantial constant-dollar reductions in the compensation
for new chemical professionals.</P>
<P>The amount of technical work experience prior
to graduation has a marked impact on the starting salaries for bachelor's
and master's chemists. For B.S. chemists,
the median is $25,000 for those with less
than a year of such experience and
$33,300 for those with more than three
years. For M.S. chemists, the
gap is even larger: $31,100
compared with $40,000. For
doctoral chemists and for
chemical engineers at all levels, the impact of prior work
experience is smaller.</P>
<P>As has been the case for
many years, gender is not a
factor in starting salaries in
the chemical profession. The
tiny differences that show up
in the salary medians are not
statistically significant.</P>
<P>Grade-point average is a
factor in the salaries of inexperienced
bachelor-level chemical engineering
graduates. But it apparently isn't for new
B.S. chemists. Chemical engineers with a
grade-point average of A enjoy a $43,000
median. This is $5,000 higher than for
those with a grade-point average of C. For
chemists with A, B, and C grades, the medians are $25,000, $25,000, and $25,800,
respectively.</P>
<P>Another significant difference between
chemistry and chemical engineering graduates is the size of the institutions
they
work for. Of full-time employed chemists
responding this year, 45% found their jobs
with institutions that employ fewer than
500 people and only 17% with large institutions that have 25,000 or more employees.
For chemical engineers, it is almost
the reverse, with 16% finding jobs in the
fewer than 500 employees category and
35% with the 25,000 or more group.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>Employment status</H3></font>
<P>New graduates are, by definition, in a
transition phase in their careers. This
makes it difficult to come up with one
measurement that accurately summarizes
the complex employment situation for an
entire class of graduates. Chemistry and
chemical engineering graduates can be
starting in full-time jobs in industry or elsewhere; accepting full-time
fellowships or postdoc positions; continuing their
education full time without such support; working in temporary or part-time
positions, often because of inability to find
full-time jobs; or still looking for any employment
at the time of the survey.</P>
<center><img src="manygraph.gif"></center>
<P>The questionnaire
asked respondents to
identify if they have full-time employment; have
accepted an assistantship,
fellowship, or postdoc position; have a
part-time job; have a temporary job; or are
unemployed. Answers to this question put
21% of B.S. chemists and 11% of B.S.
chemical engineers into the unemployed
category. For those with M.S. degrees, the
corresponding numbers are 10% and 5%,
and for Ph.D.s they are 7% and 4%.</P>
<center><img src="gender.gif"></center>
<P>These unemployment numbers are
misleading, especially at the bachelor's level, because they include among the
unemployed those who are continuing their education without the benefit of assistantships
or fellowships - mostly in medicine,
law, and other nonchemical fields.</P>
<P>Responses to this question indicate
that 32% of B.S. chemistry graduates and
70% of B.S. chemical engineering graduates have found full-time employment,
and that 28% and 11%, respectively, have
fellowships. At the doctoral level, 45% of
chemistry graduates and 73% of chemical
engineering graduates have full-time jobs
and 44% and 18%, respectively, are in
postdoc positions.</P>
<P>Another measure of unemployment
among brand-new graduates is the percentage of those seeking full-time jobs
or
fellowship/postdoc positions as a percentage of the total of those with such
employment or positions plus those seeking
them.</P>
<center><img src="pregrad.gif"></center>
<P>This year, this number is
22% for B.S. chemists, up
from 19% last year, and a
new high. In times of strong
employment, this measure
hovers near the 10% level.
For B.S. chemical engineers,
it is 16% this year. For M.S.
and Ph.D. chemists, it is 17%
and 10%, respectively. And
for M.S. and Ph.D. chemical
engineers, it is 5% and 9%,
respectively.</P>
<P>Although this measure
gives the most consistent
comparative data on year-to-year trends in
the employment status for new chemical
professionals, it, too, does not accurately
measure actual unemployment because it
includes as unemployed many who at least
have temporary or part-time positions.</P>
<font color="red"><H3>Demographics</H3></font>
<P>Comparison of respondents to this
year's survey and to the survey in 1986
bring out the magnitude of changes in
the demographics of those entering the
chemical profession.</P>
<P>For instance, this year 36% of new
doctoral chemistry graduates are women. This percentage is up from 18% in
1986. The change reflects the growth in
the number of bachelor-level chemistry
graduates who are women that has been
well under way for some years - from
39% of the class in 1986 to 48% this year.</P>
<P>In chemical engineering, the gender
change is less marked over this period.
The percentage of bachelor-level women
graduates has grown from 27% to 38%
this year, but at the doctoral level, it has
dipped a notch, from 18% to 17%.</P>
<P>However, chemical engineering classes have changed
more in terms of citizenship status and of racial and ethnic
breakdown. This is partially due to a
large number of students from Asia.</P>
<P>This year, 51% of
doctoral chemical engineering graduates are
not U.S. citizens, up from
32% in 1986. For new
doctoral chemists, this
growth has been from
15% to 35%.</P>
<P>Racial minority representation in chemistry and
chemical engineering has
grown at the bachelor's
level. Again, the growth is
substantially due to an influx of Asians, this time
Asian-Americans.

<h2><font color="8B2252"><i>It has disrupted the lives of chemists and
changed the face of employment, but it
often can lead to new opportunities</I></font></h2></center>
<H3>Elisabeth Kirschner, C&ampEN Northeast News Bureau</H3>
<P>"It was a horrible time and it
was a
wonderful time," says Donald Upson, of his 1994 layoff from Sterling
Winthrop. Upson was one of hundreds
who lost jobs when Eastman Kodak
backed out of its fledgling pharmaceutical business, selling Sterling Winthrop
to
Elf Sanofi.</P>
<P>"Everybody panicked, but we pulled
together and supported each other. It
was the old story of synergies and efficiencies," Upson explains. When
the
sale was announced, everyone knew the
end was near, he says. Sanofi didn't want
the people or the buildings, but did want
the value of the existing products and
some of those in the pipeline. Upson
was one of the lucky ones. He's now
vice president of operations at Molecular
Probes, Eugene, Ore.</P>
<P>Over the past five years, downsizing
has wiped out hundreds of thousands of
jobs, disrupted the lives of employees,
and changed the face of employment.
Chemists have not been spared. Globalization, consolidation, computerization,
and divestment have resulted in dramatic
changes in employment.</P>
<P>Many of the chemical companies that
diversified in the 1980s to buffer their
cyclical businesses were not able to manage their new businesses effectively.
Now, after a rash of divestitures in the
early 1990s, many chemical companies
focus on core competencies, with fewer
employees. Pharmaceutical companies,
merging to weather the changes in the
health care system, make jobs redundant
during the consolidations. Computerization and reengineering have further supplanted
people. And some companies
look to job cuts to improve productivity
and stock prices.</P>
<P>DuPont cited "improvements in fundamental
business processes and practices" in its announcement earlier this year
that it would cut 1,500 jobs in its nylon
and polyester units, about 8% of the unit
workforce (C&amp;EN, March 4, page 9). The
cuts come on the heels of a multiyear,
$2 billion reorganization that cost at
least 5,800 jobs. Mobil Chemical planned
to eliminate 2,300 jobs in a 1994 restructuring, blaming lower earnings and
excess capacity. Not all of the cuts resulted
in layoffs, says a company spokesman,
since some of the employees shifted to
the new owners when businesses or
plants were sold.</P>
<P>The merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz is
expected to result in a reduction of about
10,000 in the new company's worldwide
workforce (C&amp;EN, April 8, page 13). The
jobs eliminated are expected to be administrative positions and from overlapping
manufacturing operations, with few cuts
planned for R&amp;D. These are some of the
big restructurings, but many chemists
say their companies "keep under the radar" of publicity by cutting
small groups
at a time without fanfare.</P>
<center><img src="agegraph.gif"></center>
<P>Some consultants say the worst cuts
are over. A survey by Right Associates, a
career management consulting company
located in Philadelphia, found that nearly
half of the 78 companies it surveyed in the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector expect continuing - though smaller - layoffs
within the next 18 months. And at the
same time jobs are cut at large companies,
there has been growth in some smaller
companies and at consulting firms, and
even strategic hiring within companies announcing huge layoffs.</P>
<P>In preparing this article, C&amp;EN sought
out chemists who had lost their jobs to
talk about their experiences. Not surprisingly, few chemists who lost their
jobs
were willing to be identified in C&amp;EN,
even if they had landed new positions.
Some who spoke with C&amp;EN said former
colleagues who had been downsized
would rather not be interviewed at all.
They did not want to sound bitter or depressed, alienate old colleagues or new
or potential employers, or jeopardize ongoing litigation. Age discrimination
was
frequently suspected among chemists
who lost their jobs.</P>
<P>Many chemical companies contacted
by C&amp;EN were even less forthcoming.
Some refused to comment on downsizing
questions at all. Others did not respond to
repeated requests for information.</P>
<hr noshade>
<A HREF="sidedown.html"><h3>TO SIDEBAR: One chemists's story of downsizing</h3>
</A>
<hr noshade>
<P>Whether called downsizing, right sizing, or layoffs - whether
spurred by attempts to shore up stock prices, company mergers, plant closings,
or reengineering efficiencies - massive
job losses have shaken up
the chemical industry. Reengineering and downsizing have been creating a
new workplace, a new
workforce, and a new attitude toward employment.
While the cost cutting has
benefited the bottom line
of some companies, it has
wreaked havoc on job security, morale, and chemists' lives.</P>
<P>"The first day I was in a
fog," says one downsized
chemist who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The
next day I got angry. I was
thinking about suing." The
group downsized by his employer suspected the cuts
were based on age, but "there was nothing you could
sink your teeth into," he
says. "The third day, I realized I would
have to make job hunting a full-time occupation, and that I wanted a better
job."
Luckily, he says, the company provided
career counseling to get him through
those three days. "It was a catharsis," he
says. "We could get the venom out early."</P>
<P>Within a month, he found a new job
that had the atmosphere his previous job
had lost years ago. "Friends have told me
I look tranquil. Like a weight's been taken off my shoulders. Thank God [the
layoff] did happen. They did me a favor."</P>
<P>In the end, he says, "I don't know
whether it was better for the people who
were laid off or for the ones who remain
at the old job. They don't have enough
manpower. It's a hellhole." Some of his
fellow downsized colleagues are double-
dipping at the old company, he says. They
receive retirement benefits and are back
on the payroll as consultants. But there are
others he has lost track of, who may not
have fared as well.</P>
<P>Another chemist who moved up to a
better job after being downsized says
some former colleagues could only find
temporary or part-time work for a few
years before finding full-time employment. Coworkers who did not want to
move to a different part of the country
had a more difficult time finding new positions, he adds. Still others "panicked"
after a layoff, grabbing a job offer made
the very next day, but switching again
within the year.</P>
<P>Another chemist who was caught up
in a downsizing more than a decade ago
says the dramatic cuts have changed the
way people look at their work and its
loss. Back then, the downsized and the
public were shocked at the news, she
says. Now, with downsizing so common,
it takes something like the 40,000 cuts
announced by AT&amp;T in January to surprise the public.</P>
<P>Despite knowing that layoffs were
coming, most chemists say they were
shocked when told they were the ones to
lose their jobs. Years ago, workers knew
that "if they continued to work, kept their
noses clean, everything would be fine,"
says Valerie J. Kuck, American Chemical
Society councilor for the North Jersey Section and a scientist at Lucent Technologies'
Bell Laboratories. Now, "you can do
all the right things and you can be out."
When she and other members of the ACS
North Jersey Section met with laid-off
chemists a few years ago, says Kuck, a
group of about two dozen men showed
up. One had won a performance award
from his employer early in the year, only
to be dismissed in a layoff. "All of them
looked exhausted.</P>
<P>"The stigma is all gone because so
many people have been affected," says
Kuck. "A layoff is no reflection on what
you do or how you do your job. People
who thought they were doing well were
canned. Things have changed."</P>
<P>Indeed, says Nancy Blum, Right Associates career
management consultant,"
99% of the time [when people are laid
off] it has nothing to do with them, it's
just the slot they sat in." Ironically, sometimes the skills that an employee
has get
him or her transferred or promoted to a
less secure job that gets cut. Companies
are "cutting costs at the higher end, eliminating the most costly positions,"
says
Blum. "They're looking at numbers, not
particular employees."</P>
<center><img src="companies.gif"></center>
<P>But job loss, no matter what the
cause, remains a blow to self-esteem. The
time between jobs is so difficult "because of that uncertainty,"
says a downsized chemist who has moved on. "Before 
you get your next job, it's like jumping in a pool of ice water. You say to
yourself, 'Let's get it over. Let's just do
it.' Perhaps you have to jump in 15
times. Just get it over with. Sometimes it
takes 50 times."</P>
<P>"Everyone is likely to go through
downsizing. The job-for-life security is
gone," says Paul J. Forti of PJF Associates in East Hanover, N.J. Formerly
with
Right Associates, Forti works with people who have experienced downsizing."
Some go through shock, mourning, anger, and depression before they come to
terms with it."</P>
<P>The most important thing is to "get
out of their own way: They have the perception that the market is difficult.
They
have to get over their defeatist attitude,"
he says. If they have six to eight months'
severance pay to take care of the financial concerns, it's easier to deal with
the
other stresses of job loss and find a new
job, he says. Marriages that are already
strained can be pushed to the breaking
point, although some troubled couples
become closer when facing the crisis of
a downsizing.</P>
<P>If you have a good skills set, and network, you
will get a good job, says Forti.
Chemical engineers who don't have
good people skills, or whose research
skills are not honed, will have a harder
time. He says about 15 to 20% of his clients don't recoup the salary and position
they lost in the downsizing. "Forty percent do manage some level of success" - a
similar job, though perhaps with an unwanted move. "But 30 to 40% make
the
home run, get a better job, a promotion,
more money."</P>
<hr noshade>
<A HREF="side2down.html"><h3>TO SIDEBAR: Networks, counseling can help with job hunting after a downsizing</h3></A>
<hr noshade>
<P>After the Sterling Winthrop layoff, says
Upson, chemists with bachelor's and master's degrees were quickly snatched up
by
other companies. They're "always a hot
property, some with five, six, or seven job
offers to choose from. The young Ph.D.s
were from the finest schools; they did just
fine." Non-native-born chemists "needed
more help" and networking assistance, he
says. But "it was the middle-level group
leaders - the ones with three to six people
reporting to them - that were even more
of a challenge." The rest of industry was
already retrenching, often eliminating that
rung in the corporate ladder.</P>
<P>Suspicions of age discrimination in layoffs are
magnified by the greater difficulty
that older workers have in getting rehired.
Whether due to their more senior positions and greater financial needs in a
new
job, being set in their ways, or subtle or
not-so-subtle discrimination, older employees "have just one devil of
a time" landing
a new position, says Kuck. They often are
told they are overqualified.</P>
<P>"The vulnerability is down to 40
now," Kuck says. "I see more and more
people in their early 50s retiring." Most
of the older chemists she met had become consultants, where experience is a
benefit (see page 55).</P>
<P>Upson says Eastman Kodak "dealt with
us superbly well. From the announcement of the sale of Sterling Winthrop, we
knew we were about to lose jobs, but
we had five to six months of time in
which we were paid, and had access to
the library, phone, and fax." About 500
people lost their jobs during the merger,
he says, and many more have since then.
Only 10% of his former colleagues ended
up on the transition team and in successor companies.</P>
<P>The employees had just been relocated in the
spring of 1993 from Albany and
Rochester, N.Y., to new state-of-the-art
facilities in the Philadelphia area. Thirteen months later, the company was
up
for sale and the jobs were on the line. "A
move can be traumatic, and some spouses gave up their jobs on the faith that
Eastman's pharmaceuticals were a cornerstone of the corporation," says
Upson. "A lot of people really felt betrayed
and angry."</P>
<P>Upson says he and others realized that Eastman
had no choice
but to sell to Sanofi and that
Sanofi had no choice but to cut
the positions. "As a stockholder,
I applaud what [Eastman] did.
Selling off to Elf Sanofi was a
good business decision," Upson
says. Given the situation at the
company, he adds, "I might have
made the same decision. Eastman
was trapped in a pharmaceutical
operation that it had to shed."</P>
<P>Many chemists C&amp;EN spoke
with said they understood the
need for downsizing at their company and had mixed feelings
about the layoffs. But some didn't
see the need: The cuts "were just
to keep the stockholders happy,"
says one chemist, "but we're stockholders, too."</P>
<P>For many people, Forti says, a downsizing is
a turning point: They ask, "What
do I want to do until I die?" and realize
that their old job was not the answer
anyway.</P>
<P>David Liebeskind - who took an early
retirement from his Union Carbide post
as director of health, safety, and environmental affairs - found downsizing
a"
golden opportunity to move into teaching." He now teaches at New York
University's Stern School of Business and is a
principal with the management consulting firm Business Improvement Associates.
In those capacities, he studies reengineering and how it can go terribly
wrong.</P>
<P>"Reengineering is elimination of work,
not of people," he says, and many companies have eliminated people without
first
cutting out unnecessary work. "In the
long run, they put the work on other people. Then they have to bring in consultants
and temps. Many companies don't do it
right." He says Union Carbide succeeded,
because management had the "guts" to
change the way it did business.</P>
<P>Liebeskind maintains that 60 to 70%
of those companies that reengineered
aren't seeing good results. "A year, two
years down the road, they wake up and
find they solved nothing. Society is getting extremely ticked off with what's
happening to very talented people.
Unions, politicians make corporations rethink downsizing," says Liebeskind.
"A
number of companies that were planning to go down this road didn't."</P>
<center><img src="fell.gif"></center>
<P>Instead of downsizing, progressive
companies are looking for new customers,
says David L. Witte, chairman and chief
executive officer of Ward Howell International, a New York City-based executive
search firm. "They take people and reutilize them in other capacities,"
he says,
whether in expanding businesses around
the world or answering different needs.
Companies that downsized "perhaps
didn't look at their human resources as a
critical asset. They didn't know how to redeploy or retool. They used the 1950s'
approach and cut the head count. That's the
easy way out. Many cut back too far; they
don't have 38 to 46 year olds with global
management experience anymore. They
cut too deep. They don't have the high
level of talent they once had [to take advantage of the global growth]."</P>
<P>Growth is the name of the game now,
says Roger Kellett, vice president and
head of the North America chemicals
practice at Gemini Consulting, a management consulting firm in Morristown, N.J.
The U.S. chemicals industry has "finished the bulk of downsizing and restructuring,"
he says. "We're left with organizations that are highly focused on their
core businesses." Some of these companies are ready for new applications
and
new processes. And they are ready to
build.</P>
<P>In 1992, "80% of our business was in
reengineering," Kellett explains. "In
1995 and 1996, 70% of our business is in
growth-oriented strategies and people issues." He says many companies
are now
seeking help in cleaning up the mess of
a poor restructuring. "The good news is
they weren't our restructuring clients,"
Kellett adds.</P>
<P>"The best thing in the chemical industry
is that the up cycle has given
companies time to get creative
about how they focus people,"
says Kellett. "There's no urgency.
There's a lot of effort in 'reskilling.'</P>
<P>"In companies where restructuring was properly
done, [job
cuts] were based on needs. In another set of cases, jobs went
away, then came back in the form
of contractors, vendors, and consultants. In essence, the companies [made
their costs variable].
Then, those costs were cut as they
got smarter and better at taking
the work out. In the third case,
companies brought employees
back and didn't know what to do
with them.</P>
<P>"A whole lot of companies
made the mistake of taking people
out under the reengineering definition. That's okay as long as the work
goes away, but sometimes it ends up with
employees thinking 'My colleagues are
gone, but all the work is still here.' That
leads to low morale and stress."</P>
<P>Often, further cuts are expected, creating more
stress in the workplace and
lower productivity. Some downsized
chemists say cuts were made in small
groups, leaving the remaining employees"
in limbo."</P>
<P>"Some of the people who were left
feel guilty," says Kuck. "People they respected were axed."
Others have to deal
with threats: One chemist said his company evacuated its buildings multiple
times this summer in response to bomb
threats rumored to have come from a
former employee.</P>
<P>The "churn" in employment as restructuring
opens new jobs as others are
closed forces chemists to reassess their
skills and rethink their futures, while
companies reassess their needs. Indeed,
even DuPont, with its thousands of layoffs, has a "modest" hiring
program, and
is looking for Ph.D. and B.S. chemists."
We're reviewing our needs list," says a
spokesman.</P>
<P>When employees experience or witness downsizing,
they "keep their options open," says Forti. They look for
what they can get from the company."
Their morale, their trust of the corporation significantly decreases, sometimes
it's never the same and employees become 'optimistically pessimistic.'
They
remain loyal to an individual but never
trust the folks one level above the boss."</P>
<P>And the new employer is, for many
downsized employees, the old employer. After a wrenching blow to their morale,
they are offered positions in a different division, a different business, a
different location, or through a consulting
arrangement.</P>
<P>For one chemist rehired by his former
employer, resentment simmers despite
the reprieve from unemployment. After a
wrenching downsizing, he says, "you
just don't get those warm fuzzy feelings"
anymore.</P>
<P>"Worker backlash" might haunt downsized
companies that saw quick productivity improvements, warns Steven S. Roach,
chief economist for Morgan Stanley, a
New York City-based investment banking
firm. Workers who take up the slack are
not being paid more for their improved
productivity - the savings go to shareholders - but that may change
in union bargaining. And, he says, the apparent improvements may not last. "Breakthrough
technology platforms, process reengineering, and new outsourcing strategies
[were
seen as] crucial ingredients of the great
productivity turnaround of the 1990s,"
Roach advised clients in May in a research
report. But "managers may have simply focused on paring the largest chunk
of their
bloated cost structures - worker compensation, which represents 70% of corporate
production expenses."</P>
<P>Indeed, Roach says, "corporate America
may now be too lean. There is really
only one way out: upgrading the quality
of the workforce and recognizing the
need to rebuild."</P>
<P>The backlash already has become evident in politics.
On April 15, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced the"
American Workers Economic Security
Act." Under the act, mergers and acquisitions, which already go through
antitrust
scrutiny, also would be examined for"
the impact on workers and communities." The proposal never made it to
hearings, but may be reintroduced in the
next session of Congress.</P>
<center><img src="stable.gif"></center>
<P>David B. Opton founded Exec-U-Net,
Norwalk, Conn., a membership organization for executives that provides meetings
for networking with other executives, information, and listings of executive-level
job openings. Opton saw his
own job disappear in the cloud of mergers and acquisitions. He had been vice
president of personnel at Sterling Drug
when Eastman Kodak took over in its ill-fated foray into pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P>While creating a database of potential
clients for a consulting business he was
planning to establish, Opton realized the
demand for helping other executives to
network. Opton says 60% of the members of his organization are currently employed,
but use their membership as an
insurance policy - a way to combat the
uncertainties of employment.</P>
<P>"The experience gave people a lot of
confidence they didn't have before it
happened," Upson says of the layoffs at
Sterling Winthrop. "And if it happens
again - 25% of the people downsized
have already changed jobs - they'll be
prepared. The tools that they acquired in
the first downsizing help in the next.
Those of us who have children have
probably benefited from the philosophical aspects: You tell them to build skills,
improve themselves, and be prepared for
their next job. Now they believe you."</P>
<P>Workers should rely on themselves
more, and not the company, says Upson."
Keep building your skills, keep them
current. Loyalty is a thing of the past.
Why be loyal to your company if your
company isn't loyal to you? Don't count
on that loyalty."</P>
<P>Over the years, says James D. Burke,
chairman of ACS's Committee on Economic &amp; Professional Affairs and Rohm
and Haas's manager for technical recruiting and university relations, there
were
layoffs followed by rehires for the ups
and downs of the economy. But in the
more recent restructuring, the lower
numbers are intended to be permanent.
There was rehiring in many companies,
but most companies want new types of
employees. "It's like playing cards,"
Burke explains. "You discard three and
pick up another three."</P>
<P>Many of those downsized are not getting the standard
full-time jobs they once
held, but want to stay in the profession.
Some 27,000 ACS members list themselves as consultants, Burke says, and
numbers are increasing. Employees laid
off in their 40s and 50s have a lot of expertise to offer in consulting services.
But, he warns, "consulting is more demanding than people recognize. They
need knowledge of processes and of
how to get things done. It's not clear that
many people have developed presentation skills and business skills."</P>
<P>Smaller companies are expected to
hire a greater percentage of chemists and
chemical engineers in the future. Lawrence J. Rosen, CEO of Pressure Chemical,
Pittsburgh, says downsizing of his
large customers has meant more business for his smaller company, and more
employment for chemical process operators. "We're trying to add people
as fast
as we can," says Rosen. But usually not
the people laid off from large companies."
We are getting lots of applications, but
there's a misfit. Companies aren't downsizing the people we need. They aren't
laying off the operators." Research
chemists, chemists in analytical labs, and
customer service personnel are rarely
suited to the jobs available at small chemical companies, he says.</P>
<P>"Chemists look at their jobs with less
complacency" than before, says Burke."
Job security has rapidly given way to skill
security. Those who have neglected their
skills or are relying on dated technologies
or products are at great risk. They must
evolve and not expect security from a degree or from past accomplishments. Employment
is changing and will never be
the same," says Burke. For some, "it's
more exciting than ever and they work
harder than ever to stay on top."

<h2><font color="8B2252"><i>Marketing savvy is among crucial skills
for today's 'self-navigators'</I></font></h2></center><br><br>
<H3>William G. Schulz, C&amp;EN Washington</H3>
<P>Time was, the word "consulting"
was
synonymous with "unemployed." In
the change-driven 1990s, however,
independent consulting has become an
increasingly attractive option for today's"
self-navigators" of the job market - highly
motivated people in nearly every field
who thrive on the demand that, as individuals, they assume a much greater share
of
career responsibility.</P>
<P>For everything from education and
training to midcareer advancement, job
satisfaction, financial planning, and retirement, career experts say, people
are
learning that they must cut their own
path. For some people - including chemists and chemical engineers - the
ultimate in career self-direction might be independent consulting.</P>
<P>"Self-reliance is the message we have
subtly been trying to get across," says
Corinne Marasco of the American Chemical Society career services department.
By choice or by circumstance, more and
more chemists realize that the era has
ended when a single employer would
provide for employees until retirement
and beyond. Successful people tend to
take a positive view of the situation, she
says. With change and increased responsibility, the most independent of all - 
those who have ventured into full-time
consulting - welcome the opportunity to
completely control their time, earning
power, and career development.</P>
<P>As many as 27,000 ACS members report being engaged
in some kind of consulting work (C&amp;EN, Feb. 26, page 43).
Anecdotal evidence seems to confirm
the numbers: Demand for workshops
about consulting at ACS regional meetings and other meetings and workshops
has been growing, Marasco says. Seminars on managing independent careers
or small chemical businesses at the ACS
national meeting in Orlando played to
full audiences of professionals at every
stage of their careers.</P>
<P>"Consulting is a growth area," Marasco
says. But it is not for everyone. Experts say it involves specific sets of career
skills and personal traits, such as a
tolerance for uncertainty and disappointment. The rewards can be substantial,
but they come with certain risks and
with definite hazards and downsides.</P>
<P>For people who are thinking about
consulting work as an employment option, Marasco continues, it helps to define
it. She identifies several types: independent consultants who most often
work alone from home, employees of consulting firms, and employees of the "big
six" consulting/accounting firms - Price-Waterhouse, Andersen Consulting,
Ernst&amp;
 Young, KPMG Peat Marwick, Coopers&amp;
 Lybrand, and Deloitte &amp; Touche - that
have begun to fold small science consulting firms into their larger business.</P>
<P>One of the authorities on consulting
of any kind, Herman Holtz, author of"
How to Succeed As An Independent
Consultant" - a popular "how to" as
well as "how not to" guide for anyone
considering consulting - gives a more
general description: "I view consulting
as a way of practicing a profession." A
consultant is a specialist within a profession, writes Holtz. Consulting is
not in itself a profession.</P>
<P>Consultant and Shell Chemical Co. research chemist
John K. Borchardt describes himself as a "generic type" consultant.
Like a majority of chemistry consultants, his is not a full-time business. He
offers his expertise in such areas as career development and job hunting, and
most of his consulting time is now devoted to writing about consulting and other
employment issues for chemists.</P>
<P>Chemists at midcareer or who retire
early with specific areas of expertise - 
product development, environmental
chemistry, and government regulation
are specialties with high demand - have
among the best chances for success as
independent consultants within the
chemical industry, Borchardt says.</P>
<P>But competition is stiff, he cautions.
Even well-known experts who wish to
make themselves available as consultants, he says, cannot ignore the need to
network with potential new customers
and to aggressively market their consulting services.</P>
<P>During the first waves of chemical industry downsizing
in the early 1990s (see
page 50), Borchardt says, many people
thought of consulting as an obvious, and
perhaps the easiest, employment alternative. "They thought people would
beat a
path to their door. But nobody beats a
path to your door these days, even if you
have a better mousetrap.</P>
<P>"Wallflowers don't make it in the consulting
business," Borchardt says emphatically. "You have to be able to
walk
right up to people and introduce yourself." Regular attendance at relevant
professional meetings is vital. And consultants need to be there early. At technical
sessions, he says, consultants should
hang around before and after the meeting to make introductions, chat, and
hand out business cards. "Nowadays,
you have to be a good people person."
In fact, Borchardt and others emphasize,
there is probably only one key to success
for any consultant: marketing.</P>
<P>"Guerilla marketing" is the approach
recommended by Geoffrey E. Dolbear,
consultant and founder of G. E. Dolbear&amp;
 Associates in Diamond Bar, Calif. Consultants should make a list of everyone
they know, he says, call those people
and ask for more names of people who
might use the consultant's services. Ideally, Dolbear says, this process will
generate a list of 200 to 300 names. After calling everyone on the list and
asking about
potential consulting jobs, consultants
should go back to the top of the list and
call everyone again. "You really have to
be good on the phone," he says. "If you
can't - or won't - you won't be good in
consulting."</P>
<P>Dolbear says it's rarely as difficult to
settle people's technical problems as it is
to sell them on consulting services. Industry managers and others don't hire
consultants based on technical knowledge and skills alone, he says. A consultant
often is hired because he or she has
prior acquaintance with the manager."
The element of personal trust" can be a
deciding factor in landing a consulting
contract, Dolbear says.</P>
<P>Some people simply cannot face the
threat of rejection implicit in any marketing effort, or the anxiety provoked
in
talking to people they don't know.
Those people should reconsider independent consulting, Dolbear and others
say, or be willing to pay someone else for
marketing services.</P>
<P>According to Dolbear, consultants fall
into two main income categories: those
who earn about $25,000 per year and
those who earn in excess of $100,000.
Marketing efforts, he says, decide a consultant's fate.</P>
<P>Dolbear says he has a regular routine
of calling semi-cold contacts, and he
keeps an electronic Rolodex of about
400 names of people who are likely business prospects. Both Dolbear and Borchardt
also write for a variety of journals
and other publications, including such
ACS magazines as <I>CHEMTECH </I>and <I>Today's Chemist at Work. </I>Dolbear
publishes his own newsletter, <I>The Freebie, </I>that
covers topics ranging from processing
technology to personal productivity.
Aside from having fun and making new
contacts, both men say these efforts
keep their names in circulation in the
wider chemistry community - an effort
that always makes good business sense.</P>
<P>On the more basic side, self-employed
consultants today enjoy a far easier and
less expensive task in setting up the actual
business, says Borchardt. A desktop computer with fax and e-mail capabilities,
along with a letter-quality printer and basic
office supplies should be enough to get
any consultant started in business.</P>
<P>"My office is a converted spare bedroom,"
Dolbear writes in an account of
the start-up of his consulting business."
My son, then 20 years old, moved out of
the house in early 1989. He helped me
clean out his room and repaint it. I moved
in my books, computer, and desk, and
bought some file cabinets. I have made
several improvements since then, adding a
two-line telephone, filing cabinets, a fax,
and more bookshelves."</P>
<P>The key to setting up an office, Borchardt says,
is having the ability to communicate rapidly and effectively with
customers.</P>
<P>Dolbear recommends the addition of
a spreadsheet program for those consultants who plan to do their own accounting,
and he recommends purchase of a laptop computer with a desktop docking station
for those who do
not already have a desktop computer.
The setup provides a fully functional office wherever the consultant travels,
he
says. Regular disk backups are a must,
he says, and he recommends off-site storage. "In big companies, losing
your data
can be distressing, but in a small consulting business, it would be disastrous.
Off-site storage of backup tapes can save
a business in case of a fire or natural
disaster."</P>
<P>With an office and hopefully a few clients, the
next hurdle for consultants is
establishing and negotiating fees. Different consultants work from different
formulas. Most experts agree that it is nearly impossible for a consultant to
earn at
their previous salary level during the first
year or two of consulting. In fact, some
of the biggest pitfalls in consulting work,
Borchardt says, result from charging too
little or underestimating the time that
will be spent on a project. Like everyone
else, however, consultants learn from
their mistakes.</P>
<P>New consultants, Dolbear and others
say - especially people used to receiving a
regular paycheck - need to understand
that net pay is different from gross pay;
that in addition to paying themselves a salary, a consulting business needs
to earn a
profit. And at the start of a new business,
there should be plans - and money - set
aside to deal with lean times.</P>
<P>"Recognizing that need," Dolbear
says, "I went to my bank six months before I left the corporate womb and
set
up a home equity line of credit. Credit
was easy to get while I was in a corporate job, but not so easy after the break.
Bankers demand nice long financial track
records when they commit money."</P>
<P>For determining fees, Dolbear recommends looking
at what other consultants
charge. Specialty and reputation can be
big factors in fee determination. As a baseline, he believes $100 to $150 an
hour is
reasonable for professional services fees,
and that earning $800 to $1,200 per day is
not an outrageous goal for a consultant in
chemistry or chemical engineering.</P>
<P>One former consultant says the key to
financial success is a marketing strategy
that rewards the consultants' perspective
of maximum pay for minimal hours on
the job. Harold H. Gunardson, who is
now director of business development
for Air Products in Allentown, Pa., points
out that famed oil-well firefighter Red
Adair - "the ultimate consultant" - was
paid more the faster he could extinguish
a gushing oil-well inferno.
</P>
<P>As an independent consultant in the
petrochemical industry for nine years,
Gunardson says he found his niche in
such areas as plant troubleshooting. For
example, in Chile, where petrochemical
refineries were built to accommodate
the local light, sweet crude, Gunardson's
expertise was invaluable when Chile began to import Venezuelan crude - notoriously
heavy and sour - which, in turn,
began to chew up equipment in the Chilean refineries.</P>
<P>In Israel, Gunardson says, he once
landed a consulting project for his expertise with asphalt. "They were
rolling this
stuff down on airport runways and it was
rolling back up like a rug," he says. The
situation created a higher sense of urgency - and thus a higher price for
Gunardson's solutions.</P>
<P>While established expertise helps anyone considering
a consulting career, it is
not necessarily an obstacle for new recipients of Ph.D. degrees in chemistry.
Consulting firms and firms specializing in
information technology for the chemical
industry do hire new graduates, Marasco
and others say.</P>
<P>In general, people with experience in
industry, government, and academe are
preferred candidates for work at small
consulting firms, says Emery S. Conyers,
president of Technology Sciences Group,
a 27-member firm in Washington, D.C.,
that specializes in helping clients - particularly pesticide and industrial
chemical manufacturers - find solutions for
regulatory problems. People who are
looking to become experts in certain areas and people who are able to work
successfully with clients are always valuable consulting firm employees at any
stage of their careers, he says.</P>
<P>While work at a consulting firm does
mean freedom from some of the requirements of independent consulting - the
mundane chores of taxes and accounting, for example - people need to have
nearly the same sets of skills, says Conyers, a former DowElanco executive."
They have got to understand science
and they must have outstanding communications skills." For consulting
on government regulatory compliance, he says,
members of consulting firm teams must
not only work well with clients, they
must also work effectively with people at
government regulatory agencies.</P>
<P>Borchardt agrees that consultants - independent
or with a firm - must be excellent communicators and diplomats."
The customer is not always right," he
says, especially when it comes to finding
or implementing solutions to technical
problems. "But you can't say that. You
have to find a way to be diplomatic and
then effectively communicate the problem or solution to the customer."</P>
<P>And just as marketing is a mainstay for
the independent consultant, bringing in
new business is another fact of life for
anyone considering work at a consulting
firm. "It is the backbone of business,"
Conyers continues. But clients can also
be attracted by the skills package of a
firm's employees, he says. "With solid
expertise, business is going to come."</P>
<P>Consulting in general is a growth industry, Conyers
says. As chemical companies have become more cost-efficient,
they have found it too expensive to keep
people on staff from every area of expertise they might one day need. Seeking
outside help for areas such as regulatory
compliance has become increasingly
commonplace. Consulting firms likely to
succeed in this market, Conyers says,
stay focused on certain areas of expertise. And firms that can deliver work
on
time and on budget will naturally thrive.</P>
<P>Whether independent or the employee of a firm,
consultants do live and work
with a greater degree of freedom and
with greater earnings potential for the
work they perform. "You do your job in
the manner you want to do it," Conyers
says. "You have the ability to exceed expectations and to be rewarded
for that."</P>
<P>"You're your own boss," agrees Borchardt.
"You pick the projects you want
to work on. The downside is everybody
is your boss. Everyone you work with
will have expectations, and expectations
that might change midcourse."</P>
<P>But along with the freedom, loneliness is another
issue would-be consultants are wise to consider, Borchardt says."
Chemists are often not people people,"
he says. But even for someone who is
used to walking into work with colleagues every day, or simply knowing
that somebody occupies the office next
door, the periods of isolation for consultants can be overwhelming.</P>
<P>Consultants must develop strategies
to deal with those periods of loneliness
and work to find opportunities to mix
with other people.</P>
<P>Self-discipline is another issue, Borchardt says.
He recommends a daily "To
Do" list, a daily planner, and a month-at-a-glance calendar that can help
with
project planning. The point, he says, is to
develop some time-management technique and to stick with it.</P>
<P>Gunardson points to the opposite
problem - knowing when to quit and
avoiding burnout, especially when independent consultants have spouses or
children to consider. As an independent
consultant, "you're the chief cook and
bottle washer. It's hard to quit at night.
At 2 AM you can find yourself downstairs
in the office, working."</P>
<P>Collecting consulting fees can be yet
another issue. "Collecting money as a
one-man show can be tough," Gunardson says. As much as 20% of a consultant's
time might be devoted to the nonbillable hours of managing the consulting
business. When dealing with large companies, he says, especially companies
that might bring repeat business, "you
can't sue them. You can try to get retainers or you can try to get fees paid
up
front. Sometimes, all you can do is park
yourself in an office and be the squeaky
wheel."</P>
<P>And self-confidence must remain
high. A new book, "Careers for Chemists: A World Outside the Lab,"
due out
in November from ACS Career Services,
warns that the rate of rejection is high
for consulting work proposals. Consultants must deal with that and move on to
the next proposal. It is work that demands tremendous amounts of personal
drive and self-discipline.</P>
<P>And while it is an opportunity to operate an
independent business, it is not
for people who want to get rich, Dolbear
says. Rather, in a time of change, consulting work appeals to those with an
independent spirit - people who have always
been able to handle the rewards and the
rejection, but who prefer to do so on
their own time.

<h2><font color="8B2252"><I>Graduate students from abroad face tough
decision on where to go after graduation,
have a rough road to jobs in the U.S.</i></font></h2></center>
<H3>Linda R. Raber, C&amp;EN Washington</H3>
<P>The U.S. is graduate school to the
world. And the recently failed legislative attempts to curb legal entry
of foreign nationals into the country
make it likely that, for better or for
worse, it will stay that way. While U.S.
society as a whole benefits from having
access to the world's best and brightest,
some individual U.S. citizen scientists
and engineers out of work or in dead-end
jobs haven't felt so fortunate.</P>
<P>The academic research and teaching
enterprise in the U.S. needs a lot of highly
skilled people. But after four or five years
or more as a postdoc, many scientists believe they have paid their dues and
yearn
for more permanent employment. Some
argue that foreign-citizen Ph.D.s are
squeezing some U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s out of
satisfying jobs. The truth, however, is that
U.S. law makes it exceptionally difficult to
hire foreign nationals who don't have permanent resident status into either
industrial or academic positions.</P>
<P>In the past 10 years, non-U.S. citizens
have received an increasing share of U.S.
science and engineering Ph.D. degrees in
general and of chemistry and chemical engineering degrees in particular. According
to data published last month by the National Science Foundation, 47% of the
19,219 doctorates conferred by U.S. universities in the physical and natural
sciences and engineering in 1995 were earned
by non-U.S. citizens, up from 34% a decade earlier. For chemistry, 42% of the
2,116 doctoral degrees conferred in 1995
went to foreign students, up from 27% in
1986. Foreign students accounted for an
even larger share of chemical engineering
degrees, with 58% of the 699 doctoral degrees given for work in chemical engineering
in 1995 going to foreign nationals, up
from 52% a decade earlier.</P>
<P>The number of non-U.S. citizens who
earned a doctorate in chemistry actually
declined a little in 1995 after peaking in
1994. Much of the increase during the
past several years is attributable to Ph.D.
degrees received by Chinese students who
were granted permanent residence in the
U.S. by the Chinese Student Protection Act
of 1993. This law, in effect, gave mass political asylum to all students from
China
studying in the U.S. at the time of the 1989
demonstrations in Beijing.</P>
<P>Many foreign students do plan to stay
in the U.S. Almost all of the 1995 chemistry and chemical engineering Ph.D.
recipients with permanent resident visas
and with definite plans say they intend to
stay in the U.S. According to NSF, of
those on temporary visas, about 79% of
chemistry Ph.D.s and 64% of chemical
engineering Ph.D.s with definite plans
said they will remain in the U.S. after receiving their degrees at least long
enough
to complete a postdoc.</P>
<P>"This year, we're going to have about
250 or so chemistry Ph.D.s who will stay in
temporary [postdoctoral] positions much
longer than they should," says chemist David K. Lavallee, provost at City
College of
New York. In 1995, Lavallee, who calls this
number of temporary positions "the job
gap," headed up the American Chemical Society's Presidential Task Force
on the Study
of Doctoral Education in Chemistry. "After
your third or fourth year in a temporary position, you're really underemployed."</P>
<P>He says that nearly 60% of the foreign students
who receive chemistry
Ph.D.s remain in the U.S. for at least five
years after receiving their degrees. "So
out of the roughly 900 foreign students
who get chemistry Ph.D.s, we will expect about 500 to remain in the country
at least five years or longer."

cultural diversity lures foreign students</h3></A>
<hr noshade>
<P>He believes that the 3% absolute unemployment
rate for Ph.D. chemists - 
those unemployed and seeking employment - is deceptive. "The problem
is
that people are not finding satisfactory
employment in a reasonable time. Three
percent doesn't tell the whole story."</P>
<P>Lavallee contends, "If industry did not
have such a ready supply of foreign students to hire and they believed there
was
a need in the area, perhaps they would
support graduate school scholarships to
train people in the fields they thought
were important."</P>
<P>However, when asked if he thinks that
foreign nationals are taking the jobs of U.S.
citizens, Joel Shulman, manager of external
relations at Procter &amp; Gamble, says: "I don't
think so at all. There is absolutely no reason
to hire a foreign national for a job that you
can find a U.S. citizen to fill because of the
time and expense in getting somebody
permanent residency." He estimates the
expense to be about $10,000 to $15,000
in attorneys' fees and advertising along
with about 50 hours of a manager's time.</P>
<P>But sometimes employers find that a
foreign graduate is better qualified for
the position that is available. In some instances, foreign students may be the
only
people available to the employer.</P>
<P>P&amp;G, for example, "is among a fairly
large number of companies that hire foreign national scientists who fit very
specific technical requirements with the intention of sponsoring them for permanent
residency," says Shulman. "A lot of
companies, for example, software companies and the like, hire foreign nationals
on a temporary basis with no intention
of keeping them permanently."</P>
<P>That's not P&amp;G's way. "We will only
hire foreign national scientists with the intent of keeping them employed in
the U.S.
long-term," Shulman says. "This is a much
more difficult, more expensive, and time-consuming project than hiring a U.S.
citizen or permanent resident." He explains:"
To hire someone who is not a permanent
resident or citizen, you've first got to sponsor them for an H-1B visa, which
is relatively easy to obtain. You just need to apply to the Immigration &amp;
Naturalization
Service (INS) to verify that the individual's
wages are prevailing wages. That's relatively straightforward."</P>
<hr noshade>
<A HREF="sidefor2.html"><h3>TO SIDEBAR: Scientists, engineers come to the U.S.
under several visa types</h3></A>
<hr noshade>
<center><img src="mostgraph.gif"></center>
<P>Then it gets hard. The two most prevalent ways
to sponsor a person for permanent residence are to go through labor certification
or to certify that the person is an
outstanding scientist or researcher. "To go
through labor certification, you have to assure the Department of Labor that
this foreign national is not taking a job from a U.S.
citizen or permanent resident," Shulman
says. "This involves running ads and showing that the people responding
to the ad
will not meet the requirements of the job.
For industry, that is a fairly time-consuming and expensive process.</P>
<P>"Where you run the ad is dictated to
you by the Department of Labor or their
surrogate, which is usually the state department of labor. If it's a chemist
you're
trying to hire, more often than not, you
have to run it in C&amp;EN. The whole purpose of running that ad is to verify
that
there isn't somebody else who is qualified for the job.</P>
<P>"If you find a citizen or permanent resident
who fits the job's requirements, the
labor department will not allow the foreign national to obtain employment-based
permanent residency. And that person will
have to leave the country when their H-1B
visa expires," he says.</P>
<P>An alternate route to the labor certification
process is to sponsor a person for
permanent residence as an outstanding
researcher as classified by INS. "That
means the individual has an international
reputation in his or her field as evidenced by a set of criteria specified by
INS," says Shulman.</P>
<P>One suggestion for helping to ease
pressures on the job market is limiting foreign Ph.D. enrollment in U.S. graduate
schools. Reginald P. T. Tomkins, professor
of chemistry at New Jersey Institute of
Technology, Newark, says that "flies in the
face of what America is all about. This
country has thrived on people coming in
over the years in good and bad times.
They come in and they make a contribution to the country." He acknowledges
that "everything is very competitive.
When industry is looking for a person, it is
looking for the best person in a particular
area. Whether the person originally came
from Vietnam or China or Africa, if the
person has the skills and the dedication to
work hard and anything else they might
be looking for, that's the person industry
takes and, I think, ought to be taking."</P>
<P>Tomkins, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally
from England, teaches in a university
with a high proportion of foreign nationals
whom he describes as wonderful students,
who should, actually, be seen as a positive
influence on American students, raising
the standards.</P>
<P>Tomkins believes the cultural diversity brought
by international students is an
important benefit. "I work a lot with industry," he says. "Every
time I make a
visit, I see a very diverse population in
industry. I think it's good for students to
experience this diverse population in
college. Whether they are American or
not, students need to be able to mix with
students from Vietnam, from India, and
from Latin America who they will one
day be working alongside in industry, academia, or in government labs."</P>
<center><img src="asiangraph.gif"></center>
<P>Lavallee says some of the schools with
predominant enrollments of foreign students may be contributing to the underemployment
problem. "The reason it is
important for schools to take a very hard
look at the number of foreign students
they're admitting is not directly related to
the job market, but indirectly. If a school
cannot recruit domestic students, there
has to be a question about the purpose of
the doctoral education at that institution.</P>
<P>"If it is to promote the research rather
than education per se, there are other
ways to get the research done with permanent research staff. If foreign students
are being recruited simply because the
university needs a certain number of
teaching assistants, which happens in
some schools, perhaps they should be
hiring master's degree candidates to do
that," he says.</P>
<P>Lavallee doubts that the primary motive
in recruiting lots of foreign students is "to
fill the altruistic wishes of the United
States to educate the world. I think there
are these other motives that lead to the
problem. We would have a better balance
in our job market if we really focused on
why are we recruiting the students and
what we can do to both satisfy industry and
make good career paths for our students."</P>
<P>He asks: "What really drives the size
of our research groups? Does it have anything to do with what our students are
going to do afterward, or are there other
considerations? That, I think, is an issue
that has to be faced squarely."

<h1>Chemical & Engineering News</h1>
<h2>February 24, 1997</h2>
<h5><hr noshade>Copyright &#169; 1997 by the American Chemical Society

<C.EN VOLUME="75" NUMBER="8" CODEN="CENEAR" ISSN="0009-2347" PAGES="1-96" PUBDAT

<h3><font color="8B2252">'Evolution' used to isolate high-affinity ligands    
</font></h3>
<p>
A method that uses the concept of test-tube "evolution" to generate ligands
for compounds of chemical or biological interest was reported earlier this
month by medicinal chemistry professor Alexey V. Eliseev and postdoctoral
associate Marina I. Nelen of the State University of New York, Buffalo [<i>
J. Am. Chem. Soc</i>., 119, 1147 (1997)].
</p>

<p>
Eliseev's technique "bears the potential to become a system in which 
Darwinian evolution-type principles are applied, which would be a milestone in
small-molecule combinatorial chemistry," comments biochemistry professor
Michael Famulok at the Genzentrum of Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich,
Germany. Famulok specialized in the in vitro selection of nucleic acids from
combinatorial libraries.
</p>

<p>
The paper describes the enrichment of a dicarboxylate that bound with highest
affinity to a target. The dicarboxylate is selected from a "combinatorial
library" of three dicarboxylate isomers that interconvert under 
ultraviolet light. After the highest affinity dicarboxylate (the cis,cis
isomer) is removed from the mixture by affinity chromatography, it is
regenerated by isomerization of the other two (cis,trans and trans,trans).
Eliseev and Nelen refer to this regeneration process as "mutation".
Iterative removal of the cis,cis isomer from the mixture and its
regeneration from the other two isomers results in its enrichment.
</p>

<p>
One advantage of the technique, comments Famulok, is that it identifies
an active component simply by enriching it in iterative selection and
amplification cycles--regardless of how little of that component was
initially present. Although this has been done previously for nucleic acid
libraries--using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification--"the
fact that Eliseev has done something similar now with a three-compound 
'library' of small organic molecules is remarkable," says Famulok.
</p>

<p>
However, he points out that it is debatable whether the term "mutation" is
appropriate to describe the process. "Mutation" implies that the diversity of
a mixture is increased, whereas in Eliseev's system three isomers are simply
interconverted.
</p>

<p>
But Eliseev replies that the pool used in his experiment did initially
contain only a single compound (the trans,trans isomer), and that this
isomer "mutated" to form the other two. Eliseev currently is exploring
extending the technique to systems with other types of components, such as
imines that could be reversibly formed from a polyaldehyde and a set of
amines.

<P>Robert F. Curl Jr., Sir Harold W. Kroto, Richard
E. Smalley. Three very
good, maybe brilliant, chemists who
came together for 11 days at Rice University, Houston, in September 1985 to
perform a series of experiments that would,
at the very least, change chemistry, and,
just maybe, change the world.</P>
<P>Within weeks of the experiments and
the seminal <I>Nature </I>paper describing and
interpreting them, the collegial collaboration would begin to unravel; within
months, it would be dead. But the controversial hypothesis the collaboration
spawned - that another form of pure carbon besides graphite and diamond
exists - would thrive over time. The fullerenes, a family of carbon cage
molecules
epitomized by the exquisitely symmetrical C<SUB>60</SUB>, would come, for a
time, to occupy center stage in chemistry. Though
their cachet has waned somewhat in recent years, fullerenes and related molecules
known as carbon nanotubes may
well power new technologies now only
dreamed of.</P>
<P>Curl, Kroto, and Smalley, and their
equally talented but, as it turns out, not
quite so lucky collaborators, had the rare
privilege of observing a fundamentally
new facet of nature for the very first time.
This being today, what they saw were the
data from a highly sophisticated, essentially one-of-a-kind instrument, in this
case a
series of mass spectra that unequivocally
demonstrated that C<SUB>60</SUB> is an extraordinary
molecule.</P>
<P>The discovery of C<SUB>60</SUB> - fancifully
named
buckminsterfullerene by the researchers
when they gleaned that its bonds had an
architecture similar to R. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes - and the
family of
molecules for which C<SUB>60</SUB> is the prototype
earned Curl, Kroto, and Smalley the 1996
Nobel Prize in Chemistry (C&amp;EN, Oct. 14,
1996, page 7). They received the prize on
Dec. 10, 1996, the 100th anniversary of
Alfred Nobel's death. As C&amp;EN's managing
editor and a science writer with a long-
standing interest in the fullerenes, I was
invited to attend the Nobel festivities.</P>
<center><img src="from.gif"></center>
<P>Innumerable prizes and awards for
achievement in the sciences and arts exist
today, but none rivals the Nobel Prizes.
The amount of money involved - about
$1.2 million for each 1996 prize - is one
not insignificant factor in the distinction of
the Nobels. But there also is a remarkable
aura surrounding the Nobel Prizes unmatched by any other. The Nobel Prizes
simultaneously celebrate excellence across
a wide range of human endeavors - physics, chemistry, medicine, literature,
economics, and the quest for peace. Five of
the six prizes are presented together, in
dark, often dreary wintertime Stockholm,
and the events surrounding them - the
lectures, press conferences, and receptions; the awards ceremony and the splendid
banquet that follows - enchant an entire capital city.</P>
<P>And yet, despite the acknowledged
preeminence of the Nobel Prizes and the
tremendous effort that goes into selecting
the prize winners, there is a perhaps unavoidable capriciousness to them. Some
winners of the literature prize have been
remarkably obscure writers. There seem
to be a finite number of economic theorists prominent enough to merit the economics
prize who haven't already won it.</P>
<P>The limit of three recipients per prize
(imposed by the statutes of the Nobel
Foundation) inevitably means that important collaborators sometimes do not share
in a prize they and others might otherwise
believe they are due. This year's prizes in
chemistry and physics dramatically illustrate the problem. In physics, two Cornell
University physics professors, David M.
Lee and Robert C. Richardson, and their
then-graduate student, Douglas D. Osheroff (now a physics professor at Stanford
University), shared the prize for the discovery of the
superfluidity of liquid helium-3. In chemistry, two graduate students
who were key in discovering the fullerenes - James R. Heath (now a chemistry
professor at the University of California,
Los Angeles) and Sean C. O'Brien (now a
scientist with Texas Instruments, Dallas) - 
were passed by. For Heath and O'Brien,
who not only participated in the experiments that revealed the existence of
the
fullerenes but also carried out seminal
work in establishing the validity of the
fullerene hypothesis, the selection of this
year's prize appeared particularly fickle.</P>
<center><img src="freq.gif"></center>
<P>And while most chemists expected
Smalley and Kroto eventually to share a
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery
of the fullerenes, many were at least mildly surprised by the selection of Curl
to
share the prize with them. Although Curl
introduced Smalley and Kroto, participated in the experiments that led to the
discovery of the fullerenes, and conducted
research on them for several years following the discovery, he was not generally
perceived to be as central a figure in the
fullerene saga as were Smalley and Kroto.
Curl also stopped research on fullerenes in
his lab in 1992, after a method for production of macroscopic amounts of C<SUB>60</SUB>
and
C<SUB>70</SUB> was discovered elsewhere.</P>
<P>I recently talked with Curl when he
came to Washington, D.C., with Nobel
Prize winners Smalley, Lee, Osheroff, and
Richardson for a reception with Vice
President Al Gore at the White House
and a formal dinner at the Swedish Embassy. Curl discussed discovering the
fullerenes, dropping out of fullerene research, and winning the Nobel Prize.</P>
<P>Curl, 63, a native of Alice, Texas, is the
son of a Methodist minister. He is a self-effacing man, given to downplaying
his considerable intellectual acumen and scientific accomplishments. When asked
how
winning the Nobel Prize might affect him,
Curl responded, typically, "I just hope I
can resist the urge to pontificate."</P>
<P>Curl's introduction to chemistry was
Norman Rockwellian - his father bought
him a chemistry set when he was nine
years old and, within a week, he says, he
knew he wanted to be a chemist. He attended Rice University as an undergraduate,
receiving his bachelor's degree in
1954. He did his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving
his Ph.D. degree in 1957. He also met his
wife, Jonel, in Berkeley. After a postdoctoral fellowship in Edgar B. Wilson's
group
at Harvard, where he learned microwave
spectroscopy, he accepted a faculty position back at Rice in 1958, where he
has
remained ever since.</P>

</p> 
<P>At Rice, Curl settled in as a microwave and infrared
spectroscopist, applying the techniques to a variety of chemical systems. By
the early 1980s, he was
doing infrared spectroscopy of reactive
free radicals, in particular C<SUB>2</SUB>H, collaborating with electrical engineering
professor Frank K. Tittel. He was also collaborating with chemistry professor
Philip R.
Brooks on what they called reaction
complex spectroscopy, looking at relatively long-lived species in the process
of
reacting.</P>
<P>Smalley arrived at Rice from a postdoctoral fellowship
at the University of
Chicago in 1976. "Rick and I always
wanted to collaborate," Curl said. By the
early 1980s, Smalley had been promoted
to full professor and had begun making a
name for himself in the physical chemistry community because of the laser vaporization,
supersonic jet technique he
had invented for studying refractory materials. By 1983, Curl and Tittel had
begun a collaboration with Smalley studying semiconductor clusters.</P>
<P>Curl is generally credited with being
the catalyst that led to the discovery of the
fullerenes through his introduction of
Smalley and Kroto. Curl had met Kroto, a
chemistry professor at the University of
Sussex, Brighton, England, at a theoretical
chemistry meeting in 1977, and subsequently Kroto had invited Curl to visit
him
at Sussex. In 1984, at a meeting in Austin,
Texas, on gas-phase molecular structure,
Curl reciprocated by inviting Kroto to visit
Rice. There, Kroto was introduced to
Smalley and his revolutionary laser vaporization technique.</P>
<P>Kroto saw in Smalley's device an opportunity
to test ideas he had been developing about the formation and chemistry
of long-chain polyyne species formed near
carbon-rich stars. The following year, an
updated version of Smalley's instrument
was used to vaporize carbon and produce
the first fullerenes.</P>
<P>Since then, many talks, especially by
Kroto and Smalley, and articles (including
several by me) and books have explored the
intense intellectual ferment at Rice among
Curl, Smalley, Kroto, Heath, O'Brien, and
coworkers that went into devising an explanation for the unique mass spectral
signature of C<SUB>60</SUB>. Certainly, it was an exhilarating several days,
with Heath and his
wife, Carmen, one night trying to build
C<SUB>60</SUB> models with candy and toothpicks;
with Kroto trying to recall the precise geometry of a "star sphere"
he had once
built for his children; and with Smalley, after a few late-night beers, succeeding
with
a crude paper and Scotch tape polygon
that contained the required 60 vertices in
a highly symmetrical closed shell.</P>
<P>But Curl today has an interesting take
on the fullerene discovery and what primarily contributed to it. "Rick
would
maintain," Curl said, "and I tend to agree,
that, 'It's the machine, stupid,'" borrowing and modifying
a phrase made famous
by the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign. That is, without the laser vaporization
device invented by Smalley, the fullerenes would have remained undiscovered,
at least for a few more years.</P>
<P>Curl elaborated: "If we had published
the first <I>Nature </I>paper without a structure - just said, look, we
found this interesting mass spectrum - it wouldn't have
been two weeks before someone had said,'
You dolts, soccer-ball C<SUB>60</SUB> is a rational explanation for it.' Look,
Orville L. Chapman[
a chemistry professor at UCLA] had four
graduate students trying to make C<SUB>60</SUB> at
that time. So I don't think that there's any
question that people would have said this
was a reasonable explanation."</P>
<P>As Curl and Smalley pointed out in
their Nobel lectures in Stockholm, unbeknownst to the researchers at Rice in
1985, the idea for icosahedral (that is, soccer-ball) C<SUB>60</SUB> was not
new. David E. H.
Jones, writing as the columnist Daedelus
in the Nov. 3, 1966, <I>New Scientist, </I>speculated on a hollow, closed-shell
carbon molecule derived from a graphitic sheet in
which incorporated pentagons caused
the flat graphite to curve around on itself.
The Japanese synthetic organic chemist
Eiji Osawa in 1970 published a paper in
the Japanese-language journal <I>Kagaku</I>[<B>25, </B>843 (1970)]
that contained the structure of the now-familiar truncated icosahedron C<SUB>60</SUB>.
Russian chemists also speculated
on the compound [<I>Proc. Acad. Sci.
U.S.S.R., </I><B>209, </B>239 (1973)]. And UCLA's
Chapman, legendary for his innovative
ideas about molecular structure, was attempting a classical synthesis of C<SUB>60</SUB>.</P>
<P>But as Curl noted in Stockholm, "If Orville
Chapman had succeeded in synthesizing C<SUB>60</SUB>, it would have been like
dodecahedrane, a tour de force of synthetic organic
chemistry. But it would not have been the
same as the fullerene hypothesis. It would
not have revealed a fundamental property
of condensing carbon vapor."</P>
<P>That fundamental property of condensing carbon
vapor - the tendency of carbon
atoms to form a variety of closed structures heretofore unknown in chemistry - 
is what earned Curl, Kroto, and Smalley
the Nobel Prize. But after Wolfgang
Kr&auml;tschmer, of the Max Planck Institute
for Nuclear Physics, Heidelberg, Germany,
and Donald R. Huffman, a physics professor at the University of Arizona, Tucson,
developed a method for producing macroscopic amounts of the fullerenes, Curl
decided to abandon the field of fullerene research. "Why?" I asked
him in our interview in Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>"Once the Huffman-Kr&auml;tschmer technique
was developed, it became an area of
organic chemistry and materials science,"
Curl said. "Essentially, I was faced with the
issue of having to redefine myself if I wanted to continue in the fullerenes.
As a physical chemist, I could have gotten into the
issue of fullerene formation. I did do a fair
amount of thinking about that, but I really
couldn't think of a definitive experiment
that would settle the question. I didn't
want to do materials science and I didn't
want to do organic chemistry, and I didn't
want to work in a field where there were
papers coming out every week. Rick has
these three-ring binders with 3- or 4-inch
rings, and he was putting fullerene papers
in them. And when he got up to the seventh binder, I knew it was time for me
to
do something else."</P>
<P>Today, Curl is being drawn in a new
research direction through his collaboration with Tittel. The infrared lasers
they
have developed to study free radicals appear to be suitable for use in small,
portable monitoring devices that could be used
to detect, for example, trace atmospheric
gases such as methane. "We're having a
good time," Curl said, "because the work
involves questions of engineering that I
had never thought of before."</P>
<P>No one who knows them would use
the phrase "self-effacing" to describe either Harry Kroto or Rick
Smalley. Both are
brilliant, creative, articulate, and ambitious. Perhaps it was inevitable that
a collaboration between them would be both
extraordinarily successful and exceedingly
short-lived. Kroto's interests range from
chemical physics to technical drafting and
design to filmmaking. His career as a
chemist has been marked by innovative
ideas on a range of subjects, one leading to
the next, and numerous successful collaborations, not all of which ended cordially.
He is charming and gregarious, a natural
showman.</P>
<P>Smalley combines what many people
who know him well describe as true genius with dogged determination, a passion
for perfection, and an incredible ability to
design innovative approaches to intractable experimental problems. "I've
never
met anybody like Rick," O'Brien told me
in Stockholm. "He's never wrong." Smalley challenges everyone around
him - colleagues, collaborators, graduate students
and postdocs, and the occasional science
writer who wanders into his sphere. And
he does it with what is a quiet, but sometimes biting, wit.</P>
<P>Kroto, 57, was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire,
England. He obtained his
Ph.D. degree in chemistry in 1964 at the
University of Sheffield, England. But, as he
told me in an interview in Stockholm,
chemistry never dominated his life - 
graphic design was at least as great a passion. "I was the art director
of the student
magazine," he said. "The first prize I ever
won was for a book jacket." But chemistry
was his calling, and he took a faculty position in the department of chemistry
and
molecular sciences at Sussex in 1967.</P>
<P>Like Smalley and Curl, Kroto has to his
credit a variety of significant accomplishments in chemistry besides the discovery
of the fullerenes. As he pointed out in his
Nobel lecture in Stockholm, one of the
first, of which he is quite proud, was the
synthesis of the first compound containing
a carbon-phosphorus double bond. "When
we discovered the carbon-phosphorus
double bond, that was a fantastic day,"
Kroto recalled. "Because people had said
in the literature that you can't make a carbon-phosphorus double bond."</P>
<P>In his Nobel lecture, Kroto traced his
evolution as a chemist - from the early
work on carbon-phosphorus double bonds,
to carbon species in interstellar space, to
the discovery of the fullerenes, to current
work on nanoscale carbon structures and
nanotechnology. Throughout his talk, Kroto emphasized the idiosyncratic way
he
approaches chemical research.
</P>
<P>In the 1970s, Kroto began the work
that would lead, in a roundabout way, to
the discovery of the fullerenes. Working in
collaboration with Sussex colleague David
Walton and physical chemist Takeshi Oka
and astronomers at Canada's National Research Council, Kroto began a search
for
long-chain carbon species in interstellar
space. Kroto's idea was that carbon-rich
red giant stars were throwing off complex
carbon species and that radioastronomy
could detect them. The collaboration involved determining the spectral signatures
of various polyynes and searching for
those signatures in the infrared and microwave absorption spectra of interstellar
clouds. The team definitively detected linear polyyne species including HC<SUB>5</SUB>N,
HC<SUB>7</SUB>N, and HC<SUB>9</SUB>N.</P>
<P>But spectroscopy and radioastronomy
can only take you so far in understanding
the chemistry of species light-years away
from where you are standing, and Kroto
longed to know more about how such
species might form in the circumstellar
shells of red giant stars.</P>
<P>"On the discovery of C<SUB>60</SUB>, I
was interested in carbon stars," Kroto told me in
Stockholm. "I was interested in proving
this hypothesis I had that the material was
coming out of a carbon star - which at the
time was not accepted by most people because there were some very good ideas
about the formation of molecules in the
interstellar medium that did not fit with
that. Those ideas are right, but they didn't
seem to work for carbon. I think we
proved conclusively that carbon chains are
coming from carbon stars. We discovered
C<SUB>60</SUB> as serendipity."</P>
<P>About his research on nanoscale structures, Kroto
said, "Let's just let carbon do
what it wants. Let's probe these things and
use metal clusters to catalyze their formation. Let's see what happens and build
on
that. It's sort of a different way, a more
fundamental approach to strategic science. I'm not saying, 'I want to
produce
material of a given nature.' I work in a different way. I go down a street and
I find a
stone and turn it over, and I say, 'That's an
interesting fossil.' What I do is more like
fossil hunting the way that nature operates. Just probing the way it works rather
than trying to force it into submission. I
can't do it the other way. It doesn't seem
to work. Rick is doing it with a laser, trying
to produce, say, long tubes, and he's getting there. My approach is, I can see
this
particular thing we've achieved, and just by
playing around, doing it a different way,
let's see if we can do something useful."</P>
<P>Kroto is eloquent in his defense of basic research
in the face of budget cutters
in the U.K. and the U.S. "Fundamental science is difficult to directly
support because, at the present moment, people
want direct applications and direct goals.
But there are a group of people out there,
such as myself and others doing fundamental science, we're on the edge of extinction
if we're not careful, and that's sad,
because those people can't work in any
other way. And they have historically produced, I think, some of the most important
discoveries. C<SUB>60</SUB> is one of them."</P>
<P>Smalley, 53, was born in Akron, Ohio,
and grew up in Kansas City, Mo. He attended Hope College, Holland, Mich.,
from 1961 to 1963, and received his
bachelor's degree in chemistry from the
University of Michigan in 1965. From
there, he went to Shell Chemical Co. as a
research chemist from 1965 to 1969,
where he came to realize that he would
not be able to do the kind of chemistry he
wanted to do without an advanced degree. That realization led him to Princeton
University, where he received a Ph.D. degree in chemistry in 1973.</P>
<P>Smalley is a gifted technician, using the
word in its most fundamental sense. He
invented machines that change the way
we look at the chemical world. In his Nobel lecture, Smalley flatly stated:
"The apparatus discovered the fullerenes." While
Kroto and others may disagree, the argument has the ring of truth to it. Since
the
time of Galileo and his telescope, new devices, new instrumentation in the hands
of
the prepared observer, have generated
new insights into nature that simply
would not have been possible in the absence of the technology. To disparage
development of new instrumentation as
somehow "applied" science rather than"
basic" science is to condemn science to
perpetual ignorance.</P>
<P>Nanotechnology almost certainly won't
come into existence through the efforts of
basic researchers alone. The word itself
gives the game away - nanotechnology.
By definition, this is now applied or directed research. Smalley, perhaps for
the first
time in his career as a chemist, knows exactly what he wants to achieve - synthesis
of essentially infinitely long, single-walled
nanotubes of a particular symmetry. That's
his goal because he sees in such nanotubes almost unlimited potential to change
technology, a worthy enough goal to
switch from basic to applied research. We
don't need to noodle along to discover
what carbon can do anymore, Smalley
seems to be saying; that's what the 1996
Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded for.</P>
<P>Smalley has been fascinated by carbon
nanotubes since they were discovered in
1991 on the cathode of a carbon arc by
Sumio Iijima at NEC Fundamental Research Laboratories in Tsukuba, Japan. Iijima's
high-resolution electron micrographs
of multiwalled nanotubes and their hemispherical end caps clearly showed that
these carbon species are extended members of the fullerene family. Subsequent
patented work by inventor Howard G.
Tennent showed that finer and more perfect tubes could be produced by flowing
a
hydrocarbon such as ethylene mixed with
hydrogen and an inert buffer gas over
nanometer-sized catalytic metal particles
dispersed onto a support. Smalley believes
that the mechanism of this catalytic process is now well understood. But while
multiwalled nanotubes are clearly related
to fullerenes, they are not molecularly perfect; they are not fullerenes.</P>
<center><img src="c60.gif"></center>
<P>That's not the case with the single-walled nanotubes
discovered in 1993 simultaneously by Iijima and Toshinari
Ichihashi at NEC in Japan and Donald S.
Bethune and coworkers at IBM Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, Calif. The
two groups showed that if certain metals
are inserted into the anode of a carbon arc
operated in a way expected to produce
C<SUB>60</SUB>, the soot collected on the walls of the
chamber has a rubbery texture. Transmission electron microscopy images of this
soot showed that it contained many single-walled nanotubes with a narrow distribution
of diameters, about 1.2 nm. The soot
contained no multiwalled nanotubes.</P>
<P>The results from the NEC and IBM
groups suggest that the mechanism for
formation of the single-walled nanotubes
must be very different from that of the
multiwalled nanotubes, Smalley told me
when he was in Washington. "The fact
that the single-walled nanotube diameters 
are so small and have such a narrow
distribution indicates that there must be
some other process at work here," Smalley said. "We believe it is
intimately associated with the self-assembly process of
C<SUB>60</SUB> and the other fullerenes.</P>
<P>"While the diameters of catalyzed arc-grown
single-wall nanotubes are fairly uniform," Smalley added, "those
produced by
another method recently discovered in
our laboratory are stunningly so." The
Rice chemists used a laser to vaporize a
target rod composed of 98.8% carbon,
0.6% nickel, and 0.6% cobalt to produce
soot that contained 70 to 90% single-walled
nanotubes, of which 50% are of a particular
geometry, dubbed the 10,10 tube (C&amp;EN,
July 29, 1996, page 5). The tubes are bundled together in "ropes"
5 to 10 nm in diameter. Ropes as long as 100 &mgr;m have
been observed.</P>
<center><img src="c70.gif"></center>
<P>In his Nobel lecture in Stockholm,
Smalley said: "My main message is that the
process of discovering the fullerenes is ongoing. We weren't the first to conceive
of
the truncated icosahedron. Nor were we
the first to think of C<SUB>60</SUB>. Carbon has the
genius wired into it to self-assemble into
this structure, and we were lucky enough
to discover that fact. In addition to making
fullerenes, we can use cobalt or nickel to
trick carbon into making its next favorite
structure, nanotubes, of which the 10,10
tube is to tubes as C<SUB>60</SUB> is to the fullerenes."</P>
<P>The 10,10 nanotube, Smalley continued, "is
one of the most important species
in the future of chemistry." Although it
contains literally millions of carbon atoms,
the 10,10 tube is truly molecular. By symmetry, the 10,10 tube is metallic,
comparable to copper. The 10,10 nanotubes"
have the potential to revolutionize every technology in which an electron
moves from one location to another,"
Smalley said. The ends of the tubes conceivably can be opened to allow the
carbon atoms to make covalent bonds to
other atoms. Heat an opened tube to
1,000 &deg;C, and it will spontaneously close.
They will also be the strongest fiber ever
made, "perhaps the strongest fiber that
ever can be made," Smalley said, about
100 times stronger than steel while having
only one-sixth the weight.</P>
<P>In November, my wife Jan and I took
Bob and Jonel Curl and Smalley to dinner when they were in Washington,
D.C. We spent a long time together that
night talking about a variety of subjects.
John Horgan's book "The End of Science"
came up (C&amp;EN, Dec. 2, 1996, page 27).
Smalley had read it. Curl had not, but
knew of its premise, which holds, essentially, that there's not much left to
discover in science. Curl's typically succinct
comment on Horgan's thesis was: "What
that's fundamentally saying is that there is
no virtue in understanding complex systems. I think that that's obviously lunacy.
People would like to understand, for example, living organisms."</P>
<P>Smalley dismissed the book entirely."
I doubt very much that 2% of what's
important in science is now known," he
said. "Maybe that's a bit extreme. But I'm
quite certain that the universe holds important surprises yet for us. Easily
80% of
what we need to know remains to be
discovered."</P>
<P>But in Washington, Smalley was more
interested in nanotubes than he was in
arguments about what's left to be discovered in science or about meeting with
Vice President Gore. No fullerene research is currently being done in Smalley's
lab at Rice - his entire effort now focuses on nanotubes, which he believes
hold the potential for revolutionizing human existence. And as such, he wants
other chemists to investigate the chemistry and properties of 10,10 nanotubes.</P>
<P>"The more we've gotten into this,"
Smalley told me, "the more I am convinced that if this stuff is anywhere
near as
cool as I think it is, this is a lot bigger than
anything I've ever done before. It really
contains the seeds of many new major
technologies. Here we have a molecule
that's tubular made out of our favorite element. The ends can be derivatized.
For the
first time, we have a molecule the two
ends of which are communicating with
each other by metallic transport. We've
never had that before. We've had conducting molecules, but they are not really
very
good conductors. Those cases where they
are good conductors, they are not very
good molecules.</P>
<P>"The reason I'm trying to get this out
is
that I would like many of the best organic
and organometallic chemistry groups in
this country seduced into working with
this material. That's not going to happen
unless either a lot of time passes and they
get bored with what they are now doing
or, if you want it to happen quicker, and I
think that's important, the federal government needs to establish some sort
of national initiative to develop this area. The
best groups have plenty of ideas - they are
the least likely to drop what they are doing
and start in a completely different area.
And I want to attract them into it."</P>
<P>According to Alfred Nobel's will, the
Nobel Prizes honor achievements of the
preceding year that benefit humanity. By
necessity, the "preceding year" part of
the bequest has fallen by the wayside - 
the world is much too complicated as
the millennium draws to a close to be
able to judge achievement that rapidly.</P>
<P>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recent
years has recognized a variety of types of
achievement. In some years, the Nobel
Chemistry Committee has selected chemists for what appeared to be a lifetime
of
outstanding work - Rudy Marcus and
George Olah come to mind. In other
years, the committee has anointed chemists for a single essential insight, the
clarity
of which redirected a whole field of research - last year's award to Sherry
Rowland, Mario Molina, and Paul Crutzen is a
prime example.</P>
<P>The 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
went to three men for a single set of experiments conceived by one, facilitated
by another, on a revolutionary instrument invented by the third that, it has
now become clear, changed the face of
chemistry. The prize, almost everyone involved agrees, should have gone to five
scientists, for Jim Heath and Sean O'Brien
played essential roles in the discovery of
the fullerenes.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am prejudiced, because I
have been writing about the fullerenes
since the first paper on them was published in <I>Nature, </I>but the 1996
Nobel
Prize in Chemistry seems to me to be an
especially fitting one. As Rick Smalley
emphasized in Stockholm, the fullerenes
are still being discovered. But already, it
seems clear, their discovery and what it
revealed about the fundamental properties of carbon will be benefiting humanity
for many, many years to come.</P>
<P>And like the vast majority of Nobel Laureates
in Chemistry, Curl, Kroto, and Smalley, each in his own way, continue to
make vital contributions to chemistry.

<p>
What a difference a year - especially an election year - can make.
Conciliation and cooperation may
be this year's postelection theme in Congress, but last year at this time the government was shut down while President Clinton and Congress battled over how to balance the budget and over who was more devoted to meeting the country's needs.</P> 

<P>At the height of confrontation last year, several Cabinet agencies and several Administration technological programs were marked for elimination by the Republican Congress. Environmental protection was in disrepute in some circles.
The free market as the solution to all ills was the key. Not since the darkest days
of Watergate during the 1970s was the
partisan scene so grim in Washington.</P> 

<P>But as the year went on, the mood changed. Sensing public disgust with the Washington spectacle, Congress reached
agreement on a balanced budget. The Energy Department survived. Likewise the Department of Commerce. The industry-government initiative to reinvent the automobile (the so-called Clean Car Initiative)
became a good idea after all. Dual-use
technology programs at the Defense Department also made it through, with lesser funding to be sure, and so did the much-maligned Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology.</P> 

<P>The November elections have had their impact; the dynamics have shifted to some degree. Although the leadership in the
House has changed little, the Republicans have a smaller majority than they had in the last session. In the Senate, however, retirements of a number of moderate Republicans and Democrats mean that conservative Republicans wield more power.
Most members of Congress would agree
that the voters sent them a strong message last November - that they prefer cooperation and progress, not gridlock.</P> 

<P>And then there are the legislatively mandated changes in the relationship between Congress and the executive branch that may have sweeping impacts. For the
first time, the president has the power to veto individual line items in spending and taxing bills, and Congress has the power to veto regulations that the Administration wants.</P> 

<P>But some things never seem to change. One is congressional and independent counsel investigations of the conduct of Clinton and his staff,
which show no sign of waning. The
House is mired, and shows signs of remaining so, in interparty conflict over investigations of the conduct of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), whatever the outcome of the vote by the full House on the Ethics Committee's recommendations in his case. Both could come to occupy so much congressional attention that other important issues are
pushed aside. But for now, pledges
of cooperation and willingness to
compromise abound.</P>

<P>With that as background, what can be said to be in store for the chemical community in this 105th Congress, one
that is still taking shape?</P>

<P><b><font color="blue">Budget. </b></font>The context this year, as one congressional staffer puts it, is "budget, budget, budget." Budget policy
is driving science policy and that is
that. "The real question," he says," is how you fit $35 billion [the civilian R&amp;D budget] into a $30 billion box." That is the amount,
$5 billion, by which this staffer
expects the R&D budget to
be reduced. However, several coalitions of scientific societies, universities, and
high-tech corporations will be
threading through the hallways in
attempts to "save" the R&D budget and make it an exception to the overall downward trend in federal spending.</P> 

<img src="bill.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P>Leading these groups in size and money is the Science Coalition, spurred mainly
by Harvard University and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and consisting of several universities, technical societies and associations, and high-tech companies.
This coalition is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Wexler Group, whose president is the just-retired House Science Committee chairman, Robert S. Walker. It will focus on personal relations with key members of Congress instead of high-profile campaigns. The irony is that Walker quite likely will be advocating some of the very issues he opposed while a committee chairman.</P>

<img src="newt.gif" align=right hspace=10> 

<P>While people in the know are saying that the basic science budget - mainly the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health - will enjoy at
least a 3% increase, other research units of government will be taking hits. In terms of tough-to-take declines, most seriously affected will be the Defense Department's Naval
Research Laboratory and Office of Naval Research. There will be pressure to close some
of DOD's research labs as well. Those close to that issue say those labs are 40% overstaffed and due to be cut. One major reason
for the "hit" - some say it could be as much as 25% - is the cost of maintaining troops and rebuilding the infrastructure in Bosnia. However, the Commerce Department's
ATP program will quite likely be spared
again as not constituting a large enough budget item to care much about.</P>

<P>There are some new power players who will be helping to shape
the federal science and technology budget on Capitol Hill this year. Two personages to keep an eye on are F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the House Science Committee, and
the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Ted Stevens of Alaska. Both are, of course, Republicans. Sensenbrenner replaces Walker and Stevens replaces a renowned Republican friend of science, particularly of NIH, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon. Sensenbrenner's agenda is
nowhere near firm - he is still building his staff - and his record is a mixed bag, but what all observers point out is that he and George E. Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), the Science Committee's ranking minority member,
will have a much smoother relationship
compared with the turbulence that existed between Brown and Walker.</P> 

<P><B><font color="blue">Chemical Weapons.</font></B> To date, 67 countries - but not the U.S. or
Russia - have ratified the
Chemical Weapons Convention. Senate approval of the treaty imploded
last September after Republican presidential candidate Robert J. Dole
indicated disapproval of the
accord.</P>

<P>So, as it did last year, the treaty must again wend its way through the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee whose
chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), opposes ratification. Nevertheless, 
Administration sources expect to
reach an agreement with Senate
Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), setting
firm dates for votes
by Helms's committee
and then the full Senate
on treaty ratification. Administration sources tell C&amp;EN they are convinced the Senate will
approve the treaty before
April 29, when it is set to go
into effect.</P>

<P>They base their conviction on
President Clinton's direct engagement in the issue, an involvement
absent since
the U.S. signed
the treaty on
Jan. 13, 1993. For
example, Clinton
took the opportunity offered by his Jan. 7 acceptance of the final report of the presidential panel on Gulf War veterans' illnesses
to "urge Congress to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention."</P>

<P>At that press conference and again on the fourth anniversary of the treaty's
signing, Clinton spoke of security costs to the U.S. should the Senate not ratify the treaty. But there are political and economic consequences as well.</P> 

<P>On the anniversary date, Clinton stressed the economic costs, saying the" economic well-being of our chemical
industry" was at stake. "I urge the Senate to act promptly to ensure that the U.S.
remains at the forefront of international efforts to combat the spread of weapons
of mass destruction, and the U.S. chemical industry maintains its international competitiveness."</P>

<P>According to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's (CMA) best estimate,
direct chemical trade impacts will
amount to $600 million per year "if the trade sanctions provided for in the convention go into effect" before the U.S.
ratifies the treaty, says the association's senior assistant general counsel, Michael P. Walls. This is 1% of the U.S. chemical industry's annual exports, he notes.</P> 

<P>There are unquantifiable impacts too. U.S. industry could be "considered an unreliable supplier in the global marketplace because of the U.S.'s failure to ratify," Walls says. U.S. industry is also concerned that some foreign governments
might use U.S. nonparticipation in the
convention as a pretext for imposing
other barriers to trade, Walls adds.</P> 

<P><B><font color="blue">Energy.</font></B> Although the Republican juggernaut failed to eliminate the Department of Energy from the Cabinet last year, a dramatic overhaul of DOE in this Congress is possible. Other energy issues that will be engaging Congress' attention include the fate of the national laboratories and electric power deregulation.</P> 

<P>Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) is expected to propose a plan this year that
would eliminate DOE but also boost the
profile of the national research laboratories: Two are, after all, located in his home
state. In a back-to-the-future move, the responsibility for nuclear weapons and energy research would be put into a new civilian organization, the same as it was before
the Energy Department was created in
1977. This would undoubtedly give research more visibility since it would no longer be buried in the mammoth DOE
bureaucracy. Will it happen? Some say yes; some say no.
</P>

<P>Electric utility deregulation, however, is the hottest topic facing the two energy committees this Congress. Rep. Dan
Schaefer (R-Colo.), chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy &amp;
Power, will reintroduce legislation left over from last year that would allow consumers to choose a power company as they now choose a long-distance phone
company. This would put retail users, including industrial customers such as chemical plants, in the same markets as
wholesale buyers.</P>

<P><B><font color="blue">Environment.</font></B> It may seem strange, but electric utility deregulation may
also have environmental consequences. Many environmentalists say deregulation could lead to a
major increase in air pollution
because, in some regions, electricity from coal - the dirtiest fuel - is cheaper than that from
any other source. For example,
they fear that under deregulation,
New England, where electricity is
expensive and comes largely
from oil-fired or nuclear plants,
would instead buy cheaper electricity from coal-fired plants in the Ohio Valley.</P>

<P>CMA President and Chief Executive Officer Frederick L. Webber, however, does not expect air
quality to decline because of deregulation. "That argument is based on the assumption that
cheap power is always going to
come from coal," he says, when
in fact much competitive power
comes from natural gas, hydro,
and some of the older nuclear
plants. "If deregulation is done
right, the typical consumer [including CMA member companies] is going to benefit," he says.</P>

<P>Congress also is expected to put a significant amount of effort
this year into reauthorization of
the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup
law. The debate over Superfund now centers on whether the law needs to be restructured to accomplish needed reforms. Some
Environmental Protection Agency sources
indicate that a reauthorized Superfund law is needed to institute major changes. But Justice Department officials say administrative reforms already made and planned obviate the need for fundamental changes in the law. They believe a simple reauthorization of the tax on chemical production that
supports the fund and perhaps codification of what has already been accomplished administratively is all that is needed.</P> 

<P>CMA's Webber couldn't disagree more with this second approach. "We want reform in the areas of liability, funding, and
remedy selection, and we're optimistic
that this is the year to get it," he says. CMA would prefer a total repeal of retroactive liability, but that's not realistic, he explains. Instead, the organization advocates
a fair-share approach in which each polluter pays for its portion of the cleanup, and
cleanup of "orphan shares" - those that can't be assigned to any entity - are paid for by Superfund. This approach would
mean the end of joint-and-several liability, in which one party sometimes must pay
for the total cleanup when other responsible parties cannot be found.</P> 

<center><img src="R&D.gif"></center>

<P>Also on the congressional environmental agenda is legislation to establish an interim storage facility for high level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada,
where a permanent geologic repository is being built. Similar legislation almost
passed the 104th Congress, and many
members are planning to push a similar
bill this year.</P>

<P>Spent nuclear fuel is now being stored on-site at 73 nuclear power plants. A July court decision requires DOE to start accepting the spent fuel by January 1998. But DOE Undersecretary Thomas P. Grumbly said in October that DOE cannot meet that deadline. And DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management argues
that another law prevents it from placing an interim storage facility on the same site as the permanent facility. Outgoing Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary recently said there is no need for an interim facility in 1998 because the geologic repository will be ready to accept spent fuel only 12 years later, by 2010.</P>

<P>An interim storage facility likely would help keep electricity rates down.
The Nuclear Energy Institute
(NEI), the trade association for the
nuclear power industry, argues
that if DOE continues to postpone
its acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel, utilities may have to spend
$5 billion for new on-site storage
facilities. "Reform of the program now rests squarely on the shoulders of the 105th Congress," says NEI President Joe F. Colvin.</P>

<P><B><font color="blue">Food &amp; Drug Administration.</font></B> Efforts will proceed this
year to push through major reforms in operations at FDA. House Commerce Committee
Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) has pledged to make FDA restructuring his top priority this
year. And the Administration is
reportedly drafting its own FDA
reform bill.</P>

<P>Bliley said he is determined to get the agency to speed up the
approval process for new drugs
and medical devices. So among
provisions that might be included in his bill is one that would let private companies take over
some of the responsibility for reviewing new product applications. Last year's high-profile efforts to restructure FDA met with strong opposition from the Clinton
Administration. New legislation involving smaller scale approaches may be more
successful this Congress.</P>

<P>For example, reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act likely will come up early in this Congress. Under
this law, which has been given credit for shortening the time it takes FDA to review new drug applications, the pharmaceutical industry pays FDA user fees. In
exchange, the agency is supposed to
meet specific drug-review deadlines. The law is set to expire in September. The
Administration and industry are said to
be near agreement on a reauthorization bill, and the Administration is expected to send it to Congress shortly.</P>

<P>The Senate also faces the task of confirming a new FDA commissioner. Exiting
Commissioner David A. Kessler takes credit for the significant cuts achieved in drug
approval processing times, but Bliley has said Kessler did so only under the threat of congressional reform action. The Administration has not been very prompt in making appointments to scientific posts, including FDA commissioner, so Kessler may be around for a while. His successor's confirmation is in the hands of the Senate Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee,
which has a new chairman, James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.). The moderate Jeffords has not
been active on the FDA reform issue, but already has announced he will take up the
debate in his full committee, rather than giving it to a subcommittee to handle.</P> 

<center><img src="treaty.gif"></center>
<P><B><font color="blue">Immigration</font></B>. In 1996, the 104th Congress got tough on immigrants - even legal immigrants - but could not pass a bill restricting the numbers of legal immigrants
into the U.S. Now-retired Sen. Alan K.
Simpson (R-Wyo.) led the charge to reduce all types of immigration, including employment-based immigration. "Simpson banged his head against a wall for 18
years," says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington, D.C., Center for
Immigration Studies. "Simpson was frustrated and bitter at the end, but he got a
lot more done than he thinks he did. The climate is really radically different from what it was two years ago."</P> 

<P>Reductions in employment-based immigration are of great concern to scientists and engineers, some of whom believe they are being squeezed out of
good jobs by the foreign born. However,
when the dust settled, restricting U.S. access to "the world's best and brightest"
had proven too unpopular with a broad
coalition of concerns - from industry groups to software developers to trade
unions - to be enacted into law.</P> 

<P>It's still too early to tell where immigration legislation is headed in 1997, because the most crucial decision is yet to be made. As C&amp;EN goes to press, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) hasn't decided if he
wants to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration. If he wants it, he gets it for
reasons of seniority.</P>

<P>Kyl was one of only a few senators who voted for an amendment to Simpson's bill last year that would have cut legal immigration. Krikorian thinks Kyl, if he decides to chair the subcommittee, may
try to get some of the less controversial legal immigration limits - none of which focus on populations some scientists want to see limited - enacted into law.</P> 

<P>However, Kyl is reported to be very interested in other subcommittee assignments - for example, Judiciary's Antitrust, Business Rights &amp; Competition Subcommittee. Poised to pounce on the
chairmanship in the event Kyl refuses it is Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.). Abraham is a vocal opponent of restrictions on legal immigration and would block
any attempts to restrict employment-based immigration to the U.S.</P> 

<P><B><font color="blue">Occupational safety.</font></B> Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.), chairman of the Education&amp; 
Workplace Committee's Subcommittee
on Workplace Protection, says his first priority is a bill, already introduced,
that would allow hourly employees to accrue time off instead of getting cash
payments for overtime work. Such a bill would overturn the 1938 Fair Labor
Standards Act, which required employers to pay their workers overtime wages.
The House passed similar legislation last year, but it was shot down by unions
and the Administration, which said the law gave too much power to management.
</p>

<p>
And Republican leaders may take another stab at crafting a new package of OSHA
reform initiatives, one that incorporates some of the Clinton Administration's
own reinvention plan for the agency. Ballenger does plan to hold hearings on
the progress of OSHA's reinvention efforts. He wants to find out which
initiatives have been the most effective and incorporate them into any reform
bill. Any reform effort is likely to be much more low key than last year's high-
profile efforts, which were criticized as too extreme and held up by some as
an example of the Republican revolution overstepping its mandate.
</p> 

<p><b><font color="blue">Patents.</font></b>
To those following attempts to reform patent law in the U.S., 1997 is shaping
up as d&#233;j&#224;vu all over again. The players have changed a little, but
it's the same game. Just before the House recessed on Jan. 9, Rep. Howard
Coble (R-N.C.) introduced an updated version of H.R. 3460 - legislation 
drafted in the last Congress by two members of the Judiciary Committee who have
now retired - Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Calif.) and Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.).
</p>

<p>
Virtually identical to H.R. 3460, the new bill - the 21st Century Patent
System Imrovement Act (H.R. 400) - is comprehensive legislation. In addition
to providing for the publication of patent applications 18 months after first
filing, the bill converts the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) into a
government corporation. It provides a defense against patent infringement 
charges to parties who have used a patented invention in the U.S. at least one
year before that patent's filing date. It also gives third parties greater
ability to participate in patent reexamination proceedings in the PTO.
</p>

<p>
Last year, this legislation was supported by the Clinton Administration,
Republicans, and Democrats alike. In fact, it was unanimously approved in the
House Judiciary Committee last year, so it has a lot of momentum behind it.
</p>

<p>
Once again, vigorously opposing this bill will be Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-
Calif.), who, according to his staff, will introduce a bill incorporating much
of one bill he introduced in the last session,
H.R. 359. That bill seeks to return patent protection in the U.S. to the way it was before it was changed by international
treaty. In other words, patent protection would once again run 17 years from the
date a patent is granted. Rohrabacher
and his supporters, many of whom are
individual inventors, claim that the 20
years from filing protection results in less protection for them because of extraordinary delays in the patent office.</P> 

<center><img src="micro.gif"></center>

<P><B><font color="blue">Product liability.</font></B> Interest groups on
both sides of the issue expect product
liability legislation
to be introduced
again this year. A
product liability
bill was vetoed by President Clinton in 1995. Consumer groups, such as U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Public Citizens' Congress Watch, are gearing up to fight the issue. They believe tort reform would severely limit legitimate product liability cases that expose dangers, punish
wrongdoers, and provide fair compensation for injured victims. CMA, on the other hand, is very much in favor of tort reform. "Those who supported it in the last
Congress and were disappointed over the veto are going to work hard to get
something going again this year," Webber says. CMA would be satisfied with a
bill like the one that was vetoed.</P> 

<P><B><font color="blue">Regulatory reform.</font></B>  Senate Majority Leader Lott has said regulatory reform will be a high priority in the 105th Congress. But because the reform bill passed by the House last year aroused such a firestorm of criticism, most observers do not expect
regulatory reform to be moved as a stand-alone bill. Instead, it will be incorporated into individual environment or health and safety bills.</P>

<P>The earlier House regulatory reform bill was "mischaracterized" as antienvironmental, says Webber. "We certainly didn't
win the communication battle on that."</P> 

<P>Gregory S. Wetstone, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, holds an opposite view. "The single most sweeping and dangerous environmental threat of the 104th Congress was the backdoor effort to block enforcement of America's environmental laws in
the name of 'regulatory reform,'" he says."  Far from reform, these bills would have
dramatically increased bureaucracy and litigation, while drastically reducing environmental and health
protection."</P>

<P>Congress has always had the power to invalidate agency rules by enacting legislation. But last March, a new
law was passed that gives
Congress potentially
much more influence
over the rule-making process.
Called the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act, it allows Congress to overturn rules that have significant impacts -  those that cost the economy $100 million or more - by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 days after the rules become final.</P>

<center><img src="super.gif"></center>

<P>The test case for this new congressional power may involve new standards for
particulate matter and ozone that are required under the Clean Air Act and were
proposed by EPA late last year. The House  Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on
Oversight & Investigations, chaired by Rep. 
Joe Barton (R-Texas), definitely plans hearings 
on EPA's proposed air rules, and a number
of other committees have expressed
an interest in holding similar hearings.</p>

<p>Industry representatives argue that
science does not support the new standards
and that achieving them would be
extremely disruptive to the economy
costing millions of jobs. They want costs
to be taken into consideration when setting
clean air standards, something that is
prohibited under current law.</p>

<p>Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), one
of the Clean Air Act's principal authors,
maintains that the "guts of the Clean Air
Act are health-based standards. To sacrifice
the standards themselves would be a
fundamental repeal." Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest
(R-Md.) concurs: "To base clean
air standards on anything other than
health is ludicrous." 
Waxman predicts
that a clean air fight this year
would be
"the mother of all environmental fights."</p>

<p><b><font color="blue">Science and technology policy.</font></b> The
new Congress will see a maturation, as it
were, of how the science and technology
are embedded in everyday concerns. This 
week, the National Academy of Sciences,
the National Academy of Engineering,
and the Institute of Medicine as a group were
sending to Congress in the form of white 
papers their own sense of priorities facing
the country. The official unveiling of 
the reports will take place on Jan. 29, but the 
subjects covered in the papers are
known to include education at all levels,
the size and quality of investment needed
in science and technology, and the 
role of the social and behavioral sciences
in helping determine a national science and technology agenda.</p>

<p>Issues in space policy will largely be articulated
in February, when the White House holds its space summit. The value
of space science is hardly contested,
but the space station is another matter, because
of its cost and the uncertainty 
over the ability of Russia to hold to its end of the bargain involving early 
missions. Plans for the Russian mission to its space station
Mir for building the first module of its
promised part of the international (read: primarily U.S.) space station seem to be in doubt. "We just don't know whether the 
Russians are going to deliver or not," says
one House Science Committee staffer. </p>

<p>Information superhighway issues also 
are sure to be debated, including the federal role in paying for some of the new "wiring" of schools, hospitals, and other service institutions-the 
government's attempt to bring computers and
the Internet to these institutions. Of keen
interest lately is the debate over efforts
to copyright the digitized and encrypted 
messages that stream over the Internet.
The U.S. has supported changes in the world copyright treaty before the
World Intellectual Property Organization, which would regard as
intellectual property such free and universally available Internet material.
The information industry will continue to press Congress to allow for
the free flow of information, while proptecting its legitimate intellectual
property.</p>

<p>Overall, what seems to be in the offing, at least in the House Science
Committee, is a series of oversight hearings on the role of science and  
technology in - for lack of a better word - the "remaking" of the system
that is evolving throughout society. How, for example, is managed medical care
affecting the research functions of teaching hospitals? How much of
welfare reform should contain strong efforts to restrain people for the
technical world? Have research universities overbuilt? Are they truly
cutting out the fat, as they say they are? How well have civilian technology
progrmas affected the economy of the country and innovation in 
corporations?</p>

<p>So in sum, the next Congress could represent a watershed in the evolution
of science and technology policy in the U.S. It will not stand out by itself
but will probably seem hidden by events that make up the political
headlines. Space science and technology are undergoing reassessment;
the health care system likewise. Civilian technology as policy is in a
holding pattern. Basic and academic research are also on their own colsolidation course. It is as if the whole country were reassessing itself, determining
what in the end is and isn't important.

<P>A new era begins today for process chemistry, one of the
most innovative areas of industrial organic chemistry and
chemical engineering. The papers in this first issue
of
<I>Organic Process Research &amp; Development</I> demonstrate
the
quality of science and engineering involved in devising a
manufacturing process for a new or existing chemical, and
in solving the problems of scale-up from laboratory to
pilot
plant and beyond. Much of this work would probably
have
remained unpublished without the launch of <I>OPRD</I>.</P>
<P>The new international journal has had a long (and
sometimes painful) birth, resulting from ideas that I had
developed after the success of the Society of Chemical
Industry's Annual Process Development Symposia in the
United Kingdom in the 1980s. Unknown to me, chemists
in the United States were already having similar thoughts.
However, it was not until a similar series of annual
symposia,
organised by a consortium of process groups from six
pharmaceutical companies (Lilly, Abbott, Parke-Davis,
Searle,
Marion Merrell Dow and Upjohn), had been established in
the midwest United States in the 1990s that a mechanism
for realisation of these ideas became clear. The
American
Chemical Society became involved, and their market survey
indicated a wide interest from industrial chemists. The
ACS
was willing to finance the project, and the Royal Society
of
Chemistry agreed to participate and share some of the
financial "risk".</P>
<P>I was delighted to be appointed Editor in 1995 and to
have John Arnett and Richard Pariza (who had been active
in organising the midwest symposia) as Associate Editors.
Our main task is to persuade process R&amp;D chemists and
engineers that publication of their results is important
for
the process R&amp;D community, and that there is, as in all
scientific disciplines, a need to interact and exchange
ideas,
both at symposia and in print. Only then can we
advance
the science and technology.</P>
<P>The Editors have the support of an enthusiastic and
committed Editorial Board, mostly industrially based from
a wide variety of backgrounds and countries. We do
need
your future support, however, and not just in keeping the
circulation figures of <I>OPRD</I> high. We know of the
excellent
work being done in the organic process R&amp;D community-the
results are evident on a tonne scale-but we need a
second
product from you:  information on record. Ideally,
Full
Papers with experimental details are to be the main format
in <I>OPRD</I>, with Notes on shorter procedures which have been
optimised and possibly scaled up being the second preference. In cases where the confidentiality is a problem,
then
a Lecture Transcript, without experimental details, may be
an opportunity to present some information without giving
commercial advantage to competitors.</P>
<P>Of vital concern are reports on the safety of chemical
procedures, particularly where they relate to scale-up.
I
would encourage you to alert your colleagues of any
process
which gives rise to, or has the potential for,
uncontrolled
exotherms or runaway reactions. <I>OPRD</I> is the most
useful
forum for these reports, however brief, since it will be
read
by chemists and engineers involved in process R&amp;D:  your
publication of such data may help to save injuries to
others.</P>
<P>Finally, we would like to hear of new techniques that you
are using (e.g., automation of process R&amp;D, novel
in-process
monitoring techniques, etc.) and applications of recent
technology to process work and scale-up.</P>
<P>We hope that you will enjoy reading this first issue and
that it will encourage you to contribute to the Journal and
to
become a regular subscriber.</P>
<P>I cannot finish this first editorial without giving my
thanks
to all those who have made it possible:  to the ACS and
RSC
for financial commitments; to my Associate Editors and the
Editorial Board; to the management of the process R&amp;D
groups listed earlier for their continued support; and to
those
authors who have already contributed articles, both to
this
issue and to subsequent ones. The Journal has had a
long
history of efforts by numerous individuals at various
stages
of its development, but space precludes mentioning them
all
specifically in this editorial.</P>

<hr noshade>
<P>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations protect 100 million employees in the nation, while 6.5 million employers&#151;from small doctors' offices to huge corporations&#151;are required to comply with OSHA. The federal arm of OSHA inspected 24,024 employers in fiscal 1996, and state organizations inspected 57,199 places of employment.

<P>
You can't know for sure when your lab will be visited&#151;possibly never&#151;but you should be prepared. OSHA most often appears at the door in response to an employee complaint, as part of an enforcement program targeting industries prone to problems, or after an accident in which people were injured or killed. Sometimes another government agency inspecting a facility may suggest that OSHA take a look.

<P>
Because OSHA inspectors won't give you a warning, the best way to prepare for an inspection is to be in compliance. In the event that an inspector does come knocking, it helps to have a plan in place for how to manage the visit.

<P>
<h4><font color="8B4513">The Laboratory Standard</font></h4>
Laboratories of all sizes have a special requirement that governs how they deal with hazardous chemicals. The so-called Laboratory Standard (29 CFR 1910. 1450), which became effective in 1990 and fully enforceable in 1991, requires that employees be aware of the chemical hazards in their workplace and protected from excessive exposure to these chemicals. OSHA promulgated these regulations after almost a decade of discussing the differences between labs and other workplaces. Previously, all employers with laboratories that used chemicals defined as hazardous by the Federal Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910. 1200) had to comply with that standard, which people in laboratories found to be inappropriate and overly burdensome.

<P>
The four-page, 12-part Laboratory Standard, which covers the "laboratory use" of chemicals on a "laboratory scale," has relatively simple requirements: It limits permissible exposure limits (PELs) to chemicals specified in 29 CFR 1910, subpart Z, and requires labs to ensure that employee exposure is below those limits; it requires an employer to develop a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) that's easily accessible to employees and covers eight specific areas; and it requires employees to be informed about and trained on the CHP. The standard also covers requirements for medical consultation and exams for employees exposed to hazardous levels of chemicals, proper labeling of hazardous chemicals and maintenance of MSDSs, the use of respirators, and record keeping.

<P>
On the federal level in fiscal year 1996, Laboratory Standard violations were cited 45 times in 25 inspections, for a total of $18,525 in initial penalties. Most of these citations were for problems with the CHP (1910.1450 (e)) and employee information and training (1910.1450 (f)). Although citations for PELs (1910.1450 (c)) were few, penalties were high. Employers cited included a clinic; hospitals; a paint manufacturer; several chemical and allied products, health services, testing, and research laboratories;  and a soap maker.

<P>
Although the Laboratory Standard isn't a big citation or penalty source nationwide, it can be a problem for particular industries. For example, 1910.1450 was the top source of citations (if not fines) for industries classified by the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes as Research, Development, and Testing Services (8730), Commercial and Biological Research Facilities (8731), and Testing Laboratories (8734). 

<P>
Depending on the type of laboratory, other top problems include Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records (1910.0020), General Materials Handling (1910.0176), Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (1910.0120), Flammable and Combustible Liquids (1910.0106), and Personal Protective Equipment, General Requirements (1910.0132). 

<P>
The Laboratory Standard requires a lab to define how it protects employees against hazardous chemicals, and if an employer's compliance with the standard is excellent, it's less likely that other problems will arise.

If you're concerned about what a surprise inspection might 
uncover, invite OSHA for a consultative visit</i></font></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>
<h4><font color="8B4513">Diary of an OSHA inspection</font></h4>
Richard E. Fairfax, industrial hygienist at OSHA's Health Compliance Assistance Office, performed site inspections across the country for 15 years. "Most of our inspections in labs are associated with other inspections of facilities that happen to have a lab on site," he says. Fairfax described how a typical inspection works, although he notes that "every inspector probably does it a little differently." The general outline for an inspection is as follows. 

<P>
* &#009;&#009;The inspector arrives, asks to speak to the top management on the site, shows his or her credentials, and tells the employer the reason for the visit. If it is an employee complaint, a copy of the complaint is provided and the identity of the complainant is kept confidential.

<P>
* &#009;&#009;A standard opening conference is held, and the inspector will ask that an employee representative or union representative be present. In the conference, the inspector reviews employee and employer rights and responsibilities and talks about the scope of the inspection. 

<P>
* &#009;&#009;The inspector usually will begin by looking at paperwork: accident and injury records, written programs, and records of any sampling or monitoring (of air quality, for example). 

<P>
* &#009;&#009;Next is a walk-around of the facility. The employer has a right to accompany the inspector, who will look at processes, interview people, and verify training with employees. 

<P>
*  &#009;At the closeout conference, the inspector will announce any violations that have been found and give the employer suggestions on how to remedy these and any other problems. 

<P>
The decision as to whether a facility will be cited and fined is not made on site. The area director makes the final decision on whether to issue citations and levy fines. Citations are classified as "serious" or "other." A serious violation is anything that can cause death or a serious injury or illness&#151;for example, a piece of protruding equipment that could bruise someone who bumped against it would not be classed as a serious violation. Penalties for serious violations begin at $7000, but this fine can be adjusted on the basis of various considerations, including such factors as the size of the organization, demonstration of good faith, and absence of a history of OSHA violations. After adjustments are made, the average penalty assessed winds up being about $700 or $800.

<P>
OSHA's <I>Field Inspector's Reference Manual</I> offers a more detailed look at inspection procedures, gives information on how penalties are figured, and  describes post-inspection procedures, including how a settlement with OSHA is negotiated. The manual is available on OSHA's Web site at <a href="http://www.osha.gov"><b>(http://www.osha.gov)</b></a>, through a link to the agency's computerized information system (OCIS) arm in Salt Lake City.

<P>
<h4><font color="8B4513">What you can learn from OSHA</font></h4>
The <I>Field Inspector's Reference Manual</I> isn't the only helpful piece of information you can get from OSHA's Web site. Information on violations and fines can be searched by SIC code or standard number. You can also find the text of the Lab Standard and copies of letters of interpretation from OSHA on the standard on the Web.

<P>
If you're concerned about what a surprise visit from an inspector might turn up, you can always invite OSHA yourself. The agency offers free consultative services, geared to small to medium-sized employers with up to 250 workers, that can be tailored to your requirements&#151;with very few strings attached. If an employer asks for a consultative visit, it can be limited to a particular area. Inspectors will note any problems they see and will do basically anything requested&#151;conduct a training session for employees, review a CHP, and so on. No citations will be made. However, if the inspector does note any problems, the employer must make arrangements to correct them. If problems aren't addressed, the consultative service has the right to inform OSHA. 

<P>
Fairfax says the consultative service is extremely popular, with waiting lists in many states. At OSHA's Web site, you can find specific information on how the consultations work and who to call in your state to set one up.

<P>
"People should be much more relaxed about inviting OSHA to come in and give them the free, no-fines inspection service," says James A. Kaufman, president of James A. Kaufman &amp; Associates in Natick, MA. "You do earn the credit, the recognition for being proactive."

<P>
<h4><font color="8B4513">Up-front organization can impress</font></h4>
In demonstrating compliance to an inspector, "record keeping is really critical," says Tom Shelley, chemical hygiene officer (CHO) for Cornell University's Department of Environmental Health and Safety. At the university's main campus in Ithaca, NY, there are 5600 lab workers, 3800 lab rooms, and 1200 registered chemical fume hoods. Nearly half of the university's building space is devoted to labs. 

<P>
&#009;When Shelley came on board as CHO about two years ago, the CHP was adequate but in need of some revision. Faculty members were not as aware of the need for compliance as they are currently. Faculty and staff are now more attuned to regulatory requirements: Now there are one or more safety representatives in every university department, a written, university-wide health and safety policy approved by top management, and regular self-audits and self-inspections of labs in many departments.

<P>
In addition to revising the CHP, Shelley is helping to set up a central committee on laboratory and chemical safety. "You need to have 'buy-in' from faculty and staff on new and existing safety programs to facilitate compliance," he notes.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><center><B><I><FONT COLOR=#01A0C6>It's vital
to have a CHP that reflects 
the real world<br>--not an ideal one</FONT></I></B></center>
</H2>
<hr>
<P>
Last year, an OSHA inspector came to Cornell as part of an inspection of 20 colleges and universities in the region. The inspector spent an hour&#151;maybe less&#151;going over the university's CHP, training records, and respiratory protection policy. Apparently, the inspector thought this was evidence enough of Cornell's compliance with OSHA and did not feel it necessary to go further. "If your records are really comprehensive," Shelley says, "they may not even choose to go out on campus."

<P>
The key points of Cornell's protocol are that when OSHA arrives, Shelley and his director are called immediately to accompany the inspector on the rounds. "We would go with the OSHA inspector through the plant and document everything they did," says Shelley. Making sure that a knowledgeable person on the university staff is monitoring what an inspector notices and answering questions in an informed way can help avoid later misunderstandings.

<P>
<h4><font color="8B4513">Keeping in compliance</font></h4>
Shelley's role at Cornell demonstrates the importance of having a CHO to oversee compliance with the Lab Standard&#151;and of having top management demonstrate a commitment to compliance. OSHA requires that an employer covered by the Lab Standard have a CHO, and industry has recognized that such a person can be extremely helpful. In fact, the American Chemical Society is developing a certification program for CHOs. (See <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/chas/97/janfeb/
surv.html"><b>Tell <i>CH&S</i></b></a>).

<P>
But compliance with the Lab Standard and a dedication to safety in general can't be just one person's responsibility&#151;no matter how skilled and persuasive he or she is, says Kaufman. "Inspecting your own labs isn't difficult to do. It's often left as the responsibility of a few people. But everyone in the lab should be involved in the inspection process, from lab workers to administrators. . . . It should be everyone looking out for each other."

<P>
Laboratory size may play a role in the economics of compliance, points out Lou DiBerardinis, an industrial hygiene officer in the Environmental Medical Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Smaller colleges, universities, and research facilities may be falling through the cracks, he says, but financial constraints need not be a barrier if the commitment is there. "It's time-consuming, and it requires perhaps some change in people's habits and culture," he says. "There also has to be the emphasis from the right people&#151;upper management."

<P>
Finally, it's vital to have a CHP that reflects the real world&#151;not an ideal one. OSHA inspectors are not going to appreciate a plan that's perfect in its rigorousness; they want to see a plan that's followed. DiBerardinis advises, "Don't write something that you're not going to do. OSHA is going to enforce what you say your rules are."

INDUSTRY</b></h1></center></font>
<h3><font color="red"><i>In addition to those specifically educated in food chemistry,
analytical chemists, organic chemists, natural product chemists,

<a href="auth2.html"><h3>James N. BeMiller</h3></a>
<hr noshade>
<p>The food, beverage, and confection
industry, often referred to simply as the food industry, accounts for a
considerable percentage of the gross domestic product in the US, making
it one of the largest industries. Most scientists and engineers
employed in the food industry fall into three broad categories:
chemists; microbiologists; and food, mechanical, and chemical
engineers. Chemical scientists improve or maintain the nutritional
quality, safety, sensory quality, stability, and/or convenience of food
products. Employment opportunities range from large multinational
companies, which include ingredient and packaging suppliers, to small
local companies.</p> 

<P>Food chemists are concerned with the composition and properties of food
products and the chemical and physical changes they undergo during
postharvest handling, processing, storage, and preparation. Developing
and maintaining the quality of food products is accomplished primarily
through the application of analytical chemistry, biochemistry, organic
chemistry, and physical chemistry; but molecular biology and the
biological sciences also are relevant. 
</P>


<P>In addition to those specifically educated in food chemistry,
analytical chemists, organic chemists, natural product chemists,
physical chemists, biopolymer chemists, biochemists, and chemical
engineers are employed in the food and related industries. Polymer
physicists and materials scientists are increasingly in demand.</p>
<center><img src="bemill.gif"></center>
<p><h3><font color="8B4513">FOODS</font></h3>
Chemical scientists are involved in quality assurance,
research, and food product development. Any discussion of the role of
chemical scientists in maintaining or improving the quality of food
requires an understanding that most food consumed in developed
countries has been processed in some way. Even "fresh" fruits and
vegetables are processed before shipping; often, they are treated after
harvesting to enhance shelf life and control organoleptic (sensory)
characteristics. Chemists determine the most effective type of
processing treatment for each food product. 
</P>


<P>Foods are complex, heterogeneous biological materials. Some may be
respiring (meat, fruits, and vegetables), although no longer growing;
some may be capable of growth (seeds and eggs). Food products are most
often made from disrupted tissues such as flour; fruit and vegetable
purees and juices; and isolated carbohydrates, proteins, and vegetable
oils. Food chemists also deal with milk, a biological fluid, and
single-cell sources of food such as eggs, yeast, and other
microorganisms. Food products are often highly hydrated, but their
moisture content may vary from more than 95 percent to less than 4
percent. 
</P>


<P>Appearance, color, flavor, and texture are important aspects of
the organoleptic quality of foods. Texture is the response to forces
involved in chewing, swallowing, cutting, or spreading. Texture may be
described by qualitative terms such as crispness, firmness, or
cohesiveness, and/or quantified by physicochemical measurements.
Instability of foods, which limits their shelf life, can be caused by
chemical reactions, biochemical reactions, or physical changes.
Stability and instability are related to the composition of the food
and the physical states, spatial arrangements (supermolecular networks,
emulsions, foams, or films), and dynamics of its components.</p>
<p><h3><font color="8B4513">FOOD PRODUCTS CHANGE</font></h3>
Factors that govern changes in the stability of food during
production and storage are the chemical properties of individual
constituents (including those naturally occurring in the tissues being
processed and any catalysts present), oxygen content, pH, water
activity, glass transition temperatures, temperatures encountered,
times spent at those temperatures, composition of the atmospheres to
which the product is exposed, exposure to light, and/or physical
treatments that might release compartmentalized enzymes. 
</P>


<P>Desirable and undesirable changes may occur in the texture, flavor,
color, nutritive value, and/or safety of the product. Changes in
texture may be such things as either a toughening or a softening, a
loss or gain in solubility, or a loss or gain in water-holding
capacity. Typical flavor changes may be caused by the development of
hydrolytic or oxidative rancidity, other off-flavors, cooked or caramel
flavors, or other desirable flavors. Typical color changes include
darkening or bleaching and the development of desirable colors and
off-colors. Changes in nutritive value may arise from either increases
in bioavailability or losses of proteins, starch, vitamins, lipids, or
minerals. Changes in safety may arise from the development or loss of
substances that are protective of health or the generation or
inactivation of toxic substances. 
</P>


<P>The impact of chemistry on food products occurs at all points in the
system - during postharvest storage, processing, postprocessing storage,
transportation, supermarket and home storage, and preparation. The
chemistry may include enzyme- and non-enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which
may be desirable or undesirable; changes in physical states of
molecules and supermolecular structures; changes in the structures
themselves, which are created or broken down via changes in inter- and
intramolecular forces; thermodynamics of the reactions and phase
changes; kinetics of the reactions and phase changes; and various
physicochemical phenomena such as rheology. 
</P>


<P>Examples of desirable and undesirable reactions that must be controlled
can be found in the formation of colors and flavors. In some foods,
such as bakery and breakfast cereal products, the formation of brown
color (and associated flavors) is desirable (up to a point), whereas in
fruit and vegetable products, browning is undesirable. The flavors
produced by culturing milk to make yogurt and by frying when making
French fries are desirable, whereas the rancid flavor resulting from
oxidation of fats and oils, such as in roasted peanuts, is undesirable.
Physical changes may be related to glass transitions and, sometimes,
subsequent melting of partially crystalline biopolymers. Physical
changes also occur in oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, and they
may also involve the formation of foams and films. Crystallization is
important in either a positive or negative sense in many products.
Controlling crystal size is important for forming the right texture in
ice cream and chocolate. 
</P>


<P>Reactions and changes in physical state are functions of processing and
storage conditions - for example, normal thermal processing versus
ultra-high-temperature processing versus minimal thermal processing,
freezing, baking, and refrigeration. The nature of the processing
conditions and the resulting chemistry depend on the nature of the end
product: canned, frozen, dehydrated, or ready-to-eat meals.</p>
<p><h3><font color="8B4513">CONTROLLING CHANGES</font></h3>
Chemical reactions are often a function of moisture content;
temperature; and the presence of light, oxygen, enzymes, or metal ion
catalysts. These reactions may be controlled by adding compounds such
as antioxidants and sequestrants, maintaining a certain water activity,
or designing proper packaging. In newer packaging, such as that used to
prevent browning of precut vegetables and fruits used in supermarket
salad bars, the atmosphere has been modified. Active packaging
<bx>materials may contain UV-absorbing; antimicrobial; or oxygen-,
ethylene-, moisture-, or carbon dioxide-scavenging substances. 
</P>


<P>Chemists must be concerned with the public's fear of food additives,
which is tied to a fear of chemicals, even though additives are used to
improve the quality, variety, convenience, and nutritive value of our
food and have been determined to be safe. At the same time, chemists
guard against adulteration of food. Over the past two centuries,
concern about adulteration of the food supply in the US has been almost
eliminated, but food processors must be vigilant in ensuring the
purity, safety, and quality of ingredients supplied to them. 
</P>


<P>Ensuring the safety of food means that chemical and microbiological
aspects must be monitored. Chemical safety is ensured primarily by
analyzing food for trace residues of pesticides. The most common way to
provide microbiological safety, other than thermal processing, is by
reducing water activity or lowering the pH, but both influence other
attributes such as flavor, color, and texture. Biostatic agents may
also be added.</p>
<p><h3><font color="8B4513">PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</font></h3>
There is a definite relationship between the composition of
the product and processing conditions, applicable chemistry, product
texture, cost, and any subsequent preparation required. Examples of
variable product compositions include regular hot dogs and ice cream
versus low- or no-fat versions, and jellies and jams containing sugar
versus those containing non-nutritive sweeteners. Variable subsequent
preparation requirements might be microwave heating of frozen foods;
hydration of instant soups, sauces, and puddings; and baking of
refrigerated doughs. Thus, food product formulations are extremely
important. 
</P>


<P>Team approaches are most often used in problem solving. For example, a
team might look into a new formulation, devise a new processing scheme,
determine the factors affecting storage stability, and troubleshoot
problems arising from a new ingredient source or climatic conditions
affecting an ingredient. A chemist might have to determine the
properties related to safety and quality, decide which specific
chemical and biochemical reactions influence the quality or
wholesomeness of the product, and apply this knowledge to control these
reactions. 
</P>


<P>Producing more healthful foods is a major thrust of food companies. The
variety of approaches includes fortification of foods, work toward
understanding the physical and chemical basis of digestibility and
nondigestibility, development and use of non-nutritive sweeteners and
fat sparers (fat mimetics and replacers), and determination of the
physiological role of dietary fiber. Included in this effort is the
development of therapeutic and functional foods, that is, foods with
definite, specific effects on the prevention, control, or cure of
certain diseases.

</p>

<p>Cellulose-based materials such as
wastepaper make up ~40% of solid waste streams. In recent
years, an impressive array of new technologies has been developed to
address the problems associated with recycling these materials. New
processes for de-inking printed stock use novel screening systems and
sophisticated flotation techniques. Bleaching sequences without the use
of chlorine or chlorine compounds are also under investigation in
various research laboratories around the world. However, these
technologies do not effectively address the problem of stickies,
dioxins, and microbes in the wastepaper feedstock.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color="blue">Recycled paper contaminants</font></h3>
One problem in using recycled fibers is the presence of sticky
contaminants, often called stickies. These compounds are made up mostly
of organic adhesives and tackifiers used in paper conversion (processes
performed after paper manufacture, such as coating and printing),
including styrene-butadiene rubbers, acrylates, and poly(vinyl
acetate). When wastepapers containing stickies are defibered, the
stickies are broken down into 0.05- to 0.5-mm particles. Stickies in
recycled paper fibers reduce paper quality and cause paper machine
downtime. Environmentally hazardous solvents are sometimes required to
clean wires, felts, presses, rolls, and drying cylinders fouled by
stickies deposition. Current methods of dealing with stickies (e.g.,
additives and sophisticated separation processes) are not sufficient to
completely solve the problem. Eliminating stickies through careful
feedstock selection has proved unreliable and difficult to implement. 
</P>


<P>Another issue associated with wastepaper reuse is the probable presence
of small quantities of dioxins and other chlorinated organic compounds.
Kraft pulps may contain small but detectable levels of dioxins and
related compounds, especially if their bleaching process used elemental
chlorine. Bleached Kraft fibers under many guises (e.g., coated paper
and ledger paper) are often present in substantial quantities in
wastepaper purchased from commercial dealers. Clapp and co-authors
(<I>1</i>) reported that many recycled fiber feedstocks contain up
to 1200 ppm AOX (a broad group of halogenated organics, of which
dioxin and dibenzofurans are a subset). 
</P>

<center><img src="diox.gif"></center>

<P>Additionally, cleanliness and sanitation issues arise when using
postconsumer recycled paper products. It is desirable to inactivate any
potentially pathogenic organisms in the feedstock in the event that
bleaching steps such as ozonation (which is presumed to sanitize) are
not used.
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color="blue">Dissolving the problems</font></h3>
We set out to determine whether CO<sub>2</sub> and propane,
under various conditions, are suitable solvents for dealing with
contaminants such as dioxins and related chlorinated organic compounds.
</P>

<P><b>Dioxin extraction.</b> We selected recycled paper representing
both soft and hard wood fibers; it included white and colored ledger
grades and coated sulfate (magazine) papers. We ground the papers using
a Wiley Mill to particle sizes of &#60;0.5mm and then spiked them
with 232 ppt <sup>13</sup>C-dioxin. 
</P>

<P>Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> solvent extraction conditions were
71 &#176;C and 34.5 MPa. We measured extraction efficiencies using a 3-L
batch extractor (depicted in Figure 1) and a supercritical
CO<sub>2</sub> solvent-to-feed weight ratio of 105. With
high-resolution GC/MS, we analyzed the dioxin concentration in samples
from the feed and the extracted product (five samples from each).
Dioxin extraction efficiencies were up to 95%. 
</P>

<center><img src="fig1.gif"></center>

<P>We performed similar experiments using supercritical propane at
125&#176;C, 34.5 MPa, and a solvent-to-feed weight ratio of 30. In
these experiments, however, we spiked the feed sample with 232 ppt
<sup>13</sup>C-dioxin and analyzed feed and extracted product samples
for both native (unlabeled) and spiked (labeled) dioxin. 
</P>

<P>Supercritical propane removed 95% of the spiked dioxin and only 85%
of the native dioxin. This is not surprising. It suggests that the
native dioxin is more sterically trapped inside the fiber interstices
or that the binding energy of the older, native dioxin is stronger than
that of the spiked dioxin. This finding is in agreement with that of
Hawthorne, as reviewed in Majors (<I>2</i>), who found that spiked
naphthalene in sludge was extracted faster than naphthalene in aged
sludge contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons. 
</P>

<P><b>Stickies extraction.</b> We ground paper fibers containing
stickies -- ice cream cartons, paper pads with adhesive bindings, and
book bindings -- to particle sizes of &#60;0.5 mm in a Wiley Mill.
In a procedure similar to that used for the experiments described
earlier, we extracted the paper with CO<sub>2</sub> at 60 &#176;C,
34.5 MPa, and a solvent-to-feed ratio of 30. We determined the
percentage of extractables in the feed and in the extracted product
using standard Soxhlet extractions. The Soxhlet extraction solvents
used were hexane, methylene chloride, acetone, and ethanol-benzene.
Extraction efficiencies for stickies removal ranged from 55 to 79%,
depending on the solvent used (Table 1). 
</P>

<center><img src="table1.gif"></center>

<P>We performed experiments similar to supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>
extraction with supercritical propane at 125 &#176;C and 34.5 MPa and a
solvent-to-feed ratio of 30. Stickies extraction efficiencies were
69-98%, depending on the Soxhlet extraction solvent used. Another
experiment using supercritical propane at 125 &#176;C and only 8.26 MPa
gave stickies extraction efficiencies of 42-93% (Table 2). 
</P>

<center><img src="table2.gif"></center>
<P>IR spectra of Soxhlet extraction residues indicated that hexane did not
remove stickies, only the natural wood extractives such as resins and
fatty acids. All other solvents (and solvent blends) showed that
styrene-butadiene, poly(vinyl acetate), and other representative
stickies remained in their extracts. 
</P>

<P><b>Microbe inactivation.</b> We performed similar experiments
extracting recycled fibers with CO<sub>2</sub> at 60 &#176;C, 34.5 MPa
(5000 psi), and a solvent-to-feed ratio of 30 (20-min exposure time).
Analysis of feed samples and extracted product samples confirmed
inactivation of all endogenous yeast and mold spores. This is not
surprising, because CO<sub>2</sub> is a waste product of these
microbes (an organism's waste products are often toxic to that
organism).
</p>
<p> 
<h3><font color="blue">Economics</font></h3>
We analyzed engineering cost in detail using a CHEMCAD
computer-aided design system on a solvent batch extraction process.
Costs of using supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as the solvent,
supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> with an entrainer as the solvent, and
supercritical propane as the solvent were compared. 
</P>

<P>The plant design was for a 100 bone-dry ton per day recycled pulp and
paper facility. We assumed that extractions were limited by the
solubility of the contaminants and ignored matrix effects because of
the limited amount of experimental data from the extraction
experiments. We assumed a solvent loss rate of 1% per circulation,
which is probably higher than an actual plant would run. Note that
operating temperatures and pressures were not yet optimized for this
analysis. We assumed that the use of an ethanol cosolvent at
concentrations of 5% in CO<sub>2</sub> would give an entrainer effect
(in the form of a solubility multiplier) of 3. The validity of this
assumption is debatable; however, it is not unusual to experience
entrainer effects much higher than 3 in such systems, especially if the
solutes have polar groups that would interact with the polar hydroxyl
group on ethanol. We assumed that the cost of drying the fibers before
using CO<sub>2</sub> and ethanol as the solvent (to prevent azeotrope
formation of ethanol-water) was relatively small. 
</P>

<P>The solute's solubility in propane was estimated to be 50 times
greater than in CO<sub>2</sub>. This estimate takes into account two
factors: The higher temperatures used in the propane extractions give a
solute vapor pressure ~20 times higher than that under the
CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, and it was assumed that propane had an
enhancement factor roughly two to three times higher than that for
CO<sub>2</sub> at the same reduced temperature. 
</P>

<P>We designed a semibatch process that used a continuous flow of
supercritical fluid (SCF). In our design, the solids were loaded in
parallel into several steel extraction vessels with high tensile
strength, processed, and then unloaded. We reduced the pressure of the
SCF stream in a separate blowdown vessel set at 5.2 MPa and recycled
the SCF. A purge compressor removed residual SCF from the extraction
vessels before they were opened, returning the residual SCF to the main
compressor at 5.2 MPa. A granular activated carbon polishing step at
the lower pressure provides the option to reduce contaminant levels in
the SCF recycle stream. 
</P>

<P>A supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> semibatch extraction facility, without
the use of an entrainer, shows an initial capital investment of
$74 million with an ongoing operating cost of $0.33/lb of bone-dry
fibers (Figure 2). Adding a 5% ethanol entrainer allows us to reduce
the solvent-to-feed ratio, decreasing overall process costs
significantly and resulting in an initial capital investment of
$40 million and an operating cost of $0.17/lb of bone-dry fibers. 
</P>

<center><img src="fig2.gif"></center>

<P>When supercritical propane is used as a solvent, the batch process can
be run at much lower pressures than when supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>
is used. Because propane is flammable, we designed the plant to flush
the extraction vessels with nitrogen during unloading to prevent the
formation of any explosive mixture and then flare the propane. We
designed the plant so that the vessel was opened only when the mixture
was beyond any possibility of explosion. When closing the vessel, the
same process would be done in reverse to remove oxygen. This method had
the lowest projected cost of the three methods discussed here; the
initial capital investment would be $13 million, with operating costs
of $0.067/lb of bone-dry fibers (Figure 3).
</p>

<center><img src="fig3.gif"></center>

<h3><font color="blue">Results and follow-up</font></h3>
SCF extraction removed 85-95% of dioxins and 64-91%
of stickies from sample recycled paper fibers. For stickies removal,
supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> at 34.5 MPa performed better than
supercritical propane at 8.26 MPa and worse than supercritical propane
at 34.5 MPa. Initial data show inactivation of common yeast and mold
spores during supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> extraction.
Preliminary economic analyses indicate that operating costs for a
system using CO<sub>2</sub> with 5% ethanol cosolvent may cost
nickels per pound of fibers treated, whereas liquid propane would cost
pennies per pound. The associated fire hazards with the use of propane
make CO<sub>2</sub>-based systems potentially more attractive. 
</P>

<P>We stress that these promising results represent only the initial
stages of a research program. Kimberly-Clark Corp. holds four U.S.
patents related to this work (<I>3-6</i>). With technique
refinements and imaginative modification of the basic supercritical
solvents, extraction efficiencies and process economics will probably
improve. Keeping this in mind, we recommend the following steps for
further development work:
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the effect of entrainers on enhancing removal of
stickies and chlorinated organics such as dioxins. 
<li>Investigate the ability of supercritical conditions to inactivate
spiked pathogens such as hepatitis and strep. 
<li>Obtain design data for solubilities and partitioning kinetics of
stickies and dioxins (or model compounds that are less toxic but mimic
dioxin in chemical nature). 
<li>Reassess economic analyses with revised data. 
</ul>
</p>

<TITLE>What if you are defamed?</TITLE></HEAD>

<H1>CHEMTECH</H1>
<h2>January 1997</h2>
CHEMTECH <b>1997</b>, <i>27</i>(1), 47-49.<br><br>
<h5><hr noshade>Copyright &#169; 1996 by Phillip M. Perry.<br>
Published 1997 by the American Chemical Society.<hr noshade></h5>

<p><h3><center><i><font color="8B2252">What if you are defamed?</font></i>
</center></h3>
What should you do if your own business becomes the target of disparaging
remarks by a competitor? Let the matter go unaddressed, and your profits
may suffer as your competitor spreads false information about your
business practices. Do the wrong thing, and you may end up in a worse
situation.</P>

<p>"Resist the temptation to start a counter-campaign of rumors about your
competitor," says Jeff Kaplan, partner in the New York law firm of Arkin,
Schaffer & Kaplan, which has represented many defamed businesses. "Two wrongs
do not make a right in this business." The big risk here is that your campaign
will backfire and you will become the target of a lawsuit. Furthermore, you
may be mistaken about who is spreading the rumor. "It's often difficult to
determine the source of the defamation," says Kaplan. "Some businesses have
employed private investigators to either catch the defamer in the act, or
trace the rumor back to its source."</p>

<p>Getting solid evidence of the rumor's source is the biggest step. "Once you
have done that, you are most of the way there," says Kaplan. Your attorney's
first step is likely to send a letter to the competitor, citing violations of
the federal Lanham Act, says Paul Batista. "I point out what is inaccurate in
describing the client's business."</p>

<p>Businesses guilty of falsely representing competitors' services or products
are subject to what the courts call "compensatory damages," which is financial
compensation equal to the damages sustained by the target. What if you feel you
cannot accurately assess the damages you have sustained? Should you refrain
from serving a complaint on a company? Not at all, says Batista. The simple
act of serving a complaint can scare the competitor enough to halt the rumors
and may even result in an out-of-court financial settlement.</p>

<p>State laws protect your business against defamation. So does the federal
Lanham Act, as amended in 1988. "Congress has made a gift to you in the form
of the Lanham Act," says Batista. "If you can say a competitor is making
misleading statements--we can get into federal court. We can make the other
side stop it. That's a real sea change from the laws of the past."</p>

Papers from the Conference on Formulations and Drug Delivery, <br>
Held on October 10-13, 1995, in Boston, Massachusetts
<P>
During October 1995, the American Chemical Society's Division of Biochemical
Technology sponsored a conference that brought together scientists from a
wide variety of academic and industrial locations.  The discussions centered
on the rapid rise of biotechnology that has recently lead to the development
of drugs based on peptides, proteins, polysaccharides, and polynucleotides.
The December 1996 issue of the <I>Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences</I> contains a
selection of the papers presented at that forum, focusing on the successes
and disappointments of these higher molecular weight drugs in terms of their
formulation and delivery.
<P>
This special issue of the <I>Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences</I> is your primary
source for accessing these influential papers in this important
pharmaceutical area.  The Table of Contents of the issue is shown below.
<P>
The price of this special issue of the <I>Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences</I> is

<H3 ALIGN=left><A NAME="what">What does The American Ireland Fund do with 
the money it raises?</A></H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>The American Ireland Fund (AIF) seeks to fulfill a 
profound pledge made to the people of Ireland, North and South: that 
its support of Ireland-based programs will advance the causes of peace, 
culture, and charity. With $80 million already raised, AIF is the 
nation's largest private-sector foundation dedicated to helping the 
people of Ireland help themselves.
</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Through grants from a few thousand dollars to $50,000, 
The American Ireland Fund supports hundreds of projects in every county 
of Ireland each year. For many projects, a seed grant from The Fund 
provides the leverage necessary to qualify for additional monies from 
government agencies and other organizations.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>The conflict in Northern Ireland and the need for peace 
and reconciliation in Ireland, North and South, attract a large measure 
of The American Ireland Fund's support. But its work goes much further 
to meet the challenges of building a new Ireland with competence and 
determination. American Ireland Fund grants attach widespread, endemic 
unemployment. They search out the root causes of inner-city deprivation 
and rural depopulation. The enhancement of Ireland's unparalleled cultural 
heritage is also a key element of the AIF.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Return to top of Page</A>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="how">How does The Fund raise money for peace, culture,
and charity?</H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>The American Ireland Fund relies on the generosity of
thousands of Americans of Irish background as well as their friends
and business colleagues.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>In more than a dozen U.S. cities, American Ireland Fund
events range from elegant black-tie dinners to relaxing golf 
tournaments. Fund supporters are invited to attend special benefit 
performances by the very best in Irish theater and music. Contributions
of any size may also be made directly to The American Ireland Fund.
All gifts are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>The American Ireland Fund is assisted by the Irish
Advisory Committee, based in Dublin. Qualified volunteers from all 
segments of Irish society assess grant applications and prepare them
for review by The Fund's Board of Directors. To ensure contributions
are used properly and that donors' intentions have been honored, the 
Irish Advisory Committee reviews the progress of all projects to 
which grants have been made.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>The Fund's efforts have already forged strong and
lasting links between Americans and the Irish people. Our achievements
are possible only through the generosity and concern of our thousands
of supporters.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Return to top of Page</A>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="when">How and when did the AIF get started?</A></H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>The American Ireland Fund traces its roots to 1963 
when President John F. Kennedy made his historic visit to Ireland and, 
with President of Ireland Eamon de Valera, helped found the American 
Irish Foundation. A group of business leaders including Anthony
J.F. O'Reilly, now Heinz Company Chairman, President, and CEO, and 
Daniel Rooney, President of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, organized 
The Ireland Fund in 1976.</P

<P ALIGN=justify>The Ireland Fund and the American Irish Foundation, like
The American Ireland Fund today, were nonpolitical and nonsectarian and 
committed to raising funds in the United States for support of worthy 
causes in Ireland, North and South. In 1987, at a Washington, D.C., 
ceremony attended by President Reagan the two foundations merged 
to become the American Ireland Fund.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Today, partner Ireland Funds in Australia, Canada, 
Great Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand, Japan and South 
Africa make up a Confederation of Concern that helps unite
the more than 70 million people of Irish ancestry worldwide.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Return to top of Page</A>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="how much">How much money has The Fund directed to Ireland 
to date?</H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>In the last six years, The American Ireland Fund
and its affiliated Funds have raised more than $27 million. In the same
period, grants of more than $19 million have been made to projects in
the areas of community development, education, reconciliation, and 
culture. The American Ireland Fund's General Endowment Fund exceeds
$6 million.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Return to top of Page</A>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="difference">How do grants from The American Ireland Fund 
make a difference in Ireland?</H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>In every sense, The American Ireland Fund is
entrepreneurial and willing to take risks when the potential for human
dividends is high. It is often the first group to show a project in
Ireland that someone else believes in what their people can do and is
willing to stake something on that. In many cases, American Ireland Fund
grants come long before other foundations and government agencies are
willing to commit their money.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Among the most successful grants were those made in 
the early 1980s to Derry's Inner City Trust and the North-West Centre
for Learning and Development. Anyone who has visited Derry recently
can't help but notice the changes that have taken place. Ruins have 
become restaurants, bombed-out buildings are libraries and shops.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>In North Belfast, The Fund has assisted the Flax Trust
in rebuilding an abandoned linen mill into a bustling small business
center that attracts ambitious, hardworking men and women from the 
city's Catholic and Protestant communities. In Dublin, The Fund has
helped revive a once-dying cultural landmark, Marsh's Library, the 
city's oldest library. In Limerick, the city's historic center now 
welcomes residents and visitors with attractive shops and museums,
thanks to a $50,000 flagship grant.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Taking risks for the cause of peace and reconciliation,
The American Ireland Fund began its support of integration when the first
such school, Lagan College (the equivalent of an American high school)
opened in 1981 with just 30 pupils. Lagan now has an enrollment exceeding
700. It is one of 20 integrated schools in Northern Ireland teaching peace
along with math, science, and literature.</P>

<A HREF="#top">Return to top of Page</A>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="contribution">How can I help The American Ireland Fund - 
and what will my contribution bring?</H3>

<P ALIGN=justify>Our thousands of supporters contribute in myriad ways,
from attending fund-raising events, to making donations by mail, to 
visiting projects in Ireland to witness results firsthand. A gift of any
size has a significant impact.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Supporting The American Ireland Fund also puts you in
contact with thousands of other Americans who are inspired by a love of
Ireland. On the AIF Board of Directors are many of the nation's corporate
leaders.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>We have already raised $80 million, but the need remains,
as President of Ireland Mary Robinson has testified.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>"Many of you in your involvement with The Ireland Funds
will know that there is a quiet, friendly revolution going on. The hands
of friendship are being extended all around the place," President
Robinson has said.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>"So I'll make a pact with The Ireland Funds," she 
continued. "I'll go on witnessing, if you go on doing the hard work
of making it happen, by raising the funds all over the world, and
knowing that the President of Ireland is a witness to what you're doing
and is very proud of you."</P>

In honor of the start of the season The Ireland Funds are now making it 
possible for you to plant a tree in Oak Glen, Co. Wicklow, Ireland. For several years,
 the Ireland Funds have been helping people around the world memorialize and 
 celebrate the lives of friends, family and special occasions while aiding in the 
 reforestation of Ireland. In conjunction with Crann - a non-profit organization in 
 County Wicklow, and Coillte - the Irish Forestry Board - we are now offering this 
 opportunity to our friends on the Internet.
<P>
 75% of Ireland used to be covered in Oak trees, today..only 1%. But you can help 
 bring the Irish Oak back to Ireland for the children of today and future generations.
<P>
For $25 a hand calligraphied scroll will be sent to you, or to the person you 
designate, and an Irish Oak tree will be planted in their name (or yours!). This is a 
wonderful gift to your friends and family and to Ireland.
<P>
Simply fill in the details below and e-mail with your credit card information, or 
print out this page and mail to the address in the order form.
<P>

an acknowledgement of your gift.

Each individual tree is $25. Checks can be made out to The American Ireland Fund and 
mailed to 211 Congress Street, Boston MA 02110 - USA.

<FONT SIZE=+3>R</FONT>egarded by historians as the single worst catastrophe of the 19th century, the
Irish Famine now has its own museum in Co. Roscommon. Opened by Irish President Mary
Robinson in 1994, the Strokestown Famine Museum tells the story of the Famine, and life in 19th century Ireland.
Over 50,000 people have now visited the Museum to learn about the historical aspects of this 
important chapter of the Irish experience.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
This year is the 150th anniversary of the Famine and currently, the Ireland Funds are helping 
Strokestown and the National Library of Ireland undertake the proper cataloguing of all
materials relating to the Strokestown Estate (approx. 50,000 items) dating from the 1840's
in order to preserve the materials for study by students and scholars.

<H2>U.S. President Clinton Visits Derry</H2>

NORTHERN IRELAND
<P>
<IMG WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="250" SRC="clinton.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5>
Derry on Thursday, November 30th will long live in the minds of us who were
privileged to be there. It was the day that President Bill Clinton came saw and
conquered the people of Northern Ireland before moving to Dublin to repeat the
exercise the following day. But Derry was special, really special and never in
its history can this wonderful vibrant town have experienced anything quite like it.
That the President of the greatest nation on earth should be in Derry to inaugurate an
American Ireland Fund project was indeed an extraordinary tribute to the work of
the Fund and the effect that the Fund has had over the last 20 years in this city. It
was also a great tribute to the former Speaker of the House Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and
the O'Neill family, 25 of whom made the journey to Derry for the event.
<P>
In words, it is hard to put across the sheer excitement, sense of pride and
emotion of the day. It was nearly surreal - the most powerful man in the world coming to a
small Irish town so renowned for conflict and violence, for burned out cars and
buses, for fights and funerals. But what a day of unbridled joy November 30th turned out
to be! From early in the morning the people of Derry streamed into the Guildhall
square. The climatic Gods were with us. Though cold, the skies were blue and
there was brilliant winter sunshine. By three o'clock in the afternoon the atmosphere
in the packed Guildhall Square was electric. Suddenly the President and Hilliary were
there, on the podium, and the crowd went wild. They could hardly believe their eyes.
This Square, site of so much protest in the past, reverberated to the rooftops with
the sounds of a genuine and an emotional welcome to a President who clearly wanted to
be there. It really sent a shiver down ones back. The President chose his words
carefully. He paid tribute to the historic role of Derry as the departure port of
so many emigrants to America and to the welcome Derry gave to U.S. troops stationed
there in 2nd World War. The President paid tribute to John Hume and made a
special reference to Paddy Doherty and the Inner City Trust with whom the AIF has been
involved so much over the years. He appealed for all party talks and he clearly
told the men of violence that their days were over. As he succinctly put it "Peace
means Peace".
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
And then it was into the Guildhall for the American Ireland Fund event. The main
event was preceded by a private reception with the President and Mrs. Clinton for
the O'Neill family and friends and Directors of the American Ireland Fund the
highlight of which was the presentation by nine year old Tom O'Neill of his grandfather,
Speaker Tip O'Neill's golf putter to the President. In the main Guildhall the
ceremony was simple and emotional. With great style and pride the President of
the American Ireland Fund, Loretta Brennan Glucksman spoke eloquently of the AIF's
involvement with Derry over the last 20 years. Tom O'Neill, the late Speaker's
son and a Director of the American Ireland Fund made a superb address in which he
invoked the memory of his late father, and his passion and concern for a part of
the world he had grown to love.
<P>
And then it was the President. His words were simple, heartfelt and poignant. He
paid special tribute to the work of the Fund and particularly Speaker O'Neill. He
referred to him as a man of the people, a bricklayer's son who became the most
powerful man in Congress and the nation's most prominent loyal champion of
working people in the United States. The President continued, "Speaker O'Neill loved
politics because he knew it could make a difference in people's lives. And he loved people
most of all - his neighbors, his constituents, his close colleagues and his
friends both back home and in Ireland. He was a good friend of the cause of peace in Northern
Ireland. He was among the first Irish American political leaders to oppose
violence in Northern Ireland. Though sorely missed he will be long remembered and the O'Neill
Chair in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster sponsored by the American
Ireland Fund will be a fitting tribute to his long life and legacy. For Tip O'Neill knew
that peace must be nurtured by a deeper understanding among people and greater
economic opportunity for all. Of all the voices I've heard along this trip, the most
inspiring were those of the two children I met this morning at the Mackie Plant in Belfast,
and -all those children, including some from Derry, who wrote to me in recent weeks
about aspirations for peace in heartfelt terms. I know they don't want to go back to
the way things used to be. They want a better future. They deserve it. And I know you, in
the American Ireland Fund, can make it happen. When I return to Washington, I
will be thinking of this wonderful city as all of us work to keep the momentous of
this eventful week moving forward."
<P>
And then they were gone, whisked backed to Belfast and we all trooped off to a
pub and a party that Paddy Doherty had arranged so we could reminisce and ruminate
about a truly great day. I, for one, look forward to the time when I can bounce
my grandchildren on my knee and tell them of the day President William Jefferson
Clinton went to Derry for the American Ireland Fund.

<H2>A special summer camp where "kids can be kids"</H2>
<P>

<IMG WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="187" SRC="graphics/p1a.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10">

Working with Paul Newman, founder of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford, Conn.,
the American Ireland Fund has taken a leadership role and joined with Paul Newman in a
special fundraising campaign to support the creation and development of the
Barretstown
Gang Camp, 25 miles from Dublin in County Kildare. To date over $1 million has been
raised of the target $1.7 million. <P> "When I saw Barretstown Castle, I knew
immediately that this was where I wanted the European (Hole in the Wall Gang) camp to
be," actor Paul Newman says. "I imagined a kind of medieval bazaar where children from
different countries could raise a little hell together." <BR CLEAR="RIGHT"> The
Barretstown Gang Camp gives children with serious illnesses, such as cancer and
leukemia, an opportunity to experience the joys of a typical summer camp in an
atmosphere of love, friendship and around-the-clock medical care. The Barretstown Gang
Camp is the first program of its kind in Europe.

<BR CLEAR="LEFT">
<P>
Joining Paul Newman in the campaign to underwrite the Barretstown
Gang Camp are AIF Chairman Tony O'Reilly and his wife Chryss, AIF President Loretta
Brennan Glucksman and AIF Board members Chuck Daly, Richard O'Connor and Mike Roarty.
Also involved are Belfast-born actor and film director Kenneth Branagh, and Richard
Branson, Chairman, Virgin Group of Companies.<BR>
Barretstown staff ensure that each
child meets with success in activities designed to be fun and engaging, to build
confidence and self-esteem, and to help children regain the sense of self-reliance
that
medical treatment so often weakens.

"We cannot thank you all enough
for the wonderful time you gave our son, James, at the Barretstown Gang Camp," said
the
Walsh family. "It was a holiday of a lifetime and he enjoyed every minute of it. You
all do such wonderful work for the children."<BR> Now entering its second year,
Barretstown is modeled on the original Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, which Paul Newman
founded in 1988. The U.S. program enrolls 800 children annually in its special summer
camp and has been both widely acclaimed and oversubscribed, prompting Newman and
others
to launch a second, European-based camp.<BR>
In 1994, 128 children from Ireland, Northern Ireland and the U.S. attended
Barretstown's first camp session, free of
charge. This summer's program will also welcome campers from France, Germany and the
United Kingdom. In addition, Barretstown provides a year-round facility for children
with special needs and the health professionals who serve them.<BR> The Barretstown
Gang Camp is located in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains on the 500-acre grounds
of Barretstown Castle. Built in the 12th-century, Barretstown Castle is surrounded by
lawns and gardens, a lake, woodlands and rolling fields. The stunning property is
owned
by the Irish Government and in 1994 was leased to the Barretstown Gang Camp for 90
years for a nominal £1 per year.

In June 1994, construction was completed on the first of four planned development
stages. Existing buildings were
converted into arts and crafts workshops, renovated stables and a medical center.
Further improvements are planned including enlargement of the property's lake with
accompanying boathouse; construction of a fully-equipped gymnasium and a 280-seat
theater. <P> "I have discovered anything is possible at this camp. I even got to meet
Mel Gibson. Thank you for giving me the holiday of a lifetime. And next time you see
Paul Newman, thank him, too."<BR> -Gillian,<BR> Barretstown Gang Camper

A SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM MAURICE HAYES, CHAIRMAN, IRELAND FUNDS ADVISORY COMMITTEE

<P>
<IMG WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="118" SRC="graphics/p2a.gif"
BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT">
For the American Ireland Fund and its partner Ireland Funds around the world, the
current cessation of violence in
Northern Ireland presents both a challenge and an opportunity, writes Dr. Maurice
Hayes, Chairman of the Ireland Funds Advisory Committee.<BR>
More than ever, it is important that the Ireland Funds now support the efforts of
those on both sides in
Northern Ireland who are trying to stabilize the situation and who are working to keep
lines of communication open between the two communities.<BR>
In Belfast recently, a special meeting of the Ireland Funds Advisory Committee
examined how the Funds can continue to
make a difference in Northern Ireland. Our group heard submissions from various key
figures in Northern Ireland, including past recipients of American Ireland Fund
grants.
Together, we strove to identify those projects and individuals where grants played a
crucial role in bringing peace.<BR CLEAR="LEFT">
These areas include:
<UL>
<LI>Initiatives in "interface areas" of Northern Ireland where people from both
communities work to bridge the
sectarian divide;<BR>
<LI>Explorations of cultural diversity in Northern Ireland and on a North/South
basis;<BR>
<LI>Human and social rights and<BR>
<LI>Projects especially for women and young people.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
Accordingly, the Advisory Committee has forged an exciting "Northern Ireland
Initiative" that focuses on Belfast, Armagh, Mid-Ulster, and Derry as
critical areas. Projects nominated will receive grants totaling over $500,000. I
firmly
believe the work of the American Ireland Fund can continue to do much to maintain the
momentum of the peace process. As we approach a summer of peace and hope, I urge you
to
renew your connection with this vital work.

<H2>$3.2 million in grants. How do we do it?</H2>

Fundamental social and political change has deeply affected all of Ireland in the last
twelve months.<BR>
Thanks to you, this remarkable transformation has received substantial assistance from
the American Ireland
Fund.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="122" SRC="graphics/p2c.gif"
BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
At fundraising events across the U.S.-and around the world-I have witnessed a
tremendous commitment by people of all backgrounds to supporting projects that promote
economic renewal and community reconciliation.<BR>
American Ireland Fund grants give hope and confidence in the future for Irish people.
The bottom line is that fundraising
events make this work possible. Here in the United States, the AIF was delighted to be
a major sponsor of the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland held
in Washington in May. We in the AIF are conscious of how critical job creation is in
cementing a lasting peace.<BR>
In this special edition of "Connections," we bring you the news from an exciting
calendar of nearly two dozen highly successful fundraising events
held in the first half of 1995.<BR>
Last year, the AIF distributed $3.2 million in grants to more than 100 projects. From
1988 to 1994, AIF grants to hundreds of Irish
organizations totaled over $22 million.<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">
I plan to visit with a number of AIF grant recipients throughout the summer and I look
forward to reporting to you what I find in
the next issue of "Connections."<BR>
Have a wonderful summer.

Executive Director

<H2>The National Gala</H2>

WASHINGTON
<P>

On St. Patrick's Eve, March 16, Vice President Al Gore joined An Taoiseach John
Bruton,
Prime Minister of Ireland, and the Hon. John Hume, M.P for Derry, and many others for
the American Ireland Fund's annual National Gala in Washington, D.C. Hume received the
AIF's National Humanitarian Award.
"I'm obviously honored and grateful for such an evening," he told the Washington Post.
"With so many people of Irish descent here, this focuses their minds on their
homeland,
returns them back to that little island, Ireland."
No one is more responsible for the ongoing peace initiatives in Northern Ireland than
John Hume. In 1979, he became a member of the European Parliament, and in 1984 was
elected the first Catholic to represent Derry in the Parliament at Westminster.
John Bruton, Ireland's Prime Minister, made a special plea for peace. "Our swords must
be put out of commission," said Bruton. "It requires courage and leadership. Until
politicians... begin to talk, we cannot make progress."
Among those attending the AIF National Gala were Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.); Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.); and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) who called the fundraiser,
"a wonderful event that benefits so many."

<H2>Wholeys honored for "Outstanding Contributions"</H2>

PITTSBURGH
<P>
<IMG WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="254" SRC="graphics/p4b.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">
On March 25, supporters gathered for the city's eleventh annual AIF dinner. Robert and
Lois Wholey received the 1995 Chairman's Award for Outstanding Contributions-the first
such award ever to be bestowed on a couple. For Pittsburghers today, the Wholey name
is
synonymous with fine seafood and generous philanthropy. Through the years, Bob and
Lois
have given many hours and contributed most generously to the American Ireland Fund
where Bob serves on the Board of Directors.
The evening's special guest was actor and humanitarian Paul Newman who founded
Ireland's Barretstown Gang Camp for children with serious illnesses. (<A
HREF="page1.htm">see page 1</A>) AIF Chairman Tony O'Reilly presented Newman, who is
also a professional
racing driver, with a Waterford Crystal car as screen colleague Melanie Griffith and
others cheered him on.
Over the last ten years, American Ireland Fund events held in Pittsburgh have netted
more than $3 million to support innovative and progressive programs throughout
Ireland,
North and South. Pittsburgh businessmen Tony O'Reilly and Dan Rooney organized the
first such fundraising dinner in 1976.
"As a member of the American Ireland Fund from the beginning, I am proud to have
witnessed fundamental changes in the living conditions for Irish people," Rooney, AIF
Vice Chairman and President of the Pittsburgh Steelers, said.

<H2>"Red Fay" is honored with Distinguished Leadership Award</H2>

SAN FRANCISCO
<P>
In 1946, Navy mates Paul Burgess "Red" Fay, Jr., and John F. Kennedy returned from war
duty and shared a room in Boston where Fay helped his friend win a seat in Congress.
Years later, Fay served as Under Secretary of the Navy in JFK's Administration and
after the President's death wrote "The Pleasure of His Company" about their
friendship.
On March 10, "Red" Fay received the 1995 AIF Distinguished Leadership Award from a
hometown San Francisco crowd led by Eamonn Keegan, AIF President West Coast Region.
"Red Fay is an original," noted Peter Folger, the event's General Chairman. "Above all
else, his friendship, his willingness to always lend a helping hand and his strong
sense of loyalty set him apart."
Also that evening, several special friends of Ireland in San Francisco established
"Endowed Funds" with their gifts of $25,000 or more. The American Ireland Fund is
grateful to the Jon K. Folan Family Trust; Eamonn and Louise Keegan; the Odell
Foundation; Thomas and 
Erma Jean Tracy; and Alfred and Dede Wilsey for their generosity.

At the Breakers, Tina Harvey Flaherty, Felice Mark Lippert, and Chryss Goulandris

Dreyfoos, Gay Hart Gaines, Elesabeth Ingalls Gillet, and Rosemarie Stack, the Fabulous

The AIF dinner and several related events attracted what Palm Beach Today called, "a
small army of noteworthy guests." On that list were former Presidential Chief of Staff
John Sununu and his wife, Nancy Sununu, as well as Eileen and Joseph Cornacchia,
owners
of two Kentucky Derby winners. Joining them were brothers Tim and Pat Rooney and
Eileen
and Brian Burns.

<H2>St. Patrick's Day Celebration for Ireland's Children</H2>

BOSTON
<P>
For over 15 years, "Ireland's Children" has helped hundreds of children in Northern
Ireland who live in the shadow of violence by placing them in recreation and
reconciliation programs in their own communities.
On St. Patrick's Day 1995 in Boston, Jack Connors and AIF Treasurer Peter Lynch were
honorary co-chairs for an evening benefiting Meanscoil Feirste, Northern Ireland's
only
Irish language high school, and the Black Mountain Group, a Shankill Community
Development Organization.
In attendance were many youthful supporters of the AIF like Tim Corcoran, who carries
on the family's longstanding tradition of support for Peace, Culture and Charity in
Ireland established by his father Leo and his uncles Joe and John. Lawyer Corcoran is
proud to support not only the AIF's black tie galas but also less formal fundraisers
such as Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day party to benefit Ireland's Children, a
special AIF committee.
"I can't think of a better thing to do on St. Patrick's Day than lend my personal
support to a better future for all of Ireland's people, especially the children,"
Corcoran says.

The reviews were enthusiastic for a "filum" premiere at Jimmy's Restaurant to benefit
the AIF. On the screen and in the audience were Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donnell, who
co-starred in "Circle of Friends," based on the novel by Maeve Binchy who also
attended.
Like the AIF, "Circle of Friends" brought America and Ireland closer together. From
America, there was Frank Price, who serves on the AIF's Board and is the film's
producer, and from Ireland, director 
Pat O'Connor. Also there to applaud Peace, Culture and Charity were Michael and
Gretchen Wayne.

<H2>O'Reilly and Rooney honored for "Vision"; Neil Jordan wins Performing Arts
Award</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="185" SRC="graphics/p7d.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
A record attendance of more than 1,300 American Ireland Fund members and friends
celebrated the Fund's twentieth annual New York Dinner on May 11 at Tavern on the
Green.  Honorees at the gala event were Tony O'Reilly and Dan Rooney, the co-founders
of the Ireland Fund, who were feted for their daring and vision in 1976 and for their
unstinting service, support and encouragement in the ensuing years.<BR>
"Despite years of violence and death in Northern Ireland, we believed then that
individuals could help to build peace, brick by brick, day by day," AIF Chairman Tony
O'Reilly recalled. "Now, 20 years later, we have peace in all of Ireland for the first
time in a generation. But this is only a beginning."<BR>
As Dinner Co-Chairs Donald Patrick Brennan, Lewis L. Glucksman, Donald R. Keough,
Albert Lippert, Dean R. O'Hare, Michael J. Roarty and Daniel P. Tully pointed out in
their message, "It's no coincidence that, in troubled times, the Ireland Fund emerged.
The success we celebrate today originated when those two courageous men showed
extraordinary vision."
<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">
<IMG WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="192" SRC="graphics/p7a.gif" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"
ALIGN="LEFT"> Added Junior Co-Chair Claire Cronin, "My hope is that their leadership
will be our
inspiration, their unwavering commitment our example...It is our intention to pay Dan
and Tony the highest form of flattery-
imitation-and build upon the solid foundation that is the American Ireland Fund."<BR>
The Central Park event was also occasion for presentation by Gregory Peck of the
annual
Award for the Performing Arts to Neil Jordan, Oscar-winning screenwriter and film
director who scored the 1992 hit, "The Crying Game" and the 1994 hit "Interview With a
Vampire". Sligo-born Jordan is also author of an acclaimed short stories collection,
"Nights in Tunisia" (1978) and two novels, "The Past" (1980) and "Dream of a Beast"
(1983).<BR>
Jordan was honored for his extraordinary talent, artistry and achievement in world
cinema with a 
specially commissioned Waterford Crystal bowl. In addition, the AIF will make a
$10,000
grant in his name to the University College Dublin Film School.

<H2>Mercedes McCambridge stars at AIF benefit</H2>

SAN DIEGO
<P>
One of the world's most talented and admired actresses, Mercedes McCambridge, received
the AIF Heritage Award in San Diego on February 25.
Born on St. Patrick's Day, McCambridge moved from radio drama to the silver screen in
1950 and won an Oscar that year for her portrayal of feisty reporter Sadie Burke in
"All the King's Men," her first movie role. In 1964, she starred on Broadway in "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf" and in 1991, she came out of retirement to star in "Lost in
Yonkers."
Another highlight for the San Diego gala was creation of the "Irish 50," a select
group
of individual contributors. Dinner co-chairs were Mike Neil and Leo Sullivan.
Ruth and Joe McInerney turned out for the celebration. So did Mary and Dan Mulvihill,
a
former dinner 
chairman, as well as Maureen O'Connor Peterson and Joan Kroc.

<H2>AIF grant brings tiny Cootehill alive with art, music in 
a summer festival</H2>

"The idea," Kay Phelan says, "is to introduce to people living in a rural area
events and arts which they wouldn't normally see. We bring those things here 
for them."<BR>
<IMG WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="336" SRC="graphics/p13a.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10">
One way rural areas in Ireland choose to confront the challenges of de-population
and long-term economic decline is by developing significant local arts
initiatives.<BR>
The Cootehill Community Arts Festival, begun in 1988, brings theater, music and
literary readings to an isolated Cavan community. Last year, the project received
a $7,500 AIF grant.<BR>
Past festival programs have included an art workshop; a busking competition; a
performance of "Romeo and Juliet"; and a poetry reading by John Montague and
Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, 1992 AIF Literary Award winner.<BR>
In addition, the festival joined with the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, located not far
from Cootehill, to present classic music recitals. For Irish and international
artists, composers and writers, the Guthrie Centre in Annaghmakerrig, Co.
Monaghan, is an isolated retreat. The Guthrie Centre is considered one of
Ireland's premier cultural treasures and has received more 
than $70,000 in AIF grants, including a 1989 $50,000 flagship grant.
"We availed of the natural talent that is at the Guthrie Centre," Phelan
explains. "We want [the festival] to give people a little bit of what they know
and to encourage new and innovative artists."

<BR CLEAR="LEFT"> <P>
Certainly for any creative endeavor, work becomes especially worthwhile when
artists have the opportunity to come in direct contact with a community.
The 1995 Cootehill Arts Festival, scheduled for August 10-20, will feature
another classical music recital at Annaghmakerrig House as well as art
exhibitions, drama and literary workshops and street theatre.
<P>
In rural Co. Cavan, the quiet village of Cootehill "tends to get left out of
things," admits Kay Phelan. So she and other residents organized a summertime
Community Arts Festival, supported by an AIF grant.

A classic. 
Music recitals at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre are a Cootehill Arts Festival
highlight.

<IMG WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="144" SRC="graphics/p1a.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10">

<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>elcome to our new look Connections magazine. I do hope you find the following
pages of interest.
<P>
For the first time on a worldwide base, what we have attempted to do is give you
a feel both for the wide range of activities that the Fund is now involved in
from a fundraising point of view, as well as tell you about projects that we
support in Ireland, North and South.
<P>
In addition, we have included a special report on the Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill
Chair in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster funded by the American Ireland
Fund. This special project was launched by President Clinton on his recent,
remarkable visit to Ireland.
<P>
By the end of 1995, over 25,000 people had attended 52 Ireland Fund events in 39
cities in 9 countries. The American Ireland Fund and its partner Funds around the
world have now become an extraordinary network of influence linking back to
Ireland, and translating interest and concern into support for hundreds of
projects throughout the length and breadth of the land. In effect, the Ireland
Funds represent a global "community foundation" for Ireland and the Irish people.
<P>
In Ireland, where there are virtually no private foundations, the work of the
Ireland Funds is critical. At the grassroots level, a Funds grant is often the
difference between success or failure for a fledgling organization, and allows
groups to seek additional funding from other sources.
<P>
Ireland in 1996 is an island of great vibrancy, excitement and creativity, eager
to reach out to its extended Irish family and friends overseas. Future
generations may not forgive us if we don't respond as enthusiastically and
generously as possible. I urge you to connect with this movement through the
Ireland Funds and become part of something really dynamic.
<P>
Over 100,000 people will be reading this new Connections. Your feedback, ideas,
criticisms, and suggestions would be most welcome. In the meanwhile, welcome to
the world of the Ireland Funds and every best wish for a great 1996.
<P>

<H2>Clinton: Children of Northern Ireland Want a Better Future.</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>

Thursday, November 30, will long live in the minds of those who were privileged
to be in Derry, writes Kingsley Aikins.
<P>
On that day, President Bill Clinton won the hearts of the people of Northern
Ireland, before moving to Dublin the following day to repeat the exercise.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="250" SRC="graphics/p2a.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 VSPACE=10>
Never in Derry's history can that wonderful, vibrant town have experienced
anything quite like it. That the President of the United States should be there
to inaugurate an American Ireland Fund project-the Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill Chair
in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster-was an extraordinary tribute to the
work of the Fund and the effect the
Fund has had in Derry over the last 20 years. It was also a great tribute to the
former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the entire O'Neill
family, 25 of whom made the journey to Derry for the event.
<P>
From early in the morning, the people of Derry streamed into the Guildhall
Square. Though it was cold, the sky was blue and there was brilliant winter
sunshine. By three in the afternoon, the atmosphere was electric.

<P>
Suddenly, President and Mrs. Clinton arrived, and the square reverberated with an
emotional welcome. The President chose his words carefully. He paid tribute to
the historic role of Derry as a departure port of so many emigrants to America,
and to the welcome Derry gave U.S. troops stationed there during World War II.
President Clinton also paid tribute to Derry's own John Hume, and made a special
reference to Paddy Doherty and the Inner City Trust with whom the AIF has been so
closely involved over the years. He clearly told the men of violence that their
days were over. As he succinctly put it, "Peace means peace."
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
At the University of Ulster in Derry, Northern Ireland, U.S. President Bill
Clinton and American Ireland Fund President Loretta Brennan Glucksman
unveil a stone from the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. which former Speaker
Thomas Foley presented to the AIF. The stone will be displayed in the university
that houses the Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill Visiting Chair in Peace Studies.
<P>
Then, it was into the Guildhall for the American Ireland Fund event. At a private
reception with President and Mrs. Clinton, nine-year-old Tom O'Neill IV presented
his grandfather's prized golf putter to President Clinton as the O'Neill family
and Directors and friends of the American
Ireland Fund looked on. President Clinton had a special word with AIF Regional
Director, Tom Kennedy of New York who accompanied President Kennedy to Ireland on
his famous trip in 1963.
<P>
In the main Guildhall, the ceremony was simple but emotional. With great style
and pride, Loretta Brennan Glucksman, AIF National President, spoke eloquently of
the Fund's involvement with Derry over the last 20 years. AIF Board Member Tom
O'Neill, III, invoked the memory of his late father, and his passion and concern
for a part of the world he had grown to love.

BELFAST - Even as the Ireland Funds announced grants totaling $450,000 as part of
a major Northern Ireland Initiative, an unusual conference on "Reconciliation and
Community," sponsored in part by the American Ireland Fund, discussed the future
of Northern Ireland in Newry.                              
<P>
During a meeting in Belfast of Ireland Funds' board members and grant recipients
representing Irish organizations, Worldwide Chairman Dr. Tony O'Reilly announced
a round of grants "to support those on both sides who are trying to stabilize the
situation and who are working to keep lines of communication open between the two
communities."                                   Among the 68 grants made in the
Northern Ireland Initiative were $12,000 to the Centre for the Study of  Conflict
at the University of Ulster in Coleraine; $15,000 to the West Belfast Festival;
$10,000 to the Shankill
Women's Centre; and $10,000 to the Derry-based Field Day Theatre Company. For the
conference on "Reconciliation and Community," the US-based Foundation for a Civil
Society received $20,000.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
As a contribution to the growing momentum of peace in Northern Ireland, the
conference was extraordinary.
Over 300 leaders from all sectors of Northern Ireland engaged in open dialogue on
the future. They were joined by political leaders, leading policymakers, and
other experts from Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, El Salvador, Israel,
the Palestine Liberation Organization, Poland, South Africa, Spain, and the US.
Representatives from the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom also took
part.
<P>
As Ireland's Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring told the
conference, "The most important lesson is that this journey can be made." Oscar
Arias, Nobel laureate for peace and former President of Costa Rica, further
challenged the people of Northern Ireland to make peace real and lasting.
<P>
"It is not easy," said Arias. "But you will see that others have done it and are
doing it today, under the most difficult conditions. In the face of deep
differences and harsh memories, they have decided that they share one broad roof
and must learn to live under it together."

<H3>AIF LITERARY AWARD TO JOHN MONTAGUE</H3>
</CENTER>

BELFAST-In a ceremony at Queen's University, poet John Montague received the 1995
American
Ireland Fund Literary Award of $15,000. His selection was made by a
committee of Irish writers that was chaired by novelist Thomas Flanagan.
<P>
"It is, of course, in a special way appropriate that the award should be
given this year to a Northern writer as we find ourselves hoping for and praying
for a solution of the province's longstanding grievances and concerns," Flanagan
told the Cork Examiner newspaper.
<P>
"No voice has expressed those concerns with stronger emphasis than has
Montague and yet always with a sense of history's echoes, paradoxes and
ambiguities," he added.
<P>
In late 1995, Wake Forest Press published Montague's "Collected Poems"
Before beginning a career in teaching, Montague worked as Paris correspondent for
the Irish Times. He has taught at universities in France, Ireland, Canada, and
the US. Montague is currently Distinguished Professor of English in the New York
State writers program of the State University of New York, Albany.
<P>
The AIF Literary Award is funded by the Thomas F. O'Neill family of New York and
Florida. Past recipients include Seamus Heaney (see accompanying article), Brian
Friel, and Seamus Deane.

NEW YORK-Loretta Brennan Glucksman, president of Westland
Kssociates, a public relations and governmental affairs consulting firm, was
appointed AIF National President by the AIF Board of Directors. Previously AIF
President-East Coast Region, Brennan Glucksman succeeds John F. O'Sullivan who
served in the office since 1990 and is now vice chairman.

"Loretta has given outstanding service in the development of American
philanthropy for Ireland," said Dr. Tony O'Reilly, AIF Chairman. "As AIF National
Ppresident, she will direct the American Ireland Fund's continued growth and
provide strong leadership."
<P>
In addition, O'Reilly praised John F. O'Sullivan as a "distinguished leader of
the American Ireland Fund who oversaw a period of unprecedented global growth in
the Ireland Funds organisation."
<P>
On a recent visit to Ireland, Brennan Glucksman attended an informal reception
for President of Ireland Mary Robinson held by Rural Resettlement Ireland (RRI).
<P>
RRI grew out of a voluntary rural resettlement program begun in 1990 by

nearly 200 families to move to 17 rural counties. Over 3,600 families are on the
waiting list.

<H2>A year of peace:what next?</H2>

<H3>An Essay By Maurice Hayes</H3>
</CENTER>

<IMG WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="266" SRC="graphics/p8a.gif"
BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10>
<BR>
THE SUMMER OF 1995. The first summer of peace for 25 years in Northern Ireland
was also a summer of glorious sunshine, of good spirits and good weather, which
reflected the spirit of the community.
<P>
The most marked feature following the ceasefires has been the absence of fear. A
great weight has been lifted from people. Parents no longer worry that their
children might be victims of random violence and wives that their husbands will
not return from work. People living in isolated areas are free from the terror
that they will be victims of random sectarian shootings or tit-for-tat reprisals.
<P>
There is a changed atmosphere, too. People have embraced peace as an idea whose
time has come, and which must not be let go. Hopes are high, yet simple enough:
To enable people to live together in peace and harmony, and to provide them the
opportunity to find work. The precise political arrangements required to bring
this about are less important and are certain to be the subject of debate for
some time. It was a good summer, too, for tourism, for business, for people
enjoying the new-found freedom to move without fear. There is a new confidence in
the community, a willingness to move out from behind barricades and to talk and
listen. Most of all, there is a will for peace that makes a return to violence
unthinkable.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
Much of this improvement is due to the work of groups which have been assisted in
the past by the Ireland Funds. People like Jackie Redpath on the Shankhill Road
in West Belfast; Joyce McCartan in South Belfast; Paddy Doherty in Derry; the
Corrymeela Community; and various community and voluntary groups who have been
labouring for years in their own communities now see the task transformed. Most
of them are looking to embrace job creation, to work with prisoners and with
cross-community groups. Only for the support and help of the Funds in the past,
many of them would not have survived to play the important roles they
are taking today.

<H2>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</H2>
</CENTER>

In the last 12 months the Ireland Funds have distributed over $6.6
million to more than 280 programs that work to advance the causes of peace,
culture, education and charity. Through grants ranging from a few thousand
dollars to $50,000, the Fund supports hundreds of projects in nearly every county
of Ireland each year. For many projects, a seed grant from the Fund provides the
leverage necessary to qualify for additional moneys from government agencies and
other organisations.
<P>
Below is a sample of the hundreds of programs throughout Ireland that have
received grant aid from the Ireland Funds in the past year:

<H3>Liam Neeson Wins Heritage Award</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="251" SRC="graphics/p15a.gif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
<BR>
ON NOVEMBER 2, Irish-born actor Liam Neeson received the 1995 Heritage Award at
Hollywood's annual gala for the American Ireland Fund. He is currently completing
a starring role in Neil Jordan's "Michael Collins."
<P>
The Heritage Award is presented to individuals who, through their services to
humanity, have made extraordinary and lasting contributions toward a fuller
appreciation of Ireland's heritage and culture. Past honorees have
included President Ronald Reagan; Angela Lansbury; Gene Kelly; Maureen O'Hara;
Donald O'Connor; Merv Griffin; Carroll O'Connor; and most recently in 1994,
Dolores Hope.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
Liam Neeson, who studied at Queen's University Belfast, was nominated for an
Academy Award for his portrayal of Oscar Schindler in Steven Speilberg's epic,
"Schindler's List." Earlier in his career, as a member of
Dublin's Abbey Theatre repertory company, Neeson appeared in Brian Friel's
"Translations." In 1993, he made his Broadway debut in a revival of Eugene
O'Neill's "Anna Christie," co-starring Natasha Richardson.
Chaired by Frank Price, the guests who toasted the star were Charles Bronson, Roy
Disney, Bob and Dolores Hope, Colm Meaney, Gregory and Veronique Peck, Sidney
Poitier, and Christian Slater. Musical entertainment was by Phil Coulter and
Peter Yates was master of ceremonies.
<P>
As honoree of the American Ireland Fund's LA gala, Liam Neeson has designated
several organizations in Northern Ireland to receive special grants in his name.
Stadium Youth and Community Centre, located on the Shankill Road in West Belfast,
is a recreational facility that provides a wide range of activities. The Greater
Shankill area is afflicted with high unemployment, crime, and inadequate
educational opportunities. "The Stadium" offers programs to help young people
break the cycle of unemployment.
<P>
Cooperation North, based in Belfast, and Dublin is dedicated to peace and
reconciliation, and enlists the help of people in both communities in Northern
Ireland and on both sides of the border. Its main programs focus
on exchanges, residential conferences and youth camps. Co-operation North also
establishes links between leaders in business, the media and cultural groups.

LONDON-Guests at the eighth annual Midsummer Night's Magic Ball of the Ireland
Fund of Great Britain heard a message from Prime Minister John Major. "Much of
the credit," he said, for "the remarkable transformation that peace has brought
about to the lives of people in Northern Ireland, and throughout the United
Kingdom...(goes) to organisations like the Ireland Fund."
<P>
The evening's honoree was Josephine Hart, outgoing IFGB Chairman, who in her
eight years in office helped the Fund to raise almost $1.2 million. "It's been a
wonderful experience and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity," Hart
told the Irish Times. Author of the best-selling novel "Damage" (1988), Josephine
Hart recently published her third novel, "Oblivion".
<P>
In June of 1995, Brian Hayes took over from Josephine B. Hart as Chairman of the
I.F.G.B. Brian has been involved with the Fund since its inception, and he brings
to the position an outstanding knowledge of the City of London and those who live
there. His expertise as a fundraiser will see the I.F.G.B. go from strength to
strength over the next few years.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>

Special guests at the Dorchester Hotel gala included Ms. Hart's husband, Maurice
Saatchi; Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber; film producer Sir David Putnam; and broadcaster
Terry Wogan.
<P>
Earlier this year, the Ireland Fund of Great Britain's fifth annual Greyhound
Racing Dinner on March 6 at Wembley Stadium attracted over 300 enthusiastic
"punters" who gathered to cheer on their favorites. The event was hosted by the
Hon. Kevin Pakenham.
<P>
The IFGB kept its fundraising calendar full with a St. Patrick's Night Party held
at the Porchester Hall, Bayswater, hosted by Hugo MacNeill and Rory Tobin. In
May, the Fund also sponsored an Ascot Racing Dinner
hosted by Stephen Quinn and David Reid Scott. In the past few months, the Ireland
Fund of Great Britain has held two extremely successful events. One was the
annual Christmas Craic Ball in London and the other was their first ever Ireland
Fund of Great Britain event in Birmingham, chaired by Tom Gallagher.

<H2>The Chief Executive's Message</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="204" SRC="graphics/p1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10">

Welcome to our second issue of our revamped Connections which I hope you find
interesting and informative. Also, thank you to those of you who took the time
and the trouble to write with your reactions, criticisms, ideas and indeed the
odd smidgens of praise.
<P>
	Building on your feedback what we've tried to do in this issue is to continue
to cover all the various fundraising events which have been held so far this
year. In addition we've tried to tell you a little bit about some of the key
people involved in the Funds, not only here and overseas, but also in Ireland. A
further expansion has been to give you information about various projects we have
supported this year as well as a definitive listing of all the grants made in the
first half of 1996 with a few words on each. In addition we've put together a
"Tour of Ireland" featuring 17 projects which the Funds have grant aided. Perhaps
this might encourage you to make a visit.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
	I'm glad to say that coming off the back of a record breaking 1995 the
momentum has continued into 1996. San Francisco was a particular highlight and
Pittsburgh broke through the magic million dollar mark and was the most
successful dinner we've held in our 20 year history. The National Gala in
Washington, D.C. has become a very important event attracting significant
national and international media attention. Around the world all the various
Funds are midway through a busy year with exciting plans for the future.
<P>
	In Ireland the situation is tense and the role that the Funds can play at
this difficult time is critical. I would urge you to read the article in this
issue written by Hugh Frazier, a member of the Ireland Funds Advisory Board in
Ireland. He explains, very succinctly, why the work of the Ireland Funds is now
so important and how we can all make a difference.
<P>
	As we disperse for the next few months I wish you all a pleasant and
enjoyable summer and look forward to reporting back to you at the end of the year
with a full report on our 1996 activities.

<H2>A Message From The Chairman - Dr. AJF O'Reilly</H2>

<P>
<IMG WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="253" SRC="graphics/p2.gif" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"
ALIGN="LEFT">

<BR>
The Ireland Funds have come of age. As we approach the millennium, we take stock,

look ahead and move to position the Funds to meet their objectives going into the

next century.
<P>
	What have The Ireland Funds done over the past 20 years? The Funds have a
proven 
record of achievement, an unrivaled record for raising money for the promotion of

peace, culture, charity and education in Ireland. We have effectively recruited 
support for, and generated interest in, constructive initiatives in Ireland and 
strategically created a "network of goodwill" for Ireland across the globe made
up of 
concerned and dynamic people. Most importantly we have established a reputation
in 
Ireland for integrity and sympathetic understanding of the problems facing local 
communities. With the help of the Irish Advisory Committee, we have managed to 
support people of goodwill in all parts of the island, north, south, catholic and

protestant.
<BR CLEAR="LEFT">
<P>
	How can The Ireland Funds sustain momentum? We need to redouble our efforts
to 
attract donations, to encourage donors to substantially increase their giving, we

need to broaden the donor base, to encourage more people to give. We must
constantly 
seek out ways to encourage the thousands whose only contact is an annual
fundraising 
dinner to deepen their involvement and continue to interact with the work of The 
Ireland Funds throughout the year.
<P>
	By focusing on engaging new and younger people in the affairs of The Funds we

ensure that the vital work continues, and, in that spirit, we of the founding 
generation ought not to forget how our wills will influence the way we are
remembered.
<P>
	We need to encourage donors to take an active interest in the projects in
Ireland 
which their contributions make possible, to visit them, to receive periodic
reports 
of progress and develop a constructive relationship with them.
<P>
	With a renewed focus and dynamic executive direction, both in Boston and
Dublin, 
I have no doubt that we can together generate both enthusiasm and money to rise
to 
the challenge of the new century and to enhance the promotion of peace, culture, 
charity and education in Ireland. The Ireland Funds have never been more prepared
to 
translate the ancestry of the diaspora and the interest of the world at large
into 
constructive commitment to the new and modern Ireland.

<H2>From Coast to Coast, AIF Regional Presidents Support Peaceful, Constructive
Change</H2>

At a recent AIF Board Meeting, Patrick Purcell, owner and publisher of the Boston
Herald, was appointed PresidentÐEast Coast Region, succeeding Loretta Brennan
Glucksman, who now serves as AIF National President. In 1993, Purcell was Dinner
Chairman for the AIF's Boston gala and was appointed a member of the Fund's Board
of Directors.
<P>
	"The organizations the American Ireland Fund supports run the gamut from
education to the arts," says Purcell. "It's that sort of broad-based approach
that will lead to peaceful, constructive change in Ireland, North and South." 
<P>
	According to Dr. Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, AIF Chairman, "Pat Purcell has given
outstanding service in the development of American philanthropy for Ireland. As
the American Ireland Fund's President-East Coast Region, he will direct the
Fund's continued growth and provide strong regional leadership."
<P>
<H3>Patrick Purcell<BR>
A Classic Success Story</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="160" SRC="graphics/p3a.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=5
VSPACE=5>
Eldest son of an immigrant carpenter from Co. Waterford, Ireland, Patrick Joseph
Purcell was raised in Queens and went to nearby St. John's University. His first
job out of college was working in the advertising of the New York Daily News. In
1980, he became associate publisher of the Village Voice, owned by Rupert
Murdoch's News America Publishing.
<P>
	In 1984, when Purcell was just 36 years old, Murdoch appointed him president
and publisher of the Boston Herald. He later also served as publisher of the New
York Post, TV Guide, and other prominent publications. On Valentine's Day 1994,
Purcell purchased the Herald from News America.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<H3>Economic development his priority</H3>
Not long after he purchased the Boston Herald, Purcell visited Ireland and
Northern Ireland on a trade mission with Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. The
trip reinforced his conviction that economic development is the key to peaceful,
constructive change throughout the Ireland.
<P>
	"As a capitalist," Purcell says, "I believe that the most important thing we
can do for Ireland is encourage employment. "I look forward to strengthening my
commitment and involvement toward that end as AIF President-East Coast Region."
<P>

"A Need to Do Something Good"</H3>

As an AIF regional president, Pat Purcell joins Eamonn Keegan, who was appointed
AIF President-West Coast Region in 1994. Beginning in 1984, Keegan has served
annually as co-chairman of the Fund's San Francisco fundraising dinner.
<P>
	A native of Dublin, Keegan left Ireland in 1963 not long after President John
Kennedy's historic goodwill visit there and just weeks before the President's
tragic assassination.
<P>
	"I thought I'd like to have a look, but I didn't think I'd stay," he recalls.
Indeed, Keegan eventually found great business success in the United States as an
investment counsellor.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
	"My heart still says, 'Made in Ireland,' even if my mind thinks like a Yank,"
he says.  "I believe we all, as human beings, have a need to do something good.
<P>
	"My involvement with the American Ireland Fund gives me that opportunity,"
Keegan adds. "Anything we can do to foster peace and reconciliation has great
appeal to me."

<H2>Prominence in Pittsburgh</H2>

At the American Ireland Fund Pittsburgh dinner on April 2, 1993, John Connelly
announced that he was pledging $1 million to the American Ireland Fund with a
further $9 million to follow in a special ten-year bequest program.
<P>

<IMG WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="204" SRC="graphics/p6.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">



"People ask me why," Connelly said at the time. "I'd like to say that more is
expected from a man to whom much has been given. The Lord has blessed me
tremendously. When you leave this world, you leave everything-unless you make
plans that your legacy, your heritage, what you stand for, can go on."

<H3>An Impressive Business Career</H3>
One of Pittsburgh's most successful citizens, John Connelly has enjoyed a career
of remarkable business achievements since the late 1940s. At 16, Connelly
graduated from high school, but he was unable to continue his education due to
the death of his parents. "Fate had other plans," he told Pittsburgh Magazine, in
a recent profile honoring him as "Pittsburgher of the Year."
<P>
	As treasurer of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, Connelly guided the
$100 million clean-up of Pittsburgh's Three Rivers, paving the way for the city's
revitalization. In 1958, he established the Gateway Clipper excursion boat fleet,
now the nation's largest fleet of excursion and fine dining boats with operations
in Pittsburgh, New York City, Davenport, Iowa, and St. Louis, MO.
<P>
	John Connelly, according to Pittsburgh Magazine, "watched the rivers
gradually change from fetid sewers into lively playgrounds for boaters and
anglers. River sightseeing cruises spawned dinner cruises and party cruises,
which began the Three Rivers Regatta, and, down the line, opened hotels and
riverboat casinos."
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<H3>Apples for Students</H3>
	Connelly also developed a financial incentive marketing system that has done
business with 4000 banks nationwide and led to Fortune naming him, the "Father of
Incentive Bank Marketing." He later introduced modern riverboat gambling in
America, first with the President Casino in Davenport, IA, then with
establishment of casinos in Biloxi, Mississippi and St. Louis.
<P>
	In addition, Connelly started the "Apples for Students" program, in which
schools save supermarket register tapes and exchange them for free Apple
computers that Connelly buys wholesale and then sell to the stores. So far, the
program has placed $250 million of Apple computer products in schools in all 50
states.
<P>
<H3>A Legacy for Ireland</H3>
When the AIF honored him at its Pittsburgh dinner as "Man of the Year" in 1989,
John Connelly "became immersed in Ireland from then on." Every year since, he has
traveled to Ireland as a prominent AIF supporter.
<P>
	"I have a sense of well-being when I'm in Ireland," Connelly says. "The
fields, the churches, the Cliffs of Moher give me a sense of my heritage."
<P>
	His special bequest program on behalf of the American Ireland Fund, he adds,
owes its inspiration to Tony O'Reilly, AIF Chairman and fellow Pittsburgher.
<P>
	"Never in my life have I met a man with such fire in his belly, and such
eloquent speeches for reconciliation rather than confrontation," says Connelly.

well 
known is the fact that Dublin also boasts an area known as the Shankill, located
in 
the south of the city. despite name similarities, there has been no interaction
up 
until now between the two areas. Now, Thanks to a grant from the American Ireland

Fund and the drive and energy of William Smith from the Shankill Community
(Belfast) 
and Charles Martin from the Shankill Community (Dublin) the two communities have 
been linked in a unique cross-border project. Groups from both communities have
been 
to visit each other and there are now a series of interchange activities
involving 
schools and other community groups. Highlight of the visit to Dublin was when
both 
groups went to visit President of Ireland, Mary Robinson.

<H2>AIF/Trinity Scholarships in Genetics</H2>
<H3>Your Money at Work in Education</H3>

<IMG WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="247" SRC="graphics/p12a.gif" HSPACE="10"
ALIGN="RIGHT"><BR>
Once again this summer, Irish students who are majoring in genetics at Dublin's 
Trinity College will perform research at leading laboratories across the United 
States, thanks in large part to a scholarship established over 20 years ago by
The 
American Ireland Fund. "I regard this scholarship program as perhaps the most 
significant undertaking by the {Trinity College} Genetics Department," says
Professor 
David McConnell, the department head. "We can teach them, but this program gives
the 
student a great boost, and they return to Ireland full of enthusiasm."
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>
<H3>U.S. Reasearch whets their appetites</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="275" SRC="graphics/p12b.gif" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="15"
ALIGN="LEFT"><BR>
Trinity College sends six students each year to the U.S. on this special AIF 
scholarship, program. An unusually high number of Trinity's Department of
Genetics 
undergraduates eventually go on to pursue doctorate degrees, reports Prof.
McConnell 
a Cal Tech graduate himself, with about one third of them studying at American 
universities.
<P>
	"The research they do in the summer whets their appetite and the students get

infected by the American 'can-do' spirit," he reports.
<P> 
	"The experience really builds their self-confidence," he adds. "The students
also 
discover that their own educational system has done them a good turn."
<P>
	Altogether, more than 100 Trinity students have received AIF scholarships. 
Prominent among former recipients are Prof. Maurice Kernan at SUNY-Stony Brook,
whom 
Prof. McConnell calls, "one of the best young behavioral geneticists," and Dr.
Jane 
Robinson, a niece of President Mary Robinson and a leading yeast geneticist on
the 
University of Arizona faculty.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
	"It's an absolutely first-class program," observes Bill Vincent, AIF Vice 
Chairman, who has maintained a special interest in the Trinity Genetics
scholarship 
program. The Genetics Department of Trinity College Dublin is the only such 
University department in Ireland. The government has allocated £4m towards the 
construction of a new building for the Genetics Department which will include
major 
teaching facilities for the Science Faculty. This development will allow the 
Department of Genetics to enhance its teaching and research programs.

<H3>A Valuable and Rewarding Experience</H3>

In her research paper, 1995 scholarship recipient Louise Campbell described work
she 
performed at Long Island's Brookhaven National Laboratory.
<P>
	"I worked in Dr. John Dunn's lab, which, along with three other labs, forms
the 
Human Genome Group at Brookhaven," Campbell writes. "Dr. Dunn's lab is currently 
sequencing the genome of the spirochete Borrelia Burgdorferi, the causative agent
of 
Lyme disease. In conjunction with Dr. Ben Luft's lab at SUNY Stony Brook, work is

being done to develop a vaccine against this disease."
<P>
	"I would like to thank John Dunn for his enthusiastic encouragement in the
lab, 
and for making me feel so at home during my stay in the States," she continues.
"I 
am indebted to Prof. McConnell for arranging the position on my behalf and to Dr.

Vincent and The American Ireland Fund for providing much appreciated funding"
<P>
	In Indianapolis at the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana 
University Medical Center, Andrew Lindsay's research under Dr. Jay Tischfield 
included a "micro-satellite analysis of breast cancer."
<P>
	Says Lindsay: "It is due to Dr. Tischfield that I now know that I want to 
continue in research when I graduate. "I would also like to thank The American 
Ireland Fund for giving me the opportunity to go America in the first place," the

Trinity student adds. "It was a very valuable and rewarding experience which I
will 
look back on for the rest of my life."

<H2>The Texas Award Fund</H2>

The Board of The American Ireland Fund recently approved three projects to
receive 
grants from The Texas Award Fund. This award fund, which is part of the permanent

endowment fund of the AIF was originally set up by the American Irish Foundation
at a 
meeting in Houston in 1979 and owes much to the drive, vision and generosity of
Board 
member Connie Ryan of Houston. Connie and others, including Bill Vincent and
Brian 
Burns, made the original contributions to the Fund and the Burkitt Foundation
made a 
$75,000 matching grant. George William Burkitt, a native of County Down, came to
the 
U.S. in the 1800Õs and settled in Texas.

<H3>Glenstal Abbey</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="149" SRC="graphics/p13a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Glenstal Abbey, founded in 1927, is a high school for two hundred and ten
students, 
which enjoys a distinguished reputation in Ireland. It is home to forty nine
monks who 
are at the service of the Church and society in Ireland. However, it is also home
to a 
rare book collection; among the twenty-five thousand volumes in the library,
there are 
over one hundred books dating from the early seventeenth century. A $50,000 grant
from 
the Texas Award Fund of the AIF is being used to help catalogue, computerize and 
conserve its rare book collection, as part of a comprehensive development plan
which 
facilitates access to the library for scholars and other visitors.

<H3>University of Limerick American Studies Program</H3>
The University of Limerick has received a grant of $50,000 for a program of
American 
Studies at the University which will assist international understanding of the
U.S. 
and its role in the emerging global society. It was proposed to establish an
American 
Resource and Research Centre which will provide a focal point on the campus for
those 
engaged in American Studies and will support planned academic programs in the
field of 
American Studies.

<H3>Magdalene College Charles Stuart Parnell Fellowship</H3>
The object of this senior research FellowshipÐin effect a visiting
ProfessorshipÐis to 
promote the highest level of active study in Irish history, language, culture and

institutions, and to bring the fruits of that study before the wider academic 
community, and beyond. Such study is vital if the populations of Ireland and
Britain 
are to understand each other and the past and present which binds the two
together. 
This is an ongoing project in Cambridge University which has received substantial

support from the AIF to date, including this  $50,000 grant. The Fellowship has 
attracted world renown academics such as Prof. Joe Lee and Prof. McDonagh.

<H2>1996 Literary Award Winner</H2>

When the Swedish Academy of Letters awarded Seamus Heaney the 1995 Nobel Prize for 
literature, the Derry-born poet was cited for "works of lyrical beauty and ethical 
depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past." The Nobel Prize brings with 
it international acclaim and a $1 million award.
<P>
	Like so many creative artists, however, Seamus Heaney struggled early in his career
 to support his labors with pen and paper. In 1975, when he published "North," Heaney 
generously thanked the 1973 American Ireland Fund Literary Award for allowing him to 
work on that important bookÕs composition with less than the usual financial worry.
<P>
	Throughout the last quarter century, the Thomas F. O'Neill family of New York and 
Florida has funded the Award's $15,000 prize. The Award was first given in 1972 by the 
American Irish Foundation to Austin Clarke; when the Foundation merged with the 
Ireland Fund in 1987, it became known as The American Ireland Fund Literary Award.
<P>
<H2>Michael Longley</H2>

Over the last 25 years, the American Ireland Fund Literary Award has established 
itself as one of the most important prizes  given to Irish writers of poetry, prose 
and plays. The honorees have been men and women of great artistry and creative skill 
whose work has given voice to Ireland's past and present, its delights and its sorrows.
<P>
For 1996, the AIF Literary Award winner is poet Michael Longley of Belfast, whose work 
includes No Continuing City (1969), Man Lying on a Wall (1976), and Gorse Fires (1991),
 which received the Whitbread Prize for Poetry. His most recent book, The Ghost Orchid,
 was published in the U.S. in February by Wake Forest University Press.
 <P>
	"Longley's compassionate perception of his modern world is deftly embodied in a 
lucid, restrained elegance," one critic has written, while the Times Literary 
Supplement has praised "Longley's poetry [as] impressive for its skill, its cadences, 
and the naturalness of the voice speaking within it."
<P>
	Michael Longley was born in Belfast in 1939. For a number of years, he served as 
Director for Literature and the Traditional Arts on the Arts Council of Northern 
Ireland. He is married to the critic Edna Longley and has three children.
<P>
<H3>Evidence Is On The World's Bookshelves</H3>
Now in its 25th year, the American Ireland Fund Literary Award has consistently 
honored the very best of Irish writers. The honor roll of AIF Literary Award winners 
reads like the table of contents for an anthology of contemporary Irish poetry, prose, 
and playwriting.
<P>
	The Irish Times praised the Literary Award as "evidence that the Irish in the 
United States are doing something to help the culture of the mother-country." Each 
year, that evidence accumulates on bookshelves and stages around the world.
<P>
	Indeed, the Award's silver anniversary will be marked in Ireland by publication of 
The Flight Path, a limited edition collection of works especially contributed by 
previous winners.
<P>
<H3>Breathing and Creative Space</H3>
According to Thomas Flanagan in his forward to The Flight Path, the intention of the 
Award, as envisioned in 1971 by Thomas Jordan, formally the AIF's San Francisco-based 
Associate Director, "was to give young writers a breathing and creative space." 
William Shannon, then an editorial writer for the New York Times and later U.S. 
Ambassador to Ireland, agreed to chair the Selection Committee.
<P>
	Under Shannon's direction, the Award's purview grew to include writers whose 
lifetime contribution have enriched Ireland's cultural heritage.
<P>
	In 1988, Flanagan, author of "The Year of the French," took up the committee's 
reins following Shannon's death. Other committee members have included many respected 
Irish-based poets and novelists.
<P>
	Through the Award, the American Ireland Fund has established a strong and enduring 
link between Ireland through the men and women who give voice to Ireland's past and 
presents, its delights and its sorrows.

<H2>Indomitable, Courageous Joyce McCartan</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="129" SRC="graphics/p18a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
The old Pensions Building in Washington was filled with the buzz and excitement of the 
National Gala as the packed audience, including some of the most powerful and 
influential men and women in the nations capital settled themselves for the after 
dinner speeches. Suddenly, in a vivid moment, a familiar craggy face filled the 
screens and the hard vowels of Belfast in a rasping, gravely voice cut through the 
noise and demanded attention. It was back to reality with a bump.
<P>
	The face, and the voice, belonged to Joyce McCartan, an old friend of the Ireland 
Funds. There she was, standing in the middle of the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast, near 
the old markets area, a sectarian interface, a flashpoint for riot and trouble, the 
scene of bombs, attacks and murders, an expanse of inner-city dereliction and ruin.
<P>
	And there was Joyce, in command, indomitable, courageous and outgoing - pointing 
to all the developments she had brought about: a cafe here to from a focus for women 
and a community centre, a training unit there to provide computer skills and jobs for 
local kids and to lead them into employment, a family centre, a hostel, a future hotel,
 work, work, work, improvement, community building, pointing a better way, to politics 
and constructive effort as an alternative to violence.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
	As the cameras panned round both her achievements, she said public tribute to the 
help and encouragement she had received from the American Ireland Fund.
		For Joyce, indomitable, indestructable, courageous, hopeful succumbed to 
ill-health and died a month after the President's visit, after a very short period in 
hospital, battling and fighting to the end, interested in people, selfless, unselfish 
and committed.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="180" SRC="graphics/p18b.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT">
	Joyce McCartan was well to know the Ireland Funds and had many friends there. She 
spoke passionately about her work at the Dublin Conference in 1994 and the next year 
in Belfast. Her message was always the same: help us to help ourselves. We can do it 
our own way. We can beat the bomb and the bullet, poverty and injustice. We can do it 
by crossing sectarian barriers, by building trust, by getting together on the issues 
which matter to us as wives, as mothers, as ordinary people, and fighting for them.
<P>
		Three of her sons were murdered. No fewer than twenty one members of her 
extended family were killed in the troubles - some by the IRA, some by the British 
Army and the Police, some by sectarian assassins, some by chance. This litany would 
have crushed most people, but not Joyce McCartan. Every time, she came back with 
renewed effort, more determined than ever to find an alternative to violence, more 
determined too to build bridges across sectarian divisions which would lessen the 
chance of conflict in the future.
<P>
	It was Joyce's great strength that she derived the potential of women to bring 
about change. She began bringing them together, first in the Womens Circle and then 
with the help and advise of Advisory Committee member Kate Kelly, reaching out to 
women in all areas of Belfast and further afield.
<P>
		Fund members and donors will remember with affection Joyce's parting words to 
the Washington gala: "Only for the American Ireland Fund I could not have done a thing.
 They stood by me at the beginning when nobody else did."

<H2>The Famine Museum</H2>

Has received a $41,000 grant from The American Ireland Fund. Between 1845 and 1850 in 
Ireland, one million people died of starvation and disease and another 1.8 million 
fled to the United States and Canada. The Great Famine was a watershed in Irish 
history with cultural and social implications for Europe and North America. "The 
centrality of the Great Famine in Irish history has had a major impact on the 
development of Ireland and on Irish communities overseas," says Luke Dodd, 
administrator of the Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, Co. Roscommon. "It is 
fundamental to the Irish sense of heritage and identity."
<P>
<H3>Respect and Honor for "Ordinary Suffering"</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="213" SRC="graphics/p21.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">


On May 14, 1994, the Famine Museum was opened by President of Ireland Mary Robinson. 
This project has recently received a substantial grant from The American Ireland Fund 
which is helping Strokestown and the National Library of Ireland to undertake 
cataloging the approximately 50,000 materials related to the Strokestown Estate in 
order to preserve them for study by students and scholars.
<P>
	"Here in the Famine Museum, at the very center of our history, we have the chance 
to claim the ordinary suffering, the anguish of a past in which men and women who 
were our ancestors did no more than barely survive," President Robinson said. 
<P>
From photographs, letters, official documents and 19th-century satirical cartoons to 
farm implements and a huge iron cauldron from which soup was distributed in a famine 
relief program, the museum's exhibits are organized around such related themes as 
emigration, eviction, resistance and starvation and disease.
<P>
	"This is probably the most unusual heritage project in this country," observes 
Luke Dodd, who was the creative force behind the project.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<H3>"Meaning" Restored</H3>

For a number of important reasons, Strokestown Park is an especially appropriate 
location for the Famine Museum. Strokestown Park House was built during the 1730s for 
Thomas Mahon, a member of Parliament. The architect was Richard Castle, a German 
recently settled in Ireland, and one of the best exponents of then-fashionable 
neo-Palladian architectural principles. When constructed, Strokestown Park House 
operated as the nucleus of a 30,000-acre estate.
<P>
	According to agricultural experts, what caused the Famine was the over-reliance 
in Ireland on a single kind of potato, known as "the lumper," which was vulnerable to 
the particular blight fungus that struck in the 1840s. In 1845, when the blight 
became especially severe, Strokestown Park passed to Major Denis Mahon, who knew 
little about the business of estate management.
<P>
	Like many other landlords, the arrival of the potato blight left Major Mahon 
faced with bankruptcy, as most of his over-populated estate was producing no income. 
Under the direction of his land agent, Mahon initiated schemes to get the estate back 
into order, which included organized emigration and eviction. Thousands perished, 
either on the estate or making the trans-Atlantic journey. Such was the outrage felt 
by locals that Major Mahon was shot dead in 1847 not far from town.
<P>
	"The setting gives the museum its great power," notes Dodd. "We have sought to 
make a restoration of the meaning of the place. The estate no longer exists only as a 
monument to the family who lived there, but also to commemorate the tens of thousands 
of tenants whose lives were inextricably bound up with the 'Big House,' but who were 
seldom, if ever, acknowledged."

<H3>Education is the Real Test</H3>
Central to the museum's purpose is educating not only visitors, but also 
schoolchildren in all of Ireland. A full-time education officer at the museum worked 
closely with curriculum development people in the Department of Education to 
construct appropriate instruction programs.
<P>
	"Ensuring the success of the educational portion of the museum has been a real 
test," Dodd says. "The Famine Museum is about lots of different voices and about the 
difficulty of taking a 19th-century object and displaying it to a 20th-century 
audience."

<H2>Heating Up Palm Beach</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="255" SRC="graphics/p22a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
Traditionally the American Ireland Fund "season" kicks off with the annual Palm Beach 
Gala Dinner held at the famed Breakers Hotel. 1996 was no exception and perhaps it 
was the ferocity of this year's winter that attracted so many "snowbirds" from New 
York, Boston, Chicago and other points North. (Then again, it might have been the 
promise of a few rounds of golf and the odd cocktail party that was the lure...). 
Indeed we were honored by the attendance of a number of dignitaries from Ireland 
including former President Hillary and his wife and the current Minister for Finance, 
Ruari Quinn. In addition, Presidents of four Irish Universities were in attendance.
<P>
	Mike Gibbons and his hardworking dinner committee put on a terrific evening with 
the highlight being a remarkable speech by the 86 year old Judge Owen McGivern of New 
York and first class entertainment courtesy of Brendan Grace.

The San Francisco chapter of the American Ireland Fund broke all records for 
attendance and money raised when they held their annual dinner on March 9th. The 
reason for this was the choice of honoree, Tom Tracy who attracted a terrific wave of 
support. In addition the Dinner Chairman Philip Stapleton introduced many newcomers 
to the Fund. Besides honoring Tom Tracy and his family a special award and tribute 
was paid to the retiring West Coast Director of the AIF, Tom Jordan. First class 
entertainment was provided by Hal Roach and Phil Coulter.

<H2>The Big Show: Washington D.C.</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="241" SRC="graphics/p25d.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT">

The last three years have seen dramatic growth in the size and importance of the 
Washington National Gala under the guidance of dinner chairman Paul Quinn. This year 
the event, attended by 1,000 people, was held in the stunning National Building 
Museum, probably the most magnificent venue ever used by the AIF. The list of 
attendees was impressive, headed by First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Other 
speakers included the Chairman of the Democratic Party, Chris Dodd, head of Friends 
of Ireland, Jim Walsh, Congressman Ben Gilman, President of the AFL/CIO John Sweeney 
and National President of The American Ireland Fund, Loretta Brennan Glucksman. The 
Prime Minister of Ireland, John Bruton, gave a stirring speech and the audience 
included leaders of all the major parties in Northern Ireland as well as British and 
Irish cabinet ministers and over 100 U.S. Congressmen and Senators as well as 
representatives of major U.S. companies with operations in Ireland. The dinner which 
was co-chaired by Ginny Grenham and Paul Quinn was a major success and the evening 
was topped off  by everybody congregating in a unique Irish Pub, specially built for 
the evening which had been sponsored and amply stocked by Murphy's Irish Stout.

The American Ireland Fund enourages the next generation of supporters to take an 
interest in the work of the Fund both with stand alone events and by encouraging 
attendance at the major events. Already this year both Boston and Los Angeles have 
had "Young" events which attracted major support.

<H2>Partying in Pittsburgh</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="258" SRC="graphics/p28a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
For the third time in 12 months the American Ireland Fund raised over $1 million 
dollars AT A single event and this time it was Pittsburgh thanks to the generosity of 
Tony and Chryss O'Reilly, Lew and Loretta Glucksman and Joe Bogdanovich.  The dinner 
honored the latter, a legend in the U.S. fishing industry as President of Starkist 
Tuna.  Just weeks before the dinner he had visited a number of Ireland Fund projects 
which included a tour of Dublin Harbor aboard the Dun Laoighaire Lifeboat - Dublin's 
sea rescue service which is both a volunteer organization and funded by private 
donations. The dinner also honored Kevin McClatchey who has recently become the owner 
of Pittsburgh's baseball team The Pirates. One of the highlights of the record 
breaking evening from every point of view was an extraordinary one hour virtuoso 
performance from Bill Cosby who had donated his services to the American Ireland Fund 
for the evening.

<H2>Big Apple Bash</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="225" SRC="graphics/p30a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">

The American Ireland Funds' 21st dinner in the Big Apple was certainly a night to 
remember with a whole series of highlights. Nearly 1,200 people were welcomed by AIF 
Chairman, Tony O'Reilly to a huge marquee attached to the Tavern on the Green and 
paid tribute to the night's honorees Mike Roarty and Liam Neeson. The latter received 
the AIF's Performaing Arts Award for 1996 which was presented to him by last year's 
winner Neil Jordan. The evergreen Mike Roarty had the audience in stitches with his 
stories and accolades were also given to Allied Irish Bank's Jerry Casey who 
co-chaired the dinner with Tony O'Reilly. A dramatic highlight of the evening was the 
surprise announcement of a $1 million gift to The Amercian Ireland Fund by Lew 
Glucksman who received a standing ovation for his generosity.

<H2>Celebrating The Year of the Irish in France</H2>
<IMG WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="243" SRC="graphics/p32a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">


Throughout 1996, France marks the "Year of the Irish" with over 1,000 special events 
including film screenings, authors' readings, and music performances. For Pierre 
Joannon, Chairman of the Ireland Fund of France and Honorary Consul General of 
Ireland in Antibes, the "Year of the Irish" presents an opportunity to acquaint the 
French people with the achievements of contemporary Ireland. "There's an immense 
goodwill in France toward Ireland, but itÕs not always founded on a deep knowledge of 
what Ireland is really like today," he says."Certainly, Ireland is no longer the 
quaint country of 'The Quiet Man.'"
<P>

<H3>An Irish Honeymoon</H3>
Few Frenchmen know Ireland as well or love its people as deeply as Pierre Joannon. In 
1964, newlyweds Pierre and Annick Joannon cancelled a honeymoon trip to Scotland 
because of a typhoid scare there. Instead, they went to Ireland on a month-long tour 
that eventually took them from the Glens of Antrim in the North to Kerry at the 
island's southern tip.
<P>
	Their unexpected exploration left the Joannons with a lasting love for the island 
of Ireland, and they now have a house in Clonbur, Co. Galway, overlooking Lough Corrib.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<H3>Cannes With an Irish Accent</H3>
Scholar, writer, and lawyer, Joannon became Honorary Consul General of Ireland in 1973.
 His elegant home, a 19th-century villa known as "Les Chnes Verts" ("the green oaks"),
 lies appropriately on Boulevard John F. Kennedy. Among many other events he holds 
there to promote Irish culture and industry, Joannon hosts a glamorous party each May 
for Irish actors, producers, and filmmakers attending the nearby Cannes Film Festival.
<P>
	Joannon's work on behalf of broadening French understanding of Ireland sees him 
move effortlessly from the glitterati to the literati. Among other works, he is 
author of a critically-acclaimed "History of Ireland"; a biography of Michael Collins;
 as well as authoritative essays on James Joyce and William Butler Yeats.
 <P>
	In addition, Joannon launched with Professor Patrick Rafroidi, president of 
University of Lille, the bilingual publication, Etudes Irlandaises, considered the 
most serious journal of Irish studies published in France over the last two decades.
<P>
<H3>At the Wild Geese Ball</H3>
The inaugural event of the "Year of the Irish" in France, Joannon reports, was the 
1996 Ireland Fund of France benefit dinner in Paris at the at the elegant Pre Catelan 
restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne. The gala fundraiser took place on the eve of the 
annual France-Ireland rugby game.
<P>
	The dinner's guest of honor was Dr. Michael Smurfit, who received the first "Wild 
Geese Award," a bronze sculpture by Tanya Nyegaard of Dublin. As owner of Cellulose 
du Pin, based in Bordeaux, the Smurfit group is now the biggest employer in France's 
southwest region of Aquitaine.
<P>
	The term "Wild Geese" stems from the annual migration of young Irishmen in the 
17th and 18th centuries, to join the armies of the European powers, or to seek an 
education and a livelihood. Many Irish names still survive in France, Spain, and 
Austria.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>"France owes much to Ireland"</H3>
In June 1969, President Charles de Gaulle of France toured Dublin Castle, where he 
spoke warmly of French-Irish relations. Pierre Joannon detailed the General's deep 
affection for the Emerald Isle in his book, "De Gaulle and Ireland". "Ireland...has 
always held, and still holds today, a special place in the hearts of Frenchmen," de 
Gaulle noted to his hosts who included Taoiseach Jack Lynch, Ireland's Prime Minister. "You have just said, Mr. Prime Minister, what Ireland owes to France," de Gaulle continued, "but France owes much to Ireland. There are imperishable links... There is the example which you have always given and which your people, so courageous, so noble and so generous have always given...".
<P>
<HR>
<P>


Paris: From all over France, as well as from Ireland, the U.S. and elsewhere, the 
Irish flocked to the fifth annual Galas of The Ireland Fund of France, held in Paris 
on the eve of the France-Ireland rugby game. Held in the salons of the Pr Catelan, 
one of the most elegant and prestigious restaurants in the French capital, attendance 
surpassed normal capacity.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Renamed this year the "Wild Geese Ball", the event was dedicated to the Irish in 
France and their achievements down the centuries. Hosts of the evening were the Duke 
and Duchess of Magenta, whose family, the MacMahons, trace their desent from Brian 
Boru, King of Ireland, and who gave to the French Republic one of its most famous 
Presidents, Marshal MacMahon. Many of those present at the Ball were distinguished 
descendants of the Wild Geese - those Irish who fought under the French flag in past 
centuries.
<P>
	The proceeds of the Wild Geese Ball  will support the Chryss O'Reilly Scholarship 
Program, which helps young Irish people to undertake French and European studies. The 
generosity of the Fund's patrons also enables The Ireland Fund of France to finance 
the travel and treatment of French children with serious blood diseases at Paul 
Newman's "Hole in the Wall Gang Camp" at Barretstown, County Kildare, as well as 
other charitable and cultural projects in the Franco-Irish context.
<P>
	Organizers of the work of The Ireland Fund of France are Pierre Joannon, the 
writer and historian, and Tadgh F. O'Sullivan, a former Irish Ambassador to 
Washington, Moscow and Paris.

John O'Neill: One of Sydney's best known businessmen, John O'Neill, is chairman of 
The Australian Ireland Fund. Trained as a lawyer, John was Chief Executive Officer of 
the State Bank of New South Wales for 8 years until June of 1995. He then took over 
as Managing Director and CEO of the Australian Rugby Union Ltd. Australia was World 
Rugby Champion from 1991 to 1995. John takes over control of Australian Rugby at a 
time of rapid change in the structure of the game. John's Irish roots are on both 
sides. His grandfather is an O'Neill from Kerry and his grandmother a Galvin from 
Clare. John is particularly looking forward to next November when Australia will play 
Ireland in Dublin.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

Towards the end of 1995 the Australian Ireland Fund held a remarkably successful 
garden party which realized a profit of over $140,000 which allowed them to support 
the following projects in Ireland: The Belfast Community Circus School  *  The 
Committee for the Administration of Justice * Londonderry YMCA * The Phoenix Trust * 
Shankhill Community Information Service * West Belfast Festival * Women's Information 
Drop-in Centre * Women Together. The Fund has also decided to co-fund the residency 
for Australian writers at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre for Artists in Co. Monaghan, 
Ireland. The proposal is for an Australian writer to visit the Centre for three 
months. The Fund also received $5,000 for the Irish Wheelchair Association from the 
Lansdowne Club's annual St. Patrick's Day lunch in Sydney. Fund directors Peter and 
Jane Cosgrove, Margaret Whitlam, Charles Curran and Patrick Lynam attended the lunch 
and the guest of honor was Irish government minister Avril Doyle.

<H2>13th Annual St. Patrick's Day Luncheon Canada</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="219" SRC="graphics/p34a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">

Wit, warmth and wisdom was the theme of this year's annual luncheon. over 1,100 
people arrived to share in an afternoon of the best Irish fun, entertainment and food.
 Certainly the warmth and wit were very much in evidence at the pre lunch reception 
where Kilkenny Cream Ale in cans was being launched in Canada by Guinness. 
Entertainment was provided by Inishowen, a group of traditional Irish musicians.
<P> 
	Fourteen fortunate people who each generously donated $5,000 to The Ireland Fund 
of Canada for the honour of being an honorary Irish person for the day, were each 
presented with a scroll listing the privileges this position bestows. Included in 
these special gifts are "Exemption from Murphy's Law", "The Gift of Blarney", and 
"Entry into Tir na nOg". One hundred people have been inducted into this prestigious 
group over the years.
<P>
	Hal Roach kept everyone laughing for forty five minutes and surpassed his 
reputation as "Ireland's funniest man". At the post luncheon party people danced to 
the music of the Frankie Benson Band and enjoyed Irish Coffees. Mr. Tom Savage, 
Chairman of the National Board of The Ireland Fund of Canada welcomed Mr. Brendan 
Howlin, Minister of the Environment who brought greetings from the Taoiseach. Mr. 
Ronan Corvin first Secretary, Irish Embassy, Ottowa also attended. The British High 
Commissioner, Mr. Anthony Goodenough and the British Consul General were also in 
attendance. Mr. John Clare was chairman of the luncheon. His committee from the 
Toronto Chapter of the Ireland Fund and the volunteers who worked tirelessly to

<H2>Why There is Still a Need for The Ireland Funds</H2>


<H3>Advisory Board</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="188" SRC="graphics/p37a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">

Over the past year I have occasionally heard people ask the question "Is there still 
a need for The Ireland Funds?" In asking this question they point to the peace process
 in Northern Ireland. They highlight the booming Irish economy with its record levels 
of growth backed by massive subventions from the European Union. With the advent of 
such positive development they quite reasonably wonder if there is any need for the 
Ireland Funds to continue to pursue their triple goals of promoting peace, culture 
and charity in both parts of the island. My answer to such doubts is "Yes, there is 
still a very important role for the Funds to play. Indeed in many ways the need is 
greater than ever before."
<P>
	There are many reasons why this is the case. In this short article I will just 
highlight three of them. First, the peace process still needs all the support it can 
get. Secondly, there is a critical task to assist groups in Ireland to cope with the 
effects of very rapid economic, social and cultural transition. Thirdly, the Funds 
have a unique role to play in giving moral support and encouragement to groups and 
individuals struggling to build a better future.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>

<H3>Promoting Peace</H3>
The experience of the past eighteen months has brought home to everyone that the 
cessation of violence is only the beginning and not the end of a long and difficult 
process of peace is to be firmly embedded in both communities. Hopefully the current 
breakdown in the ceasefire will be overcome and all the political parties will shortly 
enter into meaningful talks. It is further to be hoped that these talks will 
eventually lead to some political compromise, though there can be no certainty about 
this. However, even when and if they do, that will only be another stage of the 
process completed.
	What has become very apparent over the recent months is the depth and extent of 
polarization that exists between the two communities. There is a serious lack of 
trust between the various players. Fear, hatred and sectarianism are still very real 
factors. Many people still feel alienated and excluded from the mainstream of society 
in Northern Ireland. There are deeply sensitive and difficult issues like traditional 
marches and policing to be tackled.
	If these issues are to be addressed there will need to be continuing support for
community relations and reconciliation initiatives. The work of local community groups,
 voluntary organizations and women's groups in building peace from the bottom up in 
some of the most disadvantages and divided communities will continue to be vital. 
This is the type of work that the Ireland Funds have supported over the past two 
decades and which has been so important in creating the climate that has made the 
peace process possible. It is essential that such work not only continue but is 
further intensified. Thus, the Ireland Funds need to continue to give a lead to 
others in supporting such work. It is uniquely well placed to do so given its 
long-established reputation for fair and impartial support to projects from both main 
traditions and in all parts of the island.
<P>
<H3>Supporting Transition</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="197" SRC="graphics/p37b.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT">

Ireland is a country undergoing very rapid economic, social and cultural transition. 
The process of very rapid change and development has many positive features. However, 
it is also a cause of much uncertainty and insecurity. Significant numbers of people 
have not benefited from the recent very rapid economic progress. There are very 
serious problems of unemployment and especially longterm unemployment. Some 
traditional communities, especially in rural areas, have experienced serious decline 
and decay. In the major urban areas there are growing problems of ghetto areas with 
high concentrations of disadvantage. Many of the traditional leadership figures and 
many of the values that Irish society has built around are being increasingly 
challenged.
<P>
	Coping with this rapid change in a positive and constructive manner represents an 
enormous challenge. I believe that the Ireland Funds have a key role to play in 
assisting both parts of the island to meet this challenge. In this regard there is an 
urgent need to support creative and imaginative projects that will help to build an 
inclusive society by promoting constructive community development initiatives that 
will help rebuild flourishing local communities. There is also a need to support 
projects which will help preserve the best of Irish culture and society and to define 
a new and distinctive Irish identity and value system within the context of a modern 
economy and society. These again are exactly the sorts of projects that the Ireland 
Funds have in the past given a lead in supporting and which the Funds are so well 
placed to identify and support in the future.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
<H3>Moral Support And Leadership</H3>
When I first became involved in advising the Ireland Funds on projects to support in 
Northern Ireland back in the late 1970s I very quickly discovered that one of the 
really important things about the Funds was that they brought much more than money to 
the projects. Their support gave to groups and individuals struggling to build a 
better future and to promote reconciliation a real sense of their efforts being 
valued and endorsed. In many cases these were projects that up to then not many people 
had appreciated the importance of. That sense of moral support continues to be true 
both for project in the Republic as much as in Northern Ireland. A cheque from the 
Ireland Funds means for recipients not only much needed money but also that a major 
network involving many eminent and successful people is saying that their efforts to 
build a better future or to work for peace and reconciliation really matter.
<P>
	This sense of endorsement has been further enhanced over the years with the 
growing recognition of the Ireland Funds as a worldwide confederation of people 
concerned about Ireland. I think that many projects supported by the Funds have a real 
sense that they have become a part of a great network of people concerned to encourage 
positive progress and development on the island. There is no other foundation or 
organization concerned with Ireland that I know of that can play quite this role.
<P>
<H3>In Conclusion</H3>
These then are just three reasons why the Ireland Funds are needed as much now as in 
the past. It is also important to recognize how well placed the Funds are to meet 
this challenge. They combine several elements in a way that make them a distinctive 
leading force in philanthropy in Ireland. They operate on all island basis. They have 
a well-established track record for enlightening grant-making. They have a 
well-merited reputation in both Unionist and Nationalist communities for being fair 
and even-handed. They have a proven ability to identify and support new and 
imaginative projects. They have significant status as a result of having a worldwide 
network of eminent and distinguished supporters. All of these factors combined mean 
that the Funds are uniquely well-qualified to continue to play a leading and much 
needed role in promoting peace, culture and charity in Ireland.
<P>

<H3>Biographical Note:</H3> 
Hugh Frazer is a member of the Irish Executive and Advisory 
Committees of the Ireland Funds and he has been involved in advising the Funds since 
the late 1970s. He comes from Cullybackey in Co. Antrim. He is former director of the 
Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust and is currently director of the Combat Poverty 
Agency in Dublin. He has written and lectured extensively on issues of community 
relations and community development. He is also an artist who specializes in painting 
the urban landscape.
<P>
A cheque from the Ireland Funds means for recipients not only much needed money but 
also that a major network involving many eminent and successful people is saying that 
their efforts to build a better future or to work for peace and reconciliation really 
matter.
<P>
The Funds are uniquely well-qualified to continue to play a leading and much needed 
role in promoting peace, culture and charity in Ireland.

At the Ireland Fund of Great Britain's fifth annual greyhound racing dinner on March 6
at Wembley Stadium, over 300 enthusiastic "punters" gathered to cheer on their
favorites. The event was hosted by the Hon. Kevin Pakenham.<BR>
Those attending included Richard Willis, who heads up the Mulligan's chain and Sarah
Willis; radio and TV personality Fred Housego; as well as Brendan Darby and Julie
Rumble of the Bank of Ireland. Among the race sponsors were Kelly Communications,
represented by Fiona and Declan Kelly.<BR>
The IFGB kept its fundraising calendar full with a St. Patrick's Night Party held at
the Porchester Hall, Bayswater, and hosted by Hugo MacNeill and Rory Tobin. In May,
the
Fund also sponsored an Ascot Racing Dinner hosted by Stephen Quinn and David Reid
Scott.

<H3>Ireland Fund of Canada</H3>

On the occasion of their joint visit to Toronto, the Lord Mayors of Dublin and Belfast
were guests for an Ireland Fund of Canada fundraiser hosted with Co-
operation North and Toronto's Mayor Barbara Hall. The special evening preceeded a
series of St. Patrick's Day events on behalf of the IFC held across Canada.
In Toronto on March 17, the Fund's twelfth annual St. Patrick's Luncheon at the Metro
Toronto Convention Centre attracted more than 1,100 leading business people,
politicians and professionals including Catherine Graham, IFC chair and Peggy Delaney,
one of the luncheon's founding members. Businessman Jim Keating said, "This is a day
when everyone can get together and toast Ireland."<BR>
Elsewhere, the St. Patrick's Society of Montreal joined the IFC for a March 17 benefit
dinner. At the Westin Hotel, Edmonton area supporters attended a St. Patrick's Emerald
Ball hosted by Doodie Cahill, Edmonton Chapter Chairman, and Colm O'Carroll, Vice
Chairman.<BR>
On May 5, the IFC's Ottawa Chapter held its fifth annual Emerald Ball at the Chteau
Laurier Hotel with entertainment by the local branch of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann.
Dinner chairmen for the festive evening were Pat Whelan and Chris Murray.

The President's response was sincere, heartfelt, and poignant. He paid special
tribute to the Fund and Speaker O'Neill, whom he hailed as a man of the people, a
bricklayer's son who became the most powerful man in Congress and the nation's
most prominent champion of
working people.
<P>
"Speaker O'Neill loved politics because he knew it could make a difference in
people's lives," President Clinton said. "The O'Neill Chair in Peace Studies at
the University of Ulster sponsored by the American Ireland Fund will be a fitting
tribute to his long life and legacy, for Tip O'Neill knew that peace must be
nurtured by a deeper understanding among people and greater economic opportunity
for all.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
"Of all the voices I've heard along this trip," he continued, "the most inspiring
were those of two children I met this morning at the Mackie Plant in Belfast, and
all those children, including some from Derry, who wrote to me in recent weeks
about their aspirations for peace in heartfelt
terms. I know they don't want to go back to the way things used to be. They want
a better future. They deserve it. And I know you, in the American Ireland Fund,
can help make it happen."

BE A PART OF THE 1996 NATIONAL GALA
</CENTER>
<P>
Once again in 1996, the American Ireland Fund's National Gala takes place on
Thursday, March 14, in the National Building Museum in Washington, DC.
<P>
The success of the last several "National Galas" made funding possible for the
O'Neill Chair in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster as well as other
important AlF initiatives to promote peace, reconciliation and renewal across
Ireland, North and South.
<P>
The 1996 Dinner will honor two great friends of Ireland, the Honorable Benjamin
A. Gilman, Chairman, International Operations and Human Rights Committee and Mr
John Sweeney, President, AFL-CIO. The President of the United States, Mr Bill
Clinton and the Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. John Bruton are also invited
guests.

AIF ESTABLISHES "TIP" O'NEILL CHAIR IN PEACE STUDIES
</CENTER>
<P>
In 1979, US Speaker Thomas P "Tip" O'Neill, Jr., went to Belfast as the first
American politician to promote dialogues with parties in Northern Ireland. He
believed that no matter the difference in race, religion, and ideology, with
honest debate and open dialogue the peace was there to be grasped.
<P>
The O'Neill Chair in Peace Studies at the University of Ulster in Derry will be
part of INCORE, which is a joint international program between the United Nations
University and the University of Ulster in the field of
conflict resolution and ethnicity. It will be a visiting chair and the holder
will develop non-violent approaches to conflict resolution and management,
particularly in the field of ethnic conflict. He/she will also examine the
American experience of pluralism for its lessons, positive and negative, and its
relevance to Ireland and other societies.

<H3>PEACE THROUGH TRADE IS TOPIC AT WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE</H3>
</CENTER>

WASHINGTON-In May, the White House Conference for Trade and
Investment in Ireland gathered together hundreds of major political and business
figures from throughout the US, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Great Britain. In
the first morning alone, the line-up of speakers included President Bill Clinton;
Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; and
former US Sen. George Mitchell. The American Ireland Fund was among a list of
corporate sponsors that also included Mutual of America Life Insurance Company;
Charles Schwab & Co.; and H.J. Heinz, co.
<P>
"Above all else, it was the atmosphere, a really tangible sense that not
only was the violent phase of the conflict over, but also that everybody was
determined to preserve the sanctity of the peace process, and collectively, move
it to the next stage," noted Kingsley Aikins, Ireland Funds Chief Executive, in a
post-conference newspaper column.
<P>
"It was, without a doubt, a huge US triumph and a considerable feather in
the cap of the Clinton Administration who, a long time ago, was both willing to
put Ireland at the top of their foreign affairs agenda and also take risks to
push the peace process.
<P>
"That the conference was going to be something special could be felt on the eve
of its opening when the American Ireland Fund hosted a reception for visitors
from Ireland, mostly Northern Ireland. Nothing remarkable in that, except that
rarely could there have been such an extraordinary cross-section of political
parties in the one room. Totally impossible, even six months ago, the evening was
nearly surreal in the mix of attendance by former opponents.
<P>
"Only in America" is a phrase we often hear-that certainly applied to this
conference. It quite simply couldn't have happened anywhere else."

KILLARNEY-Following a year of construction, which was partially underwritten with
a $25,000 AIF grant, the Muckross Community Centre opened in July with President
of Ireland Mary Robinson on hand for the dedication ceremonies.
<P>
In June 1994, AIF Vice Chairman Bill Vincent laid the cornerstone for the
community center building. In 1932, Senator Arthur Vincent, Bill's father,
presented Muckross House and 11,000 acres to the people of Ireland, and it is
today one of Ireland's most popular tourist attractions.
<P>
Groups planning to use facilities at the Muckross Community Centre include a
local Boy Scout troop, sports clubs and the Muckross Youth Club. "It is our
intention that the center will be available to all sectors of the community, and
that it will help develop social, cultural, civic and economic activities in the
area," said Jerry O'Grady, Muckross Community Association chairman.

<H3>GOLF TOURNAMENT GIVES ST. JAMES HOSPITAL BOOST</H3>
</CENTER>

DUBLIN-In november, committee members of the American Ireland Fund Golf Toumament
presented a check for $45,000 to St. James Hospital. With the AIF grant to the
Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplant Accommodation Trust, the hospital will pay
off the mortgage on
a second apartment for the families of sick children built with AIF support.
<P>
"It's very satisfying," says Jack Kennedy, committee chairman for the
seventh annual AIF Golf Tournament at the Ocean Edge resort on Cape Cod, MA. "The
first apartment has been full every night since it was opened. We are pleased to
help ease the transition for Irish families who must bring their critically ill
children to Dublin for treatment."
<P>
Altogether, Kennedy estimated, AIF grants to St. James Hospital raised at the
annual Cape Cod golf tournament currently total over $120,000. MetLife was once
again the major corporate sponsor.

<H3>NOBEL LAUREATE HEANEY HAS AIF PEDIGREE</H3>
</CENTER>

DERRY-Born poet Seamus Heaney winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize for Literature, has
maintained a warm relationship with the Ireland Funds since he received the
American Ireland Fund Literary Award in 1973.
<P>
In awarding the $1 million Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy of Letters
cited Heaney for "works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday
miracles and the living past." Born into a farming family near Derry, Heaney, 56,
teaches at Harvard University and also has a home in Dublin.
<P>
In 1989, at the Ireland Funds Conference in Cork, Heaney delivered the keynote
address on "Varieties of Irishness."
<P>
"The more varieties there are in Ireland, the better and the healthier they
will turn out," he told a rapt audience. He compared the work of a writerin
which the impulse to write discovers direction in the poem as it is writtento
the work of the Ireland Funds, where the impulse to contribute to Ireland's
development finds fulfilment in the projects eventually chosen for support.
<P>
Throughout the years, Heaney has attended numerous functions of the
Ireland Funds, in particular the annual ceremonies for the AIF Literary Award.

<H3>GLUCKSMANS GIVE AIF $3 MILLION FOR EDUCATION</H3>
</CENTER>

<IMG WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="172" SRC="graphics/p7b.gif"
BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>
AIF National President Loretta Brennan Glucksman and her husband, Lewis Glucksman
have given a $3 million gift to the Amencan Ireland Fund for the promotion of
higher education in Ireland. The gift was formally announced at the Fund's Boston
dinner in November.
<P>
Beginning in 1993, the American Ireland Fund identified the specific area
of education as one where it would seek supplemental funding from its many
friends and supporters to address particularly pressing problems and exciting
opportunities which had been identified.
<P>
For many years the AIF has supported numerous Irish educational institutions.
This important education initiative recognizes that Ireland has a large
population of children to educate; Ireland's schools have extensive needs for
capital plant and equipment; and that there is a lack of any endowment to support
educational institutions.
<P>
As solutions, the AIF education initiative will promote and develop centers of
excellence at Ireland's universities; support rural education and development;
and otherwise seek support for various educational institutions including
libraries and museums.
<P>
In addition to serving as AIF National President, Loretta Brennan Glucksman is
president of Westland Associates. Lewis Glucksman is vice chairman of Smith
Barney, Inc. In 1993, the couple were honored at the AlF's New York dinner for
their long-term love of Ireland and its people.

The great strength of the Ireland Funds is that they represent voluntary effort
and that they reach throughout the world. The money invested in voluntary and
charitable activity in Ireland is, of course, both impressive in amount and
important in effect, but just as important in sustaining hope. That people with a
benign interest in Ireland from around the world were working on their behalf and
wanted to help was a significant factor in giving people courage.
<P>

The American Ireland Fund led the way and remains the biggest donor, but each of
the Ireland Funds brings its own distinct contribution. Canada has taken a
particular interest in Northern Ireland and Australia in integrated
education; France has developed links with Ireland through a special scholarship
program. The Ireland Fund of Great Britain divides its support between Ireland
and Great Britain.
<P>
The peace process falters at times, but hopefully keeps its sense of direction.
The task now is to begin to rebuild in Northern Ireland a society that has been
sundered by violence. The immediate need is for employment, the encouragement of
enterprise, and development of community self-help projects. It is important that peace should be seen to make a
difference in a real as well as an atmospheric way. For a young man or woman in
an area which has been riven with violence, the biggest difference would be work,
education and training-together, allowing him or her a chance to contribute to
society.
<P>
The ending of violence produces new sets of problems and new calls for support
from the Ireland Funds. The configuration of the Ireland Funds as an
international Confederation of Concern for Ireland broadens its sphere of
influence and projects a positive image of the new Ireland, North and South,
young, dynamic, committed to growth, edging towards a settlement which will
accommodate difference in Northern Ireland and secure peace
on the island.
<P>
In that tremendous endeavor, Ireland's people need, more than anything, the help,
support, and encouragement of their friends around the world. It is the genius of
the Ireland Funds that they provide just such a network, and a reservoir of
goodwill, guidance, assistance and practical encouragement.

<H3>A second decade and other "beginnings"</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="187" SRC="graphics/p16a.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
<BR>
ON OCTOBER 5. 1995, THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL "Night of Awakening Dreams" brought
together Chicagoans of Irish background, along with their Colleagues and friends,
who share a deep and lasting concern for all the people of Ireland.
<P>
The fundraising gala honored Edward A. Brennan, who recently retired as Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Sears, Roebuck and co. He started his career with
Sears in 1956 selling men's furnishings in Madison,
Wisconsin, and rose through the ranks to become the giant merchandiser's eleventh
Chairman in 1986. Brennan is the third generation of his family to work for the
company.
<P>
Dinner Chairman Patrick G. Ryan noted that the evening marked the beginning of
the American Ireland Fund's second decade in Chicago. "It also marks a beginning
for Ireland, too, and for all its people in the North
and in the South," he said. "With every passing day, the Irish people come
another step closer to peace and reconciliation."
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
Honoree Edward Brennan said, "The American Ireland Fund Dinner was one of the
nicest and most memorable events of my life. The presence of so many good friends
and the many expressions of good will meant a great deal to Lois and me."

<H3>Peter Lynch Chairs Million Dollar Gala</H3>

<IMG WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="207" SRC="graphics/p17a.gif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
<BR>
"As I'm sure it does for all of you, Ireland holds a very special place in my
heart," Peter Lynch, Boston dinner chairman and AIF Treasurer, told a gathering
of 1300 guests at the Fund's annual Hub gala. "We gather tonight as witnesses to
the progress the American Ireland Fund has brought to the island of Ireland over
the past 20 years."
<P>
Guest speaker for the 1995 Boston dinnerthe fourteenth annual such eventwas AIF
Chairman Tony O'Reilly. Advertising Co-Chairmen were Jack Connors, CEO of Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, and Edmund Kelly, President and COO of Liberty
Mutual.
<P>
In addition, Louise Doherty and Thomas Lee, students at Oakgrove College, a Derry
integrated high school, spoke about how support from the American Ireland Fund
for integrated education in Northern Ireland, had positively changed their lives
and their communities. (see below)
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
Irish folksinger Frances Black performed for guests who included Loretta Brennan
Glucksman, the new AIF National President. At the dinner, Loretta and Lew
Glucksman announced a $3 million AIF gift to build
a library at the University of Limerick (see article, p. 9).
<P>
For 1995, 120 business leaders and philanthropists were honored as "Founders" for
individual donations of $5,000. In addition, 25 "Underwriters" donated $10,000
each.

Taking risks for the cause of peace and reconciliation, the AIF sent its first
grant for integrated education to Lagan College in Belfast when the high school
opened in 1981. In nearly 15 years, Lagan's enrollment has ballooned from 30
pupils to over 700 and more than 20 such schools now operate across Northern
Ireland. AIF grants to support integrated education have continued throughout
that time, and have been joined by grants from other Ireland Funds, induding the
Australian Ireland Fund and the Ireland Fund of Canada.
<P>
The first children who attended integrated schools were part of a daring
experiment," noted the AlF's Kingsley Aikins, "but its been an experiment that
has worked, in large part because of the support from Ireland Funds around the
world."

With "Peace and Reconciliation" as its theme, the Ireland Fund of Canada held its
annual fall gala in Toronto on November 3 at the city's convention center. Dinner
chairman was Thomas Savage, chairman and president of North American Trust, who
is also the new national IFC chairman.
Entertainment included musical performances by the Carlton Show Band and Ciaran
Sheehan, Irish-born star of Toronto's "Phantom."
<P>
In October, the IFC held its first "CEO Breakfast". Corporate donors from
throughout Toronto's business community heard Diane Francis, Financial Post
editor.
"At the Ireland Fund of Canada, we have raised our goals and our expectations
about our fundraising events," says Bill Neill, Belfast-born vice president of
the Financial Post and a member of the IFC's national board. "The ceasefire in
Northern Ireland has added extra vigor to our efforts. If, through our grants, we
can encourage entrepreneurship and
programs such as integrated education, we can make a lasting contribution to the
peace process."
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Lord Mayors of Dublin and Belfast were guests for an
Ireland Fund of Canada fundraiser hosted with Co-operation North and Toronto's
Mayor Barbara Hall. The special evening preceded a series of St. Patrick's Day
events on behalf of the IFC held across Canada.
<P>
In Toronto on March 17, the Fund's twelfth annual St. Patrick's Luncheon at the
Metro Toronto Convention Centre attracted more than 1,100 leading business
people, politicians and professionals including Catherine Graham, former IFC
chair and Peggy Delaney, one of the luncheon's founding members. Businessman Jim
Keating said, "This is a day when everyone can get together and toast Ireland."
<P>
Elsewhere, the St. Patrick's Society of Montreal joined the IFC for a March 17
benefit dinner. At the Westin Hotel, Edmonton area supporters attended a St.
Patrick's Emerald Ball hosted by Doodie Cahill, Edmonton Chapter Chairman, and
Colm O'Carroll, Vice Chairman.

<H2Prominence in Pittsburgh</H2>

"Jobs are the foundation of peace," explains Rooney. "A person with a job is
contributing to his or her community. Without a job, there's a loss of dignity
that can lead to despair and violence."
<P>

<H3>Dan Rooney:
A Fighter Who Loves Peace</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="222" SRC="graphics/p7.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">

In over forty years working for one of the National Football League's premier
teams, Dan Rooney has consistently enjoyed success on and off the field. The
eldest son of Art "The Chief" Rooney, he became the Steelers' president in 1975.
The Pittsburgh native was born on the city's North Side, where he still lives
today.
<P>
	Last season, the hard-charging Pittsburgh Steelers won yet another NFC
Championship, earning them the right to face off against the Dallas Cowboys in
Super Bowl XXX (that match ended with Dallas on top). The men in black and gold
first went to the Super Bowl in 1974, when they beat the Minnesota Vikings.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
<H3>Peace Means So Much</H3>
"This is a time again for us to show support and hope," Rooney says, but he's not
referring to the Steelers upcoming 1996 season.
	Instead, RooneyÑwho with Tony O'Reilly was a co-founder of the American
Ireland Fund in 1976 and currently serves as its Vice ChairmanÑis speaking about
his concern for the peace process in Northern Ireland.
	"Peace means so much to the people of Northern Ireland, and it covers so many
things, including jobs," he says.
<P>
		The American Ireland Fund, in Rooney's eyes, makes a difference through
its ongoing support of grass-roots social and economic development projects.
	"I really believe we have given people hope, particularly in the smaller
organizations," he says. "They know that there are people in America who care
about them in the right way."
<P>
<H3>Little Ireland, Big Support</H3>
	At the AIF's 20th anniversary New York City gala last year, Rooney was
honored along with Dr. O'Reilly for what Claire Cronin, the event's Junior Chair,
called, "the vision to foresee that little Ireland had big supporters around the
world."
<P>
	In Ireland, the entire Rooney family is well-regarded for its various
charities, including the Rooney Prize for Literature and Dan's own active
membership on the board of Flax Trust, a cross-community jobs creation project
based in Belfast.
<P>
	The AIF's annual Rooney Fellowship, named for Dan Rooney and administered by
the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh, sponsors a student from Northern Ireland to
study at the Duquesne University School of Business and serve an internship in
the marketing department at Heinz.
<P>
	"The Rooney Fellowship aims not only to provide education for students, but
also to improve business and cultural links between Northern Ireland and the US,"
notes Sister Michele O'Leary, the Ireland Institute's president.
<P>
	"It's a great pleasure to work with Dan," she adds. "He cuts through the
nonsense and gets to the core of an issue, but he does so quietly and
efficiently. He's a man of integrity."
<P>
	The Roony relationship with Ireland also encompasses Dan's two brothers, Pat
and Tim, who are both National Board Directors of the AIF. In addition, Pat's son
Joe runs the highly successful American College in Dublin.

<A HREF="graphics/p9c.gif"><IMG WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="63" SRC="graphics/p9c-sml.gif"
BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>
Formed in 1993, the Society aims to restore railway linkage between Mohill and
Dromod, Co. Leitrim, as part of a tourism development effort to encourage
investment and jobs creation. The project complements the Ballyconnell canal
project, which recently linked the River Shannon and Lough Erne, two of Ireland's
major waterways.
	In 1994, an AIF grant of over $22,000 from the Mildred Ryan Bancroft Fund
will enable the Society to develop the historic Mohill Station House as a local
heritage center and museum, in addition to its railway use.

Now a recognized center displaying high quality crafts, the Co-op in
Carrick-on-Shannon, Co. Leitrim was formed in 1987 by local artists concerned
that there was no outlet for the promotion and sale of their work.
	An AIF grant in 1995 of over $15,000 from the Mildred Ryan Bancroft Fund will
allow the Co-op to continue to link art and business development through
workshops in various arts and crafts open to residents and visitors.

<H3>Westford Opera Festival</H3>
<IMG WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="208" SRC="graphics/p9a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">
One of the most prestigious and celebrated Irish cultural festivals, the Wexford
Opera Festival attracts a host of performing artists as well as local and
international audiences. The Festival has also spurred considerable local
development and injected millions into the Wexford area economy.
	An AIF grant of over $22,000 from the Mildred Ryan Bancroft Fund in 1994 will
develop a "mini-festival" for Wexford children that is designed to stimulate
interest in the arts and create a sense of local ownership in the Festival.

<H2>AIF Literary Award Winners - Celebrating 25 Years</H2>

<IMG WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="163" SRC="graphics/p16a.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="RIGHT">

"I look back with joy at the
25 presentations of The American Ireland Fund Literary Award
starting in 1972, nearly all of which I have attended! It is
particularly gratifying that
we have been able to reward older writers such as Sean O'Faolain and Herbert Butler 
and also to have
spotted younger talent who have since developed their skills and become known such as 
Seamus Heaney
and John Banville."
A.W.B. Vincent
<P>
"The financial rewards for the
kind of books I write are less than princely, and while one
doesn't write for money, it is nice once in a while to receive
'a few bob', as we say."<BR>
John Banville
<P>

"(This award) means that
for a year one can pursue,
in Wordsworth's phrase, "a wise
passiveness" and recollect emotion, or in my case commotiom, in
tranquility."
Seamus Heaney<BR>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
"Think what $7,000 would have meant to the course of Irish literature
if Joyce had got such encouragement when he was straining to move
on from the Dubliners
to the Portrait while in
penury in Trieste...the Award can give talent its best chance."
Sean O'Faolain<BR>
<P>

"The leisure that the AIF has
afforded me has given me the
opportunity to put the finishing touches on a number of projects
Ð a play, poems, memoirs."<BR>
Austin Clarke
<P>
"The considerable contribution
the AIF has made to my career
as a writer came at a particularly difficult phase of my life.
They made it possible for me
to complete and stage a play and
make preparations for a new novel."<BR>
Thomas Kilroy
<P>

"Now I can look forward to a couple of years without financial worry
during which I can write not only to boil the pot.(The Award) will keep me in my idea 
of luxury for at least
2 years if not threeÉ"<BR>
Dervla Murphy

SYDNEY-Tara Hill was one of the most venerated spots in early Ireland. From
before the time of the legendary King Cormac Mac Airt in the third century, Tara
Hill was the seat of Ireland's priest-kings. Tara's atmosphere of power and myth
was recently recreated here at a "Banquet of Tara" to benefit the Australian
Ireland Fund, according to Teresa Keating, the Fund's executive secretary. 
<P>
Recent major corporate sponsors of Australian Ireland Fund events at cities across the
island continent have included Qantas Airlines; Aer Lingus; Ashford &
Dromoland Castles; Guinness Australasia; Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre;
and Waterford Wedgwood.
<P>
 Important individual supporters include Peter and Jane Cosgrove; Cameron
O'Reilly; and Patrick Lynham.
 Over one-third of Australians have some Irish ancestory. Currently, the
Australian Ireland Fund Chairman is John O'Neill. Formerly CEO of the State Bank
of New South Wales, O'Neill is now CEO of the Australian
Rugby Football Union. His Irish roots can be traced to the early days of
Australian colonization. William Charles O'Neill, John's great-grandfather was
born in Kerry in 1835. His great-great-great-grandfather,
Thomas Galvin, came to Australia in 1798. In addition to fundraising dinners,
garden parties, a concert at Sydney Opera House and film festivals have been
organized across the nation-continent. The Australian
Ireland Fund has primarily supported projects of reconciliation and those aimed
specifically at assisting youth. Grant recipients include Lough View Integrated
Primary School, Castlereagh, and All Saints Youth Club, Co.
Antrim.

<P>
The Fund has also benefitted from a close relationship with The Lansdowne Club, a
group of over 350 Irish born business people who are based in Sydney. Chaired by
Peter Brennan, the Club made a donor designated grant of $5,000 to the Australian
Ireland Fund for the Central Remedial Clinic in Dublin.
<P>
The Australian Ireland Fund's grants total over $500,000. Recent grants to
Ireland, North and South, made by the Australian Ireland Fund include:
Committee on the Admin. of Justice, Londonderry YMCA, Phoenix Trust, Macnas,
Craic Na Coillte Community Arts, Drugs Awareness Programme,
Dungannon Bereavement Community, Dockward Community, Holywell Trust, Parents
Alone Resource Centre, Tallaght Arts Forum, Women Together and Windsor Women's
Centre.

AUCKLAND-Set up in 1992, The Ireland Fund of New Zealand is steadily growing in a
country where many claim a connection with Ireland. About 600,000 of the nation's
3.5 million inhabitants are of Irish background, with about 10,000 to 15,000 of
those Irish born. The current Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, has very strong Irish
links. Both his parents emigrated to New Zealand from Wexford in the 1930s.
Bolger is one of a leading group of successful Irish-New Zealanders who have made
it to the top of the political and business ladder over the last 30 to 40 years.
<P>
An Auckland merchant banker, Sir Michael Fay, serves as Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Ireland Fund of New Zealand. Fay is one of New Zealand's most
successful businesspeople and was a driving force in introducing merchant banking
to the country.
<P>
Americans know Fay for his battles with Dennis Connoron and off the waterin the
America's Cup. In 1995, a successful Kiwi challenge brought the "Auld Mug" to New
Zealand for the first time.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
Other driving forces behind the Fund are Oliver Lee, Rodney Walshe and Patrick
Hogan. Lee presents a weekly Irish radio program heard throughout New Zealand.
"I'm very passionate about Ireland and also for the work the Ireland Funds do in
Ireland," says Oliver Lee. Rodney
Walshe, originally from Dublin, is Ireland's Honorary Consul based in Auckland.
<P>
Like the other eight countries where Ireland Funds exist, the Ireland Fund of New
Zealand relies on the generous support of the Irish community and friends of
Ireland to attend various functions. To date, these have included black tie
dinners for the President of Ireland Mary Robinson, and Dr. Tony O'Reilly, as
well as a premiere of Brian Friel's acclaimed play, "Dancing at Lughnasa." Plans
are well under way to organize a "Guinness and Oyster" garden party in March,
which hopefully will become an annual
fundraising event. Their most recent grant was to the Phoenix Trust in Belfast, a
community based employment and training centre.

<BR>
ANTIBES, FRANCE-In 1973, Ireland joined France as a member of the European
Economic Community (now the European Union), notes Pierre Joannon, Consul General
of Ireland in this splendid Riviera town on the Mediterranean coast. Today,
France is Ireland's third largest export market and more than 30 French factories
operate on Irish soil. Tourism is booming, too; more than 200,000 French
travelers visit Ireland every year.
<P>
 Close relations between France and Ireland, however, are nothing new. Links
between the two nations, Joannon adds, go back at least to the seventh century
A.D., when Irish missionaries including St. Columbanus ventured across the sea to
establish monasteries and centers of learning in Brittany and elsewhere.
<P>
 "The Ireland Fund of France was launched in Paris in 1990 to raise the level of
French understanding and concern about Ireland in every field," says Joannon, who
serves as Fund Chairman. Gala dinners and other
fundraising events have regularly been held both in Paris and Dublin.
<P>
 In 1993, the Ireland Fund of France established the Chryss O'Reilly Scholarships
through a personal grant by Chryss O'Reilly. The scholarship program allows young
Irish people, from North and South, to improve their language skills or pursue
studies abroad. O'Reilly Scholarship winners have included students from Queen's
University, Belfast; University College Cork; Trinity College, Dublin; and
University College Galway.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
In June 1969, President Charles de Gaulle of France paid an historic five-week
visit to Ireland following his defeat in a referendum that spelled the end of his
long political career. The General was descended on his maternal side from a
"Wild Geese" exile of the McCartan family and had always shown a keen interest in
his Irish roots. "We always come back to our origins," said de Gaulle.
<P>
In May 1994, the people of Sneem, co. Kerry where de Gaulle had stayed
twenty-five years before marked the anniversary by erecting a memorial stone in
the village. They also reenacted the General's famous
walk on Derrynane Strand. The event, organized by Sneem Development Association,
attracted considerable French interest and was grant-aided by the Ireland Fund of
France.

TOKYO-The highlight of St. Patrick's Day 1995 was the third annual Emerald Ball,
sponsored by the Ireland Fund of Japan, reports Majella Murphy Altschuler, the
Fund President. Celebrating the day were over 500 guests and a host of individual
and corporate sponsors who made the event the most profitable fundraiser to date
for the Ireland Fund of Japan.
<P>
"Help from the philanthropic among the Japanese and international business
communities did wonders to ensure an exciting evening," said Maeve Gallagher,
chairperson.
<P>
 The Emerald Ball's many sponsors included Virgin Atlantic Airlines; Rover Japan;
and Apple Japan.
Special guests included the U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale and Joan, his
wife; Irish Ambassador James Sharkey and Sattie, his wife.
Traditional and modern Irish music was provided by musicians Nick Kelly and James
McNally, who traveled from Ireland while the locally-based talent of Irish dancer
Yukiko Iwama and violinist Yuka Matsunuma kept
spirits high.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
 IFJ members also participated in Tokyo's increasingly popular St. Patrick's Day
parade. Established in 1992 by the Irish Network Japan, the 1995 parade boasted
700 participants with over 30 organizations, and attracted over 3,000 spectators.
<P>
The Ireland Fund of Japan was officially launched on September 21, 1994. In
February 1995, President of Ireland Mary Robinson met with the Board and was
presented with a parchment copy of the Fund's constitution.
<P>
According to Majella Murphy Altschuler, the objectives of the Ireland Fund of
Japan include promotion of cultural exchanges between Ireland and Japan; support
for the activities of the Irish community and Irish friendship and cultural
organisations in Japan; and support for charitable
causes in Ireland and Japan.
<P>
"We plan to make grants annually to environmentally-friendly projects in both
Ireland and Japan," says Murphy Altschuler. For example, the IFJ will support
re-construction of a Kobe Community Center destroyed in the city's devastating
1995 earthquake, the Conservation Volunteers in Down, and the Oidhreacht Chorca
Dhuibhne (OCD) in Kerry. OCD is a cooperative in the Dingle Peninsula which has
been set up to promote community development and conserve the unique cultural,
historical and environmental features of the Irish speaking area.

JOHANNESBURG-The special goal of the Ireland Fund of South Africa is to raise
money in South Africa to fund projects within the country in the general areas of
education and training that involve Irish
organizations and individuals.
<P>
"The overall objective is to build closer links between Ireland and South Africa
and help build on the two countries' growing commercial relationship," notes Ivan
Fallon, Honorary Chairman for the inaugural dinner of the Ireland Fund of South
Africa in June, 1995.
<P>
"This fund will be driven by Irish money, using Irish teachers, nurses and
developers to help with skills training and educaion," Fallon adds. By raising
well over R200,000 (nearly $60,000), he adds, "we couldn't have
hoped for a better start."
<P>
South African Water Affairs Minister Kadar Asmal received the Fund's Bird and
Bell award at the dinner. Asmal spent 27 years in exile in Ireland during the
apartheid regime and was a law lecturer at Trinity College. "We need the skills
of Irish people to realize the dream of economic growth and re-distribution," he
said.
<P>
Among the 500 guests who attended the dinner was David Dinkins, former New York
City Mayor.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
Though never great in number, the Irish have had a marked impact on South Africa.
Most were independent adventurous young men and women who concentrated on
specific occupations, such as missionaries, retailers,
and mine laborers. Prominent South African-lrish of the past included premiers
Sir Thomas Upton and Sir Albert Hime; William Porter, author of the Cape's famous
color-blind franchise; and Solomon Gillingham, close
adviser to Paul Kruger.

KOLN - The German Ireland Fund was founded in 1992, according to Ines Koerdt, the
Fund's Executive Secretary. Its chief instigator was Bill Vincent, American
Ireland Fund Vice Chairman, she adds.

Four annual fundraisers for the German Ireland Fund have taken place since in
Munich and Koln with the most recent in Koln on November 18. In Berlin, a
relaxing "Jazzbrunch" was held October 29 to benefit the GIF
<P>
Future plans for the Fund are to build on the growing commercial, sporting and
cultural links that exist between Germany and Ireland. There are over 25,000
Irish people living in Germany, and Ireland is one of Germany's fastest growing
tourist destinations.

<P>
This is the Catless W3 server, currently running the
<A HREF="/phttpd">phttpd server</A>. The machine is named
after a place in Northumberland, and has nothing to do
with missing UNIX utilities or a lack of felines.
In fact the name actually means "the place where you find cats" as it
derives from the name "Cat Leas". The cats referred to would be the native
wildcat of Northern England.</P>

This was a set of pages dedicated to Mountain Bikes and
things Mountain Biking with a particular emphasis on the UK.
</P>
<p>As you will I have noticed I haven't had the chance to update this
stuff for ages and the chances are receding even further so I have,
regretfully, decided to pull them for the moment. There are loads of
pages out there done by people who have the time to devote to scouring
the web for mtb related material. When I started these pages there
just wasn't that much stuff around.</P><P>
Thanks to everyone who has contributed items to me and sent me nice
e-mail. Yah, boo sucks to the people who sent me nasty e-mail...

<TITLE>Degrees in Computing Science at Newcastle</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Computing Science and Software Engineering at
<A HREF="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/">Newcastle</A></H1>

The last 30 years have seen startling advances in computer technology and
important developments in computer software.  Change is so rapid that it is
difficult to forecast even a few years ahead how the subject will progress and
what 'state-of-the-art' technology will be like.  Despite this, there are basic
principles in computing science which can be mastered, and in our degree
programmes at Newcastle we aim to enable you to understand these principles as
well as to appreciate the most recent advances.
<P>
We offer two BSc Single Honours degrees - in Computing Science and in Software
Engineering - which, through a range of  third-year options, allow you to
specialize in various topics in computing science including the development of
large-scale software systems. Our courses emphasize the techniques required to
develop systems and applications software, and provide an understanding of the
architecture of the systems on which the software runs. We encourage a
systematic approach to problem-solving and an analytical approach to the
evaluation of solutions - rather than, for example, concentrating on
present-day commercial applications of the software. In this way we equip you
with skills which you will be able to apply throughout your career. 
<P>
We are fortunate in having a large number of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/people/staff.html">staff</A>
with a wide range of
interests in computing.  We participate in major national and international
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/">research</A>
projects and are one of only six universities to have consistently
received the highest possible research rating. Our research strengths in areas
such as safety critical systems, distributed systems and parallel computation
feed through to our undergraduate courses, and are reflected particularly in
the final-year options offered.

<H2>The Degree Programmes in Computing Science and Software Engineering</H2>

These two degrees, like all the others at Newcastle, are modular. This enables
us to cater for a range of qualifications and experience on entry; it also
offers flexibility in the degree to which you may concentrate on computing in
the first year and permits a high level of specialization in the final year.
The diagram shows the structure of the degree programmes:  in each year you
take 12 modules, since a module is one twelfth of a year's study time. The
modules are taught in two semesters, one running from October to February, the
other from February to July. There is a wide choice of final-year options.
<P>
Both degrees share the same first- and second-year courses, so transfer from
one to the other is straightforward up to the end of the second year.  This
means that you may apply for either degree and wait to see how your interests
develop during the first two years. You do not need to apply for both degrees.

<H3>First Year</H3>

Everyone takes modules in programming, software engineering, data structures
and algorithms plus maths at a level suitable for your previous experience
(GCSE, BTEC or A level). You may take further modules covering logic and
computer architecture, or a third subject (eg physics, economics, psychology)
or (for those without A level maths) an additional computing science course. As
the diagram shows, which first-year courses you take makes a slight difference
to your choice of second-year modules.

<H4>Programming and Software Engineering (2 modules)</H4>

This course introduces
and develops programming concepts, taking an approach based on object-oriented
design and abstract data types, and using the programming language C++.

<H4>Data Structures and Algorithms (2 modules)</H4>
This covers some of the
fundamental data structures and algorithms for organizing collections of data,
together with their efficiency, implementation and application to a variety of
practical problems.

<H4>Logic and Computer Architecture (2 or 4 modules)</H4>
You explore the ideas
which underpin the development of both software and hardware systems, including
the appropriate mathematics.  The computer architecture course covers the
operation of the components of a typical computing system and study of a
low-level programming language.  In the logic design course you look at ways of
combining elementary logic components to perform more complex operations such
as arithmetic.

<H3>Second Year</H3>

Together with the modules taken in the first year, the 12 second-year modules
form a compulsory 'core' of material in Computing Science. (If you did not take
the Logic and Computer Architecture modules in the first year, you take them
now and defer some of the core modules to the final year - see diagram.) All
modules include practical work which contributes to your final assessment.
<P>
The modules relate to four themes:

<H4>Programming Techniques </H4>
<DL>
<DT>3 modules:
<DD>Programming Language Principles
<DD>Concurrent Programming
<DD>File Systems and Data Bases
</DL>
You study a wide range of programming languages, gaining practical experience
of their different applications and a theoretical grasp of the relationships
between the languages, file structures and the management of information.

<H4>Software Engineering</H4>

<DL>
<DT>3 modules:
<DD>Software Engineering 1
<DD>Software Engineering 2
<DD>Group Project and Professional Issues
</DL>
In this course you examine each stage in the development of a software system -
analysis of the requirements it is to meet; development of a specification;
design and implementation of the software; testing, evaluation, maintenance and
documentation of the system. 
<P>
The group project gives you experience of collaborative work and of project
planning and management. Topics are divided between the various groups of
students, so that each has to combine its own work with that of another group.
This involves each group in planning sales and purchase strategies and in
coordinating the integration of the software. The assessment of the projects
includes an element of  self-assessment by members of the group.

<H4>Systems</H4>
<DL>
<DT>3 modules:
<DD>Computer Networks
<DD>Advanced Computer Architecture
<DD>Compilers and Operating Systems
</DL>
This covers computer architecture - the structure rather than the detailed
electronics of hardware systems - examines both hardware and software aspects
of communications systems and introduces the main topics concerning the
implementation of operating systems and compilers.

<H4>Algorithms</H4>
<DL>
<DT>3 modules:
<DD>Algorithms 1
<DD>Algorithms 2
<DD>Numerical Algorithms
</DL>
These are systematic methods for constructing solutions to problems.  You
examine a range of them considering their design, implementation, efficiency
and application.

<H3>Third Year</H3>

The range of options for the Advanced Topics changes constantly to keep pace
with rapid developments in the subject, and in recent years more than 20 have
been offered. Typical choices have included:
<UL>
<LI>Applications in Artificial Intelligence
<LI>Operating Systems
<LI>Distributed Computer Systems
<LI>Parallel Computation
<LI>Reliability and Fault Tolerance
<LI>VLSI Design
<LI>Real Time Systems
<LI>Human-Computer Interaction
<LI>Computer Graphics
</UL>
An individual third-year project represents one quarter of your final year's
work. These projects vary widely but have recently included:
<UL>
<LI>Air Traffic Control Simulator
<LI>A Computing Adventure
<LI>Metro Map
<LI>An Electronic Campus Walk
<LI>Interactive Video
</UL>

<H2>Computing Science - a flexible approach</H2>

<H3>Should I have any previous experience of computing?</H3>

Obviously, many applicants do have experience of computing, but a real interest
in the subject (both its practical and intellectual aspects) is more important
than specific experience.  You do not need to have taken computing science at
GCSE or A level, but we do not limit the opportunities available to more
experienced students.

<H3>What maths do I need?</H3>

Our Computing Science and Software Engineering degree programmes are open to
students with Maths GCSE (Grade B or better) or an equivalent qualifacation
such as a Merit in BTEC Quantitative Methods, as well as to those with A level
or equivalent.  We achieve this by offering a range of first-year maths courses
at different levels: you take the one which best suits your previous
experience.  The diagram shows where this fits into the first-year programme.

<H2>Industrial Experience</H2>

Some of our students have sponsorship from leading companies which offers them
vacation work in industry, and British Telecom offers sponsorship on a
competitive basis for our Computing Science and Software Engineering degrees.
Our degree programmes are not sandwich courses but if you wish to spend a year
in industry between the second and third years of your degree, you may do so if
you can make suitable arrangements.  One of our students recently won a place
to spend an industrial year with British Airways .

<H2>Study Abroad</H2>

We have links with European universities through the ERASMUS scheme, which
enables some of our students to study for a year in another EC country.
Exchanges have been made with the Universities of Rennes, Vienna and Munich and
visiting students from these universities provide an international perspective
even for students who remain in Newcastle.

<H2>Computing Combined with Other Subjects</H2>

Computing Science may be taken as an option in Joint Honours Science with any
of the following: economics, mathematics, physics, psychology, statistics or
surveying and mapping science.  Half your time is spent on computing science
and the other half on the other subject. Computing Science is also available
within the Combined Studies BA Honours degree, enabling you to combine it with
up to four other subjects, mostly from the arts and social sciences.
Major-Minor degrees consisting of one third computing and two thirds French or
German or Spanish are offered by the School of Modern Languages. In all these
degree programmes, the computing science courses are taken from those available
within Single Honours Computing Science. Further details of all these
programmes are given in the Prospectus and in various brochures available from
the Admissions Office. 

<H2>Computing in the Faculty of Engineering</H2>

There is now a rapidly-growing need for engineers who can understand the full
range of design problems, from specifying a VLSI chip to building sophisticated
software to make use of it, and it is essential that these experts understand
both the hardware and the software of the systems.  To meet this demand we have
established two degree programmes in conjunction with the Department of
Electrical and Electronic Engineering: the BEng (a three-year degree) and the
MEng (four years) in Microelectronics and Software Engineering.  A brochure
giving further details is available from the Admissions Office or the
Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

<H2>Transfer to and from other degree programmes</H2>

Most of our students are committed to their choice of computing science or
software engineering and follow that degree programme through the three years.
However, each year some choose to transfer to related programmes at the end of
the first year.  While such transfers cannot be guaranteed and are subject to
various restrictions, typical moves include transfer to Joint Honours in
Computing Science plus another subject which you have already taken in the
first year (eg maths, statistics or your third subject); transfer to Combined
Studies or to Single Honours Maths or to Single Honours in your third
first-year subject. Of course some students who start in these subjects
transfer to Computing Science!

<H2>Entrance Requirements</H2>

We take applicants with a wide range of qualifications - A level, BTEC and
Scottish Highers and CSYS. You should have at least grade B in maths at GCSE or
equivalent,  or a pass in BTEC Quantitative Methods if you do not have it at A
level. Candidates who are uncertain about the level of their qualifications
should contact us before applying to discuss their individual circumstances.
<P>
Grades required can vary from year to year so you should check the current
estimates in this year's Prospectus.  The Prospectus also gives details of
entrance requirements for Joint Honours, Combined Studies, Major-Minor and
other degrees.
<P>
We welcome applications from mature students, with or without traditional
qualifications. Newcastle College runs an access course which equips successful
candidates for entry to our degree programmes. For further details about this,
please contact the Admissions Tutor, <A HREF="#info">Dr Lindsay Marshall</A>.
<P>
Overseas students are also very welcome; those with sufficient experience in
maths and computing may, in exceptional circumstances, be eligible for entry
direct into the second year. A Bridging Course for overseas students, run in
conjunction with Newcastle College, is available for those without the
necessary background in maths and computing; it also provides English language
tuition. Please contact <A HREF="#info">Dr Marshall</A> for further details. 
<P>
We invite candidates to whom we are going to make an offer to visit the
Department for an open day to meet current students and staff, to find out more
about the courses and to see our computing facilities.  This is intended to
help you to make your final choice of university.

<H2>The Resources of the Department</H2>

We have an extensive computer network which links a wide range of computers,
from large powerful systems down to the smallest microprocessor system.  A
considerable number of workstations available to undergraduates provides access
to the systems attached to this network, and powerful special-purpose equipment
is available for research projects.  These systems are also connected to
national and international computer networks, which give staff and students
access to electronic media, keeping them in touch with computing colleagues
around the world.  Our computer systems are continually updated to take
advantage of the latest technological developments. Students who already own a
Macintosh or PC system can make use of it, but this is by no means essential.
<P>
<IMG SRC="apple.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="232">
<H2>Life in the Department</H2>

The Department has a lively, friendly atmosphere and first-year undergraduates
quickly get to know other students and members of staff. The Computing Society,
run by the students, organizes other social events throughout the year, as well
as lectures from visiting speakers.  Departmental common rooms act as a focus
for social life for second- and third-year undergraduates.  More seriously, the
Staff-Student Committee and student representation on other departmental
committees give you the chance to contribute to discussions and influence
decisions about courses and other aspects of departmental life.

<H2>Careers</H2>

In the present job market computing science graduates are better placed than
many others to obtain employment in a challenging and fulfilling career.
Specialists are recruited by computing manufacturers and software houses (who
write programs for customers), and all graduates with good knowledge of
computing may be employed by any organization which uses computers on a large
scale - banks, insurance companies, the electronics industry, central and local
government, and management in all areas of business.
<P>
A significant number of our undergraduates continue with their studies as MSc
or PhD students. Follow <A HREF="profiles.html">this link</A> to find
some profiles of past and present students.

This is the Catless W3 server, currently running the

In fact the name actually means "the place where you find cats" as it

</ADDRESS>
<P>
This is the first issue of a new on-line forum.  Its intent is to address
issues involving risks to the public in the use of computers.  As such, it
is necessarily concerned with whether/how critical requirements for human
safety, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity, and
guaranteed service (among others) can be met (in some cases all at the same
time), and how the attempted fulfillment or ignorance of those requirements
may imply risks to the public.  We will presumably explore both deficiencies
in existing systems and techniques for developing better computer systems --
as well as the implications of using computer systems in highly critical
environments.
</P>
<H4>Introductory Comments</H4>
<P>
This forum is inspired by the letter from Adele Goldberg, President of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), in the Communications of the ACM,
February 1985 (pp. 131-133).  In that message (part of which is reproduced
below), Adele outlined the ACM's intensified concern with our increasingly
critical dependence on the use of computers, a concern which culminated in
the ACM's support for a Forum on Risks to the Public in Computer Systems
(RPCS), to be developed by the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
(of which I am currently the Chairman).  My involvement in this BBOARD
activity is thus motivated by my ACM roles, but also by strong feelings that
this topic is one of the most important confronting us.  In keeping with ACM
policy, and with due respect to the use of the ARPANET, we hope to attain a
representative balance among differing viewpoints, although this clearly
cannot be achieved locally within each instance of the forum.
</P><P>
For discussions on requirements, design, and evaluation techniques for
critical systems -- namely, how to do it right in the first place so that a
system can satisfy its requirements and can continue to maintain its desired
abilities through ongoing maintenance and evolution, you will find a little
solace in the literature on computer science, computer systems, and software
engineering.  There is even some modest encouragement from the formal
verification community -- which readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes will find in the forthcoming August 1985 special issue on
the verification workshop VERkshop III.  However, it is not encouraging to
find many developers of critical software ignoring what is known about how
to do it better.  In this RISKS forum, we hope that we will be able to
confront some of those problems, and specifically those where risks to the
public are present.
</P><P>
You should also be aware (if you are not already) of several related on-line
services:  HUMAN-NETS@RUTGERS for a variety of issues pertaining to people
(but originally oriented to the establishment of WorldNet), SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX
for software engineering, and perhaps SECURITY@RUTGERS for security -- it is
still young and rather narrow (car-theft prevention is big at the moment,
with a few messages on passwords and forged mail headers).  (You can get
more inforation from SRI-NIC.ARPA:&lt;NETINFO&gt;INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT.)  I look at
these regularly, so some cross-fertilization and overlap may be expected.
However, the perspective of RISKS seems sufficiently unique to justify the
existence of still another interest group!
</P>
<H4>RISKS Forum Procedures</H4>

I hope all this introductory detail does not deter you, but it seems to be
worthwhile to set things up cleanly from the beginning.  To submit items for
distribution, send mail to RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA.  For all other messages
(e.g., list additions or deletions, or administrative complaints), send to
RISKS-Request@SRI-CSL.ARPA.
<P>
Submissions should relate directly to risks to the public involving computer
systems, be reasonably coherent, and have a brief explicit descriptive
subject line.  Flames, ad hominem attacks, overtly political statements, and
other inappropriate material will be rejected.  Carefulness, reasonably
clear writing, and technical accuracy will be greatly appreciated.  Much
unnecessary flailing can be avoided with just a little forethought.
<P>
Contributions will generally be collected and distributed in digest form
rather than singly, as often as appropriate.  Subject lines may be edited in
order to group messages with similar content.  Long messages may have
portions of lesser interest deleted (and so marked), and/or may be split
across several issues.
<P>
Initially we will provide distributions to individuals, but as soon as there
are more than a few individuals at any given host, we will expect the
establishment of a file &lt;BBOARD&gt;RISKS.TXT or equivalent on that host -- with
local option whether or not to forward individual copies.  Back issues may
be FTPed from SRI-CSL.ARPA:&lt;RISKS&gt;RISKS-"vol"."no", where "vol" and "no" are
volume and number -- i.e., RISKS-1.1 for this issue.  But please try to rely
on local repositories rather than swamping the gateways, nets, and SRI-CSL.

<H3><A NAME="subj2.1">ACM Council Resolution of 8 October 1984</A></H3>
<address>
Peter G. Neumann
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:pgn@csl.sri.com">pgn@csl.sri.com</A>&gt;
</address>
<P>
Following are excerpts from ACM President Adele Goldberg's letter in the
Communications of the ACM, February 1985 (pp. 131-133).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  On this day [8 October 1984], the ACM Council passed an important
  resolution.  It begins:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Contrary to the myth that computer systems are infallible, in fact
    computer systems can and do fail.  Consequently, the reliability of
    computer-based systems cannot be taken for granted.  This reality
    applies to all computer-based systems, but it is especially critical
    for systems whose failure would result in extreme risk to the public.
    Increasingly, human lives depend upon the reliable operation of 
    systems such as air traffic and high-speed ground transportation 
    control systems, military weapons delivery and defense systems, and
    health care delivery and diagnostic systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  The second part of the resolution includes a list of technical questions
  that should be answered about each computer system.  This part states that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    While it is not possible to eliminate computer-based systems failure
    entirely, we believe that it is possible to reduce risks to the public
    to reasonable levels.  To do so, system developers must better
    recognize and address the issues of reliability.  The public has the
    right to require that systems are installed only after proper steps
    have been taken to assure reasonable levels of reliability.
<P>
    The issues and questions concerning reliability that must be addressed
    include:
<OL>
    <LI>What risks and questions concerning reliability are involved when
       the computer system fails?

    <LI>What is the reasonable and practical level of reliability to
       require of the system, and does the system meet this level?
  
    <LI>What techniques were used to estimate and verify the level of
       reliability?

    <LI>Were the estimators and verifiers independent of each other
       and of those with vested interests in the system?
</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Adele's letter goes on to motivate the ACM's authorization of a forum on
risks to the public in the use of computer systems, of which this is an
on-line manifestation.  As you can see, I believe that the charter must be
broader than just reliability, including as appropriate other critical
requirements such as fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity,
guaranteed service, human safety, and even world survival (in sort of
increasing order of globality).  There is also an important but probably
sharply delimited role for design verification (such as has been carried out
in the multilevel-security community in demonstrating that formal
specifications are consistent with formal requirements) and even code
verification (proving consistency of code and specifications), although
formal verification technologies seem not suited to mammoth systems but only
to selected critical components -- assuming that those components can be
isolated (which is the operative assumption in the case of security kernels
and trusted computing bases).  For example, see the VERkshop III proceedings
noted above.

One of the activities of the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
will be the review of a problem list presented by Dan McCracken and his
committee in the September 1974 issue of the Communications of the ACM, and
an update of it in the light of dramatic changes in the use of computers
since then.  Three items from that problem list are particularly relevant to
our RISK forum.

   * Computers and money
   * Computers and privacy
   * Computers and elections

Indeed, in the latest issue of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes
(July 1985), I reported on a variety of recent money problems, security
problems, and a whole string of potential election-fraud problems -- in the
last case suggesting opportunities for Trojan Horses and local fraud.  On
the third subject, there was an article by David Burnham (NY Times) in
newspapers of 29 July 1985 (NY Times, SF Chron, etc.), on vulnerabilities in
various computerized voting systems.  About 60% of the votes are counted by
computer programs, with over a third of those votes being counted by one
program (or variants?) written by Computer Election Systems of Berkeley CA.
Burnham writes, "The allegations that vote tallies calculated with [that
program] may have been secretly altered have raised concern among election
officials and computer experts... In Indiana and West Virginia, the company
has been accused of helping to rig elections."  This topic is just warming
up.

Items that also give us opportunities for discussions on risks to the
public include these:

   * Computers and defense
   * Computers and human safety 
   * Computer-user consumer protection
   * Computers and health
   * Informal and formal models of critical properties
     (e.g., not just of security or reliability, not 
      so high-level as Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics)

Several items on computers and defense are included below.  There are also
some comments on software that is safe for humans.

I would think that some sort of Ralph-Nader-like consumer protection
organization might be appropriate for computing.  We have already had two
very serious automobile recalls due to program bugs -- the El Dorado brake
computer and the Mark VII computerized air suspension, and at least two
heart pacemaker problems (one which resulted in a death), as noted in the
disaster list below -- to go along with this summer's watermelon recall
(pesticides) and Austrian wine recalls (with the antifreeze-component
diethylene glycol being used as a sweetener).

Readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes have been alerted in
many past issues to numerous disasters and computer curiosities implying
potential or actual risks to the public.  A summary of events is catalogued
below, and updates earlier versions that I circulated in a few selected
BBOARDS.  Further details can be found in the references cited.  Awareness
of these cases is vital to those involved the design, implementation, and
operation of computer systems in critical environments, but is of course
not sufficient to prevent new disasters from occurring.  Significantly
better systems, and more aware operation and use, are also required.

       SOME COMPUTER-RELATED DISASTERS AND OTHER EGREGIOUS HORRORS
              Compiled by Peter G. Neumann (21 July 1985)

The following list is drawn largely from back issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes [SEN], references to which are cited as (SEN vol no), where 
vol 10 = 1985.  Some incidents are well documented, others need further study.

considering the feasibility of developing what is probably the most complex
and most critical system ever contemplated.  It is highly appropriate to
consider the computer system aspects of that effort here.  Some of the
potential controversy is illustrated by the recent statements of David
Parnas, who presents a strongly skeptical view.  (See below.)  I hope that
we will be able to have a constructive dialogue here among representatives
of the different viewpoints, and firmly believe that it is vital to the
survival of our world that the computer-technical issues be thoroughly
discussed.  As in many other cases (e.g., space technology) there are many
potential research advances that can spin off approaches to other problems.
As indicated by my disaster list above, the problems of developing software
for critical environments are very pervasive -- and not just limited to
strategic defense.  But what we learn in discussing the feasibility of the
strategic defense initiative could have great impact on the uses that
computers find in other critical environments.  In general, we may find that
the risks are far too high in many of the critical computing environments on
which we depend.  We may also be led to techniques for developing better
systems that can adequately satisfy all of their critical requirements --
and continue to do so.  But perhaps most important of all is the increased
awareness that can come from intelligent discussion.  Thus, an open forum on
this subject is very important.  PGN

Subject: News Item: David Parnas Resigns from SDI Panel

New York Times, 7/12/85, page A6:

SCIENTIST QUITS ANTIMISSILE PANEL, SAYING TASK IS IMPOSSIBLE

By Charles Mohr
special to the New York Times

Washington, July 11 - A computer scientist has resigned from an advisory panel
on antimissile defense, asserting that it will never be possible to program a
vast complex of battle management computers reliably or to assume they will
work when confronted with a salvo of nuclear missiles.

  The scientist, David L. Parnas, a professor at the University of Victoria
in Victoria, British Columbia, who is consultant to the Office of Naval
Research in Washington, was one of nine scientists asked by the Strategic
Defense Initiative Office to serve at $1,000 a day on the "panel on computing
in support of battle management".

  Professor Parnas, an American citizen with secret military clearances, said
in a letter of resignation and 17 accompanying memorandums that it would never
be possible to test realistically the large array of computers that would link
and control a system of sensors, antimissile weapons, guidance and aiming
devices, and battle management stations.

  Nor, he protested, would it be possible to follow orthodox computer
program-writing practices in which errors and "bugs" are detected and
eliminated in prolonged everyday use. ...

  "I believe," Professor Parnas said, "that it is our duty, as scientists and
engineers, to reply that we have no technological magic that will accomplish
that.  The President and the public should know that."  ...

  In his memorandums, the professor put forth detailed explanations of his
doubts.  He argued that large-scale programs like that envisioned for the
program only became reliable through modifications based on realistic use.

  He dismissed as unrealistic the idea that program-writing computers,
artificial intelligence or mathematical simulation could solve the problem.

  Some other scientists have recently expressed public doubts that large-scale
programs free of fatal flaws can be written.  Herbert Lin, a research fellow
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this month that the basic
lesson was that "no program works right the first time."

  Professor Parnas wrote that he was sure other experts would disagree with
him.  But he said many regard the program as a "pot of gold" for research
funds or an interesting challenge.

[The above article is not altogether accurate, but gives a flavor of the
Parnas position.  The arguments for and against feasibility of success need
detailed and patient discussion, and thus I do not try to expand upon either
pro or con here at this time.  However, it is hoped that a serious
discussion can unfold on this subject.  (SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX vol 1 no 29
provides some further material on-line.)  See the following message as well.

As I read the article [by Martin Moore in <A HREF="/Risks/1.43.html">RISKS-1.43</A>,] it occurred to me
that as we discuss the risks of the destruct system we could be creating
another risk by revealing the nature of it's operation.  I had no prior
knowledge of this system and now I know, generally, how it works, it's
redundancy level, and it's physical location.

I am aware that much of the technical information about the shuttle is a
matter of public record.  I don't know what sort of information is public
and what isn't.  If the destruct system is public information, I would like
to know why, If it isn't, it certainly has no place on the net.

Respectfully, John Carpenter

Your concern is of course very valid.  The existence of such a mechanism
represents a serious risk.  The details of how that mechanism are thought
not to be spoofable or accidentally triggered are of course the subject of
an age-old controversy.  On one hand, pretending that such a mechanism is
safe because it is not publically known is disastrous -- especially if the
mechanism is intrinsically not safe.  On the other hand, publishing the
details of a mechanism that is not entirely sound is also dangerous, because
it may suggest the flaws to an interloper.  However, unless there can be
scrutiny by dedicated experts, the flaws will persist.  A further comment in
this chain of reasoning is that no mechanism can be guaranteed 100% sound --
there are ALWAYS circumstances outside of the set of assumptions.  On
balance, openness appears preferable, tempered by the recognition that if
the risks are otherwise too great, then what is being done should probably
NOT BE DONE THAT WAY AT ALL.  This is a very difficult problem, and I and
many of my colleagues seem to come down fairly consistently on the side of
forthright discussion rather than hiding one's head in the sand under a
blanket of obliviousness.  What you don't know CAN hurt you.  What you do
know can also.  There are no easy answers.  Peter

[I use "safe" and "sound" loosely to imply reliable, available, secure,
 nonspoofable, nontamperable, free of Trojan horses, etc.]

Much to my surprise -- since it did not seem too likely -- I heard of a
report on the radio last night by a physicist (and head of a company that
does something with solid-fuel rockets) who speculated that the explosion in
the solid-fuel rocket booster set off the self-destruct mechanism, resulting
in the destruction of the orbiter.  He suggested that it could not have been
a hydrogen leak because hydrogen burns clear and the Shuttle explosion had
an obvious orange glow.

  It is obvious that at the time of the explosion, no rifle bullet hit
  it.  Thus, any shot must have been fired much sooner.  The rifle shot
  must then be timed in such a way that it is fast enough to weaken the
  casing, but not strong enough to penetrate it.  It seems that that
  window is pretty small.

I have heard speculation that some fuel leaking (LHY or LOX) from the
MFT and a unexpected flame could be seen (on slow-motion videotape)
for some time prior to the explosion.  This seems consistent with
rifle bullet impact/puncture, long before the actual explosion
occured.

I have, in general, been concerned about the fact that, except for a
single question asked by one reporter at the first news conference,
there has been no public mention of the possiblity of terrorism.

Is there someone who knows enough about the security at NASA/KSC to be
able to estimate the difficulty that a malicious party would have in
getting getting physical access to the shuttle/SRB/MFT prior to the
launch?  I haven't noticed any great measure of security (except DoD
flights), but perhaps this has been the result a NASA P.R. effort make
the Space program appear as "open" as possible.

I understand the Galileo probe which was planned to be on a shuttle
flight this summer is powered by plutonium. Had Galileo been on this
flight, it seems to me a whole bunch of plutonium particles would have
been raining along the coast of Florida.

Any comments?

Martin Moore's report on the self destruct devices was very informative.
It also brings up an important question.  If the hardware system is
redundant, what about the software system?  Is the same software running
on all of the redundant hardware systems or are there more than one 
software packages developed.  If there is only one software package then
if one system fails due to a software failure then the other systems'
software may fail since the same conditions may still be in effect.

With <A HREF="/Risks/1.45.html">RISKS-1.45</A>, my MM saturated completely on its ability to cope with all
of the Volume 1 issues of the RISKS Forum (at 289 pages) in one .TXT file,
so it must be time to start Volume 2! Thus, let me take this opportunity to
review the six months since RISKS Volume 1 Issue 1, on 1 August 1985.

The SDI pallaver seems to have overwhelmed some of you, but it has opened up
some serious problems -- as does the unreleased Eastport Report, which is
perhaps most interesting for what it does not cover! (You may have concluded
that SDI is a religious issue that cannot be decided rationally?)  The Space
Shuttle tragedy also opens up all sorts of questions on how much trust we
can place in technology and what the risks are -- although those questions
have been around all along.  They are simply elevated to a higher level of
public awareness now (temporarily?).  For example, the issue of the safety
of self-destruct mechanisms has been lurking, and is clearly a concern in
general -- but is only one concern.  There are lots of others.  We must
remember that risks come many sources -- not just from maliciousness and
accidents, but also from unforeseen combinations of problems.

So far we have addressed many important issues, although some of them quite
superficially.  We have overlapped on occasions with ARMS-D, Soft-Eng, and
Security distributions.  However, it seems that RISKS does provide a focus
that cuts across these other mailings, and that it serves a useful purpose
-- particularly when it indeed focuses on the risks to the public.

A few platitudes are in order:

  No system is ever going to be 100% guaranteed all of the time,
  especially if it runs standalone.  Even with humans in the loop, 
  humans can make mistakes -- especially in real-time.

  Risks may come from unexpected directions.  A system that has run
  perfectly may still suddenly malfunction.  Hardware may fail.  Bugs may
  remain undetected for years, and suddenly become activated.  Besides,
  software may age poorly, especially if changes somewhere else interfere
  with old working software.

  The operating environment may contain risks that undermine sound design,
  impementation, and operations.

  The notion that all critical concerns -- security, reliability, etc. --
  can be confined to a small portion of a computer system or distributed 
  system (e.g., a kernel) is a fantasy, particularly with conventionally
  designed systems.  

  The notion that distributed control solves problems that cannot easily be
  solved with central control is also often a myth -- problems of updating,
  synchronization, concurrency, backup, verifiability, etc., may be equally
  severe in many operating environments.

  Lowest-bidder efforts are intrinsically risky.  Commercial software is
  commonly far behind the state of the art.  That may be an advantage in
  some cases (!), but is often detrimental.  But there are significant
  benefits to be gained from using certain software engineering techniques.

  There are inherent risks in using computer systems in critical
  environments.  These must be continually reexamined.  Critical and open
  discussion of critical systems and critical environments is essential.
  We as technologists must better understand the risks and their implications.
  And we must apply that increased understanding to new developments.

And now, a word from our sponsor: This forum was established at the request
of the Association for Computing Machinery, and chartered as an activity of
the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy (of which I am the
chairman).  However, the opinions reflected herein do not constitute an
endorsement by the ACM.  On the other hand, if I screw up and do something
the ACM does not like, I probably lose my (volunteer) job.

As a summary of some of the problems that have occurred, and as a possible
inspiration for undiscussed areas of concern or areas of hope, I include in
this issue an update of the disaster list that those of you who have been
with us since the beginning saw in Vol 1 No 1.

From the Guardian (London) 29 May 1985:
ELECTRONIC GOODBYE SHOCKS JOKER
by John Ezard

  Mr Dean Talboy's attempt to leave a harmless electronic memento for his
former workmates earned him instead a high place in the almanac of computer
horror stories, a court was told yesterday.
  News of his little prank, and its dire results for the High Street
electronics giant Dixons, sent a frisson of sympathy through computer buffs.
These are often as tempted by practical jokes as he was. But they also know,
as his experience confirms, that one mistyped symbol in a long programme can
introduce a monstrous bug into the entire machine.
  Mr. Talboys, aged 26, a highly-educated computer consultant, admitted
criminal damage at Acton crown court in the first British prosecution for
electronic graffiti. His farewell slogan was the innocuous "Goodbye, folks".
Mr. Austen Issard-Davies, prosecuting, said he intended that this should
flash up on Dixon's head office computer screen whenever his leaving date
was entered by an operator.
  But Mr. Talboys inadvertently inserted a "stop" code in his programme,
causing the programme to disconnect midway through its run.
  Mr. Talboys was crafting his masterpiece while the computer was in test
mode. But the machine then transferred it into "production" or operational
mode - in which the "stop" symbol is illegal. The outcome of his error was
that every screen - in a headquarters which processes the work of 4,500
employees - hiccuped and went blank whenever any operator keyed in anyone's
leaving date.
  "Unlike most graffiti, which can be rubbed out or painted over, it cost
Dixons more than (Pounds)1,000 to investigate, discover what he had done and
put it right," Mr Issard-Davies told the court.
  The blame was immediately traced to Mr Talboys - "rather like a burglar who
has left his visiting card". He had agreed with police that he had acted 
irresponsibly. Yesterday he was conditionally bound over and ordered to pay 
the firm (Pounds)1,000 compensation.
  The computer language in which Mr Talboys accidentally wrote his bug is
called Mantis.
  Judge Kerry Quarren-Evans said: "Offices without a certain amount of humour
would be very dry and dusty places. But this is not the type of medium for
practical jokes."
  Mr Talboys said: "My advice to anyone else is don't bloody do it. It has
been 18 months of hell. It was simply a prank and I have learned my lesson.
My backside has been well and truly tanned."

    [I guess we'll be praying mantis will eat more bugs in the future.  PGN]

An article in the new Electronics Magazine (McGraw-Hill) May 26, page 14,
describes a prototype parallel computer system that would simulate and
analyze the chain of events in a complex nuclear accident faster than the
accident would actually occur. The system, which is being developed at the
University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana campus would combine the power of a
parallel processor, with an artifical intelligence/expert system that would
examine where a problem is headed and give advice on possible corrections to
avoid a disaster.  The program does both forward and backward chaining, and
is written in Portable Standard Lisp. The system would take inputs from over

the reactor operation.  According to the calculations, this package will be
able to simulate a reactor accident 10 times faster than real time.  The

One topic so far untouched by RISKS is the intimate connection between risks
and knowledge.  That is, how can we expect to assess risks when we lack
knowledge or worse, when knowledge is deliberately withheld.  These thoughts
were prompted by the article below:

From "The Guardian", May 21, 1986 (NY, not UK) by Jonathan A. Bennet

The presidentially-appointed Rogers Commission dramatically denounced
solid rocket booster manager Lawrence Mulloy, while continuing to conceal
multiple cases of perjury by top NASA officials and NASA-White House
complicity in that perjury.

The Rogers Commission stopped far short of accusing Mulloy or anyone else
of perjury, despite clear contradictions between what its investigators
have learned and repeated statements under oath by NASA officials.
Instead, the commission merely accused Mulloy of having "almost covered up"
and of "glossing over" the truth.

...    [I have excerpted the first few paragraphs from a longish message
        which is sufficiently important to RISKS to be called to your 
        attention, but which is sufficiently non-computer-specific that I did
        not want to include it in its entirety.  It is available for FTPing 
        from SRI-CSL:&lt;RISKS&gt;<A HREF="/Risks/2.56.html">RISKS-2.56</A>WEX for those of you who can get to it.

A while back a RISKS contribution plaintively stated something to the effect
that SDI issues were strictly for experts.  Not so.  There are two somewhat
separable matters, the technical (Can SDI be done at acceptable risk/cost)
and political (Do we want it anyway? Does it improve security, etc.).

Now RISKS is a place to consider, well, computer risks. Thus it seems
appropriate here to explore SDI software issues.  The strictly political/
policy issues are on ARMS-D.  Since the two aspects of SDI are not entirely
separable, some overlap is going to occur.

The contributor of the above mentioned note might like to read msg 787
on ARMS-D from crummer.

To: "risks" &lt;risks@sri-csl.arpa&gt;

I'd like to offer an minority opinion about SDI software; i.e., I infer that
most RISKS readers agree with the assessments that "... SDI will never be 
made to work..."  At some personal risk, let me say at the outset that SDI, 
as ballyhooed in the popular press, may never work - certainly not in this 
decade.  But I believe that our projections of the future are inextricably 
linked to our past.  So let me share some observations on Navy tactical 
software as of 1979.

Much of the OLDER tactical software:
 Was written in assembly language, or CMS-2.  Powerful languages like
   FORTRAN and C were not used.  
 Was implemented by people who may not have ever sailed or flown in combat.
 Was not well defined functionally by the end users, for lack of "rapid 
   prototyping" tools.
 Was written before modern notions like "structured programming" were used.
 Was "shoehorned" into very old, small, slow, unsophisticated computers 
   (no hardware floating point, no virtual memory, 4 microsecond cycle).
 "Froze" the modules, instead of the interfaces.

Carriers ran tactical software on machines built of early 1960's technology
(germanium diodes).  They were remarkable computers for that era, having 
almost the power of an IBM 7090 in a refrigerator sized box.  They severely
restricted software development.  If replaced, tactical software could be 
written in several languages, not only Ada (DoD's choice), but also FORTRAN,
BASIC, Pascal, C, etc.; the goal is to use standard languages appropriate 
to the task; and to incorporate modules, and support libraries, already 
developed and debugged elsewehere.
------

Turning now to the more common arguments, they seem to be:
(1) COMPLEXITY; i.e., there are too many logical paths through the code; 
(2) HISTORY; i.e., no deployed CCCI program has ever worked the first time.

The complexity argument leads one to wonder HOW the human brain works.  It 
has trillions of cells; each has a probability of failure.  Some failures
are obvious: we forget, we misunderstand, we misspeak; etc.  But, inspite
of these failures - or because of them - we SATISFICE.  Even when some go 
bonkers, the rest of us try to maintain our sanity.  Similarly, one errant 
SDI computer need not fail the entire network - anymore than one failing
IMP need crash the entire ARPANET.

The historical argument leads to an analogy.  Suppose that after World War 
II, President Truman had asked Congress for an R&amp;D program in medicine, to 
treat many of the physical wounds of the war.  Doctors would have pointed 
out that lost limbs and organs were lost, period.  But the progress in the 
last 25 years changed that.  Microsurgery, new drugs, artificial joints, 
computer assists, including one system that bridged a damaged spinal cord, 
reinterpreting nerve signals so that a paraplegic could walk again.

The "complexity" and "historical" arguments even interact.  
Peter Denning observed years ago that the difficulty of understanding a 
program is a function of size (among other things).  He speculated that 
difficulty is proportional to the SQUARE of the number of "units of under-
standing" (about 100 lines of code).  Old tactical software, in assembly 
language, tends to run into the hundreds of thousands of lines of code; 
e.g., a 500,000 line program has 5000 units of understanding, with a diffi-
culty  index of 25 million.  That same program, written in FORTRAN, might 
shrink to 100,000 lines thus only 1000 units of understanding, thence a 
difficulty index of one million.  That's worth doing!

The medical analogy uncovers another tacit assumption in the SDI argument;
neither pro-SDI nor anti-SDI debaters have dealt with it well.  It is the 
"perfection" argument.  A missile defense is worth having if it is good 
enough to save only 5% of the USA population in an all-out nuclear attack.
That shield might save 75% of the population in a terrorist attack, launched
by an irresponsible source; this is far more likely than a saturation attack 
by a well armed power like the USSR.  As bleak as this prospect is, the 
facts are that if an all-out attack were launched today, whether by malice, 
madness or mistake, by either side; and the other side retalliated in full 
force, the human race would be doomed by fallout, and by nuclear winter.
-----

I am NOT saying that we have the answers within our reach, much less our
grasp.  I am NOT saying that SDI "as advertised" will be made to work ever,
certainly NOT in this decade; I am saying that if we don't try, we won't 
progress.  We know at the outset that SDI will be flawed, though perhaps 
someday acceptable.  That's the status of most of today's high technology; 
e.g., air traffic control systems, hospitals, electronic banking, 
telephone systems, mainframe operating systems, ARPANET, ad infinitum.

But my point is that we must not shun the challenge to TRY to improve the
software in the field, and the tools used to design and build and test it.
That's throwing out the baby with the bathwater!  Nor can we extrapolate
the successes of the 1990's from the common practices of the 1970's.
Rather than deplore the past, we must deploy the technology now developed
in Bell Labs, MIT, IBM, Livermore, and other leading computing centers.
When I worked in tactical software ('68 - '79), we were about a decade
behind the state of the art; e.g., we got high level programming languages,
symbolic debuggers, well stocked function libraries, and interactive tools
for writing and compiling, in the late '70's; we patterned them on systems
at MIT and Berkeley of the late '60's [MULTICS and GENIE].
I wonder just how much of the mid '80's technology is available to tactical
developers?  Are any tactical computers now offering the architecture and
performance of say a CONVEX C-1?  Is Prolog available to tactical program-
mers?  Has the "Ada environment" developed the full set of Programmer's
Workbench tools that UNIX [tm] offers? and it is widely available?
-----

The disparity between what scientists know MIGHT be done, and what poli-
ticians are claiming is a dilemma; how can we pass through its horns?
Tell the SDI proponents in DoD and Congress that: 
(1) A perfect shield is a vain wish; and 
(2) much progress CAN be made, if RDT&amp;E is done reasonably; and that
(3) the real threat is from terrorists, not Russians.  

I think it very likely that we cannot deter SDI, at least not before '89;
and even then, Americans will insist on "adequate defense" - even as they
complain bitterly about the cost of it.  So I suggest that we not try to
block SDI, but rather that we refocus its energies and emphases.
With luck, we can build a system that will work marginally.  It will cost 
billions; weigh several tons; and consume megawatts of power.  In other 
words, it will be confined to land sites only - not ships, and certainly 
not space.  Thus, it will be fit ONLY for defense.  It will be impossible
to attack with it.  It will become a sort of "Maginot Bubble."  Then we 
could sell the plans to our NATO allies, and to members of the Security 
Council, including the USSR and China.  They won't be able to attack us 
with them.  Perhaps such a demonstration of goodwill would cool the arms 
race.  The longterm economic benefits to the USA are attractive; we could 
sell systems to nations that wanted them, but couldn't build their own.  
Some of the revenue could be plowed back into R&amp;D in a many fields, not 
just defense.  The software engineering progress made in behalf of SDI 
probably would apply immediately to many other computerized systems.
Think about it.

Bob

    that I did not see how much useful information could be squirreled
    away in the message header, but did suggest that a summary of the

The following passage from a 6-part "editorial" in the San Francisco
magazine "Processed World" argues that the Space Shuttle disaster will
not (as Proxmire claimed) shake people's faith in technology.  Instead,
it may strengthen their resolve to pursue technology regardless of risks.
(Fortunately, the same argument can not be applied to the Chernobyl accident;
people don't have the same love affair with Soviet nuclear power that they
had with the Shuttle.)

Send me mail if you want more info about the magazine; this is from the
recently published Number 16.


         "Braking Star Wars, or a New Standard of Patriotism"
                          by Marcy Darnovsky

  "If the fireball that consumed Space Shuttle Challenger slows down the
  development of Star Wars, the seven people that perished in it will
  not have died in vain.

  "To millions of space enthusiasts, the shuttle and the space program
  are tributes to curiosity, imagination, courage, and the quest for
  knowledge and adventure.  These are among the worthy impulses of the
  human spacies.  But what most space boosters don't see through the
  glitter of the stars (leaving aside the problem of how to divide the
  purse between cross-town buses and interplanetary travel) is how
  these impulses are being used and perverted.

  "Whatever its origins, there can be no doubt about what master the
  Shuttle now serves.  Starting in 1987, the Pentagon had planned to use
  half of the spacecraft's cargo bay at least twice a year for Star Wars
  experiments alone.  It had claimed a third of the available shuttle
  launches over the next ten years.  Under the National Space Policy
  adopted by Reagan, the Pentagon is not only NASA's largest customer,
  but also its preferred customer, and as such is entitled to bump
  civilian, commercial, and scientific payloads off Shuttle flights.

  "For a short time, the suspension of Shuttle missions and the loss of
  one of the four orbiters will slow the military's invasion of space.
  But before long, the space arms race will be back in harmony with the
  spheres.  The scientific and commercial aspects of the space program
  will probably come out the losers, with NASA dancing to the Pentagon's
  tune even more slavishly than before.

  "A month after the explosion, some of the astronauts voiced dissatisfactions
  with NASA safety procedures and secrecy.  It's too soon to tell whether
  their criticisms will crack the unnerving unaniminity of popular support for
  more space spectaculars.

  "Remarkably, instead of planting doubts about the reliability of complex
  technologies and the push into space, the destruction of the Challenger
  seems to have convinced most Americans that no sacrifice is too great for
  the technology that will conquer the stars.  NASA reports it received 90,000
  letters in the two weeks following the explosion, 99% of them supporting the
  space program.  "Something like this brings the nation together," said
  Daniel Boorstin in the New York Times.  "The space program in general has
  done that; people understand the grandeur even if not the technology, and to
  share that grandeur is what makes a great nation."  Boorstin is right: the
  majestic lift-off of a rocket with human beings perched atop it raises
  modern Americans out of their everyday lives into an epiphany of
  technological awe intertwined with chauvinistic pride.

  "The Shuttle catastrophe has constructed a new standard of patriotism:
  giving your life for your country's technology.  Instead of making it
  acceptable to question the military takeover of space, the Shuttle
  disaster may make the space program more sacred than ever.  If the
  explosion of the Challenger and the seven dead astronauts have
  transformed protest into heresy, it was more of a tragedy than we've
  yet realized."

  *** Shuttle ***

Today's SF Chron contains a Los Angeles Times story by Maura Dolan:

             Shuttle Program Was Doomed, Panelists Say

  The space shuttle prgram was so plagued by a lack of spare parts and
  mission softwre and inadequate crew training that flights would have been
  substantially slowed or halted by now even if the Challenger disaster had
  not occurred, members of the presidential commission that investigated the
  accident said yesterday.  ``There was no management of this program," a
  commissioner said.  ``Even without the accident, the program would have 
  ground to a halt by this point.'' 

The article goes on to quote other commissioners anonymously on inadequate
planning, having to steal spare parts from other shuttles, lack of training
time, one or two of the two simulators being down often, last-minute
reprograming without testing, and so on.  It also outlines some of the 
recommendations of the forthcoming report.

  There are about four or five other ... safety things that NASA has been
  playing the same game with as the O-rings -- the main engine, the brakes,
  the flapper valves (that control fuel flow), the automatic landing
  system," one panelist said.


  *** Nuclear Power ***

Jack Anderson's column in the same paper returned to Chernobyl and the
nuclear power situation in the United States:

  We have learned that, since the hideous accident in the Ukraine, the
  Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff called in the inspectors and informed
  them that new, more lenient interpretations of the fire-safety regulations
  had been approved by the commissioners over the inspectors' vehement
  protests...  Incredibly, the new guidelines let nuclear plant operators
  sidestep the protection of redundant control systems by planing fire
  safety for the first set of controls only.  The guidelines permit 
  partial fire barriers between the first control system and the backup
  system, which can be in the same room.  This means that a fire could
  short-circuit both systems.

ReSent-To: RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

I have to question two statements that were made by Bob Estell in relation
to SDI software.  The first one, "A missile defense is worth having if it is
good enough to save only 5% of the USA population in an all-out nuclear
attack" is oft-heard.  The phrase "worth having" could be applied to a
number of things that aren't being had by many people (things like food,
shelter, medical care, or safer cars).  The question of whether something is
"worth having" irrespective of costs, as if one could snap his fingers and
have that thing is fine for idle conversation but of little use
realistically.  The question of what is worth pursuing and to what degree
must be taken up by society at large.  The magnitude of SDI costs as well as
admitted technical dubiousness must be compared with alternatives.  We can't
have everything that anybody says is "worth having."

The second quote, "That shield might save 75% of the population in a
terrorist attack, launched by an irresponsible source" deserves some
comment.  The "terrorist" argument is used fairly often also to garner
support for SDI, as terrorism is a popular topic on television, etc.  I am
prompted to ask from what quarter this terrorist attack would arise.
England? France?  Also, I would expect that SDI would fail miserably in the
event of anything less than the full-scale attack that it was billed as
deflecting.

How does this apply to Risks?  The rationale and the requirements are
the basis for a system.  If these are invalid, the system will probably
be invalid.  As Herb Lin said, "Politics are just requirements at the
top level."

I am not sure of the facts on this but I think it is pertinent to RISKS.
What is the story on the software for the Sargent York gun?  Was a "high
level" language used.  If so, and the complexity still defeated the project,
it bodes ill for SDI which consists of [the logical equivalent of?]
thousands (hundreds?) of Sargent York guns launched into space.  If a
high-level language was used, there is still life in the "historical"
argument described by Bob Estell.

     [The use of a high-level programming language is only part of the
      problem.  In many cases, deep flaws exist in the design, and
      the implementation makes things only a little bit worse.  In those
      rare cases where the design is actually sound, the programming 
      language -- whether high-level or low-level --  introduces the
      possibility of additional flaws, such as loss of encapsulation,
      lack of strong typing, lack of consistent exception handling,
      improper sequencing or atomic actions particularly in distributed
      systems, lack of adequate control transfers and domain changes, 
      and so on.  But such problems exist in ALL of the commonly used
      programming languages.  PGN]

From the SF Chron, 4 June 1986, Washington Report, p. 13:

  The house approved and sent to the Senate yesterday a bill that would
expand coverage of federal laws against computer crime.
  The legislation, passed by voice vote, would make it a felony knowingly to
trespass into a "federal interest" computer -- one operated by a federal
agency, a federally insured financial institution or by stockbrokers
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- to obtain anything
of value.
  It also would apply to entry into private computer systems located in more
than one state.  The top penalty would be five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
  The measure also would establish a new category of misdemeanor for
"hackers" who use computer bulletin boards to display passwords to computer
systems.  The top penalty would be a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

   [I note that "to obtain anything of value" does not cover denials of 
    service, mass deletions of data, insertion of nonbenevolent Trojan
    horses, and so on.  The multistate basing clause may lead some 
    organizations into distributed system and network operations just for
    the legal coverage!  PGN]

    There probably isn't a lot more to be said about backing-up data that is
new.  Since someone else brought up the subject, I'll recount a very recent
case of incorrect back-up procedures from here in central PA, and then make
a suggestion or two.  [OK. I STILL ACCEPT A MESSAGE OR TWO ON THIS TOPIC. PGN]
    A small local firm was burglarized and their micro-computers stolen.
All their diskettes were also taken -- yes, including all those carefully
made back-ups.  I don't have exact values for the worth of the data but the
loss was enough to have significant impact on a small group.
    I guess this comes under the heading of improperly defining the risk.
Everyone knows that computers can "eat" data and that's why one makes
copies.  How many of your typical users think about flood or fire, which are
problems common to all data storage systems, much less theft which is a
threat peculiar to micro-computer use where the diskettes are worth
something -- even if they don't contain expensive programs.
    I could just say, "Boy, what a dumb mistake.  They should have had
hard-copy of as much stuff as practical, and protected those back-up
diskettes."  That's not very productive, though.  The answer lies in
education and perhaps in program developers meeting the real needs of the
users.  Computer users need to know how to protect their data and why.  A
couple of horror-stories go a long way.  Either practical back-up schemes
described step-by-step (such as how to copy only files created after a
certain date) or else menu type software should be generally available.
This information should be easily accessible to people who don't know a
whole lot about programming or even about their system. (If I were a
diskette manufacturer I'd give away back-up program-packages.)  And don't
forget the worst part of using your archive-copies -- figuring out which
version of what you are working with.

You are absolutely right .... However, I think the problem this time is
not with the algorithm to compute the most reasonable time but the fact that
the machine was unavailable (but not down!) for about half-hour this
afternoon.  (The clock had stopped even though the machine didn't think
the clock had.)  Jagan [Jagannathan]

"guthery%ascvx5.asc@slb-test.CSNET" asks:

    What do we know about scaling up and evolving software?  Are there any
    empirical studies of the evolution of large code bodies (5+ million
    lines, 10+ years)? Do we know how to engineer global behavior from
    local function?  How do we recover functional descriptions and
    domain-specific knowledge from large, mature software systems?  

There have been at least a few such studies. The one I can retrieve most
quickly is "Programs, Cities, Students--Limits to Growth?" reprinted in
PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY: A COLLECTION OF ARTICLES BY MEMBERS OF IFIP
WG 2.3, Edited by David Gries, Springer-Verlag, 1978. Belady and Lehman
published a number of other articles based on their studies of the
metadynamics of systems in maintenance and growth. (Their studies are to
most studies of programming as Thermodynamics is to Classical Mechanics:
They stand back far enough that the activities of individual programmers
can be treated statistically.)

Scott Dorsey comments

    that no one can really forsee how far software engineering technology
    will advance in the next few years, and how far simulation technology
    will advance.

I agree, and certainly am in favor of research. However, the recent past
is often a good predictor of the near future. A good measure of the
progress of software engineering in the last 18 years is to compare the
proceedings of the two NATO conferences in 1968 and 1969 with the contents
of RISKS. The NATO proceedings were reprinted in SOFTWARE ENGINEERING:
CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES, edited by J. M. Buxton, Peter Naur, and Brian
Randell, Petrocelli/Charter, 1976. I think many people will be surprised
and disappointed at how little the problems and approaches have changed
in that time. I interpret this to mean that our ambitions for computer
systems have grown at least as rapidly as our abilities to produce them.

  Mike McLaughlin raises the interesting issue of system overload in software
systems.  I think RISKS readers should focus on that issue with regard to
hard real-time systems, systems in which an answer too late is worthless.
A long time scale example of a hard real-time system is a weather forecast.
If you receive it after you have experienced the weather, it is of little
value.  A more familiar example is a bomb-release computation.  If you
are told, release 10 ms ago, the information is useless.  Overload in such
systems can make them useless.  The only solution is to make sure that
overload cannot happen.  However, this is not the same as making sure that
the system will not be aware of the overload.

  According to the BSTJ articles on the ABM system known as SAFEGUARD, the
system protected against overload by knowing its limits and refusing to
attempt to deal with a new attacking missile if this would cause overload.
This guaranteed capacity to handle the load that was being handled and meet
the real-time deadlines.

  The same approach is often used for handling overload in telephone
switching.  If calls exceed the capacity users are asked to wait.  There are
delays in getting a dial tone or in a call going through.

  Clearly, there are differences in the two situations.  In the telephone
situation the callers wait, they have little choice and the delay, while it
may be annoying is seldom critical.  In the ABM situation, the missiles
don't wait; they do not need the services of the defense system anyway.

  In fact, the solution of ignoring newly arriving "users" gives rise to an
effective countermeasure, send your decoys first.  Thus, our inability to
provide infinite capacity in real-time systems gives rise to an unavoidable
weakness when dealing with an enemy.  The finite limit is always there, and
there are often cheap ways to exploit it.  We should note that the same
situation arises in a telephone system.  I am told that when President
Kennedy was shot, many Washington telephones did not respond because of
overload.  Rock concerts have been known to have similar effects.  If you
are planning a live version of "The Mouse that Roared" announce the
availability of a large number of cheap tickets for a popular group or
groups just as you attack.

  There is a simple but important lesson here.  There are clear limits on
what we can do and in an adversary situation those limits can be exploited.
Nobody would suggest that we should not have built the telephone system
because of these inherent weaknesses, but we would laugh out loud if those
who make their living by developing telephone systems were to advertise a
system that could not be defeated by a determined and sophisticated enemy.

Did I *really* read in a recent RISKS that for a system to work perfectly,
each component in it must work perfectly?

Well, if by "perfect" one means no errors anywhere, no matter how minor;
and if by "system" one means a collection of parts connected in series;
then I guess I agree.

But if "perfect" can be defined as "don't let any runs score" then the recent
World Series offers a counter-example.  The Mets got hits in game #1; there
were base runners - just none of them got all the way around to score.
What's more, balls that got by one infielder were scooped up by another,
with the result that the batter was still thrown out.

It's been a long time now since I had to rely on a computer system that was
a single thread series of non-reduntant parts; our systems do have troubles;
memory modules fail; CPU's fail; mag tapes and disks and printers fail;
communications lines, and modems fail.  So the system comes up [stays up?]
in degraded mode; I get my work done.

Maybe we should abandon the debate about SDI, and just roll up our sleeves
and make something work acceptably.  Doesn't have to be high energy beam;
probably should not be space based.  Undoubtedly should be a collage of
over-lapping and co-operating subsystems.  Those subsystems that get done
first can be deployed first; maybe some off-the-shelf technology is ready
now.  Some of the subsystems can be used against targets other than ICBM's;
e.g., cruise missile defenses might also work well against drug runners.

The RISK I'm beginning to see is that if we who know well enough how to
design redundant systems don't help, others may design SDI as a "chain
no better than it's weakest link."  If they do: (a) The links will be VERY
strong, and (b) gold-plated - so they won't corrode; and (c) it will cost
way too much; and (d) it still won't work.

This story is nth hand, thus to be classified as rumor.  But it is
relevant to RISKS, so I pass it on, if only as a parable.

SeaTac is the main Seattle-area airport.  Ordinarily aircraft landings are
from the north, and this end of the runway is equipped with all the sensing
equipment necessary to do ALS (Automatic Landing System) approaches.

The early 747 ALS worked beautifully, and the first of these multi-centaton
aircraft set down exactly at the spot in the center of the runway that the
ALS was heading for.  The second 747 set down there.  The third 747 landed
on this part of the runway. ... As did all the others.

After a while, SeaTac personnel noticed that the concrete at this point at
the north end of the ALS runway was breaking up under the repeated impact of
747 landings.  So the sofware was modified so that 3 miles out on the
approach, a random number generator is consulted to choose a landing spot --
a little long, a little short, a little to the left or a little to the right.

   THE MORAL:
   Don't assume you understand the universe without actually experimenting.

( sp == Scott Preese )
 sp&gt; Dave Benson argues that it is more reasonable and conservative to assume
 sp&gt; that an overloaded system will fail entirely than to assume it will either
 sp&gt; perform at its design limit but no more or perform above its design limit.

 sp&gt; That's unarguably the conservative assumption.  I would deny that ANY
 sp&gt; assumption was reasonable, given only a performance ceiling and the
 sp&gt; knowledge that performance demand will exceed that ceiling.

Might be helpful to look to the history of engineered artifacts, especially
military artifacts, and most especially military software artifacts.  Then
your "givens" are no longer the only data to bring to bear on the problem.

 sp&gt; It is obvious that the system could be designed to perform in any of
 sp&gt; the suggested ways when unable to cope with load.

While it might be possible to DESIGN the system to perform in any of a
number of ways, there is no particularly good reason to believe that
a software system would, in fact, meet those design goals.  There is
plenty of evidence to suggest that military software can only meet design
goals after repeated operational testing and rework.  

 sp&gt; Suggesting one response or another is simply
 sp&gt; expressing an opinion of the designers' competence

Yup, but not "simply".  It is an expression of the thirty year's history
of software engineering.  It is an expression of the difficulty of
understanding the informational milieu, both external and internal, of
software.  It is an expression of the historical fact that we consistently
fail to predict all the relevant factors, and are thus forced to learn
from experience.  It is not a claim that even the most brilliant team
of individuals could do better.

 sp&gt; rather than any realistic assessment of the risks of SDI.

History certainly suggests this is a realistic assessment -- although
I admit that a complete assessment of the risks requires greater length
than our Dear Moderator would be willing to allow, or than many mailers
could stand.
     [[DM = Dear Moderator]]
     [DM&gt; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS.  PGN]

 sp&gt; Given that neither the design nor the
 sp&gt; designers are determined yet, this is a silly exercise.

Nope.  It is called looking to history for guidance.

This is an old one from my viewpoint.  At Penn, there is an event called
Primal Scream Night, which occurs on the Sunday night before the first
Monday of finals.  Students are encouraged to let off steam by yelling and
tossing paper (an occasional notebook or Econ text has been known to fly).

Anyway, in anticipation of this event, students raided the waste bins at
the computer center, acquiring many reams of junked output as well as boxes
full of punch-card holes.  The next morning, we went down to breakfast early
and to relieve the boredom we started reading some of the fanfolded output:

	"Gee, here's a list of all the CSE110 accounts" [ &gt; 300 names]
	"And here are the randomly-generated passwords."
	"I'll bet nobody's bothered to change their passwords"

Sure enough, we found dozens of "available" accounts.  It seems that the
monthly accounting run had been done that Sunday and the output had been
appropriated before the janitorial service had come around to dispose of it.

Several RISKS violations can be seen here:

	- leaving a paper trail of information that should be secure
	- not disposing of said paper in a secure manner
	- not forcing users to change their passwords (ever)

Still, it was lots of fun to see the look on the comp center director's face
when we handed him the printout and he realized what it was.

I might have noted in <A HREF="/Risks/3.90.html">RISKS-3.90</A> that I once littered New York's Central
Park West with TWO MILES of printout during Charlotte Moorman's Avante Garde
Festival in 1967 -- a two-mile long continuous computer-printed
human-composed visual poem.  My poet friend Emmett Williams and I did a
bunch of such computer-aided visual poetry in the late 60's.  (That year
Charlotte led the parade playing her 'cello suspended from helium balloons.)
I had rigged up my station wagon to have Bell Labs' computer music emanating
from roof-mounted speakers and computer-generated murals of Ken Knowlton on
the sides of the car, with Emmett nursing the printout out of the back
window to cover the middle stripe of CPW.  It was wonderful to see kids
rushing out between the moving vehicles, tearing off some of the printout
for souvenirs!  The computer RISK lay in the fact that our then-developing
Multics system bellied up for a day or so when -- having used Ken Thompson's
QED to context-edit an incredibly lovely 7-language interwoven visual pun --
I was ready to prepare the printout.  A simpler substitute had to be used,
produced by an alternative means.  (The show must go on.)  PGN

The 22 May 87 issue of _Science_, p903, has an article about the rocket
that was hit by lightning two months ago:

    Jon Busse, chairman of NASA's inquiry into the accident, disclosed ...
  that the Atlas-Centaur ... was launched in a heavily charged electrical
  atmosphere on 26 March.  The rocket itself triggered a lightning bolt.  A
  single bolt punched through the fiberglass nose cone, spread fingers of
  electricity around the computerized brain [sic!] that commands the motors,
  and changed one word of program language.  As a result, the motors sent the
  rocket veering off course 51 seconds after lift-off, at the moment of peak
  strain.  The $160-million package began to break up, and flight controllers
  had no choice but to deliver the coup de grace.
    ... If [shuttle launch criteria] had been applied, they would have
  prevented the launch of the unmanned Atlas-Centaur this spring.  According
  to one researcher, NASA has installed the ``most sophisticated lightning
  monitoring system in the world''....  But its data were not used.
    ... There was a failure of communication, Busse said, and a failure of
  NASA to ``exercise awareness, judgment, and leadership.''
  
I find it interesting how this example is doubly appropriate for RISKS.
We have both an accidental computer failure, and of the larger human
failure to match existing data with actual procedures.

The SEATTLE TIMES, Thurs June 4, 1987, p. A4 includes a story titled
"Seconds to react, Pentagon report on Stark says," attributed to The 
Washington Post and Newhouse News Service.  It includes the statements:

"Iraq has claimed that the Stark was inside the "exclusion zone" of the 
(Persian) Gulf where Iraq had warned ships would be subject to attack, the
Pentagon said.  The U.S. government disputes the claim.

The Iraqis base their claim on the navigation system in the fighter-plane
cockpit, according to the Pentagon, which added "we are convinced Stark
was 10 to 15 nautical miles outside" that zone.  The Pentagon said it had
received a "wealth of position data" on the Stark from that ship, the AWACS
plane that monitored the attack and two other ships in the area."

       spouse had the right of way.  Unfortunately, this case is similar.  
       Whether or not the Iraqi navigation system was in error, there were
       quite a few human lapses that rendered technology useless.  PGN]

Most of us in the Computer Science Laboratory at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center have been using the programming language "Cedar" for several
years.  Cedar has a "safe" subset which guarantees the "safe" behavior of
compiled programs.  One has to use keywords like "LOOPHOLE" or "TRUSTED" in
order to program outside the safe subset.  Unsafe behavior includes
references outside the bounds of an array.  Programming in the safe subset
causes the automatic insertion of run-time bounds checks, among other run
time checks.  (It also involves extensive compile time checking as well.)

In our workstation operating system, also called "Cedar", all programs run
in a common multi-process address space.  This includes programs that are
being debugged, as well as editors and the file system.  The operating
system itself is written in Cedar, and a large part of that system is
written in the safe subset.  (Some old parts of the system have not been
converted to safe Cedar.  It is a matter of controversy how much could be
converted.)  The screen managers, editors, compilers, and mail program are
all mostly in the safe subset.  Thus, my day to day work is conducted using
programs that involve extensive run-time checking.

I rarely have a "crash" on my workstation that can be traced to a failure
that could have been caught by a run-time check, such as a bounds check.
That is, crashes in which the language abstraction is violated.  "Rarely"
means on the order of significant fractions of a year between occurrences,
probably more than a year.  I do have more frequent crashes than this.
There are a few resources in our system that are consumed in a monotonic
fashion, and under certain conditions one can run out of these resources
during a day of work; this event requires a re-boot.  In addition, there are
some lingering deadlocks in the window manager that strike infrequently.

I have recently written a large compiler-compiler system.  Except for a few
lines of code in the midst of a parser generator subsytem, it is written
entirely in the safe subset.  This system generates Cedar source code, and
generates this source code faster than the Cedar compiler can compile it.
Thus, the cost of the run-time checks in this program is inconsequential.  I
debugged this system on my workstation, running it concurrently with may
day-to-day support tools, including the window manager, text editor,
compiler, and mail-program.  This undebugged code never interfered with the
execution of these support tools.

All of the above is written to support the notion that one can work on a
day-to-day basis in a system with extensive built in run-time checks.  I
find it very comforting to work in this system.  I personally would find
it very painful to go back to a world that was not "safe".

I should clarify a couple of points in my previous contribution.  Several
people have pointed out IBM's internal PL.8 compiler, which does generally
resemble what I was thinking of:  it works quite hard to determine whether
run-time checks are really needed, and succeeds in eliminating most of them.
It typically manages to bring the run-time-check overhead down to one or
two percent, sometimes to zero.  (PL.8 has not been publicized much, but
there are a couple of papers on it in the Sigplan 82 compiler symposium.)

My notion was a little different, though:  the compiler should *never*
generate a run-time check; if a run-time check is necessary anywhere, and
the programmer has not explicitly overridden that particular check in that
particular place, this should be considered a fatal error and code generation
should be abandoned.

The reasons behind this are two.  First, the occurrence of a run-time error
is almost certainly a symptom of a bug; programs should be more careful.
It seems better to flag such bugs at compile time, when it is convenient
to do something about them.  Second, since the actual error will generally
show up at some remove from the underlying bug that caused it, it is really
very difficult to do anything intelligent about it after the fact, barring
global recovery methods like recovery blocks.  (This is a major reason why
programs should avoid generating such errors.)  Dying with a core dump is
not acceptable for e.g. an air-traffic-control program.  It seems wise to
head off such errors in advance.

Clearly, it is not realistic to expect a compiler to eliminate all run-time
checks from arbitrarily complex programs.  That's more a job for a theorem
prover, which isn't practical as a routine programming tool for normal
applications just yet.  But:  programmers do not write arbitrary programs.
My conjecture -- which PL.8 strengthens but does not prove -- is that modest
intelligence in the compiler, plus some willingness to clean up code to make
it clearer, would reduce the "compiler can't be sure about this one" cases
to an occasional annoyance that could be handled by manual overrides.

I'm the author of a Pascal compiler that is compatible with the IBM
Pascal/VS compiler.  Among other things, the compiler does a MUCH more
complete job of detecting run-time errors than the IBM product does.  For
instance, my compiler detects run-time uses of variables before they have
been assigned to or otherwise initialized.  Since the compiler is completely
compatible with the IBM product, one of the first things that people did
when the compiler was released was to dust off existing Pascal/VS programs
and run them through the new compiler.  The number of bugs that the new
compiler found in these supposedly "fully debugged" programs was absolutely
frightening.  I now regret that I did not have the foresight to keep
statistics on this since it would have given some kind of indication of the
effectiveness of the particular debugging techniques used.  Even more
frightening was the number of programmers who refused to believe that this
new compiler had actually found errors in production programs.  I've often
thought that it would be an interesting experiment to have a group of
programmers debug some programs with all compiler run-time checking off and
then to turn the run-time checking on in order to see how many errors they
missed.

One risk of putting strong run-time checking into a compiler is that the
programmers may assume that the compiler is doing more than it is.  For
instance, the IBM Pascal/VS compiler does not detect integer overflows in
EVERY circumstance (it isn't clear if this is a "bug" or a "feature").
Thus, a few programmers were really surprised when the new compiler detected
integer overflows in their programs.  They had not bothered to test for that
themselves since they were convinced that the Pascal/VS compiler was doing
the checking for them.

There's a risk associated with hardware bounds checking which continues to nab
me.  After working for months on Burroughs hardware (in Modula2 and ALGOL)
I became accustomed to having my occasional bounds errors caught by the
compiler or the hardware.  Now I work in C on a UNIX box and occasionally am
astonished when the first element of an array "miraculously" takes on a new
value.  Makes debugging a lot harder, too.

To:           RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

While working through *Peter Norton's Assembly Language Book for the IBM 
PC*, I was struck again and again by it's "risky" approach to programming.  
A few quotations:

On error checking:

         In this first version of READ_SECTOR we'll deliberately ignore
         errors, such as having no disk in the disk drive.  This is not
         good practice, but this isn't the final version of READ_SECTOR.
         We won't be able to cover error-handling in this book, but you
         will find error-handling procedures in the version of Dskpatch
         on the disk that is available for this book (169).

At another point that I could not locate just now, they (Norton and Socha)
say that they will not check for X, since it is a programming error.

One could interpret the ignoring of error-checking in a number of
ways---perhaps it is so important that the reader should spend $24.95
(for the diskette) to get some good examples; perhaps the authors are
bored by it; perhaps it would make the book too large; etc.  In any case,
the book does not make an effort to impress upon readers the importance of
extensive and careful error checking.  Since they attempt to teach
modular programming at basic levels, it would be appropriate for them to
teach error checking at basic levels as well.  They do stress the importance
of TESTING, especially boundary conditions, but they clearly believe that
testing can replace most error checking.

On completeness of programs:

         Dskpatch won't be finished then, as we said, programs never
         are; but the scope of our coverage in this book will be
         complete (280).

         "a program is never done . . . but there comes a time when it
         has to be shipped to users" (295; quotation marks are in the
         book, apparently to indicate that this is conventional wisdom).

         Remember:  Programs are never complete, but we have to stop
         somewhere (276; and then they kludge a routine that they admit
         should be completely rewritten).

This attitude explains why the book gradually gets sloppier and sloppier.  The
first few chapters impressed me as award-winning material, wonderful tutorial,
careful, thoughtful.... Then I found that care replaced more and more by an
effort to sell the diskette and by haste to finish the book and get more
dollars in their pockets.  In some ways, I appreciate the errors that I found
in their programs, since that gave me a chance to try out my knowledge of
assembly language, but that does not excuse their attitude and certainly does
not excuse their teaching others to meet deadlines by handing programs over as
is instead of completed.

I would still recommend this book for experienced programmers who want a good
tutorial on assembly language, but it would be a little dangerous for people
who have not already absorbed some of the principles of risk reduction.

In addition to this example of risky programming, I would like to offer some
thoughts on the discussion of such built-in error checking as checking for
the overflowing of array bounds.

First, aren't the gains fairly limited?  If the error is captured in the
hardware, it's still going to cause an abort, right?  It may be a little
cleaner and may help the programmer locate the problem, but the program is
still going to crash.  I certainly wouldn't want the hardware or even any
compiler-generated code to attempt to correct such an error in my code.  I
suppose that there may be some disagreement about the gains of terminating
gracefully over just falling apart, but the point is that one still has to
terminate, which is not much consolation to the user.  If the error condition
could cause damage to the system, then the gains might be considerable.  Such
damage is usually prevented at the systems level though.  On an IBM mainframe,
one has such things as "operation exceptions."  What about other machines?
In three years of program development, I have yet to damage an IBM PC.  In
"critical" software---well, maybe there is something here---would built-in
boundary checking prevent a robot from smashing someone's head?  From the
user's point of view, that certainly would be consolation!

Second, what is the overhead for such checking?  In an inner loop, the
overhead might be substantial, especially if the loop consists of only a
few lines, as in searching for a character in a string.  The programmer
has to code some termination anyway, so error checking should be redundant
here.  E.g.,

   for (i = 0; i &lt; BUFSIZE &amp;&amp; buf[i]!=CHAR_X; i++);

I suppose the programmer could slip and use BUFSIZE when it should be BUFSIZE2
or something like that.  (For a real example of such an error in distributed
code, see the public domain version of SED, "a freeware component of the GNU
operating system"---in the incarnation in which I received it from a BBS, same
version on Genie, I believe.)

Finally, checking for array bounds is of little value in languages/programs
that use pointers extensively.  The loop above is much more likely to be coded
as follows:

   for (s = buffer; *s &amp;&amp; *s!=CHAR_X; s++);

A superb compiler might be able to determine that this is an appropriate point
to check for going past the bounds of 'buffer', which may not be properly
terminated.  By such standards, however, today's compilers are Neanderthals,
and most of our machines don't have the power to drive more intelligent
compilers at reasonable speeds anyway.

In conclusion, I don't believe that built-in error checking is worth the
trouble for most environments.  First, the gains are limited.  Second, the
overhead may be substantial and cannot be controlled by the programmer.
Finally, compilers are not capable of interpreting the code well enough to
determine just what sort of error checking should be performed (perhaps I
should say compilers that I am familiar with on equipment that I am
familiar with: PL/I on IBM mainframes; C86 and MSC on IBM PCs).

Steve Thompson wrote (Risks 4.94) "Need there be a Hackers-Anonymous."

In 1972 or 73, while I was an undergraduate at Carnegie-Mellon, I made up
a supply of flyers for 'Computer Nurds Anonymous' and posted them around
campus.  (Note:  Nurd was the accepted spelling at CMU back then; we had
not picked up on the MIT spelling, nor was the word 'hacker' used much at
CMU at the time.)  Computer Nurds Anonymous offered a withdrawal plan that
moved the nurd from interactive computing to a batch environment, and from
there, in graduated steps, to hand cyphering.  I understand that some
copies of the flyer ended up at other universities; I no longer have a
copy.

More seriously, while I was an undergraduate, I and another student did
a term project for a personality theory course which involved what may well
be one of the first serious psychological studies of hackers.  We came up
with the following characterization:

	This particular group of students uses the computer as a
	social surrogate and as an object of their creative energies
	because, being passive individuals, they prefer to deal with
	the stable environment of the machine world.  As these people
	are basically intelligent but introverted, they employ the
	computer because it is intellectually stimulating without
	allowing the trauma of social contact.

We then identified a group of 28 students who had completed some course
work in computer science, 6 of whom were identified by their peers as
'computer nurds'.  We administered the Edwards Personal Preference Scales
for change (Do they like familiar environments, or do they seek new
environments?) and order (Do they like an orderly life?), and the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory social introversion scale.  We found
no correlation between being a 'computer nurd' and desire for change,
we found that, as expected, 'computer nurds' were more likely to be
introverted than extroverted, but that this was true of the entire population
tested also.  We found, contrary to our expectations, that 'computer nurds'
were significantly more disorderly than others.  

Charles Hedrick (who was then a PhD student at CMU) commented on our
unexpected result on disorder that, while an orderly disposition was
logically a prerequisite for a successful programmer, so-called 'computer
nurds' are not terribly successful.  Nurds spend a great deal of time
at the computer, but they operate it more as a toy than a learning
tool; they are adept at performing tricks with a teletype but lack
the orderliness required for true success.

Jerry Saltzer's comment:  Ah, that's my "Paradox of Software" argument.  We
want it fast (who would use a computer slower than a person?), yet we want
it flexible, friendly and maintainable when it breaks down.  I wish I were
doing more research in software, but I am surrounded by people who only want
the computation done faster, almost at all costs.  E.g., would we prefer a
single button on ALL keyboards which reads "HELP" (single button, very
fast), or a more general, flexible keyboard which has 'H' 'E' 'L' 'P'?

Steve Thompson asks about people addicted to computing.  So far as I know, we
don't have a definition of addiction; we have, at best, some criteria for
determining when a person is addicted.  In fact, I believe that we have levels
of addiction.  For example, we have "problem drinkers," and we have
"alcoholics."  Do we also have "problem computors" and "compuholics"?

First, I think we need a careful characterization of addiction, with respect
to computing.  Until we have that characterization, I don't think we can
profitably address Steve's questions.

Just to start things off, I suggest that a person P is addicted to an activity
A (which may include the taking of substances) iff (if and only if):

1) A is being engaged in to an extent that is physically and/or mentally
debilitating.

2) A is such that the benefits of not engaging in it outweigh the benefits of
engaging in it.

3) P cannot cease A.

Clause (1) is necessary to exclude such necessary activites as eating.  Clause
(2) is necessary to account for such things as living, which is progressively
debilitating; presumably, we don't want to say that people are addicted to
living (and don't want to get into discussions of when people would be better
off dead?).

I'm not sure, but it seems in some ways right to add a clause specifying that P
knows (1 and 2) or even (1, 2, and 3).  I hesitate to add this though, because 
it also seems right to say that a person can be addicted to something without 
having any idea that there is a problem.  This consideration threatens to bring
up issues of social definitions, relativism, and all of that; but let's not.

So, a preliminary result given this definition.  The benefits of being addicted
to computing instead of to other activities are trivial, since the addiction
leads to physical and/or mental disability.  Note that under certain
circumstances, the disability may be justified, but this is covered by clause
(2).  In a state of emergency, it may be appropriate to exploit the addict's
computing abilities, just as it may be appropriate to ask the police to stop a
killer in a shopping mall.  ON THE OTHER HAND, if a person is so addictive
that he/she must be addicted to SOMETHING, then it would certainly be better
to be addicted to computing than to some more damaging activity (such as
drinking alcohol), and this is covered by clause (2).

Theoretically, I think this definition takes us a long way.  Practically, it
doesn't seem to offer us much.  How are we to determine whether or not, for
example, a person is so addictive that he/she must be addicted to something?
Are we to beat on that person until we teach him/her to live with no
addictions?  Or is it better to let up at some point and say "this is good
enough."  Also, we have the problem of levels of addiction, and this is not
addressed in the definition.  If one is computing at a level that is only
problematic, then is that better than being fully addicted to something that
is less dangerous than the computing?

Also, I see that I said in (3) that P CANNOT cease A. But, don't addicts often
(with extensive help) cease their addictive activities?  Perhaps we should say
in (3) that P cannot cease A on his/her own.  Then we might define a person
who has a problem with A as someone who can cease A on his/her own but is
having difficulty doing so.

Then, it seems that we have to say that being problematic with respect to A is
better than being addicted with respect to A' iff the costs of the full span of
engaging in A are less than the costs of the full span of engaging in A' (add 
after effects to each).  If being a problematic drinker ruins your liver, why 
not be a computing addict instead?  But if addictive computing ruins your eyes 
and causes skin cancer, but your liver problem is limited to a few spots, why 
not damage the liver a little?  If addictive computing ruins your health over a
twenty-year period but being more of a participant in normal social activities 
would have infected you with AIDS, why not compute yourself into the grave?

Finally, I would like to encourage people to quit worrying about other people
being isolated.  Whenever someone doesn't want to join the circle, people have
to figure out what his/her problem is.  To say that the person is addicted to
computing (or to work) seems like an au courant easy answer.  Some people
haven't an inkling of what happens in isolation, and many people seem to know
little more than herd instinct and the word "normal" (not the concept, just
the word).  To these people, isolation seems physically and/or mentally
debilitating.  It would be much better if people would accept others a little
more and give them credit for knowing their best interests instead of
addressing their own doubts by stigmatizing what they don't understand.

Ceteris paribus, then, I think we should drop "isolation" from our concerns
about the risks of computing.  There is nothing absolutely bad about isolation,
and some people can gain a lot by a week or so of solitude.  Of course, 
prophets tend to go off for much longer than a week; forty days and forty 
nights seems like a good healthy period for a prophet.  I think we should 
allow at least that to computer gurus, even if their activities are less grand.

In WWII, a Japanese battleship with HUGE (17" or 18") guns hit a U.S.
destroyer with very nearly a full salvo... of armor piercing projectiles.
The range was close, and the trajectory of the projectiles was close to the
horizontal.  The projectiles passed completely through the target, without
detonating - the destroyer was simply not there, as far as the fuzes were
concerned.  The U.S. ship took a fair amount of injuries and damage, but was
still able to sail on its own power back to a friendly port.  Just a couple
of the projectiles exited below the waterline, and the crew was able to
control the flooding and fire.
 
PT boats, on the other hand, were sometimes destroyed by the water spouts of
major caliber projectiles.  
 
Not much relation to today's Risks in Computing - except for a little 
perspective on the history of projectiles against ships.  Projectiles are
just ballistic missiles without on-board guidance.  The larger projectiles
have fuzes that used to be set mechanically just before firing.  If you 
don't have time to set them right, they do not do what is desired.  Sounds
like human error again... or perhaps, before.

Reach for the Sky.

The US Department of Agriculture has encountered an unanticipated difficulty in
its project to develop robot fruit pickers.  To contain costs, the robots were
designed with monochrome scanners.  Unfortunately, to the robots, an orange has
the same size, shape, and brightness as a small cloud.  Current robot pickers
are often hung up literally reaching for the clouds.  The USDA says it's back
to the drawing board - this time using color.

(From "Random Access", 21 November 1987)

    [Was this in Orange Count-y?  By the way, a cotton-picking robot might
still have trouble with white clouds.  Fruit-of-the-zoom?  PGN]

An interesting point that has not been mentioned so far is that, at least in
the version that reached BITNET sites in Canada, there was a major bug in the
code of the program.  It parsed the NAMES file in a very inflexible way causing
it to have a success rate of about 5% at coming up with valid forwarding
addresses.

If the programmer had been more careful, we might have been in an even bigger
mess.

So there are fewer risks when a program has bugs? :-)

The Dec. 24 Los Angeles Times reports that "an unexplained computer glitch
caused a one-day delay in posting an estimated $2 billion in transactions at
First Interstate Bank of California last week."  The data processing problem
affected all checking account transactions last Thursday -- 3 to 4 million,
both deposits and checks, an estimated $2 billion total.

For unexplained reasons, the entire record of Thursday's transactions from the
bank's branches was rejected by the computer when posting was attempted at
10:30 pm Thursday.  DP employees worked on the problem all night and the
following day, and the transactions were finally posted late Friday afternoon.

The problem was corrected in time to avoid any widespread effect on customer
accounts.  A bank executive VP said, "We did not have a disaster.  We had a
systems problem that we are still diagnosing to make sure it doesn't happen
again."

	MALFUNCTION DISRUPTS GARY PHONE SERVICE FOR 18,000 CUSTOMERS

  GARY -- Many people living or working here found it impossible to use the
phone early Thursday [Dec. 10, 1987].  A malfunction during routine testing of
equipment at an Indiana Bell Telephone Co. switching office at 725 Madison St.
was blamed by telephone company officials for disrupted service for abount
18,000 customers with 881, 882, 883, 885 and 886 prefixes.  Gary police and
fire department representatives said the city's 911 line was working, so
emergency vehicles were able to respond to calls.  Non-emergency business
lines were out of service, they said.

The equipment failure occured at 5:45 a.m. with some phone customers regaining
partial service by 7 a.m., said Estel Gibson, media relations manager for
Indiana Bell in Indianapolis.  Service was restored by afternoon, he said.
Gibson said that during the testing, equipment was switched to battery power.
The battery power was low and there was no warning, so when equipment was
switched back to commercial power, the computer memory system was knocked out,
requiring reprogramming of the computer, he added.

Besides five Gary phone prefixes, the system malfunction also affected access
to long distance lines in north Lake County, said Gibson.  Local calls were
not affected outside Gary, he added.  Gibson said the malfunction in switching
equipment affected 18,400 lines in Gary.  "Our first priority was to restore
service," said Gibson.  The second priority was to check the backup system to
make sure it is working properly, he added.

At Methodist Hospital Northlake Campus in Gary, the nursing coordinator had to
use a two-way radio for communications inside the building, a hospital
representative said.  At St. Mary Medical Center in Gary, calls were routed
through the switchboard at the Gary hospital, a hospital representative said.

Almost 40,000 Honolulu telephones were in and out of service yesterday
(the first working day after Christmas), including the police/fire
emergency number 911, and non-emergency Fire and Police numbers, due to
a possibly faulty computerized switch, and an unusually heavy volume of
calls.

The 40,000 customers were in 8 Honolulu exchanges, covering a large
section of the downtown area.  Unlike the 5,000 or so phones that were
down during last the heavy rainstorm last week, this problem was not
weather-related.

John Harper, Hawaiian Telephone's Director of Public Affairs explained
that when the volume of calls rises to a high level, rather than falter
completely the switching equipment goes into a "half load" status,
handling only some incoming calls and often not delivering a dial tone
to customers within the affected exchanges.  The unusal aspect of
yesterday's problem was that the volume of calls was nowhere near its
rated load capacity.  However, the switch was also busy doing extensive
automatic self-diagnostics in order to locate an internal malfunction
that it had detected within itself.

Hideto Kono, the chairman of the state Public Utilities
Commission---whose phone was one of those affected---was very upset,
saying that the recent outages caused by flooded cables were
"understandable and excusable," but yesterday's problems were not.
"Equipment is available that works well almost all the time, and we're
going to be asking Hawaiian Telephone why its present equipment can't
operate that way."

Subject: Unions denied access to commercial database services

I came across this in InfoWorld (Nov 23, 1987).  It has some scary
implications about the desire and ability of corporations to control access
to information.  This points up the need for alternative power structure
databases such as those that were discussed on prog-d a few months ago.

Restricted Access Riles Dialog Users
by Jeff Angus and Alice LaPlante

Subscribers to on-line databases may increasingly see the words
"unauthorized file" when they try to use certain services, if a recent
trend continues unchecked.

Last week, Dialog Information Services, a carrier of Dun &amp; Bradstreet
financial databases--including the now-restricted Dun's Financial
Records--told labor union librarians that they would no longer be able
to access certain files.

"If it's allowed to go on, this could set a precedent for a wide range
of discrimination in online services, which are essentially public
utilities," said Randy Barber, a financial consultant with the Center
for Economic Organizing, in Washington.

This time the discrimination is aimed specifically at labor unions and
possibly the IRS, according to Barber.  But if online services such as
Dialog can cut off certain subscribers simply because of fears about how the
data will be used, the next step could be routinely forbidding customers to
access certain files at the slightest hint of an adversarial motive,
according to Barber.

"It could get to the point where you'd have to have a demonstrably
benign reason to access certain data," said Barber.  "This precedent
could have severe repercussions on the free market for ideas."

According to the AFL-CIO's librarian, Ruby Tyson, when she first got the
"unauthorized file" message while trying to access the Dun database, she was
referred by Dialog to the New Jersey office of Dun &amp; Bradstreet On-line
Services, where a spokesman told her a list of 240 "entities" had been
compiled and sent to Dialog with the instructions to deny access to any
person or organization on that list.

"We were told it wasn't just unions but other groups, including the
IRS," Tyson said, adding that Dun &amp; Bradstreet hinted the ban might be
extended to other databases as well.

Both Dialog Information Services and Dun &amp; Bradstreet refused to comment,
but Marvin Hrubes, an attorney representing the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union (UFCW), sent a letter to both organizations
charging that Dun &amp; Bradstreet's actions constitute tortuous interference
with the UFCW's contract with Dialog and are violations of the National
Labor Relations Act and the civil rights laws of both California and the
District of Columbia.

Tyson as well as Ellen Newton, librarina of the United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers International, say Dun's on-line information can be gathered through
hard copies of the data.  But this defeats the purpose of subscribing to an
on-line service since researching and tabulating data manually using hard
copy is complex and time-consuming, they said.

Tyson and Newton find the Dun move and Dialog's assent to it not only an
inconvenience, because the service is so productive, but also an offense to
their librarians' sense of the appropriate access to information, they added.

"We think it's a serious matter and something that causes concern for
libraries in their role of providing access to the broadest possible
diversity of ideas," said Patrice McDermott, the assistant director of the
Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association.

Newton added that he has seen the information spreading.  "Dun &amp; Bradstreet
has also knocked us off of Data Times," he said.  "We just got a message
saying that Dun's database service is unavailable under our agreement, which
can't be true because we haven't signed any new agreement since Data Times
added the Dun Service."

Newton spoke to a Data Times spokesoman who said that Dun &amp; Bradstreet had
also sent his company a list of names of entities to be denied access.

The following article, whose headline is the Subject: line of this message,
is from the "Fourth District Report" (a newsletter sent to all constituents)
issued by Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana's office, dated Winter
1987-88.  Carefully quoted verbatim (mistakes and all) and in its entirety
w/o permission.  No copyright notice appears on the newsletter:

  A modern-day version of "leg irons" is now being used to monitor the
  location of selected Los Angeles County inmates who as a term of their
  sentences are generally restricted to their homes.

  It is part of a pilot program that extends through September, 1988, using
  Comptom area probationers selected by the courts.  The electronic devices
  are attached to the probationers' legs.  Their movements are monitored by
  Trax Monitoring, Inc., which provided the devices.

  When we are faced with a jail overcrowding problem of tremendous
  proportions, elecronic surveillance of those probationers deemed suitable
  for the program offers at least a partial answer."

  At present, county jails have some 20,000 prisioners detained in
  facilities designed for 12,000 inmaates.

Paragraph three is apparently a quote, probably from supervisor Dana, though
it is missing an open quote mark and an attribution, as you can see.

Although no real information on how the system manufactured by Trax Monitoring,
Inc. operates, it is probably reasonable to assume that computers are a part of
it.  That there may be risks to the public in its use seems a fair bet.

While it's clear that this system is being used experimentally only on
low-risk "inmates", there is presumably an interest in expanding its
use as a "cost-effective" alternative to prison/jail construction.

In the same newsletter there is an article entitled "DRUGS.  Experts
map 32-point plan".  Here are some excerpts from that article:

  Education, automation and methods to improve interagency communcation are the
  focal points of a 32-point list of recommendations by the Los Angesles County
  Task Force on Drug Abuse to stregthen the public's war on drugs.

  ...Other recommendations include:

  Increased automation on probation conditions; establishing a centralized
  repository of data on drug arrests, seizures and trends to be available
  countywide; standardized certification for drug diversion programs for
  length, content, defendant participation and random drug testing; and,
  regular meetings among representatives of drug enforcement, abuse services
  and prevention-education agencies to discuss and resolve problems.

[ Please pardon the poor grammar of the staff of my County's elected
  officials... ]

They do have a case here - anyone who has supervisor permissions on almost any
computer system (and these might be obtained illegally) may generate any
information, including hiding the traces of what s/he had done. After all, it's
all just bits! So almost nothing can be proven without a reasonable doubt.

The problem is, this also applies to digital recording - both audio and
video. A person with the right (wrong?) equipment can generate a video clip
showing anyone committing any crime!

While I was in St. Louis visiting my inlaws over the holidays, I read an
article in the local paper about a court decision that found the computerized
voting process used in Missouri was discriminatory.  The loser of a close
election had filed the suit in question.  I didn't save the article and I don't
think the article explained what was discriminatory about the voting procedure.
The article did say that similar procedures were used in other states.

The discussion about virus programs reminds me that one thing I wish my PC's
hard disk had was a "write-enable" switch, so I could test new programs with
less worry about system corruption.  (Also, the disk manufacturers and/or pc
vendors don't seem to distribute anything resembling test software).

Last spring or summer the journal _Computer Security_ (?) carried a paper about
the author's (company approved) experimentation with viruses. Alas, his
research was closed down by his company, who got extremely nervous.  Sorry I
can't be more definitive; I'm surprised no one has mentioned this paper before.

The self-referential photocopier duplexor error that prevented the user from
finding out what a duplexor was forms the key point of the plot of the fabulous
science fiction story "Ms Fnd in a Lbry" by Hal Draper.  (It's in Groff
Conklin's _17 x Infinity_, beyond that I don't know.)  (TOTAL SPOILER
FOLLOWS...)  Information is compactified into "nudged quanta", so the total
primary knowledge of the galaxy fits in a single drawer.  However, the
secondary and higher order knowledge to &gt;find&lt; the primary knowledge grew
exponentially.  At some point, a certain nth-order quanta got stuck; checking
for repair information got routed through that very quanta; emergency checking
for the location of that original drawer of primary knowledge ....  And so
civilization collapsed instanter.

(Also, the bug reminds me of the true Cray story I submitted anonymously
long ago, where an array bounds overflow corrupted the Fortran formats
that attempted to trace the array.)

Posted: 27 Dec 87 22:39:00 GMT
Organization: The ARPA Internet
 
     By now,  many of you will have heard of the (infamous) CHRISTMA EXEC
"virus" which infected BITNET/EARN/NETNORTH and virtually paralyzed IBM's
internal  network  for a day  or two.   For those who  haven't  seen  the
various postings on the BITNET LINKFAIL list, RISKS-FORUM Digest, etc., I
will summarize  (no flames for the oversimplifications in the interest of
brevity, please).  Originating as a "prank" on a German end-node on EARN,
this EXEC (i.e.  similar to a .COM file - and written in REXX, a DCL-like
language)  displayed,  when executed  on  an IBM  VM system,  a primitive
christmas tree on the terminal and then mailed itself to everyone on that
poor user's NAMES file (i.e.  personal mailing name list) before deleting
itself.   Of  course,  some  users  had network distribution lists  (e.g.
JNET-L,  MEDINF-L,  etc.)  defined  in  their  NAMES  file . . .       [I
personally received six copies of this EXEC from different sources - this
is probably not unusual.]
 
     While this was a significant problem on  BITNET/EARN/NETNORTH with a
fair number of VM/CMS nodes, the virus clearly could not infect VAXinated
nodes,  of  which  there  are  a  larger  number.   Also,  many  (usually
undergraduate) students on VM/CMS systems are denied network access, thus
limiting  the rate of  spread  of  the virus  beyond an  infected system.
However,  once the virus entered VNET,  IBM's internal  network of VM/CMS
systems,  things really took  off (all VM/CMS systems;   users with large
NAMES  files;   all  with  network access)  and  allegedly brought  their
network to a standstill.
 
     Initially,  the  problem  required  manual  intervention  by  system
managers to purge CHRISTMA  EXECs  from users'  readers -  but this could
only give a temporary remission in the disease.   Fortunately, a CHRISTMA
eradicator was written (by Eric Thomas, author of the LISTSERV software),
and  also  an ingenious  virus  was developed  (by  Hank ?,  sorry,  I've
forgotten)  to follow and destroy the original  CHRISTMA  virus  and then
self-destruct  in  mid-January.   So now  it's  eradicated like smallpox:
hmmm .  .  .  I expect that there may be another minor epidemic when some
users return from vacation.
 
     So,  what should we do?  Laugh at IBM?  Say "It can't happen to me."
Look  at  all  those experienced,  computer-wise  IBMers who ran CHRISTMA
EXEC.  Oh yes, there will be flames . . .    platitudes about NEVER using
any software which  you  haven't  written  yourself  -  or is  written by
someone  you  TRUST  ABSOLUTELY  :-) . . .   flames  about  chain letters
and viruses on the network . . .    their authors should be boiled in oil
/ set in RA81 air filter glue / sentenced to do 10 years of RSX SYSGENs /
locked  in  a room  with  only an IBM  PC  /  (substitute  your favourite
nightmare here).  Let's just think a little before flaming.
 
     Could a "harmless"  CHRISTMA-like virus attack a VAX/VMS system?   A
recent network posting (RISKS?, LINKFAIL?) mentioned the possibility of a
virus  hidden in SHAR files which are _executed_ as .COM  files to unpack
them.   SHAR files  are,  after  all,  an excellent method for _reliable_
software distribution over  gateways.   (This  is  not  meant  to reflect
negatively  on  Michael  Bednarek  in  any  way  -   VMSHAR  is  a  great
contribution and we all have used it or will use it.) But .  .  .  nobody
unpacks one of these distributions with  PRIVs turned on,  do we?   Could
such a virus, like CHRISTMA EXEC, replicate from a non-privileged account
(apart from doing a SET PROC/PRIV=ALL quietly in the middle of the file)?
Certainly,  VMS  Mail won't allow  wildcard SEND (and JNET won't allow  a
wildcard  SEND/FILE),  but,  for example,  a .COM  file could  do  a SHOW
LOGICAL/OUTPUT=CRACKER.TMP,   look  for  logicals  with  syntax  "jnet%",
"BITNET%",  "IN%",  etc.  and try mailing itself to these addresses.  (No
flames about  giving state secrets  to the enemy,  please.   Blind Freddy
could have seen that one.)
 
     We may not be able to read  a SHAR file in its entirety (looking for
a virus  in  a few thousand blocks  of code),  but I for one am certainly
going to "quarantine" it as far as possible, SEARCHing it for more than a
few key words before unpacking it  from a non-privileged (either  default
or authorized)  account.  Further suggestions from the more devious minds
on the list would be welcome,  please.  Ignorance may be bliss, but it is
definitely NOT SAFE.
 
     Most if not all  of us have public  domain  software running on  our
systems   -   or  programs  written  by   students   and  our  colleagues
(trustworthy,  of course :-} ).  How many VAX/VMS systems do _not_ use at
least  one piece of  DECUS  software?   This  PD  software,  even if  not
essential,  makes  life easier  and/or  saves hours  of  work.   Software
exchange isn't going to stop now,  nor should it.   We  must be vigilant,
both for our  own  safety,  and as a responsibility to colleagues on  the
network.   We must make  all reasonable efforts to check before executing
software ourselves or posting it to the net -  or making it available for
FTP or putting it  on a BITNET LISTSERV.   CHRISTMA EXEC comes but once a
year, but a virus can be forever.
 
     Comments from the Info-VAX gurus would be appreciated.  What are the
guidelines for "safe  software exchange"?   What are  the best methods of
checking software for viral  contamination,  granted that we are going to
continue to exchange it?

I am the systems administrator at a small software company here in Houston.
(Actually, we're right next door to NASA-JSC and in the McDAC building. 
Anyway...)
McDAC is very, very, very security conscious.  Armed guards and the like.
"Of course", you say, "it is because they deal in the highest of high
technology and in matters of national security."

I work for a small banking software company, Integrated BancSystems,
housed in the same building.  We develop software that deals "only" 
with things like loans, customer accounts, bank customer lists, etc.

Part of our product line is geared towards the latest fad (buzzword?):
LAN's.  PC clone LANS, to boot.

Before we got our LAN for development, we developed on UNIX systems, which
I felt were secure enough for our purposes.  Banks aren't a national security
problem, so they shouldn't require the high standards of security that our
upstairs neighbors have to take.  The LAN's based on IBM PC compatible
computers (Novell SFT II v2.0a in particular) have just blown a huge,
gaping hole in the side of banking security.
I have no particular problem with Novell, and feel that they are
representative of the state of technology in PC compatible based
LAN's.

Point by point:
1.  Passwords are not stored in an encrypted form.  Any person that gains
    the "supervisor" password, or has his "security equivalance" (sic)
    raised to "supervisor"; can go into the "syscon" utility, pick
    "User Information", pick a user's login name, and then pick
    "Password".  Voila'!  The user's password, in ascii, for all to see.
    (A friend claims he has broken the protection scheme that is used to
    write them to the file server's hard-drive, but I have yet to see
    him prove this on my system.)
    [Again, other than this (rather glaring) problem, I think Novell has
      done a rather fine job of making PC clones usable (to some limited
      degree. :-) ) ]

2.  Software products sold to banks are quite often very insecure.
    I feel this is a very important issue that Data Processing managers
    should look into. (Are they still called that in other businesses?)
    An example:
    The SMART software system -- an integrated package of "Spreadsheet",
    "Communications manager", "Time manager", "Database manager", and
    "Wordprocessor" -- advertises "personal file protection".  There
    are several problems with their implementaion of this idea.
    1.  Only wordprocessor files are actually encrypted with any
        sort of encryption algorithim.
        The spreadsheet files have their password stored within
        the first 256 bytes of text. This pattern can easily be
        discoverd by encrypting a file, then "dump"ing or "debug"ing
        that file and examining what is actually written to the disk...
    --&gt; Or you can just look down a couple of blocks, where the
        raw ascii spreadsheet is stored. &lt;--
    2.  Cursory examination shows that the password used as an
        encryption key is stored in the same way:
        within the first 256 bytes of data, in a simply permutated
        form.
    3.  [This problem is created by the user-unfriendly-ness of
        the SMART system when implemented on a LAN.  (It seems to
        have been originally written for standalone PC, and not
        modified to any great deal for LAN use.)]
        Many system administrators tend to lump all the users in
        "group" instead of "individual" directories, and then
        direct users to "password" their files.
        Reason:
        It is rather involved to set up seperate SMART working
        directories.  Each user must have his own directory of
        screen, printer, and keyboard drivers, along with 3 or 4
        parameter files, a configuration file, and several other
        miscellanious files.  This eats up i-nodes (and their
        equivalent), and takes a while to set up for a new user
        and to remove for an old user.

I feel that these two reasons are more than enough to cause concern
about bank security.
I've only been into computing on a large scale (large = bigger than
a Commodore 64) for only a year or so, and I have been able to easily
defeat the security on programs sold to us.

Disclaimer:  The problems listed above have been reported to the
  management of my company.  They agree that security is a very serious
  issue, one that should be paid a great amount of attention and time.
  Our software uses DES-style encryption in an effort to make up for
  the intrinsic weaknesses in MS-DOS / IBM-PC compatable computer
  security.

  [Hugh Miller writes about replacing human judgment with machine 
  judgment with respect to computer trading programs]
&gt;And how will we insure that such enormously complex systems
&gt;will not synergetically go plooey when pushed to their volume or price limits?

We don't.  They are self limiting much in the same way as icy roads
limit speed.  Those who exceed, die.

Even if the minute to minute trading is done using machine judgement,
the day to day, or some long term, will be done by humans, even if it
is just when to turn the machine on and off.  In the near future this
will mean trading strategies change daily and on a per company or per
trader basis.  There would be no incentive to share software as
"winning" depends on doing better than the next guy.

If a company has the resources to "plooey" the market before they suicide,
well, what keeps that company in check now?

The other day a posting included the phrase:
	"...DES - has the analysis behind the design been made public yet?"

This reminded me.  I looked into the whole DES controversy in some detail 
about a year and a half ago.  It may be out of date.  Here's a summary:

In 1973, when the NBS called for proposals for a national encryption
system, IBM's LUCIFER system was already in the final stages of development.  
It was good, by all reports so good that it upset the code-breaking side of 
the NSA.  Rather than approving LUCIFER as is, NSA modified it in several 
strange ways to create DES.

LUCIFER's key size was 128 bits; DES had a key size of only 56 bits.  
Thus, it is much more vulnerable to "brute force" attacks.  There are 
2**56 possible DES keys, and as large as this number may seem, it is tens 
of millions of times smaller than the number of possible keys in ciphers
approved for military use.

NSA's weakening of LUCIFER appears to have been deliberate.  According to
David Kahn, author of The Codebreakers, LUCIFER set off a debate within
NSA.  "The code-breaking side wanted to be sure that the code was weak
enough for the NSA to solve it when used by foreign nations and companies,"
he wrote in Foreign Affairs.  "On the other hand, the code-making side
wanted any cipher it was certifying for use by Americans to be truly 
good."  Kahn says that the resulting "bureaucratic compromise" made the key
shorter.  Alan Konheim, former manager of IBM's LUCIFER research project,
recollects, "If they [NSA] had had their way, they would have had 32
bits...I was told at one time that they wanted 40 bits, and at IBM we
agreed that 40 was not enough."

At the same time that the NSA shortened LUCIFER's key, it used classified 
criteria to redesign several numerical tables known as "substitution" or
"S" boxes.  These S boxes control permutations that are key to the DES 
algorithm, and NSA's critics have long suspected that the changes to them 
might make the system vulnerable to a "cryptoanalytic" attack.  In other 
words, the boxes might conceal a trap door.  

Despite repeated rumors, such a trap door has never been found.  However,
mathematicians have unearthed several peculiar properties in the S boxes,
properties that were not present in IBM's original design.  They have also
demonstrated the possibility of weakening the cipher by introducing hidden 
regularities into the S-boxes.  Still, no one has managed to use these 
discoveries to mount a successful cryptoanalytic attack on DES.  

The controversy over DES eventually subsided, but in late 1985 NSA suddenly, 
and gracelessly, abandoned the cipher.  Directly contradicting years of 
reassurances, Walter Dealy, then NSA's deputy director for communications 
security, told Science that he "wouldn't bet a plugged nickel on the Soviet 
Union not breaking [DES]".  People in the industry felt betrayed.  According 
to Herb Bright of Computation Planning Associates, quite an uproar ensued in 
the normally quiet halls of the American National Standards Institute when 
NSA announced new ciphers to replace DES.  

These ciphers are designed to be distributed as pre-sealed and tamper-
resistant integrated circuits.  The encryption algorithm hidden within the
chips is classified.  It remains unknown even to engineers who work with 
the chips.  Critics feel that such secrecy offers NSA the chance to build 
a real trap door into the chips.  Herb Bright: "With a hardware black box
you can describe several schemes that would be almost impossible to test 
for from the outside and could, in effect, constitute a hardware Trojan 
Horse".

My conclusion?  That NSA probably hadn't put a trap door into DES, but felt
that, what with all the heat it was taking anyways, that it might as well 
replace DES with a cipher that really did contain a trap door.  The new
cipher chips may indeed contain such a trap door, but so little is known 
about their internals that speculation has been uninteresting.

Further, it is impossible -- in principle -- for the agency to exonerate itself
from charges such as these as long as it promotes ciphers based on secrecy
rather than algorithmic inpenetrability.  Such ciphers do, I believe, exist
(I'm no expert) but that's another story.

  The following is extracted from Aviation Week and Space Technology, 
Dec 7, 1987, Vol 127, No. 23.

    "Air Force Examines Effects of Microwaves on Electronic Systems" U.s. Air
  Force Gypsy microwave device is being used to check the susceptibility of
  electronic systems to currents induced by high-power microwaves, and to
  investigate methods of increasing device efficiency.  The Air Force's
  Forecast 2 report listed high-power microwaves as a promising weapon and
  there has been interest in the subject dating back over 30 years.  Gypsy and
  other microwave devices are being managed by the Air Force Weapons Laboratory
  at Kirtland AFB, N.M., where more than 600 scientists and engineers held a
  secret conference on high-power microwave technology last December (AW&amp;ST,
  3 Nov 1986, p. 151).  Soviet physics publications also have shown an interest
  in such devices.  Gypsy can produce more than one gigawatt of power in short
  pulses at several percent efficiency and can be tuned over 0.8 - 40 GHZ. 
  Gypsy uses the virtual cathode oscilator (VIRCATOR) principle, under which an
  electron beam penetrates an anode mesh with a current density greater than
  the space charge limiting value.  The high negative charge beyond the anode
  represents a virtual cathode, in which the electrons bunch in phase and
  oscillate at stable frequencies.  "

I am a bit skeptical of American Express' verification methods, also.
Recently I decided that my AmEx plate was in sorry shape and I phoned
their toll-free customer service number to arrange for a new one.
After I made my request clear, I was transferred to another CSR who
asked me two questions (what SS# I put on my application, and
something else that I don't recall offhand now).  After I answered the
questions, I  was told that my replacement (new) card would arrive in
ten days (it arrived in three days).  

Does this mean that anyone who knows a bit about me can get my AmEx
plate, too?  Scary ...

Almost everyone who has talked about the question of "Why do stores want my
phone number on the charge slip?" have clearly never worked in retail sales
before ... something *always* goes wrong, and a phone number is a quick way for
the store to contact you.  Sure, MasterCard doesn't require it, but remember
we're talking about (often) fast transactions by people who are paid very
little to make sure details are correct.  I have been called at least a half a
dozen times to correct mistakes on those little charge slips.  It has saved me
lots of time later when I would have had to correct the mistake with the VISA
or MasterCard company when my memory of the incident and my receipts were long
gone.  I wish they didn't put my number on the same piece of paper as my
account number, but i'm glad they were able to get a hold of me.

&gt;Organizations try circuitous ways to get the SSN.  For example, when one
&gt;gets or renews a driver license in California, he finds a place for
&gt;inserting the SSN but without explanation....

I just had my passport renewed.  On the renewal form, was a space for SSNs,
with the word "optional" in parentheses under the slot -- but the word had
been crossed out in pen.  I asked the (post office) clerk why, and he told
me that giving my SSN was no longer optional.  I assume that most people stop
asking questions after such a response, but I went on.  I asked if the SSN
was essential to receiving my passport, and the clerk said no!  He said that
if I did not put my SSN on the form, I would still get my passport, but that
the IRS would charge me a $5 penalty on my income tax returns.

Was the clerk making all of this up?  The whole thing sounds very strange.
Or does any or all of his story have a basis in fact?  I decided not to put
my SSN on the form, although if I was in a hurry to get the passport and
worried about delays, I might have included it to be sure the passport arrived.
The passport arrived about two-three weeks later, as expected, with no delays
and no warning about any future penalties.  Does anyone have an explanation?

At a dinner table conversation last Saturday night, the conversation turned
Apple Macintoshes.  One novice user exclaimed how confusing the error
messages can sometimes be.  She explained that the first time she'd crashed
her MAC and saw the dialog box containing the bomb icon she'd rushed out of
the room, fearing an imminent explosion.  "It was the little sparks coming
from the wick of the bomb that really convinced me of the danger."

I doubt WYSIWYG was meant to be interpreted so literally.

The era of the-24 hour electronic bank teller seems to introduced a new twist
into robberies.  According to various news stories appearing in New York
newspapers today, the body of a 66-year old doctor, Dr. Esther Lim, was found
in Brooklyn.  An article in today's New York Newsday by Bob Liff quotes an
unidentified ranking police investigator as saying, "She was serverely beaten
over a period of time.  It appears that they were trying to get information out
of her.  We're looking at the assumption that it was the secret code to her
bank account."

The article goes on to say, "Investigators suspect that the two men had staked
out the money machine and picked out Lim as a target for robbery, thinking she
had more than the $50 that bank records revealed she had withdrawn."

"They may have attempted to take the [ATM] code fom her," [Police Captain]
Flinn said.  "She only had $50.  Obviously you can get a lot more money
than that from the bank."

Some time ago, there was a discussion in this forum about changes being made
without anyone being told, e.g. floating-point arithmetic being done by
software instead of in hardware if the floating-point hardware is broken.

Optimising compilers often make very clever changes to the object code they
produce in order to make the compiled code faster or smaller.  One common
optimisation which makes the code smaller is to remove unreachable code.  Has
anyone wished that the optimiser had told him/her that a large chunk of a
program was unreachable when the fact that it was unreachable was due to a
fault in the program?

Does anyone wish optimisers were more forthcoming about the changes they make?

Australia recently flirted with, then dropped, an idea something like this.
The card itself was not to be "smart," at least not at first, but was supposed
to be a general identifier to be used in most interactions between individuals
and government.  The "Australian Card" scheme got as far as a publicity
campaign run by an advertising agency, with glossy brochures and mocked-up
cards for the press.  The Australian Senate killed the scheme.  The story is
told in Roger Clarke, "Just Another Piece of Plastic For Your Wallet: The
'Australian Card' Scheme," COMPUTERS AND SOCIETY 18(1) 7-21, Jan. 1988.
COMPUTERS AND SOCIETY is the journal of the ACM SIG on Computers and Society
(ACM/SIGCAS).

	"So far there has been no real rationale for Congress to
	consider [a national identity card], but the recent immigration
	law, which imposes fines on employers for hiring undocumented
	workers, will create a nation-wide constituency pressing for
	some reliable form of citizenship identification."

If an employer has made a reasonable effort to verify an applicant's
right to work (birth certificate or I-9 form), they are in no danger if
the applicant turns out to have used forged documents.  This just
happened in Oregon; an African national was hauled off from his
janitorial job for using a forged I-9 (he faces a possible *20 years*
in prison) and nothing happened to the employer.  Under current law,
employers have no strong need to see a national identity card, so I
don't think this nationwide constituency will form.

	"Imagine if you will, a clerk on the premises Sunday afternoon.
	He is only paid $30,000 a year or so, and an alarm is noted on
	his console or terminal.  He picks up a hand held cellular
	phone, walks into the room down the hall, sees smoke and grabs
	the Halon cannister from the wall. On the phone he dials 911 to
	tell them. He starts spraying the Halon, and likely gets the
	fire out before the firemen arrive. Then he calls a couple
	other numbers on the phone to key employees to get the word
	out: get over here fast."

Now imagine another scenario.  The clerk dials 911 but nothing happens;
cellular service has already been disrupted by the fire (as in fact it
eventually was at Hinsdale).  A ceiling caves in, or she's overcome by
toxic fumes, and she succumbs.  A few months later, her family files a
multi-zillion dollar lawsuit against the telco.

Proper disaster planning eschews best-case scenarios.

&gt; Even assuming a day shift at all offices, another 3 shifts are required
&gt; to cover the remainder of the week...

Actually it's worse than that.  4 shifts aren't quite enough for a 168-hour
week, even before you allow for vacations, sick leave, and the inconvenient
fact that humans need to sleep roughly the same 8 hours in every 24 and
can't be rescheduled daily.  The standard rule of thumb for all-hours jobs
like police is that filling one 24-hour 7-day position requires hiring five
full-time people.

In connection with the Hinsdale Fire discussion, Chris Maltby writes:

   `What no-one is talking about ... is whether society (i.e. government)
    has a role in ensuring adequate redundancy in as important a strategic 
    network as the telephone system. ... The decision to route all the
    trunks through the same building is ... a typical commercial decision.'

When analysing the missing redundancy in the (government department) `Deutsche
Bundes-Post', I have severe doubts that government agencies provide less risky
behaviour than commercially competing (and thus cost-minimizing) enterprises.
It seems more probable that *big* organisations (of `society' or as
economically competing entities) behave less adaptive and thereby more risky
than smaller, decentralised organisations.

The German lesson: our DATEX-P network (a packet-switched DATa EXchange system)
has only on central communications controller per (usually metropolitan) area.
Though dataflows may be re-routed between the node systems, intra-areal
communication as well as entry into and exit from such an area is *controlled
by a single control system*. Despite many discussions and arguments (of
influential managers as well as computer security experts), the Post office
managers argue that today, redundancy does not pay (a typical *commercial*
argument). They simply hope (and wait) for better redundancy when ISDN services
are implemented.

Apart from central control over large, well protected databanks, I think that
decentralised systems provide for more effective, less expensive systems. Such
an organisation is independent of `society' (and also of government
organisation).

Unix is not friendly - let's face it.  However, the true RISK is not in the
unfriendliness,  but in the wanton use of root privileges!  Peter Rowell
shows a wonderful (sorry about that) example of this.

	Rule number 1:  Don't use "root" unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.
	Rule number 2:  When necessary, be DAMNED careful.
	Rule number 3:  When the slightest bit in doubt, don't use "root".

Dumps should be run as "sys", or some other non-priv userID.  Disks should
be owned by "sys", and protected r--r--r--.  This way, you can only write to
them when you make a conscious decision to do so.  When doing a restore,
either manually change the protection on the SPECIFIC disk, or run as root
(since root automatically gets write permission).  However, "root" should
only be used to restore (not to dump), and then only if you TRIPLE check your
command line.

As to your specific problem - agreed, dump should check for bogus arguments.
"/dev/rmtxx" should not have been accepted as a numeric argument.  However,
there are times when you want to dump TO a disk device (i.e. if you are
dumping to a WORM device).  Agreed, though, "default" disks and tape units
should be eliminated, or at least configurable on a per-system basis.

However, you should not have been running as "root" in the first place.  Far
too many system administrators become enthralled with the power, and forget
the RISKS.  Most system administration tasks can be accomplished with a
non-priv UID, with the system still being secure.  Doing things from a
non-priv account will cause some initial conversion headaches, but will save
you from the BIG headaches when you make a small, 1 character error later on.
In the cited example, the worst that would have happened would have been an
error message "can't write to /dev/...", when dump failed to clobber your
disk partition due to the file protection bits.

Welcome to Volume 7!  There have been 472 RISKS issues in the past 35 months.
However, the number of contributions has been expanding dramatically of late
as RISKS goes further out into the internet.  (I note the big increase in
messages from Australia!)  (Countering that somewhat is the appearance of
specialized groups, such as VIRUS-L.)  To prevent RISKS readers from being
totally inundated with the deluge, the proportion of messages emerging from
my pipeline has been dwindling somewhat of late -- as I sharpen my
interpretation of the above guidelines.  (Apologies to those of you who did
not get any response at all -- if you feel that your contribution was of
PARTICULARLY BURNING INTEREST and that I might have missed it or not gotten
it, please resubmit with a note -- or think about refining it.)  By the way,
RISKS production will have to slow down a little during June, because of my
schedule; so, be patient.  Maybe with school recesses, discussion will slow
down also.  But the world never rests, and we can assume that there will be
a few stellar cases of interest to RISKS.  PGN

As one of the culprits who found this feature in Erik Fair's *.test
message bouncer program,  I'd like to mention a couple of ways to protect
yourself (by the way, yes, it was an accident).

What is a *.test message bouncer?  If a user posts a message to "misc.test"
or "alt.test" this bouncer program will mail the posted message back to the
user.  This is often used by sites to determine if their news feeds are
making it out to the backbone (or, as in our case, to gather statistics
to determine the best news propigation path).

The symptom is that this one particular (the most popular) message bouncer
will send mail to every address on every From: line in the message.  This
includes From: lines in the message body.  Now that this feature has been
widely publicised in the "news.admin" newsgroup,  the best step is to warn
everyone before some net-terrorist decides to cause real havoc.

The message that caused the recent problems on the net had two features which,
when combined, resulted in a mess.
	(1) the message had 109 From: lines in the body
	(2) it was a large ~62k message

What happened?  Every site that had the message bouncer installed sent
out 109 62k mail messages.  Also, many of these mail messages failed because
of a bad address.  This lead to them to be bounced back to the originating
site (the one with the bouncer) to end up in the inbox of the Postmaster.
Needless to say, many sites had their spool partitions and usr partitions
filled to capacity within minutes of receiving that message.  Also, there
was a significant jump in uucp and Internet traffic (painfully expensive
to long distance uucp sites).

How can you protect yourself?  If you're not running Erik's program, you
are likely to be safe (check anyway to see if it has these same "features").
Modify your message bouncer to:
	(a) Send a reply to one "Reply-To:" or "From:" address (the
	    first From: address in the header seems logical to me).
	(b) Don't send the entire message back, just the original header
	    and a note saying "we got your message".

I just returned from attending the IFIP/SEC-88 conference on the Gold
Coast of Australia.  It's a meeting that addresses protection of
information systems in the broadest context.  SEC-88 is the 5th in a
series of roughly annual meetings, and is sponsored by TC-11, a technical
committee of IFIP -- approximately the international analog of AFIPS.

In addition to doing a keynote talk on "Perspectives on Trusted Systems", one
of the fun things for me was to participate in an evening public forum on
social aspects of computer technology.  In addition to myself, there were on
the platform an Australian computer expert (who organized the conference) and
two Australian politicians -- one a regional official of the Labor Party and
the other, a present conservative Member of Parliament.

I had been cautioned that the subject would almost certainly center around
the Australian ID card exclusively, and it did.  By the by, the story that
was told to me, and verified by something that I read down there, was that
the only reason that the legislation did not go into effect earlier was
that it contained a technical flaw; namely, in the haste of getting it
ready, a switch-on date was inadvertently omitted from the law.  This fact
came from a prominent member of the Australian Computer Society.

The argument that developed during the evening -- and it apparently is the
nub of the Labor Party position -- is that Australia has too much tax
fraud [sic] and that the ID card is the answer.  It seemed to me that the
proper word was "tax evasion."

It seems that the Laborites feel that too much income is escaping the tax
authority, and that it should be collected to make more revenue available
for social and other programs.  Obviously what Australia wants to do is
corral the taxpayer, as the IRS does with its Taxpayer ID; Australia wants
to be able to do the analog of tracking supplementary money flows as
reported on the various form 1099s and similar documents here.

Other than the tax-related matter, no other argument was given for the
institution of a universal ID card and number.

There was an amusing comment from the floor.  A member of the Swedish
delegation pointed out that Sweden has had a population register for
decades, if not centuries, and Sweden has substantial tax fraud still.

My concluding comment was to point out to the Labor person that it seemed
to me that he had a solution in search of a problem.  In the best
system-analysis tradition, I observed that the tax problem could very well
be real, but that it looked as though it had been assumed that a universal
ID was *THE* answer.  There clearly are other answers and the government
ought to do a more careful analysis of alternatives.  Something in the
spirit of the US/IRS arrangement would meet their tax needs, without
subjecting the Australian population to all the RISKS associated with a
genuine universal personal ID.

The whole thing was covered by a TV crew whose interviewer chaired the
session.  I was told that a lot of air coverage was given to the occasion
the following night, but I did not see it.

There seem to other RISKS in the Southern Hemisphere also; there has to be
one somewhere in the following story.  En route, I read an Auckland, NZ
newspaper which reported a cable car incident.  The Auckland cars are not
in the spirit of the San Francisco ones but evidently more like an
inclined railway running up and down a steep street in a more or less
straight line.

Seems as though a cable car had crashed into a bumper at the end of the line
with some injuries, but the RISK content is in the final words of the article:

     "The City Council had just spend [NZ]$90,000 
     reprogramming the onboard computer."

From the _Washington_Post_, 31 May 1988, page D-1 (without permission, of
course) comes the following article (credited to _Newsday_):

TEXAS TO HOLD A LANDMARK TRIAL ON COMPUTER TAMPERING BY 'VIRUS'

Texas prosecutors are preparing to go to trial in one of the first criminal
cases in the nation involving spohisticated tampering with a computer's
programming.

Donald Gene Burleson, a 39-year-year-old Fort Worth programmer, has pleaded
innocent to charges of computer sabotage and burglary involving the USPA
and IRA, Co., a Fort Worth-based insurance and securities concern.  He is
free on $3,000 bail pending a July 11 trial.

Burleson has lost a civil action in connection with the alleged 1985
computer tampering, and has been ordered to pay USPA about $12,000 in damages
and interest.

Prosecutors charge that after being fired in September 1985, Burleson deleted
records of thousands of sales commissions owed USPA employees from the
company's computer system, and also introduced into the system a hidden
program that would erase such data in the future.

Davis McCown, head of the Tarrant County district attorney's economic crimes
division, said in an interview last week that  the program "had the ability
to move through the [computer system], to change its name and to relocate."

[discussion of Trojan horses and viruses (virii?)]

[...] Burleson denied the charges and [said] that the company is blaming him
for someone else's actions.

"They really have no proof," [his lawyer] said.  "Anybody could have done
the deletions" from the commission payment records.

Subject: How did this program burn out two monitors?
Organization: University of California, Berkeley

I recently compiled a program that is supposed to do graphics on a Hercules
graphics adapter.  I've used a similar routine before, and I would have
sworn there was nothing wrong with the software.  Maybe the files got
corrupted.  When I ran the .exe file, my monitor made a high-pitched whine,
then the power light went off, and a crackling noise came out of the back
until I pulled the power cord.  Curious about whether this was a
coincidence, I took the program to work and tried it on an extra monitor I
had there.  The second monitor burned out too! I thought it was impossible
to damage my monitor and adapter with software.  Does anybody have any ideas
what caused this?  I'll post the .exe file and source (in C) to any brave or
curious souls who request them.

The hardware:
	1st time:  homebrew PC clone with generic Hercules clone card
		   Quimax DM-15 amber monitor.

	2nd time:  Leading Edge Model D, "turbo" with built in
		   Hercules compatible adapter, Quimax DM-14
		   amber monitor (an earlier version of the DM-15).

Neither video adapter was damaged.  Both monitors are DEAD.

       This is an old known bug.  You can burn out the IBM monochrome
monitor by stopping the horizontal sweep while keeping everything else
running, and the Hercules card gives you enough control to do this under
software control.  The video chip lets you select the horizontal and
vertical sweep rates independently, and zero rates are possible.  However,
the horizontal sweep is used as the oscillator for a switching power supply,
as is typical in TV circuits, and with the sweep rate at 0, DC flows through
a coil with high inductance but low resistance, producing an excessive
current that burns out the coil.

       Part of the problem is that the IBM monochrome monitor is a design
lifted from an earlier, pre-PC product line, the IBM Displaywriter, and in
that product, there was no potential vulnerability of this type.

My original message to RISKS, with the copy of the Daedalus article, contained
(or more exactly, since my files do not indicate one way or the other, I
believe contained) an explanatory introduction about Daedalus, and his splendid
articles. It was not my intention to test the gullibility of the RISKS
readership!

Adding to the information that has since appeared about Daedalus:

  (i) he is, I'm pleased to say, based here in Newcastle,

  (ii) he has been claimed to be the world's most successful builder of
perpetual motion machines! (A fascinating example, whose actual method of
operation is still a matter of some mystery, is I understand in the
Ontario Science Center, and

  (iii) he was the subject of a splendid documentary on BBC TV recently,
possibly in the Horizon series, which is worth looking out for, not least
for its account of his perpetual motion machines.

  &gt; For  years  now,  we  have been told that the cashless society is
  &gt; just around the corner...

If this is the true condition of the cashless society in UK, you are
behind the Danish banks. For the last one and a half year I have been
able to do shopping and pay with my DanKort (in english: DanCard)
which is the card you receive from your bank if you want to have a
cashcard. In the Danish system all the banks has join forces and
developed a system with a card with crypt 4 digit PIN code on a
magnetic stip, a independent company runs the ATM automats, the pay
terminals in the shops etc. The system operated on high security
level; you get three attempts to enter your PIN code correct. If you
has not enter a valid code the card is automatical blocked and you
have to go to your bank, to raise the blockade. The obvious RISK in
this system is if anybody place a fraud ATM which just read the
content on the magnetic stip and the PIN code the custom taps in on
the keyboard. But at present I have not hear anybody trying this.

The Unix dump discussion illustrates having to balance two risks -- the risk of
committing errors as an all-powerful superuser, vs. the risk of having an
insecure system if access is improperly set for non-superusers.  As pointed out
by Brian Reid many months ago, giving system maintainers or administrators
special privileges, such as write permission on system directories, has its own
risks.  Unix is a complex system, and setting certain protections has
non-obvious side-effects.

For example, dvk advises that disks should be protected r--r--r--; in other
words, everyone will have read access to the raw disks.  This is equivalent to
giving EVERYBODY read access to ALL files on that disk! In some environments,
this may be ok, but other environments may want users to have some privacy.

Every site has to adopt some philosophy for dealing with Unix's all-or-nothing
approach to privileges.  I usually perform most system tasks as superuser, and
after a long (and sometimes painful) learning process, I'm now careful enough
not to destroy anything.

   Dumps should be run as "sys", or some other non-priv userID.  Disks should
   be owned by "sys", and protected r--r--r--.  

Actually, r-------- is more appropriate... otherwise anyone who can
get to /dev (which should be *anyone* since /dev/null is in there) can
read the entire mounted disk, violating any security the filesystem
was meant to offer. Running a debugger with macros for opening up the
file system structure makes it easy to find files by hand...

This message gives some very sound advice; one can, and should, avoid root
privileges if at all possible with UNIX.  [... comment on  r--r--r-- ...]

There are also problems with doing system administration as someone other than
root in a networked environment.  Lots of people have their own workstations
and can configure them any way they like, pretending to be any user who might
have interesting privileges, like "sys".  Sun's current version of NFS does not
perform any serious validation, so if you export a filesystem to my workstation
via NFS, I can read and write any file on it simply by setting up an account on
my workstation with the appropriate user-ID.  The only exception to this is
root: an NFS client is never granted root privileges by an NFS server.  So
there may be reasons why some things HAVE to be owned by root, even when it
would be better to avoid it, thanks to NFS.  (Sun OS 4.0 apparently fixes this
problem.)  In this specific case, I don't think device files can be accessed
under NFS (and you don't need to make the root filesystem exportable anyway),
but anyone trying this kind of thing should be aware of the general problem.

The following message is intended to serve as a response to the comments by
Nancy Leveson et al. (in <A HREF="/Risks/7.84.html">RISKS-7.84</A>) on our original brief message in
<A HREF="/Risks/7.61.html">RISKS-7.61</A> about Fetzer's paper.  It is extracted from a much more detailed
statement that will appear in the Communications of the ACM.

The furore that the article has aroused in the program verification community
has caused us to go back and re-read Fetzer's paper more carefully, to see
whether it really deserves the opprobrium which the program verification
community has been heaping on it.  Part of the problem seems to us to be the
(unfortunately justifiable) fear that the paper will be misinterpreted by
laymen, particularly those involved in research funding.  We have good reason
to sympathise with such reactions, given the misunderstandings that arose in
some quarters from the Knight and Leveson paper on design diversity.  Indeed,
both papers demonstrate the care that needs to be taken in assessing how
different readerships will react to one's writings.  However we now believe
that there are also significant philosophical issues underlying the present
debate, which is not helped by the terms in which some of the reactions have
been couched.  [In our CACM paper, we go on and analyze one such issue, that
caused by the difference between explanatory and evidential reasoning.]

In essence our view is that the dispute has arisen as a discrepancy between
the program verification community's view of their practice and objectives on
the one hand, and the outside world's view of those objectives on the other. 
It is in fact a public image problem, and public image is not to be corrected
simply by the writing of intemperate letters.  We suspect that a major
underlying reason for the undesired image is that there has been a good
measure of overselling of the concepts.  (This is not of course the first
occurrence of this practice in computer science, nor will it be the last.) A
recent and all too clear example of this overselling can be seen, in the case
of hardware verification, by contrasting exaggerated advertising claims for
the VIPER microprocessor (e.g.  "VIPER is the first commercially available
microprocessor with both a formal specification and a proof that the chip
conforms to it") with the careful and balanced discussion, in Avra Cohn's
report on her (very impressive) work on formal verification of the VIPER
`block model', of what was actually proven, and what was out of scope of the
proving techniques.  (The above advertisement is in fact quoted by Cohn, who
rightly goes on to state that "such assertions, taken as assurances of the
impossibility of design failure in safety-critical applications, could have
catastrophic results".)

If our belief that formal verification has been oversold is correct, then
articles such as `Program Verification - The Very Idea', misconceived though
we now accept it undoubtedly is, might be seen in the longer term as
providing a stimulus for a strategy of corrective measures necessary to
counter the false sense of security that is, we fear, all too commonly
promoted by vendors of verification technology and/or verified programs. 

Finally, to avoid any misunderstanding as to our own views, let us make it
clear that we in no way dispute that program verification can have a
significant role to play in the vital task of clarifying specifications and
removing design faults. That, however, is not the issue.

    From: Henry Cox  &lt;cox@spock.ee.mcgill.ca&gt;
    Subject: Supercomputer used to "solve" math problem

    [ Article about use of computer search to demonstrate the non-existence
    of a "projective plane of order 10 deleted. -- drw]

    The RISKS are obvious. The willingness of people to accept a computer's 
    answer on faith (whether at the cash register at the grocery store or in
    the university environment) remains disturbing.  		 Henry Cox

This is replaying a dispute that arose when the Four-Color Problem was solved
via computer search -- If no human mind has comprehended the proof, has it
truly been proved?  In the case of the Four-Color Problem, it is generally
believed to be true, since other people (independently) wrote programs to check
the solution.

However, from a broader perspective, this is ignoring the fact that many
published mathematical proofs have significant errors in them, and not
infrequently turn out to be "proving" entirely false statements.  For instance
there is a famous theorem whose proof was 300 pages long, in which 100 or so
errors have been found (and corrected).  Consider how many errors are probably
in the proof of the Simple Group Theorem, which is a compendium of papers by
100 or so mathematicians, totalling about 2000 pages.

In cases not involving humans, no one would say "The willingness of people to
accept other people's answers on faith remains disturbing" -- after all, we
can't re-prove *everything* we read.  When computers are involved, often the
disturbing change is not that we take *more* on faith, but that it becomes *so
obvious* we take things on faith.

Similarly, when a human controller screws up and causes a train collision, we
consider this an unfortunate accident.  When a computer control does the same,
we wonder why people would rely on computers...

Personally, I'd rather depend on the cash register to do the addition than the
minimum-wage clerk operating it.

There has been some discussion in RISKS recently about what action universities
might appropriately take to instill a sense of ethics in the use of computers
by their students.  M.I.T.'s Project Athena provides some 800 networked
engineering workstations for undergraduates to use in any way they find helpful
to their education.  Accordingly, Project Athena has assumed that one of its
responsibilities is to open a discussion of ethical use with its user
community.  The primary action that Project Athena has taken is the publication
of a set of principles, a copy of the current version of which is attached.

These principles are for the most part general, following M.I.T.'s usual
approach of appealing to basic concepts rather than spelling out many detailed
rules.  There is no claim that publicizing these principles completely solves
any problem nor that it completely answers any question, but it does represent
one organization's attempt to take a step in the right direction.  Some version
of these principles has been posted for about four years, and whenever we have
an incident serious enough to ask a student to talk to the Director, these
principles have provided a very useful starting point for the conversation.

                                         Jerry Saltzer

     ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- 

Principles Of Responsible Use Of Project Athena

  Project Athena is M.I.T.'s computing facility for education.  It consists of
a networked system of workstations and services, and includes communication
features that offer many opportunities for members of the M.I.T. community to
share information.  With that ability to share comes the responsibility to use
the system in accordance with M.I.T.'s standards of honesty and personal
conduct.  Those standards, outlined in the M.I.T. Bulletin under Academic
Procedures, call for all members of the community to act in a responsible,
ethical, and professional way.  This note offers guidelines in applying those
standards to use of Project Athena facilities.

INTENDED USE

  The hardware granted to Project Athena, and the software licensed for that
hardware, are intended for educational use, broadly construed, by members of
the M.I.T. community.  Use of Athena resources by anyone outside M.I.T.
requires approval of the Provost, and the sale of such use is improper.  The
use of Athena resources for immediate financial gain is similarly improper.
Use of Project Athena's facilities for sponsored research activities that
normally would make use of other M.I.T. facilities requires specific
authorization of the Director.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

  The operating systems used by Project Athena encourage sharing of
information.  Security mechanisms for protecting information from unintended
access, from within the system or from the outside, are minimal.  These
mechanisms, by themselves, are not sufficient for a large community in which
protection of individual privacy is as important as sharing.  Users must
supplement the system's security mechanisms by using the system in a manner
that preserves the privacy of others.

  For example, users should not attempt to gain access to the files or
directories of another user without clear authorization from the other user
(typically that authorization is expressed by setting file access permissions
to allow public or group reading).  Nor should users attempt to intercept any
network communications, such as electronic mail or user-to-user dialog.  A
shared program should not secretly collect information about its users.
Personal information about individuals, which a user would not normally
disseminate, should not be stored or communicated on the system.  Examples of
such personal information are grades or letters of recommendation.

SYSTEM INTEGRITY

  Actions taken by users intentionally to interfere with or to alter the
integrity of the system are out of bounds.  Such actions include unauthorized
use of accounts, impersonation of other individuals in communications, attempts
to capture or crack passwords or encryption, and destruction or alteration of
data or programs belonging to other users.  Equally unacceptable are
intentional efforts to restrict or deny access by legitimate users to the
system.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

  Some software and data that reside on the system are owned by users or third
parties, and are protected by copyright and other laws, together with licenses
and other contractual agreements.  Users must abide by these restrictions.
Such restrictions may include prohibitions against copying programs or data for
use on non-Athena systems or for distribution outside M.I.T., against the
resale of data or programs or the use of them for noneducational purposes or
for financial gain, and against public disclosure of information about programs
(e.g., source code) without the owner's authorization.  It is the
responsibility of the owner of protected software or data to make any such
restrictions known to the user.

There are still many would-be contributions in the RISKS pipeline on the
general topic of computer misuse.  Some reiterate points already made several
times before.  Others elaborate on relatively minor points.  Thus, I have been
a more rigorous enforcer of the RISKS guidelines than usual on this topic --
hopefully without unbalancing the representativity of the dialogue.  I am
grateful to Jerry for providing a general, principled view of part of the
problem.

The bottom line is that responsibility is of necessity widely distributed.  We
certainly need better ethics and better laws, and better teaching of their
implications.  We also need a society that respects them.  But our society
needs much more that that; those of us who look at the world only from the
vantage point of our computers are missing much.  (I say this not just in the
spirit of the season.)

Unfortunately, reality suggests that even the best ethics and laws will be
violated by people responding to misplaced incentives (financial or otherwise).
(The drug situation and insider trading are two examples that are difficult to
combat with ethics and laws alone.  They are deep social problems.  And hacking
can certainly become a social disease!) Thus, we also need computer systems
that can enforce security and integrity much more thoroughly, and we need those
systems to be administered and used intelligently.  (That already may be
expecting too much.)  But by now it is generally realized that we cannot depend
only on computer security controls -- there are just too many ways to break
them in the systems that we must use.

So, to end the soap-box for this year, security, integrity, software safety
and system safety (e.g., in the sense of Nancy Leveson, Avra Cohn, and
others) are system-wide (and network-wide) concepts.  There are many
life-critical or other critical applications in which we must rely on both
people and technology (especially computers) to perform properly (i.e.,
within tolerances); as we have seen in many cases discussed in RISKS,
deviations may result in catastrophes that are unacceptable to the affected
individuals, if not to society as a whole.  This applies to disastrous
design flaws, programming errors, acts of God, and many other problems in
addition to intentional system misuse.  One rotten apple (human or
technological) can spoil the barrel.  The message for RISKS readers is once
again that we must never blindly trust that computers and people will always
do the right thing, and that we must plan accordingly.  The problems require
a comprehensive approach.  If the real risks (as opposed to the perceived
risks) are too great, then we had better rethink the use of computers in
those applications.  But let's honestly address the REAL RISKS.

Happy holidays!  Peter

Congressman Les Aspin (D - Wis.) is the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee.  In an op-ed piece in the 28 Dec 88 'Los Angeles Times,' he writes
about the rarity of naval combat and about needed improvements in the Navy's
training, screening, and scheduling.  To make his case, he tells details from
the Vincennes' shootdown of an Iranian commercial jet last July:

  The crew was green when the battle began.  And it showed.  Despite all
  the training that the crew of the Vincennes received, the reality of 
  battle was something new and nerve-racking.  We can tell how nerve-
  racking it was from the unique electronic record kept by the Aegis 
  system aboard the Vincennes.  It recorded such details as the precise
  moment in which every button was touched and every toggle switched in
  the Vincennes' command center.
  
  Because of this record, we know that one officer, who was prompted by
  the computer to "select weapon system" as the countdown to the destruction
  of the Airbus began, hit the wrong buttons five times before he realized
  that he was supposed to select a weapon.  And we also know that another
  member of the Vincennes' crew was so agitated that he got ahead of the
  firing sequence and pushed another button 23 times before it was an
  appropriate part of the procedure.
  
  I don't recount these errors to pick on the crew.  I recount them because
  I believe that they much be considered the norm when inexperienced
  humans face a sudden stressful encounter.....

I found the following quote in the journal of Soren Kierkegaard for 1850.  As
this is the time of year we traditionally form our resolutions for the next, I
thought it might be helpful for us on the RISKS list to bung this into the
hopper for consideration.  The really good ideas never die; they just change
examples.

  "It is the old story.  A discovery is made--the human race triumphs;
  enthusiastically everything, everything is set going to perfect the
  discovery more and more.  The human race is jubilant and worships itself.
  At long last there comes a halt--man pauses and asks: is this discovery
  really a boon, especially the extraordinary perfection of it that has been
  achieved! Then a new call goes out for the most eminent heads, and they
  torture their brains almost to madness to find safety-valves, dampers,
  clogs, etc. in order, if possible, to put a brake on, to prevent this
  matchless and matchlessly perfected discovery, the pride of the human race,
  from riding roughshod over the whole world and destroying it.  Consider,
  for instance, the invention of the printing press, perfected to a top-speed
  machine sure to guarantee that no dirt or dregs remain unpublished."

A Happy and Safe 1989 to everyone!  Hugh Miller University of Toronto

In January 1988, Riverside, CA coroner's deputies obtained a warrant
to seize all the computers at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.
This was done in connection with the widely reported cryonic
suspension of 83-year-old Dora Kent.  The coroner accused the Alcor
staff of murder, arguing that the cryonics procedure, where life
support and anesthesia/cooling is applied after legal death, is
murder, because resuscitation technology is applied without the intent
to revive the patient.

The deputies took six or seven computers ranging from an Apple II to
an Amiga, and have held them for the last 11 months.

Only one of these had a hard disk, so there wasn't much they
could get out of the computers anyway.  However, they did succeed
in making it much more difficult for Alcor to conduct business.

The computer with the hard disk was being used as a bulletin board.
Some 50 to 100 people had correspondence on the machine.  No warrants,
not even any "John Doe" warrants, were issued which would permit the
coroners, DAs, or the Riverside Police Department to access these
electronic communications in storage under the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act.  The ECPA requires that the particular
people whose communication is to be seized be named in the warrant,
similar to the warrants required to seize a person's postal mail.
This search warrant specified that "all electronic storage devices...
and the complete hardware necessary to retrieve electronic data" be
confiscated, not even naming Alcor, but simply giving the address of
their office.

Keith Henson (best known for founding the L5 Society, which encourages
the exploration of outer space) was one of the people whose email was
confiscated.  He complained to the FBI about his email being taken
without a warrant last April.  The FBI Riverside office inquired of
the US Attorney's office as to their interest in email, and, on
getting a "not interested," declined to investigate.  Henson tried
through his congressional representatives to get enforcement action
out of the Federal government against the various local law
enforcement agencies who had taken his email.

Finally, becoming convinced that this route was ineffective, Henson
and two other bbs users filed suit against the US Attorney's office
and the FBI.  One of the bbs users, Roger Gregory, is well known for
guiding project Xanadu, the proposed hypertext library system; the
other, Thomas Donaldson, has contributed two science fact articles to
Analog magazine in the last year.  The suit, "Complaint for
Declaratory Judgement" number C 88 20788, was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California on December 9,
1988.

The crux of the matter is whether the ECPA prevents electronic mail
from being read if the entire computer containing the mail is seized
under a warrant.  If this is held true, the ECPA provides little or no
actual protection.  Consider the non-electronic or real-time
analogies; can a warrant that names no names be used to seize and read
all the mail in a building providing private post office boxes?  Can a
warrant claiming that someone is doing something illegal in a
telephone company office be used to tap all the subscribers' lines
going through that office?

A complete online copy of the suit (40 kbytes) is available as email
from keith@toad.com.  He can also send out hardcopies for the disabled,
or for people whose email has been seized.  The plaintiffs are:

A follow-up story to the Kevin Mitnick case [see RISKS 7.95] in the 'Los
Angeles Times' 24 Dec 88 says the federal magistrate refused to release Mitnick
on bail 23 Dec 88

  after prosecutors revealed new evidence that Mitnick penetrated a 
  National Security Agency computer and may have planted a false story 
  on a financial news wire....
  
  Investigators believe that Mitnick may have been the instigator of a
  false report released by a news service in April that Security Pacific
  National Bank lost $400 million in the first quarter of 1988.  The 
  report, which was released to the NY Stock Exchange and other wire
  services, was distributed four days after Mitnick had been turned 
  down for a job at Security Pacific [after the bank learned he had
  lied on a job application about his past criminal record]....  The 
  false information could have caused huge losses for the bank had it
  reached investors, but the hoax was uncovered before that could happen.
  
  The prosecutor said Mitnick also penetrated a NSA computer and obtained
  telephone billing data for the agency and several of its employees....
  
  [In refusing bail, the magistrate said,] "I don't think there's any
  conditions the court could set up based upon which the court would
  be convinced that the defendant would be anything other than a danger
  to the community.... It sounds like the defendant could commit major
  crimes no matter where he is."
  
  Mitnick's attorney said prosecutors have no evidence for the new
  accusations....

Re:    Observing Chaos Communication Congress 1988, Hamburg
       (`From Threat to Alternative Networks')
Date:  January 2nd, 1989

On 28-30 December, 1988, Computer Chaos Club (CCC) held its 5th annual `Chaos
Communication Congress' at Hamburg/FRG. As in previous years, 300 people
(mainly aged 16-36, 90% male, with some visitors from Austria and The
Netherlands) gathered, carefully observed from newsmedia (German stations,
printmedia, press agencies, but also from UK's BBC, and being observed by
Business Week's Katie Hafner, who gathered material for a book on hackers,
planned by John Markoff and herself).

In the chaotic (though creative) congress `organisation', two different tracks
were visible:

   -- technical presentations on networks (UUCP, GEONET, FIDONet,
      and CCCs emerging `open networks' BTXnet and `Zerberus'),
      and on a PC-DES encryption developed by a leading CCC member
      (who had escaped the French police's arrest by travelling
      to SECURICOM by railway while police waited at the airport);
      
   -- socio-political discussions about `sociology of hackers',
      `free flow of information' as well as reports about
      recent events, dominated by the arrest of Steffen Wernery
      in Paris in spring 88 when being invited to speak on SECURICOM.

The technical presentations were of mixed quality. The PC-DES program
(evidently written under the experience of several `visits' of German criminal
police on search for convicting material in cases of hacker attacks) encrypts
texts with a key of 8-40 characters, with a velocity of 135 characters/second
(on a 10 MHz 80286 processor); in a demonstration, the stored `Congress report'
of 137.416 Bytes was encrypted (without prior compression) in 2:55 minutes. The
recent version (V.2.02: about 8 kByte long including about 4 kByte of
help-text) was distributed at CCCongress as `Charity-ware' (for hackers free of
charge), but will be available for commercial users from German `Security
advisor' Hans Gliss at 250 DM (about 141 Dollars at actual exchange rates).

CCC speakers reported about their work to install `free networks'.  In Germany,
most of the networks are organised in the form of a `Verein' (an association
with legal status, which guarantees tax-free operation): such networks are
access-restricted to their members. The different German science and University
networks (and their bridges to international networks) usually restrict access
to scientists. Different CCC subgroups are establishing `alternative networks',
such as `EcoNet' for communication of ecological data and information, planned
to be available, free of cost, to broader social, ecological, peace and
political groups and individuals.

Apart from traditional technologies (such as GEONET and FIDONet), the German
Post Office's Bildschirmtext (Btx) will be used as a cheap communications
medium; while CCCs first hack was, years ago, to attack the `insecure
Btx-system' (in the so-called `HASPA coup' where they misused the Btx passwork
of the Hamburg savings bank to repeatedly invoke CCC's Btx information at a
total prize of 135.000 DM, then about 50.000$), they today begin to use this
cheap though very limited medium while more powerful communications media are
available. Today, the emerging ISDN technology is verbally attacked by hackers
because of the excessive accumulation of personal data; from here, hacks may be
attempted when ISDN becomes regionally available in 1989/90.

Several speakers, educated Informaticians with grades from West German
Informatics departments, professionally work in Software production and in
selling hardware/software to economy and state agencies. Among them, several
professional UNIX and UUCP users have begun to organize CCC's future UUCP
version. Up to now, only few CCC members use (and know about) UNIX systems, but
their number may grow within the near future according to CCCs `marketing'.
One speaker told the audience `that you can remotely start programs in UUCP'.
After some learning phase, the broadened availability of UNIX in the hacker
scene may produce new threats.

The other track of the Congress discussed themes like `sociology of hackers'
where a group of politology students from Berlin's Free University analysed
whether hackers belong to the `new social movements' (e.g. groups on peace,
nuclear energy, feminist themes).  They found that, apart from much public
exaggeration ('it is not true that hackers can invade *any* computer'), hackers
are rather `unpolitical' since they are preferably interested in technology.

A major topic was `free access to/flow of information'. Under the title
'freedom of information act', speakers suggested a national legislation which
guarantees individual and group rights to inspect files and registers of
`public interest'; the discussion lacked sufficient basic knowledge, e.g. of
the respective US legislation and corresponding international discussions in
Legal Informatics.  Generally, the published results of the rich discussions
about `Social aspects of Computing', gathered in professional bodies (like ACMs
SIGCAS, IFIPs TC-9 or the German national society's FA-8, all devoted to such
themes) are evidently unknown to this scene.

Summarising the Congress and accompanying discussions, active CCC members try
hard to demonstrate that they have *no criminal goals* and ambitions (they
devoted a significant amount of energy to several press conferences, TV
discussions etc). The conference was dominated by young computer professionals
and students from the PC scene, partially with good technological knowledge of
hardware, software and networks; while some people seem to have good technical
insights in VAXsystems, knowledge of large systems seems to be minimal. To some
extent, the young professionals wish to behave as the `good old-fashioned
hackers': without criminal energy, doing interesting work of good professional
quality in networks and other new areas.

While former CCCongresses were devoted to threats like Viruses, *no explicit
discussion* was devoted *to emerging threats*, e.g. in ISDN or the broadening
use of UNIX, UUCP. The new track discussing political and social aspects of
computing follows former discussions about `hacker ethics'. Here, the
superficial, unprofessional discussions of related themes show that the young
(mainly) males are basically children of a `screen era' (TV, PCs) and of an
education which concentrates on the visible `image', rather than understanding
what is behind it.

are mainly written in German)

	Personal XXXXX's

Not many years ago, there were three kinds of typing and each sent its own
message.  Letters from a genuine V.I.P. were written on an elegant electric
typewriter, with a carbon ribbon that printed sharp black letters.  Letters
from lesser lights were written on manual machines, nicely arranged and error-
free, but distinguishable by the grainy impressions of a fabric ribbon.  Then
there were the personal letters, in which strikeovers and xxxxx's demonstrated
the exclusivity of the correspondence.

Now the word processor has erased this typology of typewriting.  The early
home printers with their coarse san-serif characters are yielding to new
machines, including laser-jet printers, that make the layman's letters look
like the elegant V.I.P. correspondence of old.

That's probably progress, but it comes at a cost.  There's no telling, any-
more, whether such a letter is personal.  Once, you could discern from the
typographical errors whether the annual chatty holiday letter was meant just
for you, or for the whole Christmas list.  Not anymore, not when home compu-
ters can "personalize" a mass mailing by changing the salutation and a tell-
tale fact or two and printing it up beautifully.

The tide of progress, in other words, sometimes flows backward.  There's
probably only one sure way now to write letters that are, and look, personal:
by hand.

	High-Tech Junk Mail

After installing a facsimile machine, many offices soon discover a byproduct
of this high-tech communications form --- junk fax mail.  When a facsimile
machine is left on, anyone with access to the machine's telephone number is
free to send documents to the machine, just as anyone with access to a postal
address can send mail there.

Now Digital Publications of Norcross, Ga., has come up with a program and a
data base that can be used with a specially equipped personal computer to send
press releases en masse by facsimile machine.  Late at night, when telephone
long-distance rates are lowest, the computer and its facsimile-machine circuit
board will automatically dial telephone numbers all over the country, sending
out press releases.

Executives of Digital Publications contend that after 11 P.M. their system can
deliver a news release for 10 cents.  They said that a news release sent
through the mail costs about 80 cents.  Mail rates keep going up, of course,
and delivery can take two or three days, or longer.

The Digital Publications system data base has 5,000 names and addresses of
newspapers, broadcast stations, trade magazines and writers.  Also --- and
this is crucial --- it has each outlet's fax number.

But the new technology must still overcome the same hurdle that confronts
the old technology of sending an envelope through the mails --- getting the
recipient to read the material.

Clive Feather, a former contributor to Risks currently off the net but "soon to
be clive@isi.co.uk", has sent me some information about the train crash at
Clapham Junction in London last month.  I have posted a longer version to
Usenet's rec.railroad, but here's the meat.

Clive writes:

#  The BR internal enquiry found that there were no faults in the
#  signalling equipment as such, but a member of the S&amp;T [Signals and
#  Telecommunications] department had failed to correcly tie off a loose
#  cable end.  This was making intermittent contact with a signalling
#  structure (i.e. earth) and this in turn caused the preceding
#  signals to continually vary in aspect.  Presumably the driver ...
#  was only looking at the wrong moment.
#  
#  There will not be a normal enquiry and report.  Instead, there will be
#  a full judicial enquiry, something that up to now has only happened
#  twice -- Tay Bridge [1897] and Hixon [~1968].
#  
#  I expect the February Modern Railways [magazine] will be full of this.

Student plan marred by computer mistake

by Diego Ribadeneira, Globe Staff

  In a major glitch in the new Boston school student assignment plan, a
computer tape containing the names of nearly 900 students entering
kindergarten this fall was lost, leaving parents unsure if their children will
be able to attend their preferred schools.
  The snafu, discovered earlier this week, also hurts the credibility of the
plan, which some critics had said was being implemented too rapidly.
  Some students who have already received their assignments for next year may
not have gotten their top choices had the tape with the 900 applicants been
properly processed, school officials said.
  Superintendent Laval S. Wilson said the department has not yet determined how
it will remedy the problem. He said it may conduct the assignment process for
kindergarten students all over again. The error occurred, according to school
officials, because the lost tape had been used to test the accuracy of a
program developed to assign schools to students under the new plan.  The tape
was not returned to be used in the computer run to assign students to schools.
  ``Inadvertently this tape was not merged with the other tapes...,'' said
Catherine Ellison, senior officer for implementation for the Boston School
Department.  The lost tape contained the names of 887 children, the majority of
whom will be entering kindergarten.
  Since the mistake was discovered, school officials have manually been able
to match 344 of the children on the misplaced tape with one of their school
choices.
  Under the plan, called controlled choice, the city is divided into three
geographic zones. Parents were asked to list five choices for schools within
their zone.  The plan will being this fall for students entering kindergarten,
first grade and sixth grade.  All remaining grades would fall under the new
plan in the fall of 1990.
  School officials had advised parents affected by the new plan to submit their
applications by May 18, the first deadline for choosing a school, to have a
better chance of getting their top choices.
  The officials acknowledged yesterday that the remaining 543 students on the
misplaced tape may not get one of their preferred schools, partly as a result
of the mistake.
  ``We will be looking at the remaining applicants to determine how well we can
honor the requests,'' Ellison said. ``We will do as much as we can with the
best interests of the parents in mind. I won't sit here and promise something I
cannot deliver. We hope to attempt to honor one of the parents choices.''
  Kathy Satut listed the New Agassiz School in Jamaica Plain as her first
choice.
 ``I called up Wednesday and that's when they told me they had lost the tape.''
Satut said. ``I couldn't believe they had done that. Now I don't know what's
going to happen. Am I going to be penalized for their mistake? What was the
point of trying to get the application in on time. I think they should all be
fired. I'm very, very upset.''
  School officials said they are trying to insure that the percentage of
students from the misplaced tape who get their first choice will be about the
same as that for the students assigned schools from the first computer run.
They said they hope to complete assignments for kindergarten students by the
weekend.
  News of the error angered some school observers who said it comes at a time
when various reforms are being undertaken in an effort to lure new students to
the system.
  ``It's pretty outrageous,'' said Paula Georges, executive director of the
Citywide Education Coalition. ``It undermines the credibility of the plan.''

[End of Text]

[The most obvious implication of this incident is the importance of having a
backup. And why oh why weren't they using a *copy* of the data to do their
testing?!? The article merely hints at some intriguing characteristics of the
Boston Schools' DP department.

What disturbs me about this is that the plan is an important step in the
troubled recent history of the Boston schools towards equitable access to
various resources within the schools, by allowing parents to make an informed
choice for their child as to which school to attend. This ``snafu'' has created
the perception of arbitrary school assignments. Further, I suspect the
complicated nature of giving the maximum number of students one of five top
choices involves so many permutations that computer processing is essential to
proceeding with the plan; as the article reveals, the ``credibility'' of both
the plan, and most likely the role of computer processing, has now been called
into serious doubt.]

Friday June 23 N Y Times, p. A10:
By Roberto Suro, special to the NYT

LA JOLLA, CA, June 22 -- The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization,
Alan C. Nelson, today proposed a nationwide computer system to verify the
identities of all job applicants in order to halt the widspread use of
fraudulent documents by illegal aliens seeking jobs.
    Mr Nelson also suggested standardized identity cards for immigrants
so as to get fuller compliance with a 1986 law prohibiting employment of
illegal aliens.
    Creating a national identity card and other ways of checking legal
status or identity have been repeatedly suggested in Congress as tools in
fighting unlawful immigration, but have also been consistently rejected
as potential infringements on civil liberties.
			[15 column-inches deleted]

The national computerized database on everybody is one bad idea that
simply refuses to stay dead, no matter how many times we drive a stake
through its heart---if the INS ("Search warrants?  We don't need no
stinking search warrants!") didn't resurrect it, the drug czar or the
FBI would.  "Eternal vigilance ...".  On the other hand, it appears to
me that most informed citizens by now understand the risks involved:
computer professionals no longer have to fight this battle alone.

The identity-card stuff I suppose belongs in talk.politics.misc: I won't
go into it here.

I've seen a fair number of articles in the press lately warning people about
how sophisticated advertisers are getting in keeping databases and targetting
particular groups. I wonder if any of their authors has been getting the
targetted junk mail I have.

Oh sure, I get junk mail targetted towards Mazda owners, because I bought one
recently - but I get equally large amounts of junk mail for Camry owners, that
being the car I sold when I bought the Mazda. Some of my junk mail is targetted
to childless single mid-twenties women; then again, the same week brought me
mail that confidently announced that the coupons inside were specifically
targetted towards "growing families like mine, with young children" and mail
that confidently announced that I had now reached "an interesting age" (from
context, they meant I was over 40) and my children were all grown! Not to
mention the advertisements that begin "Men like you..."

I understand why they think I own a Toyota; I have a vague concept that my
growing family was a guess based on the date of my marriage certificate, which
definitely made its way into databases. I am at a loss to explain how anybody
became certain that I was over 40, or that I was male. I also wonder why (and
how) people manage to keep such careful track of car purchases but not sales,
marriage but not divorce... My mother, who has been dead nearly 5 years, has
reached retirement age in the databases that are preserving her memory for the
advertisers of America.

All in all, I don't think I'll worry about Big Brother watching me in order to
sell things to me.

Here are excerpts from IEEE INSTITUTE, July 1989, p. 8:

``Study finds `pedal misapplication' to blame for Audi surges''
by Karen Fitzgerald

The Audi 5000 has largely been vindicated in claims over the last four years of
sudden, out-of-control acceleration, but a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) study released in March also cautioned that pedal design
and minor engine acceleration may have caused drivers to apply their foot to
the accelerator instead of the brake.  ... 

The study, ``An Examination of Sudden Acceleration,'' explored ...
electromagnetic and radio frequency interference and malfunctions in cruise
control, electronic idle-speed control systems, computer-controlled fuel
injection systems, transmissions, and brakes.  The investigators could find no
mechanism --- besides actuation of the gas pedal --- that would open the
throttle sufficiently to accelerate any of the cars studied at full power.

However, there was evidence of minor surges of about three-tenths of the
Earth's gravity for 2 seconds caused by electronic faults in the idle
stabilizer systems of the Audi 5000 ... the surge could startle a driver enough
to accidentally push the accelerator instead of the brake, the study found ...
Moreover, the travel of the pedals and their height off the floor make it
possible for engine torque to overtake brake torque when the pedals are applied
simultaneously ...  [ more about this, including a graph indicating unusually
problematic placement of pedals in the Audi ].

The NHTSA took pains to call the problem ``pedal misapplication'' rather than
``driver error,'' as Audi first characterized the problem. ... ``Driver error
may imply carelessness or wilfulness in failing to operate a car properly,''
said an NHTSA press release announcing the study.  ``...(sudden acceleration)
could happen to even the most attentive driver who inadvertantly selects the
wrong pedal and continues to do so unwittingly.''

Social Comment: Are computer criminals, and is computer crime, treated
differently than other crimes?

 RISKS DIGEST 8.85 (28 June) carried two separate stories on hackers, their
motives, and the results of their "activities".

 In one case, a teenager managed to crack the code of an Air Force
satellite and was able to read confidential information of at least 200
companies: "He hoped to use his know-how to persuade the companies to hire
him as a computer security consultant, police said."

 The second article reported that "Firms in the City of London are buying
the silence of hackers who  break into their computers and steal millions
of pounds."

 I have personal knowledge of similar incidents of both types:

 o One hacker, very notorious to telecommunications security people, was
   finally apprehended, and some of the on-line evidence in his personal
   accounts showed that he had planned to use his cracking expertise to get
   a job in the computer industry.

 o I have never heard of any payoffs, such as are reported in the second
   article--but it is well known among security and legal consultants that
   companies will often drop a hacker case because of fear of publicity.
   In fact, some of the security experts have been "turned to the dark side
   of hacking": frustrated by their own company's refusal to crack down on
   lawbreaking, they have become phone phreaks and crackers themselves.

 There is a persistent piece of folklore that criminals in nonviolent
crimes are often hired as consultants by the industries or governments they
victimized.  I can't remember the source exactly--but I remember a report a
few years back from some U.S. Government enforcement agency that such
things are very rare; in fact, the incidents of such hiring are all well
documented as special cases.  But in computer crime it appears to be a norm
that criminal activity will go unpunished, and might even be rewarded.

 If the social controls aren't in step with legal controls, then the best
laws and enforcement systems are worthless.  Companies and governments
publicly decry cracking of all types: they often state that the public
should be educated that breaking into telecommunications circuits
(computers or otherwise) is a crime.  Yet these same companies/agencies
refuse to enforce existing laws--and some crackers have been hired as
consultants or paid off.

 I don't pretend to have a good answer to this problem.  Perhaps the "social"
definition of computer crime needs to be changed; maybe we're dealing with a
new and different kind of social behavior and the rules must be examined.
Personally I favor more enforcement of existing laws, perhaps backed up with a
new law that would not allow companies/agencies to drop charges once an arrest
was made (a frequent occurrence).  However, something needs to be done: as long
as this social/legal dichotomy exists, no progress (or protection) exists for
the socially responsible hacker and computer user.

Subject: Reducing risks of cost overruns/project failures

Much of recent discussions have been relating to products which have no
guarantee of working (missile systems). From a purely technical point of view
this reflects badly on the procurement process.  Would you buy a
dishwasher/TV/microwave/automobile/aircraft if you couldn't see a working model
(and what's more, try it for yourself) first?  Wouldn't you expect it to come
with a warranty against faulty design or workmanship?  Surely when DoD pays
billions of dollars for a weapons system, the taxpayer is entitled to expect
that the supplier will provide a meaningful warranty, and that any failures
will be pursued in a rigorous and thorough manner (i.e. through the courts)..
There appear, to my way of thinking, two areas of conflict::

1) In a large project, involving many thousands of man-years effort, it
   is (almost) impossible to, at some point, admit that there's been a
   mistake made previously - this leads to embarassment and red faces all
   round.  Hence, previous mistakes, misunderstandings etc. get fossilised
   into the system at an early stage and are never undone.  There is no
   easy way of avoiding these sorts of problems when the coverup may only
   come to light when the article/project is completed (by which time it's
   too late to do anything about it as the money has all been spent.....)

2) It is difficult to test all the way through the development cycle - with
   many projects you don't know if it's all going to work together until 
   someone turns both keys at the same time........
   If nothing happens at that point, it's too late to consult your lawyer.
   Modularisation, structured methods etc. can go some way towards making
   sure that the obvious incompatibilities are avoided, but there's no
   substitute for live testing in a real-world situation.

Solutions - well i am a confirmed minimalist when it comes to these areas,
'Keep-it-simple-Stupid' (KISS) technology can avoid a number of possible
failure modes (and save money too - why buy one very sophisticated system
when you can have more less complex (and hence probably more reliable!)
ones?  The `if it isn't there it won't go wrong' argument against complexity
is a powerful one - minimising component count by eliminating unnecessarily
complex functionality means that the thing will be more likely to work when
you need it to.  It also keeps the human-count down (and as we all know,
people are the most error-prone and irrational parts of any system!).
Remember that the number of failure modes increases dramatically with the
number of points of failure.

If a large company intended to sell me some device, i would insist on a
test-drive, on MY chosen patch (so the supplier couldn't present his device
under the most satisfactory conditions) and if the supplier couldn't
deliver, then he sure wouldn't get the cash! It's amazing how withholding
payment will concentrate the minds of people.  `Cost-plus' contracts are a
mistake too, as you don't know what the final cost will be.  The classic
example here is the British 'Nimrod' project - a plan to produce a
radar-plane functionally equivalent to AWACS - after ten years and nearly a
billion pounds of funding, it was scrapped (and AWACS bought...).

If I had been the UK government, someone somewhere wouldn't be in business any
more.... After all, we all pay TAXES (don't we?) and so it's OUR money and i
think we should EXPECT things to WORK when the time comes..!!!
                                                                  Pete Lucas

  [This contribution covers ground that will be familiar to many RISKS readers,
  and is somewhat OVERsimplified, but nevertheless makes some good points. PGN]

The third part in the series is on radiation and alleged health problems
associated with VDTs.  It is worth reading -- it was sufficiently detailed to
give a former "they should have accounted for job stress" skeptic (me) reason
to wonder.

Several points taken from the series (as recalled and interpreted by me):

1) consider *magnetic* fields, not just *electrical* fields
   (easier to shield against electrical fields)

2) The strength and range of magnetic
   fields depends on geometry and current -- the low-voltage
   distribution lines in your back yard may emit just as
   strong a magnetic field as the high voltage lines through
   some farmer's fields.  Though magnetic fields fall off
   rapidly with distance, fields from large "coils" extend
   farther than fields from small "coils" (that is, house-
   hold appliances are much smaller than power distribution
   systems, and thus their magnetic fields are of different
   shape and size).

3) consider not just VDT operators, but also people sitting
   around the VDT operators (there's the horizontal deflection
   coil which emits a 10s of KHz sawtooth, and the vertical
   deflection which emits a 50-100 Hz sawtooth.  The strong
   portions of those fields may not extend directly to the front
   of the VDT).

4) be careful, in general, when people quote "average" figures
   at you; the repetitive peak power is also an important figure.
   The frequency spectrum is also interesting -- harmonic effects
   have been observed.

5) There have been studies (on magnetic fields in general).
   Effects have been observed, both statistically (leukemia stats)
   and experimentally (abnormal development of fetal chickens and
   mice).  The mechanism, if any, is unknown.

   *Interactions with the ambient (i.e., earth's) magnetic field
   have been observed* -- this affects repeatability of experiments
   if not controlled for.
                                                  David

Thanks to Bhota San for the posting on the Canadian computer-translation
item. This reminded me of something I had just seen in a recent paper,
and which struck me as odd at the time. However, since I didn't know
what the curent state-of-the-art was in computerized translation, I
didn't realize at the time that this precis of a US Army Request for
Proposal represented some really pie-in-the-sky hopes for a fantastic
level of AI in automated translation! Here is the item, from the
"CBD Watch" column [CBD = Commerce Business Daily] on page 24 in the
June 5, 1989 issue of Federal Computer Week:

Army. Software for language translation. Software must be capable of
translating from English to German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Chinese and Portugese. It must provide idiomatic, verbatim translation of such
documents as military specs, international legal agreements, correspondence,
reports, studies and military briefings on doctrine, combat developments,
training and materials. It must be MS-DOS compatible and capable of translating
military terms and syntax. Contact Barbara Smith, TRADOC Contracting Activity,
Building 1748, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5538, (804) 878-4053.  ***End of item***

Hmmm... So these people expect this to run on a PC, too... (note the "MS-DOS"
reference...) "TRADOC" is the Training and Doctrine Command, by the way. I can
see why they would want to be able to translate stuff for the training of
allied personnel. However, based on the info in the previous posting, it sure
seems unlikely they are going to get what they want! Also, the RISKS
implications of this are rather stupendous. To expect software to translate
both military jargon, circumlocution, and tortured governmentese prose, and at
the same time handle the diplomatic nuances of "international legal agreements"
is a bit much, I think...  Most multi-lingual humans would have difficulty
doing that.

Another two days of the testimony into the April 1st elevator fatality
in Ottawa has revealed some interesting/ scary facts.
  It seems that the elevator type in question had a known problem
with potentially being able to move when only one of the two doors
was closed. A repair which involved moving only *one* wire was known,
and had been recommended by the manufacturer in 1978. The repair
was not made until 4 days *after* the accident, 11 years later.
In the meantime, the ownership of the building changed hands (in 1980),
and the maintenance company changed (in 1988). The government inspectors
never noticed that the change hadn't been made (there are only 2
inspectors for the Ottawa area, which has 3000+ elevators), and the
new repair company didn't notice it either. The owner of the company that
checked the elevator just 1 hour before the death *was* aware of the
change notice, but, as he put it:
  "Are you telling me 10 years after a letter comes out... I should
remember that?" [...]
  "I would assume in 1980 [when the building was sold -- WDR] all those
changes would be made, let alone 1988 [when he took over maintenance].
I don't know of any way any elevator company could know about it all."

The scary part came at the end of yesterday's article:

  "The inquest was told no maintenance records were available for the
  elevators, installed with building construction in 1973. Records are not
  required by the ministry and are often removed by maintenance companies if
  the contract expires in order to hinder the new contractors, Allan Maheral
  said."

I have just seen a copy of the UK department of defence draft standard
for safety critical software  (00-55).

Here are a few high (and low) points.

1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).

2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.

3. There should not be any distributed processing (i.e. only a single
processor).

4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

5. NO ASSEMBLER.

6. All code should be at least rigourously checked using mathematical
methods.

7. Any formally verified code should have the proof submitted as well, in
machine readable form, so that an independent check can be performed.

8. All code will be formally specified.

9. There are very strict requirements for static analysis (no unreachable
code, no unused variables, no unintialised variables etc.).

10. No optimising compilers will be used.

11. A language with a formally defined syntax and a well defined semantics,
or a suitable subset thereof will be used.

Comments.

1. means that all storage can be statically allocated.  In fact somewhere it
says that this should be the case.

2-4 seem to leave no option but polling.  This is impractical, especially in
embedded systems.  No one is going to build a fly by wire system with those
sorts of restrictions. (maybe people should therefore not build fly by wire
systems, but that is another matter that has been discussed at length here
already).  it also ignores the fact that there are proof methods for dealing
with distributed systems.

5. This is interesting, I seem to remember reading somewhere that Nasa used
to have the opposite rule: no high level languages, since they actually read
the delivered binary to check that the software did what it was supposed to
do.

6-7.  All through the draft the phrase `mathematical methods' or `formal
methods' is *invoked* in a general way without going into very much detail
about what is involved.  I am not sure that the people who wrote the report
were sure (Could someone from Praxis - which I believe consulted on drawing
it up - enlarge on this?).

8. this is an excellent thing, though it does not say what sort of language
should be used.  Is a description in terms of a Turing machine suitable?
After all that is a well understood formal system.

10. Interestingly, there is no requirement that the compiler be formally
verified, just that it should conform to international standards (though
strictly), and not have any gross hacks (i.e. optimisation) installed.
There is also no demand that the target processor hardware be verified
(though such a device exists here already: the Royal Signals Research
Establishment's Viper processor).

11. seems to be a dig at Ada and the no subsets rule.  It also rules out C.

Conclusions.

I find the idea of the wholesale mayhem and killing merchants being forced
to try so much harder to ensure that their products maim and kill only the
people they are supposed to maim and kill, rather amusing.

The standard seems to be naive in its expectations of what can be achieved
at the moment with formal methods (That is apparently the general opinion
around here, and there is a *lot* of active research in program verification
in Edinburgh), and impossibly restrictive.

An interesting move in the right direction but too fast and too soon.  And
they might blow the idea of Formal verification by tring to force it too
soon.  And I would very much like to see these ideas trickle down into the
civil sector.

I might follow this up with a larger (and more coherent) description if
there is interest (this was typed from memory after seeing it yesterday)
there is quite a bit more in it.

"Exxon accidentally destroys data files on Alaska oil spill,"
          by Roberto Suro, New York Times Service

HOUSTON - A computer operator at Exxon headwuarters in Houston says he
inadvertently destroyed computer copies of thousands of documents with
potentially important information on the Alaskan oil spill.
  A federal court had ordered Exxon to preserve the computer records along
with all other material concerning the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in
Prince William Sound on March 24 and the subsequent cleanup effort.
  Les Rogers, a spokesman for the Exxon Company USA, confirmed the
destruction of the computer records but said the oil company's lawyers
believed other copies exist.
  "Very early in the spill, even before the court order, Exxon took
the initiative to instruct all its employees to save all documents
relating to the event because of the anticipated litigation," Rogers
said.  "We assume these instructions have been followed."
  The computer technician, Kenneth Davis, said that it would be difficult
and perhaps impossible to determine what documents were on destroyed
conmputer files.
  Exxon faces about 150 lawsuits as a result of the spill, which dumped 
11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, and it appears
certain that the loss of these documents will be the subject of court
arguments.
  Stephen Sussman, a Houston lawyer involved in a suit against Exxon on
behalf of Alaska fishermen, Native Americans, and others, said, "The
destruction of these records is potentially significant to our case in
that we will be arguing that Exxon has been negligent throughout this
disaster and now perhaps it was negligent even in the handling of its
own documents."
  Davis, 33, was dismissed June 8, the day after the destruction of the
records was discovered.
  In several interviews, and in written statements to the Texas Employment
Commission, Davis alleged that his superiors had been negligent in
safeguarding the computer records and that his actions resulted from
their failures.
  The destroyed material included all internal communications and
word-processing documents from both the Exxon Shipping Co., which owned
the tanker, and the executive offices of Exxon USA.
  Davis said that since the tapes were the only complete copy of what
passed through those computer systems, it might be impossible to
determine what was lost.

   [The full NYT text was sent in by Hugh Miller &lt;MILLER@vm.epas.utoronto.ca&gt;,
   who prefaced the text with this reference to `1984' by George Orwell:

     ``I was thinking just this morning about how Winston Smith's job in
       historical engineering would have been a lot easier if everything had
       been kept on magnetic media, when this item appeared in today's NYT.''

   To conclude, he made some comments about the difficulties of prosecuting
   after the documents have been destroyed (with reference to Ollie and Fawn).

The June 1989 issue of IEEE Spectrum contains a series of articles discussing
risk management techniques and failures, paying particular attention to the
areas of aging aircraft ala the Aloha Airlanes 737 incident, the Hinsdale 
fire which shut down phone service near Chicago, the Savannah river nuclear 
reactors, the space shuttle, and the release of lethal chemicals in Bhopal.

Perhaps because of my own particular biases, the space shuttle article was
particularly interesting where it describes the risk of a shuttle accident also
dooming the space station (due to the destruction of single copies of critical
space station components).

In RISKS 8.86, Jon Jacky quotes Stan Shebs:

  We supposedly had a "model" software engineering methodology; what I
  remember most clearly is that half the work was done on one flavor of IBM
  OS, and the other half done on a different flavor, and file transfer
  between the two was tricky and time-consuming.

The coupled clauses are unrelated, a compositional practice Mr. Shebs is
apparently quite fond of.  Let's concentrate on Mr. Sheb's text to see what
his understanding of software development is:


  The day-to-day work was [...] writing the "Program Design" for an
  already-written program (is that stupid or what), figuring out how to
  compute the intersection of two polygons in space.  

Without context, this is not evidence that the SE method was good or bad.
Of course the program design should have been documented beforehand, but
recognizing that it is necessary to have for testing and maintenance
purposes is not stupid.  I have seen many systems where the software is very
old (or inhereted) and must be re-documented to current standards.  What was
the case here?


  I suppose the greatest risk of failure derives from things that weren't
  anticipated during testing, such as a Siberian snowdrift changing the
  topography on a navigation map...

[How does the snow get on the map?!]  One does not wait until testing to
anticipate such contingencies.  Does Mr. Shebs think so?


  (Regarding) statistics on software quality, the closest thing we had was
  maybe a count of problem reports (hundreds, but each report ranged from
  one-liners to one-monthers in terms of effort required).

Sigh.  There is no mention here whether this applies to _delivered_ product
or corrected production errors.  Is this his view of what constitutes
quality?


  Nothing classified, we had the odd situation that the *data* was [sic]
  classified, but the *program* wasn't even rated "confidential"!

Odd situation?  Apparently, Mr. Shebs had a single experience in the MCCR
community.


This article was posted to illuminate "the accuracy/quality of strategic
weapons guidance systems", presumably by offering a coherent and reasoned
exposition.  Instead, it presents jokes, innuendo, and unsubstantiated
charges and conclusions in indefinite (and sloppy, such as the 1/2 inch
diameter missile) language such as:

  The difficulty of all this apparently didn't occur to anybody until after
  the missile was working...

  ...error accumulation over 2000 km is immense,... 

  ...cute little cassette tapes...

  The precision and formality of the software was very low, but it was
  exhaustively tested over and over and over again.  


Really, if Mr. Shebs's rambling demonstrates anything, it shows that the
greatest risk is hiring inarticulate and confused programmers like himself
who don't have the faintest idea what software engineering is.

Mr. Shebs appears to come clean in only one statement:

  The fragility of something like the cruise missile and its software is
  something I've spent a lot of time wondering about, and don't really
  have any idea.  

Indeed.

&gt; The study, ``An Examination of Sudden Acceleration,'' explored ...
&gt;
&gt; However, there was evidence of minor surges of about three-tenths of the
&gt; Earth's gravity for 2 seconds caused by electronic faults in the idle
&gt; stabilizer systems of the Audi 5000 ... the surge could startle a driver
&gt; enough to accidentally push the accelerator instead of the brake, ...

Minor??  .3G works out to roughly 10 feet/sec^2, or a zero-to-sixty
acceleration time of about 9 seconds.  This may not be considered "full power"
or "major" acceleration for a sports-car, but my old Volvo has difficulty
reaching highway speed (55) in 9 seconds even if I floor the accelerator.

A .3G surge for 2 seconds would accelerate a car from a standstill to somewhere
in the neighborhood of 20 feet/second, and would carry the car about 10 feet
forwards.  Startling?  I should say so... especially to drivers who might have
only recently switched to the Audi from an older, lower-powered car.

Even if this fault in the idle stabilizer cannot invoke "full"
acceleration by itself, it sounds substantially dangerous in and of
itself.  Coupled with poor pedal/linkage layout and design, it
apparently adds up to a real hazard.

Three-tenths of the Earth's gravity is not "minor."  That's about
three meters per second squared.  At the end of two seconds the car
would have travelled about six meters or twenty feet.  3m/sec^2 on
a 1500 Kg automobile for just a moment will set it moving fast
enough to squish or bash-in any likely obstacle (inertia, you know).

I'll bet drivers are startled!  They aren't likely to accellerate
that fast when parking...  Sixty miles per hour is about a hundred
kilometers per hour.  That's about twenty-eight meters per second.
At 3m/sec^2 it takes only nine or ten seconds to reach 28m/sec; the
owners of Audi 5000's are probably pleased with the "zero to sixty
in six seconds" performance of their cars; that's less than 5m/sec^2.
(Many cars can't do 0-60 in less than 9 seconds flat out.)  This
means the "surges... caused by electronic faults" are equivalent to
accellerating away from a stop light in traffic--and only a third
less than flooring the gas pedal to get onto the Pasadena Freeway
in Highland Park.  Imagine if you were easing your car into your
garage at an idle and it suddenly accellerated like you were taking
off from a stop sign.

(Before you all write to criticize the math, I'm aware that I've neglected air
resistance and gear shifting, but I don't think this invalidates the
discussion.)

If the report does minimize the fault in the Audi's electronic controls to lay
the blame on the driver, then we must ask whether the authors wanted to shift
concern away from Audi where it seems to belong.  (No, I've never owned or even
driven an Audi.)

&gt;However, there was evidence of minor surges of about three-tenths of the
&gt;Earth's gravity for 2 seconds caused by electronic faults in the idle
&gt;stabilizer systems of the Audi 5000

Is this a missprint?  I find the characterization of a two-second, 3/10 g surge
as "minor" to be ludicrous.

This is especially true if it is the result of a malfunction in an idle speed
control system, implying that it would occur when the vehicle was stopped.  At
a busy intersection, for instance, with pedestrian cross-traffic or another
stopped car just a foot or two ahead.

After one second, a 3/10g surge would have moved the vehicle almost five feet
forward, and have it traveling over 6 1/2 MPH.  By the end of the two second
surge, if nothing is done, the car would be doing 13 MPH and have gone nearly
twenty feet.

No hypothetical "pedal misapplication" is necessary to make such a vehicle
hazardous, and while zero-to-sixty in under ten seconds may not be full
throttle for an Audi, it's close enough for me.

[My apologies for the gap in this series -- I'm running for City Council
currently and don't seem to have enough spare cycles. -Les]

	Was there ever a command and control system that worked?

My opening remark in RISKS 9.80 was:  "Of the dozens of command and
control system development projects that were initiated by the U.S. Air
Force in the early 1960s, none appeared to perform its functions as well
as the manual system that preceded it."  Gene Fucci, who worked on the Air
Force satellite surveillance programs as a project engineer on SAMOS and
later as Field Force Test Director of MIDAS, found my remarks "somewhat
distorted" in that he believes the satellite command and control systems
worked well.

I will plead relative ignorance of those systems, but note that they were
called just "control systems" until "command and control" became a
buzzword in the early 1960s.  I do not wish to take the position that all
systems to which the term "command and control" or "command-control-
communications" was eventually applied were failures -- just that all of
the dozens that I knew of were failures.

			SAGE revisited

Some of the earlier C3 Legacy postings on SAGE have found their way via a
circuitous route to an old friend of mine, Phil Bagley, who also helped
design that system.  Phil has now sent me snail-mail that takes a different
view of that program, as follows.

"I think that you have discovered what is behind the curtain.  In case you
haven't, let me tell you my view.  The motivation behind a big military
electronic system such as SAGE or BMEWS is _not_ to have it work.  It is
just to create the _illusion_ that the sponsor is doing his job, and
perhaps peripherally to provide an opportunity to exercise influence.
Lincoln Lab and MITRE had no motivation to point out the obvious -- that
the emperor had no clothes.  If you had asked a responsible think tank who
had no stake in the outcome how to deal most effectively with the issues,
you would have recommendations very different from those that guided the
electronic systems developments.

"Now it wasn't all for naught.  Out of SAGE, computer technology got a big
boost.  IBM learned how to build core memories and made a lot of money
building machines with core memories.  Lots of people like you and me got
good systems and programming training (I still write programs).  Ken Olson
learned how to design digital equipment and ultimately gave the world a
few billion dollars worth of Vaxes.

"The moral of all this is:  When things appear not to make sense you very
probably are looking at it from the `wrong' point of view.  Another way
to say it:  It's pretty hard to fool Mother Nature, so if it appears that
she is being fooled, try to find a point of view which doesn't imply that
she's being fooled."

While Phil and others may be comforted by this view, I will argue that it
amounts to nothing more than "Whatever is, is right," which grates on my
rationalist soul.  I believe that if a comparable amount of government
money had been invested in research, or on a more tractable application,
that computer technology would have advanced much more quickly than
actually happened.

I believe that as soon as MIT and MITRE engineers figured out that they
had designed an unworkable system, they had an ethical obligation to point
that out to their sponsors.  Instead they (we) helped perpetuate the myth
that it worked so that we could continue in our beloved technological
lifestyle.

Phil's mention of Ken Olson reminds me that we gave a going-away party for
him and Harlan Anderson at the MIT Faculty Club when they left to form
their company to make transistorized digital modules based on experience
in building the TX-0 and TX-2 computers at Lincoln Lab.  We told them that
they could have their old jobs back after their start-up went belly-up, as
we all expected.  In fact, that reportedly came rather close to happening
more than once in the first couple of years, but somehow DEC squeeked
through and grew a bit.

Requiem:  the SAIL computer, which would have reached the grand old age
of 25 next week, is slated to retire tonight and die in the near future.
It has provided an intellectual home for a very productive generation of
researchers and will be remembered fondly.

[Admittedly tangential, but fun....]

      [Oh, yes, this is a VERY OLD shaggy dog story, but worth retelling.  
      It might even have appeared in RISKS before, but I don't recall it.  
      On the other hand, this time I do not feel like grepping my way
      through the archives.  Apologies to those of you to whom it rings
      true.  PGN]

Donald Wechsler's story in RISKS 9.96 (about the Lhasa apso which may have
learned to dial 911) reminded me of one of my favorite stories.  I found it
in "Computers and Society Digest", Number 39, Tuesday, September 9th 1986.
As you can see below, it is said to have originated in 1977.

Subject: Interesting Phone Calls
    
		    AN UNUSUAL TELEPHONE SERVICE CALL
    
This story was related by Pat Routledge of Winnepeg, ONT about an unusual
telephone service call he handled while living in England.
    
It is common practice in England to signal a telephone subscriber by signaling
with 90 volts across one side of the two wire circuit and ground (earth in
England). When the subscriber answers the phone, it switches to the two wire
circuit for the conversation. This method allows two parties on the same line
to be signalled without disturbing each other.
    
This particular subscriber, an elderly lady with several pets called to say
that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called and that on the few
occasions when it did manage to ring her dog always barked first.  Torn between
curiosity to see this psychic dog and a realization that standard service
techniques might not suffice in this case, Pat proceeded to the scene. Climbing
a nearby telephone pole and hooking in his test set, he dialed the subscriber's
house.  The phone didn't ring. He tried again. The dog barked loudly, followed
by a ringing telephone. Climbing down from the pole, Pat found:
    
	a.   Dog was tied to the telephone system's ground post via an iron
	     chain and collar 
	b.   Dog was receiving 90 volts of signalling current 
	c.   After several jolts, the dog was urinating on ground and barking 
	d.   Wet ground now conducted and phone rang.
    
Which goes to prove that some grounding problems can be passed on.
    
This anecdote excerpted from Syn-Aud-Con Newsletter, Vol 4, No 3, April 1977.

 There is a dual standard of conduct, of ethics, for managing money: One for
private funds, and another, higher standard for "public money."  All of us who
spend public money, collect it, live on it, are called to an ethic described,
by Shakespeare I believe, for Caesar's wife, to be "above suspicion."

 The rule is simple: If you choose to live by your wits, and to be "sharp" in
your professional practices [i.e., bend rules that are flexible, cut corners
that "don't seem to matter"], then do it with private funds.

 The backbone of the InterNet is publicly funded.  Period.  Many of the host
computers on the InterNet are publicly funded.  Thus, I have always assumed
that the traffic was monitored from time to time.  Some of us have taken
advantage of that to bring issues to the attention of the monitors, without
having to find explicit US Mail addresses for them.

 All who benefit from the privilege - "PRIVILEGE," NOT "RIGHT" - of spending
public money must be even more prudent with that public money than with our
private funds.  So many have gotten "the top of the line model" because it was
available; in private life - REAL life - we often choose some lesser model,
because it is prudent to compromise.  [Else we would all be driving Cadillac,
BMW, Mercedes, Mazda, or some other very fine automobiles, instead of the Fords
and Chevrolets and other good, but not excellent, cars we do.]

 I recently wrote a US Senator with an idea for capital gains tax breaks.  In
part, I suggested that the US make intelligent decisions about which industries
to encourage, rather than offering tax benefits for any investment held over
some period of time.  An approximate quotation of my rational summarizes my
belief: " We should probably not give capital gains tax breaks for investments
in Jack Daniels, and Playboy.  I may choose to spend my private dollars that
way, but I don't want my tax dollars spent that way."

 The US Mail (postal service), once part of government, is now said to be a
"private corporation" with some special management by the executive branch,
with Congressional oversight - but different in kind and degree from either the
old or new "AT&amp;T."  In any case, users are said to pay, at the time, for
services rendered, one letter or parcel at a time.  Even so, there are
regulated - forbidden - uses of the mails, aside from and in addition to the
privacy aspects.

 We must appreciate the old maxim that "Your right to swing your fist ends at
the tip of my nose."  The 2600 gang needs to understand the computer corollary
of that; and, as they say, we all need to understand the risk that nontechnical
zealots will over legislate to protect their noses.

A couple of points that aren't in this report. According to reports I've seen
elsewhere, the person working on for Jackson Games was a former Legion of Doom
member, who was also working on a book of interviews of Doom members. If what I
just said actually is true, having a known hacker writing a 'manual' on
hacking, even a fictional one, is something the Secret Service would want to
keep an eye on -- imagine, for instance, that the fictional game instructions
are actually true and the supplement was published as a way of passing them
around in a covert way.

Now, everything I've heard indicates this isn't what happened: it really is
fictional material. But it's an interesting concept in theory.

&gt;  The amorphous nature of the raid is what is most frightening to me.  Does
&gt;this raid indicate that those who operate bulletin board systems as individuals
&gt;are at risk for similar raids if someone posts "hacking" information on their
&gt;computer?

If you're running a BBS that's supporting a group of system crackers, you are,
at least, contributory to felony crimes. Sure you should worry about someone
knocking on your door. A BBS that's on the up-and-up should have no worries,
though.

&gt;Or does it indicate that games which involve "hacking" are subject
&gt;to searches and seizures by the federal government?  Does it indicate that
&gt;writing about "hacking" exposes one to the risk of a raid?  It seems that this
&gt;raid goes over the line of protecting society and has, instead, violated the
&gt;freedom of its citizenry.

Not if the Legion of Doom angle is true. This is not to imply that Steve
Jackson or Jackson games was at all involved with any Doomers, but moire likely
stuck in the middle.

I recently had a chance to inspect the back of an automated teller while
conducting some business with the human teller that works part-time on site.

It was divided into three sections, the computer, the records and the money.  I
noticed that one section had both combination and key locks and was informed
that it contained the money.  The section housing the computer was defended by
a simple key lock.

I pointed out that Hewlett Packard was filled with people who design and build
computers as well as equipment to monitor and test computers she noted that her
teenage son thought it was a risk, but the bank considered the money quite
safe.

Now if the lock manufacturer can make a key from lock number and type . . .

&gt;  There's a world of difference between, say, ``B1- certifiable'' -- which 
&gt;  generally means a feature list -- and ``B1 certified.''

I'd like to state for the record that what the NCSC does is NOT product
"certification", but product "evaluation".  Certification refers to a specific
site being approved (usually by an authority referred to as a DAA, or
Designated Accrediting Authority) as "B1 (or whatever digraph) secure".  This
certification may be contingent upon posting armed guards at every door to
identify users instead of including a user authentication mechanism in the
system, or any other restrictions the DAA feels are appropriate.  An NCSC
evaluation, on the other hand, is based upon the TCSEC requirements
exclusively.  A product must meet all of the requirements for a candidate class
in order to receive that rating; there is no bargaining with the requirements
based upon the judgement of a DAA.  Thus, an *evaluation* of a system is
generally more stringent than a certification, because the evaluation process
tends not to allow a procedural correction for a deficiency in the hardware and
software elements of the system.
