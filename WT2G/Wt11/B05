<STRONG>Rollie Schmitten Responds to AFS Editorial</STRONG><P>

	The American Fisheries Society's (AFS) May 1994 issue of Fisheries contains an editorial letter
from NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, Rolland Schmitten.  The letter is in response
to AFS Executive Director Paul Brouha's February 1994 editorial entitled, the "The NMFS
Habitat Protection Program: Lost in the Bureaucracy."  Brouha's editorial reported shortcomings
in the NMFS Habitat Protection Program, based on the findings of three recent major program
assessments.  Particular attention was addressed to the 1994 Office of Inspector General's (OIG)
report "Major Initiatives Needed to Protect Marine Habitats." <P> 

Schmitten's letter concurs with the major findings of the OIG Report.  He pointed out that the
loss of nearshore ocean and estuarine fishery habitat is probably the greatest long-term threat to
U.S. marine fishery productivity.  He then laid out several steps now underway to improve the
NMFS Habitat Protection Program for the 1990's and beyond.  Among these are: <P>

o    Development of a multi-year NMFS habitat protection budget initiative to meet the
Program's unfunded needs and to be included in NOAA's strategic plan. <P> 

o    Pursuit of new legislation to improve NMFS habitat protection authorities will be
included in NOAA's Fiscal Year 1995 legislative package.<P>
o    Redirection of NMFS resources now employed in support of other NOAA/NMFS
missions back to habitat protection mandates.<P>

Copies of both the editorial and letter are attached.  Copies of the OIG report are available upon
request from the F/HP. <STRONG> (Ken Roberts, 301-713-2325)

<STRONG>NMFS-FWS Unveil Joint Rule-making Effort For Fishway Prescription Responsibilities.  
</STRONG><P>

	On May 5, 1994, high ranking officials and staff of NMFS, Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service
(FWS), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) met to explore interagency
issues, communications, and understanding.  The intent for for NMFS and FWS was to provide
FERC officials with early notice of plans to undertake joint rule-making to carry out fishway
prescription responsibilities.  The prescription responsibilities are cited under section 18 of the
Federal Power Act.  Administrators present at the FERC offices included NMFS Deputy Director
Nancy Foster, FWS Director Mollie Beattie, and FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler.<P>  

	Other discussion items included: (1) proposed FERC policies on hydroelectric dam
decommissioning and cumulative impacts; (2) increased NMFS-FERC information exchanges,
perhaps under procedures similar to those in an existing 1993 FWS/FERC Agreement; and (3)
the National Hydropower Association's proposal to amend FERC's relicensing procedures.  <STRONG>(John Hall, 301-713-2325)
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Status of Habitat Provisions in Magnuson Act (MFCMA) Reauthorization </STRONG><P>

	The pace of Magnuson Act reauthorization has quickened in recent weeks.  In early April, the
F/HP briefed House Merchant Marine and Fisheries staffers on the NMFS Habitat Protection
Program.  The briefing covered key NMFS habitat authorities, headquarters and regional habitat
program responsibilities, possible habitat amendments to the Magnuson Act, and other habitat
protection issues, including the Commerce OIG Report. <P>  

	At this writing, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee is completing their Magnuson Act
amendments and expects to introduce them in early June.  This legislation also addresses foreign
fishing, large-scale driftnet fishing, improvements to fishery management plans and the
emergency rule-making process, and the establishment of fees to pay the costs of carrying out
conservation and management measures.<P>   

	On May 12, Representative Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD) of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee introduced H.R. 4404, the Marine Fish Conservation Amendments of 1994.  Of
particular habitat protection importance, H.R. 4404 would extend the Commerce Department's 
fishery habitat protection authorities to review state and Federal, projects, permits, and licenses. 
Under certain conditions, it calls for a Secretarial veto power over Federal development actions. 
The bill was developed by the Marine Fish Conservation Network, a nationwide coalition of over
60 conservation and fishing groups, and proposes several changes to the Magnuson Act.  Other
possible changes address overfishing, bycatch, regional Fishery Management Council reform,
and research and enforcement needs.  <P>

	On May 16, the Secretary of Commerce forwarded the Administration's proposal to amend the
Magnuson Act to the Congress.  With respect to habitat protection, the Administration's bill calls
for the identification of "essential fishery habitat" in each Federal fishery management plan. 
<STRONG>(Ralph Lopez, 301-713-2325)</STRONG><P>



<STRONG>NOAA/NMFS Pursuing Basic Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) Amendment </STRONG><P>

	F/HP has acted to rekindle a basic, but critical, technical amendment to the FWCA.  The
amendment would at long last officially establish NMFS as a Federal fish and wildlife agency
under this important habitat advocacy law.  The action came about because of the 1994
Department of Commerce's OIG report on the NMFS Habitat Protection Program.  In response to that report, NOAA committed itself to launch a legislative plan to strengthen NMFS's legal
habitat authorities.  At this time, it is being pursued within the Administration.<P>  

	Long overdue, the amendment is needed because of an oversight which occurred with the transfer
of responsibilities from the FWS to NMFS in 1972.  The Nixon Administration's Reorganization
Plan 4, which created NOAA, transferred the old Bureau of Commercial Fisheries' FWCA staff
and responsibilities from the Department of Interior.  Over the years, NMFS' FWCA authority
has been challenged because the law does not acknowledge NMFS as a Federal fish and wildlife
agency.<P>  

	The last attempt for enactment occurred in 1991.  The Bush Administration developed and
delivered to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, a package of amendments
to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.  These amendments would have codified the
authorities and responsibilities of the NMFS to protect fish habitats.  However the package was
not enacted.<P>  

	Anyone interested in more information or obtaining a copy of the proposal contact <STRONG>James
Burgess (301-713-2325).</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>Multi-year NMFS Habitat Protection Initiative Completed</STRONG><P>

	In its response to the 1994 OIG Report on the NMFS Habitat Protection Program, NOAA
committed itself to make NMFS' Habitat Program needs a high agency priority.  One proposed
action was that NMFS would develop a comprehensive multi-year plan to develop adequate
resources to meet the Program's mandated, but unfunded, resource requirements.  <P>

	This plan was developed and submitted by F/HP in time for consideration in NOAA's FY 96
budget process.  We are pleased that an initial year of funding has been included in NOAA's
request to the Department of Commerce.<P>  

	While the specifics of the proposals, including funding amounts, are confidential, the initiative
would focus upon carrying out procedures and options available under the FWCA, Federal Power
Act, Magnuson Act, and National Environmental Policy Act to influence Federal decisions about
important habitats.  These activities will include direct involvement in Federal decisions
regarding dredge and fill projects, OCS oil and gas development, ocean dumping, water
diversion, artificial impoundments, energy facility siting, water quality degradation, and removal
or degradation of tidal and intertidal wetlands.  <P>

	The funding proposals include: (1) base program enhancement to address years of underfunding;
(2) identification of essential habitats under the Magnuson Act, if amended; (3) an anadromous
fish habitat initiative directed at Federal hydroelectric licensing and relicensing; and (4) activities
to prevent the need to list species as endangered or threatened.  <STRONG>(James Burgess, 301-713-2325).
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Options Paper Completed on Dredging Problems and Solutions</STRONG><P>

	An Interagency Working Group was formed last fall by the Department of Transportation's
Maritime Administration.  Its purpose is to identify potential solutions to problems associated
with port development and Federal dredging and dredged material disposal processes.  An initial
series of public outreach sessions were held early this year throughout the United States.  Based
on these sessions, an Options Paper has been developed and released.  <P>

	The paper presents a spectrum of options to address problems associated with dredging and
disposal in port development.  Of particular importance are the options dealing with the creation
of a national dredging policy, advance planning incentives, and changes in methods and
processes for funding dredging projects.  The paper overviews how the Group assimilated the
results of the first round of outreach meetings, discusses five major issue areas, and sets forth
options that will be discussed at a second round of outreach sessions.  These sessions are
scheduled to occur May 18 to June 2. <STRONG>(Ralph Lopez 301-713-2325).
</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>June Federal Register Release Scheduled for Review of Mitigation Banking Policy </STRONG><P>

	For several months, representatives of NMFS, FWS, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Soil Conservation Service have been preparing an
interagency policy on wetland mitigation banking.  The policy will provide guidelines for use by
Federal personnel and prospective sponsors in setting up mitigation banks.  Publication of the
policy in the Federal Register for comment is scheduled for June or July 1994.  A completed
policy should be available by early Fall.  <P>

	The policy addresses many aspects of mitigation banking, from preliminary planning meetings to
long-term protection of the bank wetlands.  To ensure interagency cooperation, the policy
recommends that an interagency Mitigation Review Team (MRT) be established for each bank. 
The MRT sets up guidelines under which a specific bank will be operated and reviews
monitoring reports, credit accounts, and the general operation of the bank.  Through participation
in MRT's, NMFS will have an opportunity to establish banking procedures that ensure
appropriate compensation for fishery habitat lost under the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit
program. <STRONG> (Susan Stedman, 301-713-2325) 
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Good News For Alaskan Wetlands -- Release of Alaska Wetlands Policy Paper</STRONG><P>

	The final Summary Report of the Alaska Wetlands Initiative was released on May 13, 1994, by
the Corps and EPA.  Concurrently, the controversial 1992  proposed "Alaska 1%" rule-making
was withdrawn.  These two actions were in response to recommendations in the Administration's
August 24, 1993, report on protecting America's wetlands.  At stake are Alaskan wetlands, which
provide habitat for the highly valuable fishing industry and employment for Alaskans.  <P>

	The Summary Report details the environmentally appropriate actions that are being taken to
ensure regulatory flexibility in protecting Alaska's wetlands.  If promulgated, the "1%" rule
would have excepted all wetlands in Alaska from National mitigation requirements which would
have resulted in placing to high value coastal habitats for living marine resources in danger of
destruction.  <P>

	The NMFS habitat protection staff played a substantial role during the seven months of initiative
development.  NMFS regional staff participated in the Alaskan stakeholder meetings and
development of issue papers and Headquarters staff participated in development of the final
Summary Report.  NMFS was invited because of its trustee responsibilities for living marine
resources and their habitats.  The Initiative addresses the concerns of stakeholders, while
ensuring the protection of wetlands and associated living marine resources.  Key elements in the
Summary Report include: abbreviated permit processing procedures under certain conditions in
Alaskan villages; development of general permits where potential impacts are small, such as
construction of schools and medical clinics; and strengthening of relationships among State and
local governments, Native corporations and villages.  <STRONG>(Ramona Schreiber, 301-713-2325)</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Qualified "No" To Schmitten on NMFS Elevation Rights for Gastineau Channel, Juneau, Alaska</STRONG><P>

	In a letter of May 12, 1994, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army John H. Zirschky has denied
NMFS Assistant Administrator Rolland Schmitten's request to waive an administrative
restriction to NMFS elevation rights.   At issue is a controversial permit application under the
Army-Commerce Section 404(q) Memorandum of Agreement for the Alaska-Juneau Mine, near
Juneau.  However, Army has said that, NMFS will have an opportunity to provide its views
informally in the Corps' decision process if the FWS elects to elevate the issue to Washington,
D.C. <P> 

	The Alaska-Juneau Mine, a gold mine near Juneau, Alaska, has filed Federal permits to reopen
the mine.  NMFS is concerned about impacts that construction and operation of the mine may
have on aquatic resources.  NMFS believes that the proposal should require reexamination of the
permit and reopening of the public review process.  A proposed tailings impoundment on Sheep
Creek (a state-designated anadromous fish stream) would be used to dispose of cyanide-treated
tailings.  Most of the Sheep Creek flow and excess effluent from the impoundment would be
discharged into the adjacent Gastineau Channel.  The diversion of 80 percent of Sheep Creeks's
freshwater flow will essentially de-water 1.1 miles of productive spawning habitat.  Sheep Creek
is an essential habitat for several fisheries resources including Dolly Varden char and
anadromous populations of pink and chum salmon.  The natural fish populations are augmented
by a private, non-profit fish hatchery at the mouth of Sheep Creek.  A significant roadside sport
fishery also exists in this area, which in 1987, was valued at $14.4 million.  Rerouting of Sheep
Creek would drastically alter and impair the ecosystem.  Because of the potentially damaging
impacts to living marine resources, NMFS fully intends to use all available avenues to assure full
consideration of the fishery issues in the Corps' decision process.<STRONG> (Ramona Schreiber,
301-713-2325)</STRONG><P>


<STRONG>Opportunity to Protect Fish Habitat Through FPA Section 10(a)</STRONG><P>

	Conservation agencies and organizations should be aware that the Federal Power Act (Act)
requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to consider fully other Federally
authorized mandates before arriving at a licensing decision.  Section 10(a) of the Act states that
FERC must consider "The extent to which the [proposed] project is consistent with a
comprehensive plan (where one exists) for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or
waterways affected by the project . . . .."  In order for section 10(a) to be applicable, the
"comprehensive" plans must be on file with FERC.  <P>

	The F/HP has been taking steps to assure that applicable NMFS comprehensive fish and wildlife
plans are officially filed with FERC.  The West Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan is
already on file.  Four additional plans -- The Alaska and Atlantic salmon FMPs and two critical
habitat plans for West Coast salmon -- were submitted to FERC during May.  <P>

	Conservation agencies and organizations are encouraged to familiarize themselves with Section
10(a) and take steps to see that their applicable "comprehensive plans" are also find their way to
FERC's file.  The Office has briefed the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission and NOAA's
Office of Coastal Resource Management so they could also file their plans with FERC.  FERC's
interpretation of Section 10(a) (FERC Order 481-A) and a list of current plans filed with FERC
have been distributed to NMFS Regional Habitat Offices.  For more information, contact <STRONG>Mr.
Clem Bribitzer (301-713-2325).</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>NMFS Comments on PACFISH Interim Strategies 
</STRONG><P>

	PACFISH is a long-term  "ecosystem based, aquatic habitat and riparian-area management
strategy, for Pacific salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout habitats on lands administered
by the U.S. Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)."   The strategy is
being developed to provide a management framework to arrest the decline of anadromous fish
populations and the destruction of their habitats.  Of approximately 400 stocks of salmon,
steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout occurring in the region addressed by the EA, 214 stocks are
considered at-risk and 106 are already extinct.  The region addressed by PACFISH includes
anadromous fish habitat on all or parts of 15 national forests in 4 FS Regions in 4 states and 7
BLM districts in 4 states.  <P>

	In March 1994, FS and the BLM forwarded for review an "Environmental Assessment (EA)" of
proposed interim PACFISH strategies.  The EA addresses interim or temporary strategies, which
are to be implemented while the longer-term, permanent PACFISH strategy is under
development.  The EA proposes five alterative management scenarios that provide varying levels
of habitat protection.  <P>

	In May 1994, NMFS completed detailed comments and recommendations on the EA interim
PACFISH initiative.  The Anadromous Fish Habitat Division, F/HP solicited and coordinated
NMFS comments from the Protected Resources and Habitat Protection Offices of the Northwest,
Southwest, and Alaska Regions.  NMFS has recommended adoption of PACFISH Alternative 5,
because it offers the most comprehensive protection for anadromous fish. <STRONG> (Stephen Waste

<STRONG>Call For Oyster Disease Research Proposals
</STRONG><P>

	A solicitation for FY 1994 proposals to conduct oyster disease research was published in the
Federal Register on May 16, 1994.  NMFS receives $1.5 million annually to conduct a program
of oyster disease research.  These funds are administered out of the NOAA Chesapeake Bay
Office, Annapolis, Maryland.  Seventeen proposals from universities and state agencies from
Maine to South Carolina were funded with FY 1993 funds.  <P>

	The program is in response to infections of oysters on both the East and Gulf Coasts by the
parasites MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) and Dermo (Perkinsus marinus).  In Chesapeake Bay,
these parasites kill the oyster before it reaches marketable size and, as a result, the Bay oyster
catch has plummeted to record lows.  Long Island hatcheries in recent years have also suffered
from extensive, poorly-understood, juvenile oyster mortality. <P>

	Since 1989, NMFS has funded a competitive extramural program to investigate aspects of the
life cycle of oyster pathogens, physiological and genetic factors influencing resistance, and
management strategies such as oyster reef restoration to enhance survival of the American oyster,
Crassostrea virginica, in Northeastern states.  One recent accomplishment has been the
development of a technique for culturing Dermo, which for the first time enables lab-based
experimentation with Dermo. For more information, contact <STRONG>Ms. Bess Gillellan (410-267-5660).
</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>Effort Beginning to Update Chesapeake Bay Bathymetry  
</STRONG><P>

	The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office has taken the lead in organizing an interagency effort to
update Chesapeake Bay bathymetry information.  The NOAA Office met in mid-May with
officials from Maryland state agencies, the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program Office, and the Coast
and Geodetic Survey of NOAA's National Ocean Service to begin defining user needs, project
objectives, and logistics.  <P>

	Decades of shoreline erosion and sedimentation in tributaries and channels limit the value of
existing bathymetry data.  The vintage of depth data used on nautical charts dates from pre-1940
for a large portion of the northern Bay; some data are from 100-year-old lead line surveys.  <P>

	More accurate depth information is increasingly important for habitat protection and restoration
efforts of the multi-agency state/Federal Chesapeake Bay Program.  For example, accurate
bathymetry is needed to estimate acreages of potential submerged aquatic vegetation habitat and
to screen the Bay for suitable sites for oyster reef creation.  <P>

While the interagency project may eventually cover the entire tidal Bay and tributaries, it is
expected to focus on Maryland waters initially, beginning as early as spring, 1995.<STRONG>  (Bess
Gillellan, 410-267-5660).
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>New Catch-and-Release Video -- "Fishing for a Future"</STRONG><P>

	An excellent new 30-minute video on catch-and-release fishing, entitled "Fishing for a Future," is
now available.  Co-produced by the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office and Maryland Sea Grant, the
video features footage with George Reiger at a tuna-tagging tournament in Watchapreague, VA;
Bob Lippson amberjack fishing at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay; shark tag-and-release fishing
out of Ocean City, MD, with Capt. Mark Sampson and John Riggins; and cod fishing out of
Gloucester, MA, with Capt. Tom Hill.  A reference card on catch-and-release techniques and an
ethical angling sticker come with the video.  <P>

	Copies are available for $5.00 by check (payable to University of Maryland Sea Grant College)
sent with return mailing address to:  Maryland Sea Grant, Fishing for a Future, 0112 Skinner
Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD  20742.  For more information on the video and
other resources on the catch-and-release ethic, contact<STRONG> John Jacobs</STRONG> at the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office in Annapolis <STRONG>(410-267-5660).
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>These items have been prepared by the Office of Habitat Protection (F/HP), National
Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, tel.

<code><STRONG>D.  Southwest Region</STRONG><P>
<P>
	The Southwest Region with its office in Long Beach,
California has relatively little natural estuarine habitat left
to conserve.  Consequently, it focuses on protecting and
enhancing the remaining coastal wetlands, anadromous fish
habitats, reef environments, and several offshore fisheries.  The
Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) in La Jolla,
California conducts habitat studies that include research on the
wetland dependency of coastal marine fish, fishing activities,
and natural events on the offshore and coastal fisheries of the
region.  Marine mammal research is also a key element of its

      Regional Hazardous Material Spill Contingency Planning</B><P>
Throughout 1992 and 1993, regional habitat conservation staff
participated in a series of Area Contingency Planning meetings
dealing with hazardous material spill issues relative to regional
(California and Hawaii) fish and wildlife habitat issues.  The
result was the development of maps of California (county-by-county)
and the western Pacific (Hawaii) reflecting the different
sensitivity of various habitats to hazardous material spills. 
These maps are designed for the use of the Coast Guard Regional
Response Team On-scene Coordinators during hazardous materials
spill situations.  This effort involved NMFS cooperation with the
Coast Guard, State and Federal resource agencies, and State Offices
of Oil Spill Prevention and Response.<P>

As a result of NMFS' participation in the Hawaiian planning
process, the habitat conservation staff received a Certificate of

               Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project</B><P>
The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project (SMBRP) was organized
after the Bay was included in the National Estuary Program and a
1988 management conference made all interested parties aware of the
Bay's problems and potential solutions.  Currently NMFS serves on
the Management Committee, the Technical Committee, and co-chairs
the Marine Habitat Subcommittee for the SMBRP.  These committees
function as the focal point for the development of solutions for
problems relative to the affected natural resources and are
coordinating mechanisms for all the agencies having management
responsibilities relating to the Bay.  Working together with the
other committees, a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan
(CCMP) was to be produced by late 1993.<P>
<P>
The late 1993 completion date for the CCMP was accelerated to mid
1993 in order to take advantage of a proposed 1994 State bond
measure that could provide funding for the implementation of the
plan.  Draft elements of the plan were presented to the Management
Committee during the latter part of 1992.<P>

            San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Activities</B><P>

	In 1974, when the California Coastal Commission (CCC) reviewed the
application by Southern California Edison for expansion of the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), there was little
information available on the potential impacts on the marine
environment of nuclear generation plants. As a consequence, a Marine Review Committee
(MRC) was established to develop and conduct a comprehensive field
study of the impacts associated with the operation of the new units.
<P>
The final report of the MRC, completed in 1989, concluded that
significant adverse effects were associated with the operation of
SONGS.  Those identified impacts included a substantial reduction
in standing stock of several fish populations in the southern
California Bight and adverse impacts to the kelp community of the
nearby San Onofre kelp bed.  The MRC also concluded that proposed
changes in operation of the cooling system would create further
environmental impacts and were not cost-effective.<P>
<P>
NMFS is now providing direct input along with Federal and State
resource and regulatory entities for the design and implementation
of an overall mitigation package.  To mitigate existing and future
environmental impacts from these new units, CCC approved a plan
which included the requirement for the restoration of 150 acres of
wetlands and construction of a 300-acre artificial reef with
kelp.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>
        Experimental Eelgrass Transplant in San Diego Bay</B><P>
The Le Meridien property eelgrass transplant project, utilizing a
new NMFS technique for the construction of an eelgrass transplant
site, was completed during 1990.  The experiment was to transform
a deep-water area to a depth suitable for the establishment of
eelgrass.  To accomplish this objective, a 180-foot-long submerged
rock dike was constructed in water approximately -10 to -12 feet
deep (MLLW) at a site near the Coronado Bridge in San Diego Bay. 
Sand fill was placed behind the structure to establish a planting
elevation of -5 to -7 feet deep (MLLW.)<P>
<p>
Fish monitoring at the site has suggested that this technique
offers considerable potential for the enhancement of fishery
resources.  The inclusion of new rock habitat has resulted in the
establishment of several fish species typically found in open coast
reef communities.  Diver observations indicate that these species
apparently are taking advantage of the rich food resource found in
the adjacent eelgrass bed.  Further study could prove this
experimental transplant technology to be a viable fishery habitat
mitigation option.<P>
<P>
Since clean sand was used as the fill material, experiments
utilizing nitrogen-enriched fertilizers to enhance growth rates
were conducted.  The preliminary results of this work indicated
little effect.<P>
<P>
This transplant and other eelgrass vegetated areas of San Diego Bay
experienced severe winter die-back in the later part of 1992. 
Monitoring will provide information regarding whether this dieback
is related to seasonal factors or is more long-term.<P>

<B>
         Bay Farm Island Borrow Pit in San Francisco Bay</B><P>
Bay Farm Island was created several years ago by "borrowing"
material dredged from San Francisco Bay.  Approximately 20 million
cubic yards were removed, leaving a 480-acre pit approximately 30
feet deep.  The Corps became interested in examining the pit as a
potential disposal site for dredged material, especially
contaminated material.  They began preliminary biological work in
the fall of 1989.  Multiple attempts to get COE interested in
jointly examining the site as a NOAA/COE MOA fishery enhancement
project failed.  NMFS is interested in restoring eelgrass habitat
over the pit once it is filled and capped.  The pit probably has a
15 million cubic yard capacity.  It would provide an alternative to
disposal at Alcatraz and would serve as a suitable disposal site
until EPA formally designates an offshore deepwater dredge spoil
disposal site.<P>
<P>
The Port of Oakland and COE are seriously considering the borrow
pit as an alternative disposal site for the Oakland Harbor
deepening project.  It is still unclear whether they are
considering it as a one-time confined aquatic disposal site (CAD)
and would then cap it for restoration.  Another option which may be
looked at is a multi-user CAD site for use over several years.<P>
<P>
The COE has also contracted a study to determine the utilization of
the pit itself.  They have been looking at sea bottom fauna and
fish utilization of the water column and they have been using
gillnets set at various depths to determine fish species present. 
COE will trawl the pit in 1993 to check the set-net data.<P>

                 Gravel Mining in Coastal Streams</B><P>
NMFS continued its efforts to improve the management of gravel
mining in coastal streams.  Gravel mining removes spawning gravels
and alters the fluvial geomorphology of rivers, often resulting in
the degradation of anadromous spawning and rearing habitat.  River
areas with extensive gravel mining typically become severely
braided and shallow with little or no rearing habitat.  A Regional
NMFS Gravel Management Policy was adopted in January 1991 to
provide guidance and consistency in project reviews.<P>
<P>
In California, gravel mining is managed by county government. 
Therefore, NMFS has been providing comments as a trustee agency for
salmonids through the county permitting process in Del Norte,
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Sonoma counties.  Principal rivers in
these counties include the Smith, Klamath, Trinity, Eel, Mad,
Garcia, Gualala, and Russian Rivers.  In cases where a COE permit
is also required, NMFS provides comments through the COE
process.<P>
<P>
Largely due to the efforts of NMFS, the California Department of
Fish and Game, and environmental groups, all four counties are now
developing and/or refining Environmental Impact Reviews (EIR) that
include comprehensive impact assessments and gravel mining
management plans.  Each plan gives careful consideration to the
potential impacts of gravel mining to salmonids, and includes
extensive environmental impact monitoring.  NMFS will continue to
work with the counties to ensure that gravel mining management
provides adequate protection of anadromous resources.<P>

                    Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) on Sacramento River- Fish Passage Program</B><P>

	The Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) was constructed in 1964 on the upper Sacramento River in the northern portion of California's Central Valley.  RBDD is located 243 river miles above San
Francisco Bay.  Many investigators in the 1970's and early 1980's attributed much of the decline of anadromous fisheries in the upper Sacramento River to construction and operation of the RBDD.  This
resulted in the formulation of the RBDD Fish Passage Program in 1983 by the fisheries and water agencies.<P>
<P>
NMFS Southwest Region's Habitat staff has contributed extensively
to the Fish Passage Program during the past ten years.  They
identified three major problems: 1) inadequate screening of
downstream migrating juvenile salmonid fishes at the intake to the
Tehama-Colusa Canal; 2) substantial mortality on downstream
migrating juvenile salmonids that remain in the river but are
forced to pass under the RBDD gates; and 3) delay and blockage of
upstream migrating spawning adult salmonids.<P>
<P>
NMFS Southwest and Northwest Regional staffs provided biological
criteria and engineering specifications for fish screens to solve
the fish passage problems.  Consequently, a 600-foot long array of
drum screens has been constructed to replace the existing louver
fish screens which annually "leaked" an average of 500,000 juvenile
salmon into the Tehama Colusa Canal.  The new screen system, the
largest facility of its kind, should especially improve passage of
winter-run fry.<P>
<P>
NMFS will continue to work with the operators to ensure that the
system is operated effectively in the wide variety of flow
conditions that the project experiences.  Full evaluation will
probably be delayed until irrigation season due to low diversion
flows during drought.<P>
<P>
Addressing and correcting the remaining fish passage problems at
RBDD have been assigned to a group called the Planning Coordination
Team on which NMFS staff has played a critical role.  The Team
developed a list of alternatives which include variously-sized, new
left-bank fish ladders, a permanent mid-dam ladder and
modifications to the right ladder.  These alternatives are now
being reviewed in an appraisal-level study to determine the
preferred alternative.<P>

<P>
An alternative that is very attractive to NMFS and other fisheries
agencies employs a bank of Archimedes screws to pump water into the
Tehama-Colusa Canal headworks rather than using the RBDD to divert
the river by gravity.  This would allow the dam gates to be raised
out of the river year-round resulting in virtually unimpeded
upstream and downstream fish passage.  This is the only alternative
under consideration that remedies the combined impacts of delay and
blockage of upstream migrating adult fish and the estimated 50%
mortality of downstream juvenile migrants which pass under the dam
gates.  However, there is significant opposition to this
alternative due to the costs of pumping being passed on to the
water users.<P>
<P>
In 1992, the Bureau of Reclamation allocated money for a
500-cubic-foot-per-second (cfs) pilot, archimedes screw pumping
plant to begin research to:<P>
<P>
     1.   Identify the feasibility and potential problems of using
          either an archimedes screw pump and/or a helical pump in
          anticipation of a full-scale design of a pumping plant at
          RBDD,<P>
<p>
     2.   Determine if the plant could provide low-volume,
          winter-time water deliveries while the RBDD gates are
          raised.<P>
<P>
The Bureau began with an ambitious schedule of construction from
spring through fall of 1993.  Potential hydraulic problems were
identified during the summer.  NMFS and the other agencies
recommended a more methodical approach to the problems identified
including physical model testing.  The Bureau decided to proceed,
however, they did agree to field verification of flows in the fall. 
The fall flows confirmed the hydraulic problems and, in late
December, an emergency design review recommended that the project
be modified and model tested.  This delayed the project by a year. 
NMFS will be heavily involved in the redesign, model testing, and
further developing of testing procedures for the experimental
plant.<P>

<B>
          Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) on Sacramento River</B><P>

	The GCID pumping operation is the largest and oldest on the
Sacramento River and is believed to be the largest source of
juvenile salmon mortality on the river below the RBDD.  The
existing fish screens have never worked properly and do not meet
the current fish screen criteria of NMFS and California Department
of Fish and Game.  In addition, recent changes in the Sacramento
River stream bed have altered the hydrology of the fish screen
bypass so that at lower river flows the channel leading from the
screens back to the river can become a dead end "predation
sink."<P>
<P>
In late 1989, GCID's consultant with the close cooperation of the
fishery agencies, completed a preliminary assessment of alternative
fish screen sites and designs.  NMFS, other fishery agencies, and
fishery conservation groups met often to discuss implementation of
the preferred alternative and to adopt interim measures to reduce
fishery problems at the screening facility.<P>
<P>
In 1991, GCID applied for a permit to dredge the oxbow at its
pumping site.  So, under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
(ESA), COE entered formal consultation with NMFS regarding
potential impacts of the dredge permit application on winter-run
chinook salmon.  NMFS concluded the operation of the diversion was
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook
salmon and the construction of an alternative was proposed.  GCID
failed to accept the alternative offered by NMFS and did not apply
for authorization under Section 10 of the ESA to "take" winter-run
at its pumping station.  As a result, COE denied GCID's application
to dredge.<P>
<P>
NMFS also sought injunctive relief in Federal Court under Section
9 of the ESA to curtail the "taking" of juvenile winter-run at
GCID's facility.  A Preliminary Injunction was issued limiting GCID
pumping to a level that would improve protection for winter-run fry
and juveniles.  NMFS returned to Federal Court seeking a permanent
injunction against GCID until it complies with the ESA.  The
Permanent Injunction was granted.<P>
<P>
In February and March 1993, GCID, NMFS and CDFG staff met to forge
a Stipulated Agreement which would allow reduced pumping by GCID
until the design and construction of the new screen facilities were
completed.  In addition to reduced pumping, GCID was also obligated
to improve hydraulic conditions for fish passage in the pumping
plant intake and bypass channels.  These improvements will provide
considerable improvement in juvenile survival until the new screen
can be put in place.<P>
<P>
During the spring, a contractor was selected to complete the
conceptual design and Environmental Impact Review.  This contract
is scheduled to be completed in 1994.  NMFS staff will continue to
participate in reviews of the progress of this contract.<P>

                  Central Valley Project Reform Act (Miller-Bradley Bill P.L. 102-575)</B><P>

	Over the years, it became evident that the Central Valley Project
(CVP) was no longer serving the best economic interests of
California.  After an extensive drought, many recognized that one
of the least expensive and least environmentally damaging sources
of drought control would be for CVP farmers to conserve water or to
fallow fields and voluntarily sell the saved water.  Unfortunately,
Federal law forbade CVP water from being used outside the CVP
Service Area which excluded most of the Bay Area and Southern
California.<P>
<P>
On October 30, 1992, President Bush signed Public Law 575 beginning
a new era in Federal water policy.  Title 34 of this bill is the
Central Valley Project Improvement Act, the most significant step
ever taken toward the reform of the water project which has been
perhaps the single greatest environmental disaster in the history
of California.<P>
<P>
NMFS Habitat Conservation Division staff reviewed several
modifications of the bill and also presented supporting testimony
before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in
Washington, D.C.<P>
<P>
The new law, known as Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, has the
following among its provisions:<P>
<P>
     o    Establishes fish and wildlife protection as a"co-equal
 		  project purpose" of the CVP.<P>
<P>
     o    Dedicates 800,000 acre feet (af) of water annually to
          fish and wildlife.<P>
<p>
     o    Requires the construction of "hardware fixes" such as for
          improved fish screens at GCID, spawning gravel
          replenishment, and a temperature control device at Shasta
          Dam.<P>
<P>
     o    Establishes a $50 million fish and wildlife restoration
          fund to help pay for "hardware fixes" and purchase
          additional water for fish and wildlife.<P>
<P>
     o    Makes permanent a temporary order providing at least
          340,000 af annually for the Trinity River.<P>
<P>
     o    Guarantees wildlife refuges an adequate supply of
          water.<P>
<P>
     o    Requires the preparation and implementation of a plan to
          double Central Valley anadromous fisheries stocks by
          2002.  When this Plan is submitted to the Secretary of
          Interior in 1995, even more water than the 800,000 af may
          be directed to fisheries restoration.<P>
<P>
     o    Requires the preparation of a study regarding the
          feasibility of restoring flows in the Upper San Joaquin
          River.<P>
<P>
     o    Precludes new water contracts until fish and wildlife
          obligations have been met.<P>
<P>
     o    Allows CVP growers to sell conserved water on the open
          market anywhere within California with limited regulation
          from agricultural water districts.<P>
<P>
The Bureau of Reclamation and USFWS have been given Joint Lead in
carrying out the provisions of the Bill.  NMFS is a cooperating
agency in the effort to produce the Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement required by October 1995.  Further, NMFS is
working cooperatively with the California Department of Fish and
Game and FWS to establish the fish and wildlife water needs for
allocation of the 800,000 af in 1993.<P>

          Hawaii Geothermal Project (HGP) Environmental Impact Statement</B><P>
	
	In August 1991, the Department of Energy (DOE) published a Notice
of Intent to prepare an EIS for the Hawaii Geothermal Project
(HGP).  NMFS was invited to be a cooperating agency in developing
the EIS.  Staff attended a meeting in San Francisco to discuss the
project and to identify environmental issues and resources which
they thought would be potentially impacted by the project.  By the
end of the year, NMFS had given tentative approval to participate
as a cooperating agency in developing the EIS, primarily because of
its mandated responsibilities concerning the inter-island submarine
cable portion of the project.<P><P>
NMFS accepted the invitation from DOE to work as cooperating agency
in developing an EIS for the HGP.  An initial scoping meeting of
cooperating agencies was held in late March in Honolulu.  A series
of ten public meetings was held throughout the State of Hawaii
during the spring.  A workshop to begin development of the EIS was
held on July 16, 1992 .  Staff were concerned that the working
draft of the Implementation Plan was too general and did not
identify many of the potential project impacts in the nearshore
marine environment.<P>

              Survey of Oroluk Atoll and Minto Reef</B><P>
At the request of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), an
expedition was organized through the South Pacific Regional
Environment Program (SPREP) of the South Pacific Commission and the
East-West Center, University of Hawaii, to survey the marine
resources of two remote atolls in the Eastern Caroline Islands. 
The surveys were to inventory the marine resources and habitats of
Oroluk Atoll and Minto Reef.  These data were to be used in
establishing the sites as protected areas.  Staff was requested to
participate in the expedition team.<P>
<P>
Field work was carried out at Oroluk Atoll and Minto Reef from
November 28 to December 6, 1990.  Staff was responsible for
underwater surveys of reef fishes and their habitats, as well as
sea turtle abundance at the two atolls.<P>
<P>
A paper entitled "Sea Turtle Survey at Oroluk Atoll and Minto Reef"
was prepared by staff.  After outside review, the paper was
submitted to Marine Turtle Newsletter and was published in the
October 1991 (No. 55) edition.  A paper entitled "Survey of Reef
Fishes and Their Habitats at Oroluk Atoll and Minto Reef" was
finalized in December 1991.  Both papers were submitted to FSM and
SPREP for inclusion in the final Expedition Report.<P>

            Resort Hotel and Marina at Ngesaol, Koror</B><P>
In 1989, a developer proposed dredging and filling over 400 acres
of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitat for a resort, golf
course, and a marina at Ngesaol.  Early scoping meetings in which
NMFS participated were successful in substantially reducing the
scale of the project.<P>
<P>
Despite the above scoping process, the applicant submitted a permit
application to COE proposing the destruction and alteration of 200
acres of nearshore fishery habitat for a resort hotel and marina
complex without the golf course.  Habitat staff participated in a
multi-agency site survey in April 1991.  NMFS and other resource
agencies recommended the permit be denied.  The Corps concurred and
informed the applicant that a Federal EIS would be necessary unless
the applicant modified the project such that non-water dependent
fills were avoided.<P>
<P>
The applicant submitted a revised permit application for a
substantially scaled-down project but still requiring the loss of
approximately 86 acres of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef
habitat.  NMFS recommended denial of the revised permit and was
supported again by the other resource agencies.  NMFS also informed
the applicant that should all non-water dependent fills be
eliminated from the proposed project and compensatory mitigation
developed for unavoidable loss of habitat, NMFS would reconsider
its position of recommending denial.<P>
<P>
In August 1992, the applicant submitted a fourth revised project
application further reducing the project to 2.7 acres of fill and
13.5 acres of dredged channels.  NMFS concurred with the further
downsizing but continued to recommend mitigation for the Section
404 activities.  The COE agreed and the applicant is now developing
a mitigation plan.<P>

<P><B>Restoration of Coral Reef Deemed a Success</B><P>
<P>

Two vessels, the<I>M/V Alec Owen Maitland</I>, a 155-foot oil field supply vessel and the <I>M/VElpis</I>, a 470-foot cargo freighter, ran aground on a coral reef system within the Florida Keys NationalMarine Sanctuary in October and November 1989. The groundings and salvage significantly injured the reefstructure and threatened living marine resources. Out of court settlements in 1991 resulted in $ 2.74 million torestore the reef system.  After engineering planning and design, a team assembled from NOAA's DamageAssessment and Restoration Program (the Restoration Center of the National Marine Fisheries Service, theDamage Assessment Center of the National Ocean Service, and the General Counsel for Natural Resources) andNOAA's Sanctuaries and Reserves Division participated in an unprecedented effort to restore the damaged coralreef habitats. The goals were to stabilize the reef structure and prevent additional injury from loose debris. Theteam also wanted to rehabilitate part of the living portion of the reef system and make it indistinguishable fromnatural, unimpacted reefs.<P>

<P>
At the Maitland site (cover photograph), a three-dimensional relief habitat composed of reef replicating armorunits was created.  The units are concrete structures cast with different size rocks and boulders to provide a stable,natural framework on which transplanted corals, coral larvae, and other organisms may colonize, restoring theinjured area's habitat value and providing a natural framework for recovery.  Forty of the large, pre-cast concretereef units were placed in the injured area following removal of rubble caused by the groundings.<P>

<P>
At the Elpis site, quarried limestone boulders were used to fill in excavations in the reef. Sand was poured aroundthe boulders to form a continuous surface. The structures recreate the typical three-dimensional habitat relief ofnatural Florida Keys reefs. During the next several years, sanctuary biologists will transplant corals, sea fans, andsponges into the restored area with the goal of accelerating the rate of recovery by years or decades. <B>TimOsborn (301) 713-0174</B><P>

<B>Magnuson Act Reauthorization Progresses with House Approval of H.R. 39</B><P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, 1995, the House amended and passed H.R. 39, reauthorization of the Magnuson Fishery Conservationand Management Act (MFCMA), by a vote of 388-37.  The bill would amend and reauthorize the MFCMAthrough 1999 and provide for increased habitat conservation activities by the regional fishery management councilsand the Secretary of Commerce.  All councils would be required to submit an amendment for each fisherymanagement plan to include a description of essential fishery habitat for approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Federal agencies would be required to consult with the Secretary regarding any action that  may result in the"destruction or adverse modification of such essential fishery habitat." The Secretary would be required tocomment on and make recommendations regarding such actions; and the Federal agency would be required toprovide a detailed, written response to the Secretary. These provisions received formal Administration support ina Statement of Policy on H.R. 39, released September 18th by the Executive Office of the President, Office ofManagement and Budget. Another provision would make mandatory a previously discretionary provision requiringcouncils to include, in fishery management plans, measures that would minimize, to the extent practicable, anyadverse impact of fishing on essential fish habitat, and a requirement that Regional Councils evaluate the impact offishing gear on habitat. The Administration supported this provision but recommended that fishery managementplans should also include measures to minimize impacts from activities other than fishing. On the Senate side, thelast two field hearings on S. 39 were conducted by the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation onJuly 15 and 17 in Charleston, SC and Morehead City, NC. A Senate mark-up will be held once a substitute bill is developed.  Committee staff are predicting mark-up in early 1996. <B>Ralph Lopez (301)713-2325</B><P>

<B>Progress Continues on Habitat Strategic Plan</B> <P>

<P>

On September 28, 1995, Rollie Schmitten, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, approved the release of aPublic Review Draft of "A Strategic Plan to Strengthen the National Marine Fisheries Service's National HabitatProgram." This new Strategic Plan contains 25 major recommendations and 80 individual actions to beimplemented to strengthen the NMFS habitat program. These recommendations cover the areas ofConservation,Restoration, Understanding, and Management Improvements.  In early October, the Public Review Draft wasdistributed to about 150 constituents involved in the numerous public workshops that NMFS hosted to develop thePlan. Comments are due by mid-December. NMFS plans to issue the final Plan in early 1996. <B>JimBurgess (301) 713-2325</B><P>

<B>First Objective Completed in Essential Fish Habitat Initiative</B>
<P>

In FY 1995, the Office of Habitat Protection initiated an effort aimed at identifing essential fish habitat inanticipation of proposed Magnuson Act amendments.  A first milestone, a demonstration projecton summerflounder, was completed in September.  The project was a cooperative venture between the Office of HabitatProtection and the National Ocean Survey's Strategic Environmental Assessments Division, to develop amethodology for identifying and assessing important habitats for NMFS managed species.  The project reviewedenvironmental and biological data, geographic information systems and desktop mapping software, and evaluativetools available within NOAA.  A series of maps, demonstrating one methodology that may be useful fordeveloping descriptive map products to identify essential habitats, were produced. A summary report wasprepared that reviews the methodologies tested and results obtained, availability of data, and conclusions andrecommendations based on the demonstration project. The report will provide a basis for expansion of theEssential Fish Habitat Initiative in FY 1996. <B>Ramona Schreiber (301) 713-2325</B>

<P><B>Habitat to be Central Focus of Upcoming ASMFC Workshop</B><P>

<P>
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) will sponsor a Habitat Managers Workshop in March1996.  Purposes of the workshop are to: (1) identify state and Federal habitat managers that the ASMFC cancoordinate with; (2) provide habitat managers with information about current ASMFC fishery management plans;(3) inform habitat managers how to become more involved in the fishery management process at the Federal,ASMFC, and state levels); (4) identify information habitat managers and fishery managers need from each other;(5) provide an opportunity for technology exchange; and (6) develop a communication process between fishery andhabitat managers.  The tentative agenda calls for eight sessions: (1) Overview of Fisheries Management; (2)Existing Creative Tools for Fish Habitat Management; (3) Implications of Identifying Essential Fish Habitat; (4)Restoration or Enhancement for Fisheries; (5) Linking Habitat Loss to Fisheries Impacts; (6) Review of Issues andIdentification of Research Needs; (7) What Kind of Information Do Habitat Managers Need?; and (8) Wrap-up. Regional and Headquarters Habitat representatives are on the Workshop Steering Committee.  <B>Lee Crockett(410) 267-5672</B><P>

<B>NMFS' FY 1996 Habitat Budget Initiative Still Pending in Congress</B><P>
<P>

The President's FY 1996 Budget contained two major initiatives to enhance the resources needed to begin toimprove the effectiveness of the NMFS habitat program. The Budget contained a $3.6 million increase in the"Habitat Conservation" line item to enhance the base habitat program activities as well as to begin to meet therequirements outlined in the Administration's "essential fish habitat" initiative to improve the management of fishery resources under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  In addition, the budgetcontained $1.5 million for base program funds for NOAA's Restoration Center, which is part of the NMFS'Office of Habitat Protection. These funds, which are contained in the "Resource Information" line item, areessential if NMFS is to continue its partnership with other NOAA offices for implementation of the DamageAssessment and Restoration Program and other restoration efforts. The House and Senate have provided only levelfunding for the "Habitat Conservation" line item, and only slight increases in the "Resource Information" lineitem, which will not accommodate the President's full increase request for habitat restoration. In addition,Chesapeake studies were reduced by $900 thousand in the House markup and by $300 thousand in the Senatemarkup, which will greatly limit pur habitat work in Chesapeake Bay. <B>Jim Burgess (301)713-2325</B><P>

<B>NOAA Clears Mitigation Banking Guidance  - Final Release Near</B><P>
<P>

Following evaluation of the comments received on the public review draft of the Federal interagency guidance onmitigation, NMFS and other Federal agencies held discussions on how the guidance should be amended to resolveconcerns raised in the public comments.  Major concerns included a misinterpretation of the example of 15%advanced debiting of banks as a set limit; a perception that the interagency coordination procedures would slowdown the development of the bank; and a need for more guidance on how mitigation banks fit into the establishedprocess of avoidance of wetland impacts, minimization of wetland impacts, and on-site compensatory mitigationfor unavoidable wetland impacts.  The guidance was revised to address these and other concerns, but the essencedid not change substantially.  NOAA signed the document in August and we are awaiting signature by Armybefore releasing it. Once released, NMFS will provide copies to all Offices with a memorandum offeringadditional guidance in implementation in accordance with NMFS habitat conservation policies. <B>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325</B>

<B>NMFS Raises Concerns About Proposed Corps Appeals Process</B>
<P>

NMFS reviewed and developed NOAA comments on the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) draft AdministrativeAppeals Process. The proposed process would allow administrative appeals of decisions made by the Corps aspart of their administration of the Clean Water Act Section 404 program.  Under the proposed process, appealabledecisions would include jurisdictional determinations, permit denials and conditions, and administrative penalties. The inclusion of permit conditions as an appealable decision was not part of the Clinton Administration's 1993Wetland Policy, and is of concern because permit conditions recommended by NMFS are an important tool inconserving fishery habitat.  NOAA's comments to the Corps expressed this concern, recommending that permitconditions be dropped from the list of appealable decisions. We also informed the Corps that should permitconditions remain on the list of appealable decisions, the final appeals process must recognize that Federal naturalresource statutes require full consultation with NMFS on any permit amended as a result of an appeal.  We willcontinue to work with the Corps to establish an appeals process that does not undermine NMFS' ability to protectimportant fish habitat. <B>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325</B><P>

<B>NMFS Works Closely With Corps on New Nationwide Permit</B><P>
<P>

On July 7 the Corps authorized a new nationwide permit that will allow the filling of up to 1/2 acre ofnon-tidal water or wetlands for the purpose of building or expanding a single-family home.  NMFS has beenworking with the Corps on the development of this permit and was responsible for the restriction of the permit tonon-tidal water and wetlands.  NMFS also recommended excluding anadromous fish spawning habitat, and severalother provisions that would have improved our ability to ensure that adverse impacts to fish habitat do not occur,but those provisions were not included in the current permit.  However, this nationwide permit, as well as all ofthe other nationwide permits, will be re-authorized by the Corps in 1996.  NMFS plans on making a renewedeffort to amend the new Nationwide at that opportunity. <B>Susan-Marie Stedman (301)713-2325</B><P>

<B>Concerns for Anadromous Fish Addressed in Review of Forest Service Hydropower Policy</B><P>
<P>

The Office of Habitat Priotection developed NMFS comments on the Forest Service's proposed policy onhydropower applications that addresses procedures for the administration of authorizations and the processing ofproposals for 240 hydropower projects affecting National Forest System lands. NMFS efforts to move fish pasthydropower sites on Forest Service lands are especially critical, since these lands embrace some of the lastremaining areas in the contiguous states where anadromous fish habitat still exists in a pristine state.  Therecurring theme of the policy was the devolution of authority from the Forest Service, a resource managementagency that shares NMFS concerns for the integrity of aquatic ecosystems.  NMFS comments recommended thatthe Forest Service withdraw the parts of their proposal that would exacerbate difficulties that already exist inmanaging fisheries under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing.  <B>Stephen Waste (301)713-2325</B><P>

<B>NMFS Reviews Proposed Legislation for Protection of Living Marine Resources</B><P>
<P>

The Office of Habitat Protection developed NMFS comments on the proposed Federal Power AdministrationTransfer Act that would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Energy to study and prepare plans to sell ortransfer the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Power Administrations out of Federal ownership. Althoughthe Act proposes to increase the responsiveness of the power administrations to local concerns, it does notcommunicate that ownership involves responsibility for protecting living marine resources, primarily anadromousfish. The Act would also require the Secretary of the Department of Energy to ignore Federal, state, and localenvironmental laws, describing them as "impediments" to the sales. We disagreed that compliance with existingFederal laws should be viewed an impediment to the Act.<P>

<P>
The Alaska Power Administration Sale Authorization Act would authorize the sale of two Federally licensedhydropower projects in Alaska, Eklutna and Snettisham, to the Alaska Power Authority. We supported this Actbecause it properly incorporates into law a 1991 Memorandum of Agreement entered into by NOAA and the Stateof Alaska regarding fish protection measures. The Act would also give the United States District Court for Alaskajurisdiction to review decisions pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement, as well as enforcement authority. Together, these provisions would preserve the fisheries management capabilities NMFS previously exercised underthe Federal Power Act, despite the change in jurisdiction resulting from the sale from a Federal to a state entity.<B>Stephen Waste (301) 713-2325</B>

<B>Recommendations for Habitat Conditions Submitted to Boston Harbor Navigation ImprovementProject</B>
<P>

NMFS' Northeast Region reviewed the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Boston HarborNavigation Improvement Project, one of the largest dredging projects ever undertaken in New England.  Itinvolves the removal of 1.1 million cubic yards of contaminated silt, 1.7 million cubic yards of clean parentmaterial, and 88,000 cubic yards of rock.  An additional 1.8 million cubic yards of clean material would bedredged to create in-channel disposal sites for the contaminated material, and the disposal sites would be cappedwith clean sand.  The Region compiled NOAA's comments on the Final Environmental Impact Statement,including input from the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the Office of Coastal ResourceManagement. Among other things, we recommended additional fish sampling at the disposal sites, development ofcontingency plans case the in-channel sites cannot contain all the contaminated material, feasibility investigationsof using turbidity control chutes during dredged material disposal, and development of a detailed long-term monitoring plan for the in-channel disposal sites. <B>Jon Kurland (508) 281-9204</B><P>

<B>Port Facility a Serious Threat to Habitat - NMFS Recommends Alternative Location</B><P>

<P>

NMFS' Northeast Region reviewed the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for a proposal by theMaine Department of Transportation to construct a new 95-acre port facility on Sears Island in Penobscot Bay,Maine. The project would result in substantial adverse effects to eelgrass beds, tidal flats, shellfish habitat, andfreshwater wetlands and wildlife habitat on Maine's largest undeveloped island. Over 200 people attended therecent public hearing for the project, which included about 130 speakers and lasted more than nine hours. TheDeputy Regional Director read a prepared statement at the hearing, saying the Sears Island proposal "would beone of the most damaging coastal development projects to occur in New England since modern environmentalstandards went into effect in the 1970s." NMFS is recommending that the Corps of Engineers deny a permit forSears Island, and that the applicant instead build the port at a nearby industrially-developed site that supportedcargo wharves in the 1930s.<B>Jon Kurland (508) 281-9204</B><P>

<B>Concerns for Anadromous Fish Support Decommission of Dam</B><P>
<P>

NMFS' Northeast Region submitted preliminary fishway prescriptions to the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) on the relicensing application for the Edwards Dam hydroelectric project on the KennebecRiver in Augusta, Maine.  The project impounds and degrades a 15-mile stretch of river that is historic spawninghabitat for anadromous fish. The area between Edwards Dam and the next upstream dam constitutes the historicupstream migratory limit of four anadromous species. Those species do not use conventional fishways, sobreaching the dam is the only viable way to provide fish passage. NMFS recommended that FERC deny therelicensing application and order the project decommissioned and removed. This is the first hydroelectric projectnationally to test the scope of FERC's authority (and willingness) to order dam removal at the licensee's expense. <B>Jon Kurland (508) 281-9204</B><P>

<B>NMFS Advocates Expansion of Shellfish Aquaculture Operation</B><P>
<P>

Spatco, Ltd. is a small aquaculture venture in Point Judith Pond, Rhode Island that produces American oysters,hard clams and bay scallops for the commercial seafood industry.  In response to a proposal to expand theoperation, NMFS' Northeast Region conducted an environmental assessment. The evaluation considered possibleimpacts of the project on local habitat quality and hydrodynamic characteristics and phytoplankton abundance andconcluded that the project would have only minimal adverse impact, and  could provide habitat benefits as well.  Inparticular, the additional cages would create more hard substrate that would provide crevices and other refuge forsmall or juvenile finfish, crustacean and molluscan species.  The area also would increase available spawningsubstrate for organisms with demersal, adhesive eggs. The expanded operation may promote improved waterquality of this nutrient-enriched habitat due to increased grazing by the growing shellfish.  NMFS' support of thisproject at a public hearing was instrumental in obtaining the necessary permits. <B>Cori Collins (203)783-4213</B><P>

NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office (NCBO) continues to support Bay research projects, begun in 1985 with the firstChesapeake Bay Studies funding from Congress.  In FY 1995, NCBO supported the following efforts: ChesapeakeBay Stock Assessment Committee, $540,000; Chesapeake Bay Environmental Effects Committee, $600,000;Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Support $60,000; and Bioavailability of Organic Nitrogen in Lower ChesapeakeBay Waters, $55,000.  <B>Bess Gillelan (410) 267-5661</B>

<B>Nutrient Loading, Chlorophyll Levels, and Atmospheric Deposition of Nitrogen to Coastal WatersAddressed in NCBO Water Quality Research</B>
<P>
<P>
NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office (NCBO) is investigating the condition of habitats in Chesapeake Bay and itsmajor tributaries.  NCBO is analyzing water quality monitoring data to determine whether reductions in nutrients(nitrogen and phosphorus) can be detected in the Bay and, if so, whether they are playing a role in improvingfisheries habitat. The common belief is that increased nutrient concentrations over several decades has led toincreased algal (phytoplankton) growth and subsequent decreased dissolved oxygen (DO) during the summer whenthe algae die and decompose. Bay DO levels in summer had increased in recent decades, limiting bottom andpelagic habitat for estuarine biota.  Monitoring data are collected through grants from EPA's Chesapeake BayProgram and analyzed by NCBO for trends in oxygen, chlorophyll (as a measure of algal growth), nitrogen,phosphorus, and other factors.   Images are  compiled from these data to give visual representations of habitatquality.<P>

Surface chlorophyll levels are also measured through a remote sensing project sponsored jointly by NCBO and theMaryland Sea Grant Program.  In its sixth year, the project has begun to show year-to-year patterns of spring andsummer algal blooms. These data will assist in evaluation of the Bay's response to decreasing nutrient loads to theBay over the long term.<P>

NCBO is addressing the issue of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in the Bay watershed in conjunction NOAA'sOffice of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's Air Resource Laboratory (ARL), which has been investigating thisphenomenon for several years using the Bay watershed as a case study.  This issue has become increasinglyimportant to regional water quality efforts designed to meet the Bay-wide goal of reducing nitrogen andphosphorus by 40% by the year 2000.  As much as 20-40% of the total nitrogen entering the Bay is estimated tocome from atmospheric deposition (a combination of deposition directly to the water surface and to land areas andsubsequent runoff).  Atmospheric nitrogen is not yet factored into policies to meet the Bay-wide 40% nutrientreduction goal, but air pollution controls designed to reduce ground-level ozone will reduce nitrogen oxides andthereby help Bay states meet this goal and limit nitrogen and phosphorus input to the Bay beyond the year 2000. <B>Bess Gillelan (410) 267-5661</B>

<B>NCBO Works to Improve Habitat Sections in Chesapeake Bay Fishery  ManagementPlans</B><P>
<P>

NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office is working with other state and federal agencies of the Chesapeake Bay Program(CBP) to incorporate habitat management measures in the fishery management plans (FMP's) developed forChesapeake Bay fisheries under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.  Traditionally, habitat sections in the FMP's forthe CBP provided only general descriptions of the types of habitats used by fishery species, making little effort tosuggest management measures that might improve their habitats.  Recently, the CBP decided to strengthen itsFMP's by including more specific habitat requirements in new and revised Bay-wide FMP's, as they aredeveloped. A workgroup was established to develop a source document that will describe the habitat requirementsof fish stocks and provide needed background information on the types of activities that adversely impact thosehabitats. The source document will be reviewed by the CBP be signed by the member organizations, providing amechanism for states to either encourage or require adequate consideration of habitat impacts in all permitting decisions. <B>Anne Lange (410) 267-5675</B>

The project, a "beneficial use" of dredged material from the Baltimore approach channels, will restoreapproximately 1,100 acres of a mixed habitat island in Chesapeake Bay. Current plans call for creating a1,110-acre island which would consist of 50% wetlands and 50% uplands. Of the wetlands, 80% is proposed tobe low marsh, which has the highest habitat value for living marine resources.  NOAA's involvement is acooperative effort among NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office and Restoration Center, and NMFS's Northeast Regionand Southeast Fisheries Science Center's Beaufort Laboratory.  The Beaufort Laboratory has the lead forlong-term monitoring studies in which changes in structure and function will be measured, and the relative use ofcreated habitats by fisheries resources will be compared with natural habitats. <B>Tim Goodger (410)226-5771 or Lee Crockett (410) 267-5672</B><P>

On June 2, a ground-breaking ceremony was held at the Cooperative Oxford Maryland Laboratory.  NMFS andthe Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which have shared the Oxford Laboratory since 1987under a cooperative agreement, joined forces in a unique project to renovate the main building and add a wing. NOAA transferred approximately $720 thousand to the DNR for the renovation effort, and DNR provided in kindlabor to design and construct the new wing. NMFS Deputy Director and the Beaufort Laboratory Director, joinedMaryland officials and Maryland Senator Paul Sarbanes for the event. NOAA's Administrator agreed in 1994 to aplan to manage the NMFS element of the cooperative laboratory through the Beaufort Laboratory, with programguidance from NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office. The new program at the Oxford Laboratory will operate as adivision of the Beaufort Laboratory. New initiatives are being developed to strengthen the oyster disease researchprogram, initiate habitat restoration science efforts, and to coordinate with the DNR on its regional responses tomarine mammal strandings and sea turtle mortality around the Delmarva peninsula. <B>Bess Gillelan (410)267-5661</B><P>

<B>Habitat Restoration Saves Coral Reef Ecosystem in Florida Marine Sanctuary</B><P>
<p>

The <I>COLUMBUS ISELIN</I>, a 160-foot research vessel owned by the University of Miami, ran agroundon August 10, 1994 in the western portion of Looe Key Reef, within the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary. The ship remained on the spur and groove formations for two days, resulting in substantial destruction of livingcorals and reef biota and generating a large amount of coral rubble.  NOAA filed an administrative notice ofviolation against the University and assessed the maximum available civil penalty under the regulations. In May,the University agreed to pay the penalty.  This summer, NOAA's Restoration Center coordinated the removal ofcoral rubble from the site; such unconsolidated coral rubble is easily moved by winter storms and can causeadditional injury to surrounding healthy coral.  With the immediate threat of additional injury removed, focus willshift to stabilizing and restoring the coral spurs at the grounding site. <B>Erik Zobrist (301)713-0174</B><P>

<B>Interagency Effort Wins Restoration of Tidal Marsh at Hamilton Army Airfield</B><P>

<p>

This past summer, NMFS's Southwest Region initiated an active campaign with state and Federal natural resourceagencies for restoration of the Hamilton Army Airfield Base to tidal wetlands. The base is located approximately25 miles north of San Francisco on San Pablo Bay in the City of Novato. The base is being disposed by theDepartment of Army under the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 or BRAC 1. The airfield parcelcomprises approximately 700 acres of diked historic tidal salt marsh. There have been no attempts by the resourceagencies to collectively pool their efforts for obtaining and restoring the property to wetlands.  We saw thisopportunity and organized a focused effort by the agencies to have the property transferred and restored towetlands. The effort has met immediate success.  A state resource agency willingly stepped forward to serve asthe landowner. In addition, the Army has agreed to examine the feasibility of linking their contamination cleanupresponsibilities to the wetland restoration effort. The state and Federal agencies have agreed in principal on a setof fish and wildlife restoration goals and objectives. The Region also presented the project to the SouthwestImplementation Team of Coastal America and received their endorsement.  Efforts by the Region are now focusedon resolving flood control issues between the Army and the potential new landowner by proposing the Army useclean dredge spoils to isolate contamination on the parcel and transfer funds originally designated forcontamination cleanup to flood control.<B> Mark Helvey (310) 980-4079</B><P>

A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the Middle Waterway Restoration Pilot Project June 15, marking thesuccessful implementation of an industry-government-public partnership between Tacoma Simpson Kraft Companyand the natural resource trustees (the u.s. Fish and Wildlife Service; NOAA; the Washington Departments ofEcology, Fish and Wildlife, and Natural Resources; and the Puyallup and Muckleshoot Indian Tribes).  Project goals are to create productive and diverse estuarine habitats for fish and wildlife; and to provide an outdoorlaboratory for studying various planting strategies, monitoring protocols, and volunteer/ stewardship models forfuture natural resource restoration efforts in the region.  The 4.9 acre project will convert industrial uplands toestuarine upper intertidal wetlands, salt marsh and intertidal mud/sand habitats.  A riparian buffer and transitionzone will screen, protect, and support the diversity of the remnant Middle Waterway mudflats. To date, theproject has created 1.5 new acres of high intertidal habitat from an industrial fill adjacent to 1.9 acres of existingrelic tidal flats.  Salvaged intertidal plants have survived the hot Northwest summer.  A 600+ plant upland bufferplanting operation, supported mainly by volunteers, was completed October 21.

<B>NPDES General Permit For Alaskan Log Transfer Facilities a Cause for Alarm</B><P>

<P>

In Alaska, timber harvested on numerous coastal islands and isolated mainland areas is transported over short roadnetworks to termination point at salt water where the log bundles are transferred either into the saltwater or ontobarges or ocean-going vessels. These log transfer facilities (LTFs) generally consist of an upland logtruckunloading area and a device to transfer the log bundles. When the transfer is into the water there is usually anearby rafting area where log bundles are grouped and restrained against each other prior to towing them to millsor into the holds of ocean-going vessels. Section 404 permits are required for the intertidal modificationsnecessary to construct the facilities; and Section 402 (NPDES) permits for the discharge of bark and wood wasteinto nearshore habitat that occurs in the transfer process. Since the mid-1980s, comments on proposed LTFs andmodifications to existing facilities have been solicited through combined NPDES and Section 10/404 public noticesissued by the Corps of Engineers. The Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing to issue a NPDESgeneral permit (GP) for new and modified LTFs. NMFS's Alaska Region is concerned the GP will preclude theopportunity for agencies and other interested parties to comment on qualifying LTF proposals.  Opportunities torelocate facilities away from valuable shellfish habitat, eelgrass beds, nursery areas, etc. may be lost due to theuse of this GP. <B>Andrew Grossman (907) 586-7235</B><P>

<title>Mitigation Banking Guidance:  Memo</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#800080">

     MEMORANDUM TO THE FIELD <P>

<STRONG>	SUBJECT: Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use and Operation of Mitigation Banks</STRONG><P>

     
  <STRONG>   I.  Introduction</STRONG><P>

         <STRONG> A.  Purpose and Scope of Guidance.</STRONG><P>

          This document provides policy guidance for the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation for authorized adverse impacts to wetlands and other aquatic resources. This guidance is provided expressly to assist Federal personnel, bank sponsors, and others in meeting the requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the wetland conservation provisions of the Food Security Act (FSA) (i.e., "Swampbuster"), and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The policies and procedures discussed herein are consistent with current requirements of the Section 10/404 regulatory program and "Swampbuster" provisions and are intended only to clarify the applicability of existing requirements to mitigation banking.<P>

          The policies and procedures discussed herein are applicable to the establishment, use and  operation of public mitigation banks, as well as privately-sponsored mitigation banks, including third party banks (e.g. entrepreneurial banks).<P>

       <STRONG>   B.  Background.</STRONG><P>

	For purposes of this guidance, mitigation banking means the restoration, creation, enhancement and, in exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands and/or other aquatic resources expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar resources.<P>

          The objective of a mitigation bank is to provide for the replacement of the chemical, physical and biological functions of wetlands and other aquatic resources which are lost as a result of authorized impacts. Using appropriate methods, the newly established functions are quantified as mitigation "credits" which are available for use by the bank sponsor or by other parties to compensate for adverse impacts (i.e., "debits").  Consistent with mitigation policies established under the Council on Environmental Quality Implementing Regulations (CEQ regulations) [40 CFR Part 1508.20], and the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines) [40 CFR Part 230], the use of credits may only be authorized for purposes of complying with Section 10/404 when adverse impacts are unavoidable.  In addition, for both the Section 10/404 and "Swampbuster" programs, credits may only be authorized when on-site compensation is either not practicable or use of a mitigation bank is environmentally preferable to on-site compensation. Prospective bank sponsors should not construe or anticipate participation in the establishment of a mitigation bank as ultimate authorization for specific projects, as excepting such projects from any applicable requirements, or as preauthorizing the use of credits from that bank for any particular project.<P>

          Mitigation banks provide greater flexibility to applicants needing to comply with mitigation requirements and can have several advantages over individual mitigation projects, some of which are listed below:<P>

   <STRONG>  II.  Policy Considerations</STRONG><P>

	 The following policy considerations provide general guidance for the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks.  It is the agencies' intent that this guidance be applied to mitigation bank proposals submitted for approval on or after the effective date of this guidance and to those in early stages of planning or development. It is not intended that this policy be retroactive for mitigation banks that have already received agency approval. While it is recognized that individual mitigation banking proposals may vary, it is the intent of this guidance that the fundamental precepts be applicable to future mitigation banks.<P>

	For the purposes of Section 10/404, and consistent with the CEQ regulations, the Guidelines, and the Memorandum of Agreement Between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army Concerning the Determination of Mitigation under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, mitigation means sequentially avoiding impacts,  minimizing impacts, and compensating for remaining unavoidable impacts. Compensatory mitigation, under Section 10/404, is the restoration, creation, enhancement, or in exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands and/or other aquatic resources for the purpose of compensating for unavoidable adverse impacts. A site where wetlands and/or other aquatic resources are restored, created, enhanced, or in exceptional circumstances, preserved expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar resources is a <STRONG>mitigation bank.</STRONG><P>

	The policies set out in this document are not final agency action, but are intended solely as guidance. The guidance is not intended, nor can it be relied upon, to create any rights enforceable by any party in litigation with the United States. This guidance does not establish or affect legal rights or obligations, establish a binding norm on any party and it is not finally determinative of the issues addressed. Any regulatory decisions made by the agencies in any particular matter addressed by this guidance will be made by applying the governing law and regulations to the relevant facts.<P>
      
    	     <STRONG> B.  Planning Considerations.<P>
</STRONG>
     <STRONG>      1.  Goal setting.</STRONG><P>

          The overall goal of a mitigation bank is to provide economically efficient and flexible mitigation opportunities, while fully compensating for wetland and other aquatic resource losses in a manner that contributes to the long-term ecological functioning of the watershed within which the bank is to be located. <P>

     The goal will include the need to replace essential aquatic functions which are anticipated to be lost through authorized activities within the bank's service area. In some cases, banks may also be used to address other resource objectives that have been identified in a watershed management plan or other resource assessment. It is desirable to set the particular objectives for a mitigation bank (i.e., the type and character of wetlands and/or aquatic resources to be established) in advance of site selection. The goal and objectives should be driven by the anticipated mitigation need; the site selected should support achieving the goal and objectives.<P>

<STRONG>           2.  Site selection.</STRONG><P>

	 The agencies will give careful consideration to the ecological suitability of a site for achieving the goal and objectives of a bank, i.e., that it possess the physical, chemical and biological characteristics to support establishment of the desired aquatic resources and functions.  Size and location of the site relative to other ecological features, hydrologic sources (including the availability of water rights), and compatibility with adjacent land uses and watershed management plans are important factors for consideration.  It also is important that ecologically significant aquatic or upland resources (e.g., shallow sub-tidal habitat, mature forests), cultural sites, or habitat for Federally or State-listed threatened and endangered species are not compromised in the process of establishing a bank. Other significant factors for consideration include, but are not limited to, development trends (i.e., anticipated land use changes), habitat status and trends, local or regional goals for the restoration or protection of particular habitat types or functions (e.g., re-establishment of habitat corridors or habitat for species of concern), water quality and floodplain management goals, and the relative potential for chemical contamination of the wetlands and/or other aquatic resources.<P>

	Banks may be sited on public or private lands.  Cooperative arrangements between public and private entities to use public lands for mitigation banks may be acceptable. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to site banks on Federal, state, tribal or locally-owned resource management areas (e.g., wildlife management areas, national or state forests, public parks, recreation areas).The siting of banks on such lands may be acceptable if the internal policies of the public agency allow use of its land for such purposes, and the public agency grants approval.  Mitigation credits generated by banks of this nature should be based solely on those values in the bank that are supplemental to the public program(s) already planned or in place, that is, baseline values represented by existing or already planned public programs, including preservation value, should not be counted toward bank credits.<P>
          
	Similarly, Federally-funded wetland conservation projects undertaken via separate authority and for other purposes, such as the Wetlands Reserve Program, Farmer's Home Administration fee title transfers or conservation easements, and Partners for Wildlife Program, cannot be used for the purpose of generating credits within a mitigation bank.  However, mitigation credit may be given for activities undertaken in conjunction with, but supplemental to, such programs in order to maximize the overall ecological benefit of the conservation project.<P>

          <STRONG>3.  Technical feasibility</STRONG><P>

	Mitigation banks should be planned and designed to be self-sustaining over time to the extent possible.  The techniques for establishing wetlands and/or other aquatic resources must be carefully selected, since this science is constantly evolving. The restoration of historic or substantially-degraded wetlands and/or other aquatic resources (e.g., prior-converted cropland, farmed wetlands) utilizing proven techniques increases the likelihood of success and typically does not result in the loss of other valuable resources. Thus, restoration should be the first option considered when siting a bank.  Because of the difficulty in establishing the correct hydrologic conditions associated with many creation projects and the tradeoff in wetland functions involved with certain enhancement activities, these methods should only be considered where there are adequate assurances to ensure success and that the project will result in an overall environmental benefit.<P>

	In general, banks which involve complex hydraulic engineering features and/or questionable water sources (e.g., pumped) are more costly to develop, operate and maintain, and have a higher risk of failure than banks designed to function with little or no human intervention. The former situations should only be considered where there are adequate assurances to ensure success. This guidance recognizes that in some circumstances wetlands must be actively managed to ensure their viability and sustainability. Furthermore, long-term maintenance requirements may be necessary and appropriate in some cases (e.g., to maintain fire-dependent plant communities in the absence of natural fire; to control invasive exotic plant species).<P>

	Proposed mitigation techniques should be well-understood and reliable. When uncertainties surrounding the technical feasibility of a proposed mitigation technique exist, appropriate arrangements (e.g., financial assurances, contingency plans, additional monitoring requirements) should be in place to increase the likelihood of success.  Such arrangements may be phased-out or reduced once the attainment of prescribed performance standards is demonstrated.<P>
           
<STRONG>	4.  Role of preservation.</STRONG><P>

	Credit may be given when existing wetlands and/or other aquatic resources are preserved in conjunction with restoration, creation or enhancement activities, and when it is demonstrated that the preservation will augment the functions of the restored, created or enhanced aquatic resource. Such augmentation may be reflected in the total number of credits available from the bank. In addition, the preservation of existing wetlands and/or other aquatic resources in perpetuity may be authorized as the sole basis for generating credits in mitigation banks only in exceptional circumstances, consistent with existing regulations, policies and guidance.  Under such circumstances, preservation may be accomplished through the implementation of appropriate legal mechanisms (e.g., transfer of deed, deed restrictions, conservation easement) to protect wetlands and/or other aquatic resources, accompanied by implementation of appropriate changes in land use or other physical changes as necessary (e.g., installation of restrictive fencing).<P>
  
	Determining whether preservation is appropriate as the sole basis for generating credits at a mitigation bank requires careful judgment regarding a number of factors. Consideration must be given to whether wetlands and/or other aquatic resources proposed for preservation (1) perform physical or biological functions, the preservation of which is important to the region in which the aquatic resources are located, and (2) are under demonstrable threat of loss or substantial degradation due to human activities that might not otherwise beexpected to be restricted. The existence of a demonstrable threat will be based on clear evidence of destructive land use changes which are consistent with local and regional land use trends and are not the consequence of actions under the control of the bank sponsor. Wetlands and other aquatic resources restored under the Conservation Reserve Program or similar programs requiring only temporary conservation easements may be eligible for banking credit upon termination of the original easement if the wetlands are provided permanent protection and it would otherwise be expected that the resources would be converted upon termination of the easement. The number of mitigation credits available from a bank that is based solely on preservation should be based on the functions that would otherwise be lost or degraded if the aquatic resources were not preserved, and the timing of such loss or degradation.  As such, compensation for aquatic resource impacts will typically require a greater number of acres from a preservation bank than from a bank which is based on restoration, creation or enhancement.<P>

         <STRONG>  5.  Inclusion of upland areas.</STRONG><P>

	Credit may be given for the inclusion of upland areas occurring within a bank only to the degree that such features increase the overall ecological functioning of the bank.  If such features are included as part of a bank, it is important that they receive the same protected status as the rest of the bank and be subject to the same operational procedures and requirements.  The presence of upland areas may increase the per-unit value of the aquatic habitat in the bank. Alternatively, limited credit may be given to upland areas protected within the bank to reflect the functions inherently provided by such areas (e.g., nutrient and sediment filtration of stormwater runoff, wildlife habitat diversity) which directly enhance or maintain the integrity of the aquatic ecosystem and that might otherwise be subject to threat of loss or degradation.  An appropriate functional assessment methodology should be used to determine the manner and extent to which such features augment the functions of restored, created or
enhanced wetlands and/or other aquatic resources.<P>

	<STRONG> 6.  Mitigation banking and watershed planning.</STRONG><P>

	Mitigation banks should be planned and developed to address the specific resource needs of a particular watershed.  Furthermore, decisions regarding the location, type of wetlands and/or other aquatic resources to be established, and proposed uses of a mitigation bank are most appropriately made within the context of a comprehensive watershed plan.  Such watershed planning efforts often identify categories of activities having minimal adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem and that, therefore, could be authorized under a general permit. In order to reduce the potential cumulative effects of such activities, it may be appropriate to offset these types of impacts through the use of a mitigation bank established in conjunction with a watershed plan.<P>

   <STRONG>      C.  Establishment of Mitigation Banks.</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>          1.  Prospectus.</STRONG><P>

	Prospective bank sponsors should first submit a prospectus to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) or Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to initiate the planning and review process by the appropriate agencies.  Prior to submitting a prospectus, bank sponsors are encouraged to discuss their proposal with the appropriate agencies (e.g., pre-application coordination). <P>

	It is the intent of the agencies to provide practical comments to the bank sponsors regarding the general need for and technical feasibility of proposed banks. Therefore, bank sponsors are encouraged to include in the prospectus sufficient information concerning the objectives for the bank and how it will be established and operated to allow the agencies to provide such feedback. Formal agency involvement and review is initiated with submittal of a prospectus.<P>
           
<STRONG>	2.  Mitigation banking instruments.</STRONG><P>

	Information provided in the prospectus will serve as the basis for establishing the mitigation banking instrument.  All mitigation banks need to have a banking instrument as documentation of agency concurrence on the objectives and administration of the bank.  The banking instrument should describe in detail the physical and legal characteristics of the bank, and how the bank will be established and operated. For regional banking programs sponsored by a single entity (e.g., a state transportation agency), it may be appropriate to establish an "umbrella" instrument for the establishment and operation of multiple bank sites. In such circumstances, the need for supplemental site-specific information (e.g., individual site plans) should be addressed in the banking instrument. The banking instrument will be signed by the bank sponsor and the concurring regulatory and resource agencies represented on the Mitigation Bank Review Team (section II.C.2.). The following information should be addressed, as appropriate, within the banking instrument:<P>
	a. bank goals and objectives;<P>
 	b. ownership of bank lands;<P>
	c. bank size and classes of wetlands and/or other aquatic resources proposed for inclusion in the bank, including a site plan and specifications;<P>
	d. description of baseline conditions at the bank site;<P>
	 e. geographic service area;<P>
 	f. wetland classes or other aquatic resource impacts suitable for compensation;<P>
	g. methods for determining credits and debits;<P>
	h. accounting procedures;<P>
	i. performance standards for determining credit availability and bank success;<P>
	j. reporting protocols and monitoring plan;<P>
	k. contingency and remedial actions and responsibilities;<P>
	 l. financial assurances;<P>
	m. compensation ratios;<P>
	n. provisions for long-term management and maintenance.<P>

	The terms and conditions of the banking instrument may be amended, in accordance with the procedures used to establish the instrument and subject to agreement by the signatories. In cases where initial establishment of the mitigation bank involves a discharge into waters of the United States requiring Section 10/404 authorization, the banking instrument will be made part of a Department of the Army permit for that discharge. Submittal of an individual permit application should be accompanied by a sufficiently-detailed prospectus to allow for concurrent processing of each.  Preparation of a banking instrument, however, should not alter the normal permit evaluation process timeframes. A bank sponsor may proceed with activities for the construction of a bank subsequent to receiving the Department of the Army authorization.  It should be noted, however, that a bank sponsor who proceeds in the absence of a banking instrument does so at his/her own risk.<P>

	In cases where the mitigation bank is established pursuant to the FSA, the banking instrument will be included in the plan developed or approved by NRCS and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).<P>
           
	<STRONG>3.  Agency roles and coordination.</STRONG><P>

	Collectively, the signatory agencies to the banking instrument will comprise the Mitigation Bank Review Team (MBRT).  Representatives from the Corps, EPA, FWS, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and NRCS, as appropriate given the projected use for the bank, should typically comprise the MBRT. In addition, it is appropriate for representatives from state, tribal and local regulatory and resource agencies to participate where an agency has authorities and/or mandates directly affecting or affected by the establishment, use or operation of a bank.  No agency is required to sign a banking instrument; however, in signing a banking instrument, an agency agrees to the terms of that instrument.<P>

	 The Corps will serve as Chair of the MBRT, except in cases where the bank is proposed solely for the purpose of complying with the FSA, in which case NRCS will be the MBRT Chair.  In addition, where a bank is proposed to satisfy the requirements of another Federal, state, tribal or local program, it may be appropriate for the administering agency to serve as co-Chair of the MBRT.<P>

	The primary role of the MBRT is to facilitate the establishment of mitigation banks through the development of mitigation banking instruments. Because of the different authorities and responsibilities of each agency represented on the MBRT, there is a benefit in achieving agreement on the banking instrument. For this reason, the MBRT will strive to obtain consensus on its actions. The Chair of the MBRT will have the responsibility for making final decisions regarding the terms and conditions of the banking instrument where consensus cannot otherwise be reached within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 90 days from the date of submittal of a complete prospectus). The MBRT will review and seek consensus on the banking instrument and final plans for the restoration, creation, enhancement, and/or preservation of wetlands and other aquatic resources.<P>

	Consistent with its authorities under Section 10/404, the Corps is responsible for authorizing use of a particular mitigation bank on a project-specific basis and determining the number and availability of credits required to compensate for proposed impacts in accordance with the terms of the banking instrument.  Decisions rendered by the Corps must fully consider review agency comments submitted as part of the permit evaluation process. Similarly, the NRCS, in consultation with the FWS, will make the final decision pertaining to the withdrawal of credits from banks as appropriate mitigation pursuant to FSA.<P>

<STRONG>          4.  Role of the bank sponsor.</STRONG><P>

	The bank sponsor is responsible for the preparation of the banking instrument in consultation with the MBRT. The bank sponsor should, therefore, have sufficient opportunity to discuss the content of the banking instrument with the MBRT. The bank sponsor is also responsible for the overall operation and management of the bank in accordance with the terms of the banking instrument, including the preparation and distribution of monitoring reports and accounting statements/ledger, as necessary.<P>

         <STRONG> 5.  Public Review and Comment.</STRONG><P>

 	The public should be notified of and have an opportunity to comment on all bank proposals. For banks which require authorization under an individual Section 10/404 permit or a state, tribal or local program that involves a similar public notice and comment process, this condition will typically be satisfied through such standard procedures. For other proposals, the Corps or NRCS, upon receipt of a complete banking prospectus, should provide notification of the availability of the prospectus for a minimum 21-day public comment period. Notification procedures will be similar to those used by the Corps in the standard permit review process. Copies of all public comments received will be distributed to the other members of the MBRT and the bank sponsor for full consideration in the development of the final banking instrument.<P>

     <STRONG>      6.  Dispute resolution procedure.</STRONG><P>

	The MBRT will work to reach consensus on its actions in accordance with this guidance.  It is anticipated that all issues will be resolved by the MBRT in this manner.<P>

<STRONG>               a.  Development of the banking instrument.</STRONG><P>
               
	During the development of the banking instrument, if an agency representative considers that a particular decision raises concern regarding the application of existing policy or procedures, an agency may request, through written notification, that the issue be reviewed by the Corps District Engineer, or NRCS State Conservationist, as appropriate.  Said notification will describe the issue in sufficient detail and provide recommendations for resolution. Within 20 days, the District Engineer or State Conservationist (as appropriate) will consult with the notifying agency(ies) and will resolve the issue.  The resolution will be forwarded to the other MBRT member agencies. The bank sponsor may also request the District Engineer or State Conservationist review actions taken to develop the banking instrument if the sponsor believes that inadequate progress has been made on the instrument by the MBRT.<P>
              
<STRONG>				 b.  Application of the banking instrument.</STRONG><P>

	As previously stated, the Corps and NRCS are responsible for making final decisions on a project-specific basis regarding the use of a mitigation bank for purposes of Section 10/404 and FSA, respectively. In the event an agency on the MBRT is concerned that a proposed use may be inconsistent with the terms of the banking instrument, that agency may raise the issue to the attention of the Corps or NRCS through the permit evaluation process. In order to facilitate timely and effective consideration of agency comments, the Corps or NRCS, as appropriate, will advise the MBRT agencies of a proposed use of a bank.  The Corps will fully consider comments provided by the review agencies regarding mitigation as part of the permit evaluation process. The NRCS will consult with FWS in making its decisions pertaining to mitigation.<P>

	If, in the view of an agency on the MBRT, an issued permit or series of permits reflects a pattern of concern regarding the application of the terms of the banking instrument, that agency may initiate review of the concern by the full MBRT through written notification to the MBRT Chair.  The MBRT Chair will convene a meeting of the MBRT, or initiate another appropriate forum for communication, typically within 20 days of receipt of notification, to resolve concerns. Any such effort to address concerns regarding the application of a banking instrument will not delay any decision pending before the authorizing agency (e.g., Corps or NRCS).<P>

     <STRONG>     D.  Criteria for Use of a Mitigation Bank.
</STRONG><P>
        <STRONG>  1.  Project applicability.</STRONG><P>

	 All activities regulated under Section 10/404 may be eligible to use a mitigation bank as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands and/or other aquatic resources.  Mitigation banks established for FSA purposes may be debited only in accordance with the mitigation and replacement provisions of 7 CFR Part 12.<P>

	Credits from mitigation banks may also be used to compensate for environmental impacts authorized under other programs (e.g., state or local wetland regulatory programs, NPDES program, Corps civil works projects, Superfund removal and remedial actions).  In no case may the same credits be used to compensate for more than one activity; however, the same credits may be used to compensate for an activity which requires authorization under more than one program.<P>
         
<STRONG>	     2.  Relationship to mitigation requirements.</STRONG>	<P>

	Under the existing requirements of Section 10/404, all appropriate and practicable steps must be undertaken by the applicant to first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to aquatic resources, prior to authorization to use a particular mitigation bank. Remaining unavoidable impacts must be compensated to the extent appropriate and practicable.  For both the Section 10/404 and "Swampbuster" programs, requirements for compensatory mitigation may be satisfied through the use of mitigation banks when either on-site compensation is not practicable or use of the mitigation bank is environmentally preferable to on-site compensation.<P>

	It is important to emphasize that applicants should not expect that establishment of, or purchasing credits from, a mitigation bank will necessarily lead to a determination of compliance with applicable mitigation requirements (i.e., Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines or FSA Manual), or as excepting projects from any applicable requirements.<P>
          
					3.  Geographic limits of applicability.<P>
         
	 The service area of a mitigation bank is the area (e.g., watershed, county) wherein a bank can reasonably be expected to provide appropriate compensation for impacts to wetlands and/or other aquatic resources. This area should be designated in the banking instrument. Designation of the service area should be based on consideration of hydrologic and biotic criteria, and be stipulated in the banking instrument. Use of a mitigation bank to compensate for impacts beyond the designated service area may be authorized, on a case-by-case basis, where it is determined to be practicable and environmentally desirable.<P>

	The geographic extent of a service area should, to the extent environmentally desirable, be guided by the cataloging unit of the "Hydrologic Unit Map of the United States" (USGS, 1980) and the ecoregion of the "Ecoregions of the United States" (James M. Omernik, EPA, 1986) or section of the "Descriptions of the Ecoregions of the United States" (Robert G. Bailey, USDA, 1980).  It may be appropriate to use other classification systems developed at the state or regional level for the purpose of specifying bank service areas, when such systems compare favorably in their objectives and level of detail.  In the interest of integrating banks with other resource management objectives, bank service areas may encompass larger watershed areas if the designation of such areas is supported by local or regional management plans (e.g. Special Area Management Plans, Advance Identification), State Wetland Conservation Plans or other Federally sponsored or recognized resource management plans.  Furthermore, designation of a more inclusive service area may be appropriate for mitigation banks whose primary purpose is to compensate for linear projects that typically involve numerous small impacts in several different watersheds.<P>
         
			<STRONG>4.  Use of a mitigation bank vs. on-site mitigation.</STRONG><P>

	The agencies' preference for on-site mitigation, indicated in the 1990 Memorandum of Agreement on mitigation between the EPA and the Department of the Army, should not preclude the use of a mitigation bank when there is no practicable opportunity for on-site compensation, or when use of a bank is environmentally preferable to on-site compensation. On-site mitigation may be preferable where there is a practicable opportunity to compensate for important local functions including local flood control functions, habitat for a species or population with a very limited geographic range or narrow environmental requirements, or where local water quality concerns dominate.<P>
  
	In choosing between on-site mitigation and use of a mitigation bank, careful consideration should be given to the likelihood for successfully establishing the desired habitat type, the compatibility of the mitigation project with adjacent land uses, and the practicability of long-term monitoring and maintenance to determine whether the effort will be ecologically sustainable, as well as the relative cost of mitigation alternatives.  In general, use of a mitigation bank to compensate for minor aquatic resource impacts (e.g., numerous, small impacts associated with linear projects; impacts authorized under nationwide permits) is preferable to on-site mitigation.  With respect to larger aquatic resource impacts, use of a bank may be appropriate if it is capable of replacing essential physical and/or biological functions of the aquatic resources which are expected to be lost or degraded.Finally, there may be circumstances warranting a combination of on-site and off-site mitigation to compensate for losses.<P>

        <STRONG>  5.  In-kind vs. out-of-kind mitigation determinations.</STRONG><P>

	 In the interest of achieving functional replacement, in-kind compensation of aquatic resource impacts should generally be required. Out-of-kind compensation may be acceptable if it is determined to be practicable and environmentally preferable to in-kind compensation (e.g., of greater ecological value to a particular region).  However, non-tidal wetlands should typically not be used to compensate for the loss or degradation of tidal wetlands. Decisions regarding out-of-kind mitigation are typically made on a case-by-case basis during the permit evaluation process. The banking instrument may identify circumstances in which it is environmentally desirable to allow out-of-kind compensation within the context of a particular mitigation bank (e.g., for banks restoring a complex of associated wetland types). Mitigation banks developed as part of an area-wide management plan to address a specific resource objective (e.g. restoration of a particularly vulnerable or valuable wetland habitat type) may be such an example.<P>
  <STRONG>        6.  Timing of credit withdrawal.</STRONG><P>

	The number of credits available for withdrawal (i.e., debiting) should generally be commensurate with the level of aquatic functions attained at a bank at the time of debiting. The level of function may be determined through the application of performance standards tailored to the specific restoration, creation or enhancement activity at the bank site or through the use of an appropriate functional assessment methodology.<P>

	The success of a mitigation bank with regard to its capacity to establish a healthy and fully functional aquatic system relates directly to both the ecological and financial stability of the bank.  Since financial considerations are particularly critical in early stages of bank development, it is generally appropriate, in cases where there is adequate financial assurance and where the likelihood of the success of the bank is high, to allow limited debiting of a percentage of the total credits projected for the bank at maturity.  Such determinations should take into consideration the initial capital costs needed to establish the bank, and the likelihood of its success.  However, it is the intent of this policy to ensure that those actions necessary for the long-term viability of a mitigation bank be accomplished prior to any debiting of the bank.  In this regard, the following minimum requirements should be satisfied prior to debiting: (1) banking instrument and mitigation plans have been approved; (2) bank site has been secured; and (3) appropriate financial assurances have been established.  In addition, initial physical and biological improvements should be completed no later than the first full growing season following initial debiting of a bank. The temporal loss of functions associated with the debiting of projected credits may justify the need for requiring higher compensation ratios in such cases. For mitigation banks which propose multiple-phased construction, similar conditions should be established for each phase.<P>

	Credits attributed to the preservation of existing aquatic resources may become available for debiting immediately upon implementation of appropriate legal protection accompanied by appropriate changes in land use or other physical changes, as necessary.<P>

          <STRONG>7.  Crediting/debiting/accounting procedures.</STRONG><P>

	Credits and debits are the terms used to designate the units of trade (i.e., currency) in mitigation banking. Credits represent the accrual or attainment of aquatic functions at a bank; debits represent the loss of aquatic functions at an impact or project site.  Credits are debited from a bank when they are used to offset aquatic resource impacts (e.g. for the purpose of satisfying Section 10/404 permit or FSA requirements).<P>

	 An appropriate functional assessment methodology (e.g., Habitat Evaluation Procedures, hydrogeomorphic approach to wetlands functional assessment, other regional assessment methodology) acceptable to all signatories should be used to assess wetland and/or other aquatic resource restoration, creation and enhancement activities within a mitigation bank, and to quantify the amount of available credits. The range of functions to be assessed will depend upon the assessment methodology identified in the banking  instrument. The same methodology should be used to assess both credits and debits. If an appropriate functional assessment methodology is impractical to employ, acreage may be used as a surrogate for measuring function. Regardless of the method employed, the number of credits should reflect the difference between site conditions under the with- and without-bank scenarios.<P>

The bank sponsor should be responsible for assessing the development of the bank and submitting appropriate documentation of such assessments to the authorizing agency(ies), who will distribute the documents to the other members of the MBRT for review.  Members of the MBRT are encouraged to conduct regular (e.g., annual) on-site inspections, as appropriate, to monitor bank performance.  Alternatively, functional assessments may be conducted by a team representing involved resource and regulatory agencies and other appropriate parties. The number of available credits in a mitigation bank may need to be adjusted to reflect actual conditions.<P>
          
	The banking instrument should require that bank sponsors establish and maintain an accounting system (i.e., ledger) which documents the activity of all mitigation bank accounts.  Each time an approved debit/credit transaction occurs at a given bank, the bank sponsor should submit a statement to the authorizing agency(ies). The bank sponsor should also generate an annual ledger report for all mitigation bank accounts to be submitted to the MBRT Chair for distribution to each member of the MBRT.<P>

	Credits may be sold to third parties. The cost of mitigation credits to a third party is determined by the bank sponsor.<P>

         <STRONG> 8.  Party responsible for bank success.</STRONG><P>
	
	The bank sponsor is responsible for assuring the success of the debited restoration, creation, enhancement and preservation activities at the mitigation bank, and it is therefore extremely important that an enforceable mechanism be adopted establishing the responsibility of the bank sponsor to develop and operate the bank properly. Where authorization under Section 10/404 and/or FSA is necessary to establish the bank, the Department of the Army permit or NRCS plan should be conditioned to ensure that provisions of the banking instrument are enforceable by the appropriate agency(ies). In circumstances where establishment of a bank does not require such authorization, the details of the bank sponsor's responsibilities should be delineated by the relevant authorizing agency (e.g., the Corps in the case of Section 10/404 permits) in any permit in which the permittee's mitigation obligations are met through use of the bank. In addition, the bank sponsor should sign such permits for the limited purpose of meeting those mitigation responsibilities, thus confirming that those responsibilities are enforceable against the bank sponsor if necessary.<P>

  <STRONG>        E.  Long-Term Management, Monitoring and Remediation.</STRONG><P>

   <STRONG>       1.  Bank operational life.
</STRONG><P>
	The operational life of a bank refers to the period during which the terms and conditions of the banking instrument are in effect.  With the exception of arrangements for the long-term management and protection in perpetuity of the wetlands and/or other aquatic resources, the operational life of a mitigation bank terminates at the point when (1) compensatory mitigation credits have been exhausted or banking activity is voluntarily terminated with written notice by the bank sponsor provided to the Corps or NRCS and other members of the MBRT, and (2) it has been determined that the debited bank is functionally mature and/or self-sustaining to the degree specified in the banking instrument.<P>
          <STRONG>2.  Long-term management and protection.</STRONG><P>

	The wetlands and/or other aquatic resources in a mitigation bank should be protected in perpetuity with appropriate real estate arrangements (e.g., conservation easements, transfer of title to Federal or State resource agency or non-profit conservation organization).  Such arrangements should effectively restrict harmful activities (i.e., incompatible uses) that might otherwise jeopardize the purpose of the bank. In exceptional circumstances, real estate arrangements may be approved which dictate finite protection for a bank (e.g., for coastal protection projects which prolong the ecological viability of the aquatic system). However, in no case should finite protection extend for a lesser time  than the duration of project impacts for which the bank is being used to provide compensation.<P>

	 The bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate funds for the operation and maintenance of the bank during its operational life, as well as for the long-term management of the wetlands and/or other aquatic resources, as necessary. The banking instrument should identify the entity responsible for the ownership and long-term management of the wetlands and/or other aquatic resources. Where needed, the acquisition and protection of water rights should be secured by the bank sponsor and documented in the banking instrument.<P>

        <STRONG>  3.  Monitoring requirements.</STRONG><P>

	The bank sponsor is responsible for monitoring the mitigation bank in accordance with monitoring provisions identified in the banking instrument to determine the level of success and identify problems requiring remedial action. Monitoring provisions should be set forth in the banking instrument and based  on scientifically sound performance standards prescribed for the bank.  Monitoring should be conducted at time intervals appropriate for the particular project type and until such time that the authorizing agency(ies), in consultation with the MBRT, are confident that success is being achieved (i.e., performance standards are attained). The period for monitoring will typically be five years; however, it may be necessary to extend this period for projects requiring more time to reach a stable condition (e.g., forested wetlands) or where remedial activities were undertaken. Annual monitoring reports should be submitted to the authorizing agency(ies), who is responsible for distribution to the other members of the MBRT, in accordance with the terms specified in the banking instrument.<P>

  <STRONG>        4.  Remedial action.</STRONG><P>

	The banking instrument should stipulate the general procedures for identifying and implementing remedial measures at a bank, or any portion thereof. Remedial measures should be based on information contained in the monitoring reports (i.e., the attainment of prescribed performance standards), as well as agency site inspections.  The need for remediation will be determined by  the authorizing agency(ies) in consultation with the MBRT and bank sponsor.<P>

<STRONG>          5.  Financial assurances.</STRONG><P>

	The bank sponsor is responsible for securing sufficient funds or other  financial assurances to cover contingency actions in the event of bank default or failure. Accordingly, banks posing a greater risk of failure and where credits have been debited, should have comparatively higher financial sureties in place, than those where the likelihood of success is more certain.  In addition, the bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate funding to monitor and maintain the bank throughout its operational life, as well as beyond the operational life if not self-sustaining.  Total funding requirements should reflect realistic cost estimates for monitoring, long-term maintenance, contingency and remedial actions.<P>

	Financial assurances may be in the form of performance bonds, irrevocable trusts, escrow accounts, casualty insurance, letters of credit, legislatively-enacted dedicated funds for government operated banks or other approved instruments.  Such assurances may be phased-out or reduced, once it has been demonstrated that the bank is functionally mature and/or self-sustaining (in accordance with performance standards).
<STRONG>          F.  Other Considerations.</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>          1.  In-lieu-fee mitigation arrangements.</STRONG><P>

	 For purposes of this guidance, in-lieu-fee, fee mitigation, or other similar arrangements, wherein funds are paid to a natural resource management entity for implementation of either specific or general wetland or other aquatic resource development projects, are not considered to meet the definition of mitigation banking because they do not typically provide compensatory mitigation in advance of project impacts. Moreover, such arrangements do not typically provide a clear timetable for the initiation of mitigation efforts. The Corps, in consultation with the other agencies, may find there are circumstances where such arrangements are appropriate so long as they meet the requirements that would otherwise apply to an off-site, prospective mitigation effort and provides adequate assurances of success and timely implementation.  In such cases, a formal agreement between the sponsor and the agencies, similar to a banking instrument, is necessary to define the conditions under which its use is considered appropriate.<P>

         <STRONG> 2.  Special considerations for "Swampbuster".</STRONG><P>

	Current FSA legislation limits the extent to which mitigation banking can be used for FSA purposes.  Therefore, if a mitigation bank is to be used for FSA purposes, it must meet the requirements of FSA.<P>
     
<STRONG>     III.  Definitions</STRONG><P>

	For the purposes of this guidance document the following terms are defined:<P>

<STRONG>	 A.  authorizing agency.  </STRONG>Any Federal, state, tribal or local agency that has authorized a particular use of a mitigation bank as compensation for an authorized activity; the authorizing agency will typically have the enforcement authority to ensure that the terms and conditions of the banking instrument are satisfied.<P>

	<STRONG>B.  bank sponsor. </STRONG> Any public or private entity responsible for establishing and, in most circumstances, operating a mitigation bank.<P>

<STRONG>	C.  compensatory mitigation.</STRONG>  For purposes of Section 10/404, compensatory mitigation is the restoration, creation, enhancement, or in exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands and/or other aquatic resources for the purpose of compensating for unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.<P>

<STRONG> 	D.  consensus.</STRONG>  The term consensus, as defined herein, is a process by which a group synthesizes its concerns and ideas to form a common collaborative agreement acceptable to all members.  While the primary goal of consensus is to reach agreement on an issue by all parties, unanimity may not always be possible.<P>

	<STRONG>	E.  creation.</STRONG>  The establishment of a wetland or other aquatic resource where one did not formerly exist.<P>

	<STRONG>	F.  credit. </STRONG> A unit of measure representing the accrual or attainment of aquatic functions at a mitigation bank; the measure of function is typically indexed to the number of wetland acres restored, created, enhanced orpreserved.<P>

	<STRONG>G.  debit.</STRONG>  A unit of measure representing the loss of aquatic functions at an impact or project site.<P>

	<STRONG>H.  enhancement. </STRONG> Activities conducted in existing wetlands or other aquatic resources which increase one or more aquatic functions.<P>
         
	<STRONG> I.  mitigation. </STRONG> For purposes of Section 10/404 and consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations, the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines and the Memorandum of Agreement Between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army Concerning the Determination of Mitigation under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, mitigation means sequentially avoiding impacts, minimizing impacts, and compensating for remaining unavoidable impacts.<P>
         
	<STRONG> J.  mitigation bank.</STRONG>  A mitigation bank is a site where wetlands and/or other aquatic resources are restored, created, enhanced, or in exceptional circumstances, preserved expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar resources. For purposes of Section 10/404, use of a mitigation bank may only be authorized when impacts are unavoidable.<P>
         
<STRONG>	 K.  Mitigation Bank Review Team (MBRT).</STRONG>  An interagency group of Federal, state, tribal and/or local regulatory and resource agency representatives which are signatory to a banking instrument and oversee the establishment, use and operation of a mitigation bank.<P>
          
<STRONG>	L.  practicable.</STRONG>  Available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.<P>
         
<STRONG>	 M.  preservation. </STRONG> The protection of ecologically important wetlands or other aquatic resources in perpetuity through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms. Preservation may include protection of upland areas adjacent to wetlands as necessary to ensure protection and/or enhancement of the aquatic ecosystem.<P>
         
<STRONG>	 N.  restoration.</STRONG>  Re-establishment of wetland and/or other aquatic resource characteristics and function(s) at a site where they have ceased to exist, or exist in a substantially degraded state.<P>
        
<STRONG>	 O.  service area. </STRONG> The service area of a mitigation bank is the designated area (e.g., watershed, county) wherein a bank can reasonably be expected to provide appropriate compensation for impacts to wetlands and/or other aquatic resources.<P>

<TITLE> Framework for the Description, Identification, Conservation, and Enhancement of Essential Fish Habitat </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

 <STRONG><CENTER>Framework for the Description, Identification, Conservation, 
and Enhancement of Essential Fish Habitat</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<STRONG><CENTER>(January 2, 1997)</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>I.	PURPOSE</STRONG><P>
<P>
Section 305(b)(1)(A and B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), as amended, mandates that, <P>

<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>"(A) The Secretary shall, within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, establish by regulation guidelines to assist the Councils in the description and identification of essential fish habitat in fishery management plans (including adverse impacts on such habitat) and in the consideration of actions to ensure the conservation and enhancement of such habitat.  The Secretary shall set forth a schedule for the amendment of fishery management plans to include the identification of essential fish habitat and for the review and updating of such identifications based on new scientific evidence or other relevant information. 
</DL>
<P>
<P>
	
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>"(B) The Secretary, in consultation with participants in the fishery, shall provide each Council with recommendations and information regarding each fishery under that Council's authority to assist it in the identification of essential fish habitat, the adverse impacts on that habitat, and the actions that should be considered to ensure the conservation and enhancement of that habitat."
</DL>
<P>
<P>
This document provides a framework for the description, identification, conservation, and enhancement of essential fish habitat (EFH) and is designed to aid Fishery Management Councils (Councils) in implementing the EFH requirements of sections 303 and 305 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.   This framework also describes how the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), will implement its EFH requirements under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  These requirements include developing and providing information and recommendations in guidelines, by regulation, to the Councils to assist in identifying EFH, adverse impacts to EFH (including adverse impacts from fishing), and actions to conserve and enhance EFH.  Finally, the framework describes how NMFS, in coordination with the Councils, will consult on and recommend conservation and enhancement measures for actions undertaken by any state or Federal agency that may adversely affect any EFH.<P>
<P>
This framework is an instrument to solicit public comments on ideas for the development of guidelines by regulation, as required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  In order to coordinate implementation of the fishery management plan EFH amendments efficiently, NMFS will contact the Councils to develop an appropriate schedule (see section V.D).   NMFS will also develop a technical assistance manual that will provide the Councils, Federal agencies, and states with additional information for identifying EFH, adverse impacts to EFH, and conservation and enhancement measures.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>II.	INTRODUCTION</STRONG><P>
<P>
The health and productivity of fish populations are dependent on habitat quantity and quality.  As defined in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, fish includes finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animal and plant life, other than marine mammals and birds.  Congress stated that habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources (section 2(a)(9)).  This framework describes how NMFS interprets the statutory definition of EFH and outlines procedures to assist Councils in describing, identifying, conserving, and enhancing EFH.<P>
<P>
This framework is based on four general principles.  First, the description and identification of EFH must be based on the best scientific information available.  Second, in cases where little information is available, the framework requires a conservative approach to describing and identifying EFH, erring on the side of inclusiveness, to ensure adequate habitat protection.  Third, the framework must be appropriate for many different species in many different areas.  Finally, the procedures for describing and identifying EFH should be scientifically defensible.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>III.	OVERVIEW OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>A.	Definition of EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
As defined in section 3(10) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, EFH is  those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity."  For the purposes of this framework document:  waters" include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical and biological properties that are used by fish and may include historic areas where appropriate;  substrate" includes sediments, geological features underlying the waters, and associated biological communities such as coral reefs or submerged aquatic vegetation;  necessary" means the habitat required to support a managed species or assemblage at a target production level reflecting conscientious stewardship;  and  spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity" covers a species' full life cycle.  Migratory routes such as rivers serving as passageways to anadromous fish spawning grounds should be considered EFH.  The definition of EFH may include habitat for an individual species or an assemblage of species, whichever is appropriate within each FMP.  Finally, in interpreting "feeding" and "growth to maturity", EFH should also include essential habitat for prey species if the managed species depends on the existence of a specific prey species.  This definition commits the Secretary and Councils to an ecosystem approach to fish habitat conservation and enhancement that views EFH from a broad perspective.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>B.	Contents of FMPs</STRONG><P>
<P>
The amended Magnuson-Stevens Act has several new FMP provisions, including section 303(a)(7) which requires: that EFH be described and identified for any fishery that is managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act based on guidelines established by the Secretary of Commerce under section 305(b)(1)(A); that the adverse effects of fishing on EFH be minimized, to the extent practicable; and that other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of EFH be identified.  <P>
<P>
<STRONG>C.	Actions by the Secretary</STRONG><P>
 <P>
The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires the Secretary to undertake several actions regarding fish habitat:<P>

</UL>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>E.	Actions Required of Other Federal Agencies</STRONG><P>
<P>
The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires actions by Federal agencies, including:<P>
<P>

<LI>Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary regarding any activity, or proposed activity, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency that may adversely affect EFH.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Within 30 days of receipt of a recommendation, Federal agencies are required to provide the Secretary and any Council that comments on an activity, or proposed activity, with a written description of the measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating or offsetting the impact of the activity on EFH.  If this response is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Secretary, the agency must explain why it is inconsistent.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>IV. 	SPECIFIC EFH REQUIREMENTS IN FMPS</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>A.	Description and Identification of EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>1.		Fish Habitat (Present and Historical)</STRONG><P>
<P>
The role of habitat in supporting the productivity of organisms has been thoroughly documented in the ecological literature, and the linkage between habitat availability and fishery productivity has been clearly established for several fishery species.  Because habitat is an essential element for sustaining the production of a species, the goals of FMPs cannot be achieved if the managed species do not have a sufficient quantity of suitable habitat.  <P>
<P>
From the broadest perspective, fish habitat is the geographic area where the species occurs at any time during its life.  That area should be described in terms of ecological characteristics, location, and time.  Ecologically, essential habitat includes structure or substrate that focus distribution (e.g., coral reefs, marshes, or kelp beds) and other characteristics that are less distinct (e.g., turbidity zones, thermoclines, or fronts separating water masses).  Spatially, habitat use may shift over time due to climatic change, human uses, or other factors.  Habitat not currently used should be considered when establishing long-term goals for EFH and species productivity.  Habitat restoration will be vital to improving habitat quality and quantity, with benefits to the species and society.  <P>
<P>
Fishery species use habitat for spawning, breeding, migration, feeding and growth, and for shelter to increase survival.  However, most habitats provide only a subset of these functions.  Fish habitat utilized by a species can change with life history stage, abundance of the species, competition from other species, and environmental variability in time and space.  The type of habitat available, its attributes, and its functions are important to species productivity and societal benefits.<P>
<P>					
<STRONG>2.	 EFH for Managed Species</STRONG><P>
<P>
There are numerous factors that must be considered by the Secretary and the appropriate Council for determining the EFH of a managed species.  Institutional arrangements for implementing the Magnuson-Stevens Act currently utilize either a single species or single assemblage approach.  The ecological relationships among species and between the species and their habitat require, where possible, that an ecosystem approach be used in assessing EFH of a managed species or species assemblage.  Where possible, this ecosystem approach should be used in assessing the EFH of a given species or assemblage.  The extent of the EFH should be based on the judgment of the Secretary and the appropriate Council regarding the amount of habitat that is necessary to maintain a managed species at a target production level that supports the maximum societal benefits of the species, including the catch of the species. <P>
<P>
In general, the minimum threshold for determining the target production of the species or assemblage should be that level necessary to maintain at least the current reproductive capacity of the population so that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) eventually can be attained.  Since the MSY is based on prevailing ecological and environmental conditions, including degraded conditions that may have contributed to a reduction in MSY, the feasibility of increasing the yield of a species with improved ecological conditions must be evaluated.  This feasibility should be determined by assessing historical information that existed in periods of higher yields and more favorable ecological conditions, and considering the feasibility of returning to those conditions.  If degraded or inaccessible habitat has contributed to the reduced yields of a species, and in the judgment of the Secretary and the appropriate Council, the degraded conditions can be reversed through such actions as improved fish passage techniques (for fish blockages), improved water quality measures (removal of contaminants) and similar measures that are practicable, then EFH should include those habitats that would be essential to the species to obtain increased yields or societal benefits.  EFH is to be determined based on the target production level that supports the maximum societal benefit of a species, including harvest, and will always be greater than the "critical habitat" for any managed species  listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.<P>
<P>
Other societal benefits of the species, such as being a prey species of other living marine species, should be considered when determining the target production level of a species and the required habitat to support that level of productivity.  Where a stock of a species is considered to be healthy and where sufficient information exists to determine the necessary habitat to support the target production level, then EFH for a species should be a subset of all existing habitat for the species.<P>
<P>
EFH should include geographic boundaries in order to provide notice to Federal and state agencies and other affected parties of the potential effects of their activities on EFH.  It should be described by the components of the ecosystem that are important to the managed species.  Therefore, EFH should be described by its physical, chemical, and/or biological characteristics, including, but not limited to, temperature, salinity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, bottom type, and vegetation.  EFH should also take into consideration that environmental conditions affecting one life history stage could impact the overall production and recruitment success of a species.  Some habitats may be essential because they support specific prey organisms required to maintain the productivity of the managed species.  If the abundance of a species is directly reliant upon the abundance of specific prey organisms, then the description of EFH for the species should include a description of the essential habitat for the prey as well.<P>
<P>
FMPs should describe EFH in text and with tables that provide information on the biological requirements for each life history stage of the species.  These tables should include all available information on environmental and habitat variables that control or limit distribution, abundance, reproduction, growth, mortality, and productivity of the managed species.  Information in the tables should be supported with citations.  Graphical depiction of habitats used by life history stages, and maps of species distributions may also be useful in describing and identifying EFH.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>3.	Information Requirements</STRONG><P>
<P>
The following hierarchical approach should be used in identifying EFH; the process should be initiated at Level 1 and progress through the various levels as more information on habitat functions becomes available.  Information from all levels will be useful in identifying EFH, and the goal of this procedure should be to include as many levels of analysis as possible within the constraints of the available data.  The hierarchical approach presented herein for describing and identifying EFH relies upon the best available scientific information regarding species distribution, abundance, habitat usage, and habitat function.  Where the best available scientific information is subject to differing interpretations, or is limited in scope, best scientific professional judgement should be used.  Councils should apply this approach in a risk-averse fashion, erring on the side of inclusiveness to ensure adequate protection for EFH of managed species.  Councils should strive to obtain data sufficient to describe habitat at the highest level of detail (i.e., Level 4) and provide the regulated community (i.e., those individuals proposing activities that may adversely effect EFH) with an unambiguous interpretation of the description and identification EFH.  The hierarchical approach provides a framework for identifying research needs and collecting additional information to improve our understanding of  EFH.<P>
<P>
The information obtained in the hierarchical analysis will allow Councils to assess the relative value of habitats in relation to the productivity of a fish species.  Habitats valued most highly through this analysis should be considered essential for the species.  Habitats of  intermediate and low value, however, may also be essential.  For example, low-value habitat may be extensive in its geographic coverage, and the productivity derived from the cumulative habitat area may be essential in meeting target productions levels.  Similarly, if a species is recovering from a population decline, all habitats used by the species should be considered essential in addition to some historic habitats that are potentially valuable.<P>
<P>
To identify EFH, basic information is needed on current and historic stock size and on the geographic range of the managed species (and prey species where appropriate).  Information is also required on the timing and location of major life history stages (defined by developmental and functional shifts).  Since EFH should be identified for each major life history stage, data should be collected on the distribution, density, growth, mortality, and production of each stage within all habitats occupied by the species.  Different levels of data may be available for different life history stages of a species  (e.g., data for eggs may be at Level 1, while data for adults may be at Level 3).  These data should be obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, data reports and "gray" literature, data files of government resource agencies, and any other potential source of quality information. <P>
<P>
Level 1:  Presence/absence distribution data are available in at least some portions of the geographic range of the species<P>
<P>
This level is used when only presence/absence data are available to describe the distribution of a species (or life history stage) in relation to potential habitats.  Care should be taken to ensure that all potential habitats have been sampled adequately.  Using these data, the only scientifically defensible statement that can be made about the importance of a habitat is that the species (or life history stage) does or does not occur in the habitat.  At this level of data availability, EFH is everywhere a species has been found.<P>
<P>
In the event that distribution data are available for only portions of the geographic area occupied by a particular life history stage of  a species, EFH can be inferred on the basis of distributions among habitats where the species has been found and on information about its habitat requirements and behavior.  At this level of data availability, the risk-averse approach is to define EFH as everywhere the species is likely to occur, noting any areas of known significance to reproduction, feeding, or growth to maturity.<P>
<P>
Level 2:  Habitat-related densities of the species are available<P>
<P>
At this level, quantitative data (i.e., relative densities) are available for the habitats occupied by a species or life history stage.  Because the efficiency of sampling gear is often affected by habitat characteristics, strict quality assurance criteria are required to ensure that density estimates are comparable among habitats.  For example, trawl data may not be appropriate for making comparisons of fish densities among different estuarine habitats, because trawl catch efficiency has been shown to vary with some habitat characteristics.  Density data should reflect habitat utilization, and the degree that a habitat is utilized is assumed to be indicative of habitat value.  Therefore, for each life history stage, the habitats contributing the most productivity are those with the highest densities of the species.  When assessing habitat value on the basis of fish densities in this manner, temporal changes in habitat availability and utilizations should be considered. <P>
<P>
Level 3: Habitat-related growth, reproduction, or survival rates by habitat are available<P>
<P>
At this level, data are available on habitat-related growth, reproduction, and/or survival by life history stage.  The habitats contributing the most to productivity should be those that support the highest growth, reproduction, and survival of the species (or life history stage). <P>
<P>
Level 4:  Production rates by habitat are available<P>
<P>
At this level, data are available that directly relate the production rates of a species or life history stage to habitat type, quantity, quality, and location.  Essential habitats are those necessary to maintain target long-term production levels.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>4.	Representation of EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
Once EFH is identified for each life history stage,  the general distribution and geographic limits of EFH should be presented in FMPs in the form of maps.  Ultimately, these data should be incorporated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to facilitate analysis and presentation.   For example, if submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has been identified as EFH for a species, the general distribution of SAV should be mapped over the geographic range of the species.  These maps may be presented as fixed in time and space, but they should encompass all appropriate temporal and spatial variability in the distribution of EFH.   If the geographic boundaries of EFH change seasonally, annually, or decadally, these changing distributions need to be represented in  the maps.  Different types of EFH should be identified on maps along with areas used by different life history stages of the species.  The type of information used to identify EFH should be included in map legends, and more detailed and informative maps should be produced as more complete information about population responses (e.g., growth, survival, or reproductive rates) to habitat characteristics becomes available.  Where the present distribution or stock size of a species or life history stage is different from the historical distribution or stock size, then maps of historical habitat boundaries should be included in the FMP.  If EFH for a species includes habitat that supports a specific prey organism, this prey habitat should be identified separately and presented on the habitat maps as well.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>B.  Adverse Effects of Human Activities, and Actions to Ensure the Conservation, Management, and Enhancement of EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
This section provides guidance concerning the identification in FMPs of potential adverse effects of  Federal and state activities on EFH, as well as conservation, management and enhancement opportunities associated with such activities.  Potential adverse effects of fishing activities on EFH are also addressed  in this section.<P>
<P>
Consideration of EFH should be incorporated into amended FMPs such that the FMPs identify and describe the following: (1) activities with known or potential adverse effects on EFH (threats); (2) actions required to counter threats to the existing and historic EFH; and (3) actions to restore or enhance EFH.  In this context, "restore" means to reestablish the habitat and associated functions to a desired level that is based on feasibility and historic information; and "enhance" means to improve the habitat and associated functions to a desired level that is based on feasibility and historic information.  FMP recommendations should assess impacts cumulatively and individually for all activities that adversely affect EFH.  The ultimate goal is to incorporate the highest level of analysis possible, e.g., cumulative impacts on a watershed basis, including some form of ecological risk assessment.  The steps involved in identifying and describing adverse effects on EFH, and a suggested process to avoid them, should be presented in a hierarchical fashion.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>Tier 1: </STRONG> Identify activities that have potential adverse effects on EFH.  Broad categories of activities may include, but are not limited to: fill, excavation, mining, impoundment, discharge, water diversions, thermal additions, runoff, placement of contaminated material, introduction of exotic species, certain fishing activities, and the conversion of aquatic habitat that may eliminate, diminish, or disrupt the functions of EFH.  If known, describe the EFH most likely to be affected by these activities.   For each activity, describe the known or potential impacts to EFH.  These descriptions should explain the mechanisms or processes that cause expected deleterious effects, and explain the known or potential impacts on the habitat function (e.g., carcinogenic effects, bioaccumulation, clogged gills, reduced visibility for prey capture, etc.).  When there are sufficient data to support it, the use of a GIS is encouraged.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>Tier 2:</STRONG>  Using Tier 1 as a basis, identify and describe those activities that can influence habitat function on an ecosystem or watershed scale.  This should include an assessment of the cumulative and synergistic effects of multiple threats, including natural adverse effects  (such as storm damage or climate-based environmental shifts), and an ecological risk assessment of the managed species' habitat.  For the purposes of this analysis, cumulative impacts are impacts on the environment that result from the incremental impact of an action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions.  Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor, but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.  The use of a GIS to analyze and present these data is required under this tier.<P>
<P>
For the identification and description of adverse effects on EFH, FMPs should provide scientific justification that the potential or known adverse effects are a result of the identified activities.  Examples of scientific justification include, but are not limited to: peer-reviewed articles and reports; resource agency publications that have been subjected to internal agency review; agency data products, such as research findings, on-going evaluations and scientific knowledge of species, ecosystems, or watershed systems; ocean temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity logs; fish landings reports; satellite and aerial imagery data products; and testimonies of individuals with a demonstrated expertise regarding the resources under discussion. <P>
<P>
<STRONG>1.  Fishing-Related Activities</STRONG><P>
<P>
Adverse impacts from fishing may include physical disturbance of the substrate, loss of and injury to benthic organisms, and loss of and injury to prey species and their habitat.  Benthic organisms are a particular concern because they may also create important microhabitat features of EFH that directly affect survival and feeding success of early life history stages of the managed species.  FMPs must include management options that minimize adverse impacts, to the extent practicable, and identify potential conservation and enhancement measures. Because fishing activities fall within the regulatory control of the Councils and the Secretary, it is incumbent upon NMFS and the Councils to gather sufficient information to support evaluation of these options.  Fishery management options may include, but are not limited to:<P>
<P>
     <DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(i) <U>Fishing gear restrictions</U>. These options may include, but are not limited to: limit seasonal and areal uses of trawl gear and bottom longlines; restrict net mesh sizes, traps, and entanglement gear to allow escapement of juveniles and non-target species; reduce fish and shellfish traps set near coral reefs and other hard bottoms; limit seasonal and areal uses of dredge gear in sensitive habitats; prohibit use of explosives and chemicals; restrict diving activities that have potential adverse effects; prohibit the use of nets that have a high rate of incidental take or bycatch; prohibit drift gillnets; prohibit anchoring of fishing vessels in coral reef areas and other significant areas; and prohibit fishing activities that cause significant physical damage in areas of EFH, such as SAV, algal beds, rock reefs, and sand dollar beds.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
     <DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(ii) <U>Closed areas/times</U>.  These spatial and temporal actions may include, but are not limited to: closing areas to all fishing or specific gear types during spawning, migration, foraging and nursery activities; and designating zones to limit effects of fishing practices on certain vulnerable or rare areas/species/life history stages, e.g. Special Management Zones, Habitat Areas of Particular Concern, Areas of Biological Significance, and Species of Concern.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(iii) <U>Harvest limits</U>.  These actions may include, but are not limited to: limits on take of species that provide structural habitat for other species assemblages or communities, e.g., "live rock," SAV including eelgrass, kelp beds (e.g., "roe-on-kelp" fishery), and other marine habitats.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Non-Fishing Related Activities</STRONG><P>
<P>
A variety of  activities within watersheds and in offshore and coastal  areas affect fish habitat.  These activities affect living marine resources directly and indirectly through habitat loss and/or modification.  These effects, combined with cumulative effects from activities in adjacent areas, have contributed to the decline of some species.<P>
<P>
FMPs should include options that minimize these effects and identify potential enhancement measures.  Conservation and enhancement recommendations may include, but are not limited to:<P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(i) <U>Avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts on EFH</U>.   Environmentally sound engineering and management practices (e.g., seasonal restrictions, dredging methods, disposal options, etc.) should be employed for all dredging and construction projects.  Disposal of contaminated dredge material, sewage sludge, industrial waste or other materials in EFH should be avoided.  Oil and gas exploration, production, transportation, and refining activities in EFH should be avoided, where possible, and minimize and mitigate if unavoidable.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(ii) <U>Restoration of riparian and shallow coastal areas</U>.  Restoration measures could include: restoration of functions of riparian vegetation by reestablishing mature trees or other appropriate vegetation, restore natural bottom characteristics; removal of material from areas where accumulation is caused by human activities; and replacement of gravel to stream areas for spawning.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
     <DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(iii) <U>Upland habitat restoration</U>.  This should include measures to control erosion, stabilize roads, upgrade culverts for fish passage, and manage watershed uses.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(iv) <U>Water quality</U>.  This includes enforcement of best land management practices for ensuring water quality standards at state and Federal levels, improved treatment of sewage, and disposal of waste materials. 
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(v) <U>Watershed analysis and subsequent watershed planning</U>.  This should be encouraged at the local and state levels.  This effort should minimize depletion/diversion of freshwater flows into rivers and estuaries, destruction/degradation of wetlands, and introduction of non-native species, and should consider climate changes.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(vi) <U>Habitat creation</U>.  Require justification for habitat created at the expense of another naturally functioning systems (e.g., marsh creation with dredge material placed in shallow water habitat).
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>C.	Recommendations for Improving Habitat Information</STRONG><P>
<P>
Each FMP should contain recommendations, preferably in priority order, for research efforts that the Councils and NMFS view as necessary for carrying out their EFH management mandate.  The primary need for additional research is to make available sufficient information to support a higher level of description and identification of EFH (Section IV.A.3).  An initial inventory of available environmental and fisheries data sources relevant to the managed species should be useful in describing and identifying EFH.  This inventory should also help to identify major species-specific habitat data gaps.  Gaps in data availability (i.e., accessibility, use and application of the data) and in data quality (including considerations of scale and resolution; relevance; and potential biases in collection and interpretation) should be identified.  The recommendations may include basic life history information that will result in the comprehensive identification of the habitat requirements of the species (or species assemblages), including all life stages, as well as habitat-related information that defines the interrelationship between the species, its environment and the food chain (e.g., drifter studies to determine current flows, and tagging studies for determination of migratory pathways and habitat-use patterns).<P>
<P>
Additional research may also be necessary to identify and evaluate actual and potential adverse effects on EFH, including, but not limited to: direct physical alteration; impaired habitat quality/functions; or indirect adverse effects such as sea level rise; global warming and climate shifts; and non-gear fishery impacts.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act specifically identifies the effects of fishing as a concern.  The need for additional research on the effects of fishing gear on EFH may be included in this section of the FMP.  If an adverse effect is identified and determined to be an impediment to reaching target long-term production levels, then the research needed to quantify and mitigate this effect should be identified in this section.<P>
<P>
A target production level and the habitat necessary to support this level of productivity should be defined in the EFH amendment process, against which success can be measured.  This should represent a measure of the habitat necessary to restore levels of species productivity to feasible historic levels, taking into account accepted productivity levels and any adverse effects that have already reduced available EFH.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>V.	DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF EFH FMP AMENDMENTS</STRONG><P>
<P>
The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires NMFS to:<P>
<P>
 
<UL><LI>Develop recommendations that will assist the Councils in identifying and describing EFH, adverse impacts to EFH (including adverse impacts from fishing), and actions to conserve and enhance EFH; and<P>
</UL>
<P>
<UL><LI>Recommend conservation and enhancement measures for actions undertaken by any Federal or state agency that would adversely affect EFH. 
</UL><P>
<P>
These efforts will involve close cooperation with the Councils, states, other Federal agencies, interstate fisheries commissions, tribal agencies, academia, fishing participants, conservation organizations, and other interested parties.<P>
<P>
Based on schedules submitted by each Council, NMFS will establish a master schedule within 60 days of publication of the final rule to indicate when FMPs will be amended to include EFH.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>A.	Evaluation of FMPs</STRONG><P>
<P>
Since 1986, the Magnuson-Stevens Act has required that each FMP describe significant fishery habitat and the effects habitat impacts may have on the fishery.  The initial step in preparing EFH amendments will be for NMFS and each Council to evaluate the existing habitat information in each FMP.  This review will help establish the amount and quality of the information on life history, habitat, and distribution for each species or assemblage of species managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  This evaluation should compare existing FMP documentation to the hierarchical approach outlined in section IV.A.3.  <P>
<P>
In cooperation with the Councils, and after consulting with fishery participants, NMFS should identify additional information to assist the Councils with EFH amendments.  Significant data gaps should also be identified. <P>
<P>
<STRONG>B. 	Development of EFH Identification Recommendations</STRONG><P>
<P>
After reviewing the best available scientific information, and in consultation with the Councils, participants in the fishery, and other interested parties, NMFS will develop recommendations for the identification of EFH in each FMP.  Prior to submitting a formal EFH identification recommendation to the Council for an FMP, the draft recommendation will be made available for public review and at least one public meeting will be held.<P>
<P>
The contents of EFH identification recommendations may vary depending on the amount of supporting information available for the species being considered.  For EFH, presence/absence data for a species with "Level 1" information (see Section IV.B.2.i) will support a simple graphical display, while the more complex data sets expected at "Level 3" will support more detailed comparison of life history stages and habitat types to yield displays of distribution over time.  For mitigative measures, the level of detail will be dictated by a combination of species and impact information.  Point source discharges, designated disposal sites, and known pollutant loads may provide sufficient information to develop mitigative measures for certain impacts in specific areas, perhaps even with seasonal restrictions.  Such determinations will be made by NMFS and the Councils based on the available information for each species or species assemblage. <P>
<P>
<STRONG>C.	Preparation of EFH Amendments</STRONG><P>
<P>
NMFS will consider the best available scientific information in developing EFH amendments for Council consideration.  Councils have the option of incorporating some or all of the NMFS recommendations into their EFH amendments, consistent with this framework.  <P>
<P>
<STRONG>D.	Schedule for EFH Amendments</STRONG>  <P>
<P>
The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires that NMFS develop a schedule for amending FMPs.  NMFS will develop the amendment schedule based on discussions with each Council, thereby balancing pressures from other priorities and staff availability.  NMFS will use the schedule to anticipate when its contributions will be needed by each Council.  Several factors are likely to affect EFH amendment schedules:<P>
<P>
 <UL><LI>Is there sufficient information to prepare an EFH amendment early in the 18-month period or is the amount and quality of habitat data available expected to improve later in the amendment period?</UL><P>
<P>
 <UL><LI>Can the EFH amendment be combined with an FMP amendment that may already be anticipated within the 18-month amendment period?
</UL><P>
<P>
 <UL><LI>Could certain aspects of the information available on life history, adverse effects, EFH, and/or mitigative measures for one species be applied to more than one FMP, thereby expediting the amendment process?
</UL><P>
<P>
 <UL><LI>Will staff resources constrain the pace or order of work on EFH amendments?</UL><P>
<P>
 <UL><LI>How will preparation and approval tasks for all EFH amendments be distributed over the 18-month period, both for the Councils and NMFS?</UL><P>
<P>
To arrange workloads during the 18-month amendment period, each Council should notify NMFS of its intended EFH amendment schedule within 1 month of publication of final guidelines in the <U>Federal Register</U>.  NMFS will combine those schedules into a master list of all proposed EFH amendments and make the schedule available to the public.  Further discussion may be needed to balance amendment schedules with resource availability.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>E.	Future Review of EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
Each Council and NMFS are expected to review the EFH components of FMPs.  Each FMP EFH identification recommendation and amendment should include a provision to review and update EFH information and prepare a revised FMP amendment if new information becomes available.  The schedule for this review should be based on an assessment of the quality of both the existing data and expectations when new data will be available.  Such a review of information should be conducted at least once every five years. <P>
<P>
<STRONG>VI.	COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION ON EFH</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>A.  GENERAL</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>1.  Scope </STRONG><P>
<P>
The following guidance addresses the coordination and consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  These include the requirement that: Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary on all activities, or proposed activities, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency, that may adversely affect EFH; and the Secretary and the Councils provide recommendations to conserve EFH to Federal or state agencies on such activities.  EFH conservation recommendations are measures recommended by the Councils or NMFS to a Federal or state agency to conserve EFH.  Such recommendations may include measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or otherwise offset adverse effects on EFH resulting from actions or proposed actions authorized, funded, or undertaken  by that agency.  These actions are mandated by sections 305(b)(2-4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  These requirements are also explained within sections III(D-E) of this framework.  The following guidance for a coordination and consultative process should assist all parties involved to clearly and consistently interpret and implement the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Coordination with Other Environmental Reviews</STRONG> <P>
<P>
Consultation and coordination under sections 305(b)(1)(D), 305(b)(2), and 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act may be consolidated with interagency coordination procedures required by other statutes, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Federal Power Act, to reduce duplication and improve efficiency.  For example, a Federal agency preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) need not duplicate sections of that document in a separate EFH assessment, provided the EIS specifically and fully evaluates the effects of the proposed action on EFH, notes that it is intended to function as an EFH assessment, is provided to NMFS for review, and meets the other requirements for an EFH assessment contained in this section.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>3.  Designation of Lead Agency</STRONG> <P>
<P>
If more than one Federal or state agency is involved in an action (e.g., authorization is needed from more than one agency), the consultation requirements of sections 305(b)(2-4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act may be fulfilled through a lead agency.  The lead agency shall notify NMFS in writing that it is representing one or more additional agencies.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>4.  Conservation and Enhancement of EFH </STRONG><P>
<P>
To further the conservation and enhancement of EFH in accordance with section 305(b)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS will compile and make available to other Federal and state agencies syntheses of the locations of EFH, including maps and/or narrative descriptions.  Federal and state agencies empowered to authorize, fund, or undertake actions that could adversely affect any EFH identified in an FMP are encouraged to contact NMFS and the Councils to become familiar with the extent of, and potential threats to EFH, as well as opportunities to promote the conservation and enhancement of such habitat.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>B. COUNCIL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES</STRONG> <P>
<P>
<STRONG>1.  Establishment of Procedures</STRONG><P>
<P>
Each Council should establish procedures for reviewing activities authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken, by state or Federal agencies that may affect the habitat, including EFH, of a species under its authority.  Each Council may identify activities of concern by: directing Council advisory staff to track proposed actions; having the Council's habitat committee identify activities of concern; entering into an agreement with the NMFS Regional Administrator to notify the Council of activities that may be a concern; or by similar procedures.  Federal and state actions often follow specific timetables which may not coincide with Council meetings.  Councils may wish to consider establishing abbreviated procedures for the development of Council recommendations.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Early Involvement</STRONG><P>
<P>
Councils should provide comments and recommendations on proposed state and Federal activities of interest as early as practicable in project planning to ensure thorough consideration of Council concerns by the responsible agency.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>3.  Coordination with NMFS</STRONG><P>
<P>
The Secretary will develop agreements with each Council to facilitate coordination between the Councils and NMFS on EFH conservation recommendations.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>C.  FEDERAL AGENCY CONSULTATION</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>1. Interagency Coordination </STRONG><P>
<P>
Both Federal and state agencies are encouraged to coordinate their actions with NMFS to facilitate the early identification of potential adverse effects on EFH.  However, the consultative requirements of sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act differ for Federal agencies versus state agencies.  Federal agencies have a statutory requirement to consult with NMFS regarding actions that may adversely affect EFH, pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.   NMFS is mandated under section 305(b)(4) to provide EFH recommendations regarding state and Federal agency actions that could adversely affect EFH (see section D).  In order for NMFS to fulfill its obligation regarding EFH recommendations to states, a process to facilitate EFH recommendations on state activities should be developed.   Both Federal and state agencies are encouraged to develop specific agreements (or modify existing agreements) with NMFS to meet these requirements in a manner to increase the efficiency of the consulting requirements and to fully meet the intent and purpose of the Magnuson-Stevens Act EFH provisions. <P>
<P>
<STRONG>2. Designation of Non-Federal Representative </STRONG><P>
<P>
A Federal agency may designate a non-Federal representative to conduct an abbreviated consultation or prepare an EFH assessment by giving written notice of such designation to NMFS.  If a non-Federal representative is used, the Federal agency shall provide guidance and supervision and shall independently review the scope and contents of the EFH assessment.  The Federal agency remains ultimately responsible for compliance with sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>3. General Concurrence</STRONG> <P>
<P>
(a) <U>Purpose</U>.  The General Concurrence process identifies specific types of Federal actions that may affect EFH, but for which no further consultation is generally required because NMFS determines, through an analysis of that class of action, that they are likely to result in minimal adverse effects individually or cumulatively.  General Concurrences may be national or regional in scope.<P>
<P>
(b) <U>Requirements</U>.  <P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(1)  For Federal actions to qualify for General Concurrence, NMFS must determine, after consultation with the appropriate Council(s), that the actions meet the following criteria:
</DL>
<P>
<P>
     <DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd><DL>

		(2)  Categories of Federal actions may also qualify for General Concurrence if they are modified by appropriate conditions that ensure the actions will meet the criteria in paragraph 3(b)(1) above.  For example, NMFS may provide General Concurrence for additional actions contingent upon project size limitations, seasonal restrictions, or other conditions.<P>
<P>
(c) <U>General Concurrence Initiated by Federal Agency</U>.  A Federal agency may request General Concurrence by providing NMFS with a written description of the nature and approximate number of the proposed actions, an analysis of the effects of the actions on EFH and associated species and their life history stages, including cumulative effects, and the Federal agency's conclusions regarding the magnitude of such effects.  If NMFS agrees that the actions are likely to result in minimal adverse effects to EFH,  NMFS, in consultation with the Council(s), will provide the Federal agency with a written statement of General Concurrence that further consultation is not required, and that preparation of EFH assessments for individual actions subject to the General Concurrence is not necessary.  If NMFS determines that the actions would adversely affect EFH, NMFS will notify the Federal agency that abbreviated or expanded consultation is required.  <P>
<P>
(d)  <U>Notification and Further Consultation</U>.  NMFS may request notification for activities covered under a General Concurrence if NMFS concludes there are circumstances under which such activities could result in more than a minimal impact on EFH.  NMFS may require further consultation for these activities on a case-by-case basis.  Each General Concurrence should establish specific procedures for notification that further consultation is possible.<P>
<P>
(e) <U>Revisions to General Concurrences</U>.  NMFS will periodically review and revise its findings of General Concurrence as appropriate.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>4.  EFH Assessments</STRONG>  <P>
<P>
(a) <U> Preparation requirement</U>.  Federal agencies (or designated non-Federal representatives) must complete an EFH assessment for any action that may adversely affect EFH identified in a FMP, except for those activities covered by a finding of General Concurrence.  <P>
<P>

The assessment may incorporate by reference a completed EFH assessment prepared for a previous action, supplemented with any relevant new information, provided the proposed action involves similar impacts to EFH in the same geographic area or a similar ecological setting.  It may also incorporate by reference other environmental assessment documents.  These documents must be provided to NMFS.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>5.  Abbreviated Consultation Procedures </STRONG><P>
<P>
(a)  <U>Purpose</U>.  Abbreviated consultation allows NMFS to quickly determine whether, and to what degree, a Federal agency action may adversely affect EFH.  The abbreviated consultation process is appropriate for Federal actions that would adversely affect EFH when, in NMFS' judgment, the adverse effect(s) of such actions could be alleviated through minor modifications to the proposed action.  <P>
<P>
(b)  <U>Notification by agency</U>.  The Federal agency shall notify NMFS and the appropriate Council as early as practicable regarding proposed actions that may adversely affect EFH.  Notification will facilitate discussion of measures to conserve the habitat.  Such early consultation shall normally occur during pre-application planning for projects subject to a Federal permit or license, and during preliminary planning for projects to be funded or undertaken directly by a Federal agency.<P>
<P>
(c)  <U>Submittal of EFH assessment</U>.  The Federal agency shall submit a completed EFH assessment to NMFS for review.  If either the Federal agency or NMFS believes expanded consultation will be necessary, the Federal agency shall initiate expanded consultation concurrently with submission of the EFH assessment. <P>
<P>
(d)  <U>NMFS response</U>.  NMFS shall respond in writing as to whether it concurs with the findings of the assessment.  NMFS' response shall indicate whether expanded consultation is required.  If additional consultation is not necessary, NMFS' response shall include any appropriate EFH conservation recommendations to be used by the Federal agency.  NMFS will send a copy of its response to the appropriate Council.<P>
<P>
(e)  <U>Timing</U>.  Wherever possible, the Federal agency shall submit its EFH assessment to NMFS at least 60 days prior to final approval of the action, and NMFS shall respond in writing within 30 days.  NMFS and Federal agencies may agree to use a compressed schedule in cases where regulatory approvals cannot accommodate 30 days for consultation, or to conduct consultation earlier in the planning cycle for proposed actions with lengthy approval processes.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>6.  Expanded Consultation Procedures </STRONG><P>
<P>
(a)  <U>Purpose</U>.  Expanded consultation is appropriate for Federal actions that would result in substantial adverse effects to EFH and/or require more detailed analysis to enable NMFS to develop EFH conservation recommendations.<P>
<P>
(b) <U> Initiation</U>.  Expanded consultation begins when NMFS receives a written request from a Federal agency to initiate expanded consultation.  The Federal agency's written request must include a completed EFH assessment.  Subject to NMFS' approval, any request for expanded consultation may encompass number of similar individual actions within a given geographic area.<P>
<P>
(c)   <U>NMFS response</U>.  NMFS will:<P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(1)  Review the EFH assessment, any additional information furnished by the Federal agency, and other relevant information; 
</DL>
<P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(2)  Conduct a site visit, if necessary and appropriate, to assess the quality of the habitat and to clarify the impacts of the Federal agency action;
</DL>
<P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(3)  Evaluate the effects of the action on EFH, including cumulative effects;
</DL>
<P>
<P>
		<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(4)  Coordinate its review of the proposed action with the appropriate Council; and
</DL>
<P>
<P>
	<DL>
<DT><dd><DT><dd>(5)  Formulate EFH conservation recommendations and provide the recommendations to the Federal agency and the appropriate Council.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
(d)  <U>Timing</U>.  NMFS will conclude expanded consultation within 60 days of its initiation unless extended by agreement between NMFS and the Federal agency.  NMFS and Federal agencies may agree to use a compressed schedule in cases where regulatory approvals cannot accommodate 60 days for consultation. <P>
<P>
(e)  <U>Best scientific information</U>.  The Federal agency shall provide NMFS with the best scientific information available, or reasonably accessible during the consultation, regarding the effects of the proposed action on EFH.<P>
<P>
(f) <U> Extension of consultation</U>.  If NMFS determines that additional data or analysis would provide better information with which to develop EFH conservation recommendations, NMFS may request that the Federal agency agree to extend expanded consultation.  If NMFS and the Federal agency agree to an extension, the Federal agency shall provide the additional information to NMFS, to the extent practicable.  If NMFS and the Federal agency do not agree to extend consultation, NMFS shall provide EFH conservation recommendations to the Federal agency using the best scientific data available to NMFS.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>7.  Responsibilities of Federal Agency Following Receipt of EFH Conservation Recommendations </STRONG><P>
<P>
(a)  <U>Federal agency response</U>.  Within 30 days after receiving an EFH conservation recommendation (or prior to final approval of the action, if a decision by the Federal agency is required in less than 30 days), the Federal agency shall provide a detailed response in writing to NMFS and the appropriate Council.  The response shall include a description of measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting the impact of the activity on EFH.  In the case of a response that is inconsistent with the recommendations of NMFS, the Federal agency shall explain its reasons for not following the recommendations, including the scientific justification for any disagreements with NMFS over the anticipated effects of the proposed action and the measures needed to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or offset such effects.<P>
<P>
(b)  <U>Dispute resolution</U>.  After receiving a Federal agency response that is inconsistent with the recommendations of NMFS, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (or a designee) may request a meeting with the head of the Federal  agency, as well as any other agencies involved, to discuss the proposed action and opportunities for resolving any disagreements.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>8.  Resumption of Consultation</STRONG> <P>
<P>
A Federal agency must resume consultation with NMFS following either abbreviated or expanded consultation if the agency substantially revises its plans for the action or if new information becomes available that affects the basis for NMFS' EFH recommendations.  Additionally, where Federal oversight, involvement, or control over the action has been retained or is authorized by law, the Federal agency must resume consultation if new EFH is designated that may be adversely affected by the agency's exercise of its authority.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>D.  NMFS RECOMMENDATIONS TO STATE AGENCIES</STRONG><P>
<P>
<STRONG>1.	Establishment of Procedures</STRONG><P>
<P>
Each NMFS Region will establish procedures for identifying actions or proposed actions authorized, funded, or undertaken by state agencies that adversely effect EFH, and for identifying the most appropriate method for providing EFH conservation recommendations to the state agency.  In some cases, project-specific recommendations may be required, in other cases, programmatic recommendations may be appropriate.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>2.	Coordination with Federal Consultation Procedures</STRONG><P>
<P>
When an activity that may adversely effect EFH requires authorization or funding by both Federal and state agencies, NMFS will provide the appropriate state agencies with copies of EFH conservation recommendations developed as part of the Federal consultations procedures in section VI.C.<P>

Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use and Operation of Mitigation Banks<P>

AGENCIES:  Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, DOD; Environmental
Protection Agency; Natural Resources Conservation Service, Agriculture; Fish and
Wildlife Service, Interior; and National Marine Fisheries  Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commerce.<P>

ACTION:  Notice<P>
</STRONG>
SUMMARY:  The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Fish and Wildlife Service
(FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are issuing final policy guidance
regarding the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks for the purpose of
providing compensation for adverse impacts to wetlands and other aquatic resources. 
The purpose of this guidance is to clarify the manner in which mitigation banks may be
used to satisfy mitigation requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404
permit program and the wetland conservation provisions of the Food Security Act (FSA)
(i.e., "Swampbuster" provisions).  Recognizing the potential benefits mitigation banking
offers for streamlining the permit evaluation process and providing more effective
mitigation for authorized impacts to wetlands, the agencies encourage the
establishment and appropriate use of mitigation banks in the Section 404 and "Swampbuster" programs.<P>

DATES:  The effective date of this Memorandum to the Field is 30 days from its
publication in the Federal Register (which was 11/28/95).<P>

<STRONG>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Mr. Jack Chowning (Corps) at (202) 761-1781; Mr. Thomas Kelsch (EPA) at (202) 260-8795; Ms. Sandra Byrd (NRCS) at (202) 690-3501; Mr. Mark Miller (FWS) at (703) 358-2183; Ms. Susan-Marie Stedman (NMFS) at (301) 713-2325.</STRONG><P>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Mitigating the environmental impacts of necessary development actions on the Nation's wetlands and other aquatic resources is a central premise of Federal wetlands programs. The CWA Section 404 permit program relies on the use of compensatory mitigation to offset unavoidable damage to wetlands and other aquatic resources through, for example, the restoration or creation of wetlands. Under the "Swampbuster" provisions of the FSA, farmers are required to provide mitigation to offset certain conversions of wetlands for agricultural purposes in order to maintain their program eligibility.<P>

     Mitigation banking has been defined as wetland restoration, creation, enhancement, and in exceptional circumstances, preservation undertaken expressly for the purpose of compensating for unavoidable wetland losses in advance of development actions, when such compensation cannot be achieved at the development site or would not be as environmentally beneficial. It typically involves the consolidation of small, fragmented wetland mitigation projects into one large contiguous site. Units of restored, created, enhanced or preserved wetlands are expressed as "credits" which may subsequently be withdrawn to offset "debits" incurred at a project development site.<P>

     Ideally, mitigation banks are constructed and functioning in advance of development impacts, and are seen as a way of reducing uncertainty in the CWA Section 404 permit program or the FSA "Swampbuster" program by having established compensatory mitigation credit available to an applicant. By consolidating compensation requirements, banks can more effectively replace lost wetland functions within a watershed, as well as provide economies of scale relating to the planning, implementation, monitoring and management of mitigation projects. On August 23, 1993, the Clinton Administration released a comprehensive package of improvements to Federal wetlands programs which included support for the use of mitigation banks. At that same time, EPA and the Department of the Army issued interim guidance clarifying the role of mitigation banks in the Section 404 permit program and providing general guidelines for their  establishment and use. In that document it was acknowledged that additional guidance would be developed, as necessary, following completion of the first phase of the Corps Institute for Water Resources national study on mitigation banking.<P>

     The Corps, EPA, NRCS, FWS and NMFS provided notice [60 FR 12286; March 6, 1995] of a proposed guidance on the policy of the Federal government regarding the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks. The proposed guidance was based, in part, on the experiences to date with mitigation banking, as well as other environmental, economic and institutional issues identified through the Corps nationalstudy. Over 130 comments were received on the proposed guidance. The final guidance is based on full and thorough consideration of the public comments received.<P>

     A majority of the letters received supported the proposed guidance in general, but suggested modifications to one or more parts of the proposal. In response to these comments, several changes have been made to further clarify the provisions and make
other modifications, as necessary, to ensure effective establishment and use of mitigation banks. One key issue on which the agencies received numerous comments
focused on the timing of credit withdrawal.  In order to provide additional clarification of the changes made to the final guidance in response to comments, the agencies wish to emphasize that it is our intent to ensure that decisions to allow credits to be withdrawn from a mitigation bank in advance of bank maturity be made on a case-by-case basis to best reflect the particular ecological and economic circumstances of each bank. The percentage of advance credits permitted for a particular bank may be higher or lower than the 15 percent example included in the proposed guidance.  The final guidance is being revised to eliminate the reference to a specific percentage in order to provide needed flexibility. Copies of the comments and the agencies' response to significant comments are available for public review.  Interested parties should contact the agency representatives for additional information.<P>

     This guidance does not change the substantive requirements of the Section 404 permit program or the FSA "Swampbuster" program.  Rather, it interprets and provides
internal guidance and procedures to the agency field personnel for the establishment,
use and operation of mitigation banks consistent with existing regulations and policies of each program. The policies set out in this document are not final agency action, but
are intended solely as guidance.  The guidance is not intended, nor can it be relied
upon, to create any rights enforceable by any party in litigation with the United States. This guidance does not establish or affect legal rights or obligations, establish a binding
norm on any party and it is not finally determinative of the issues addressed. Any
regulatory decisions made by the agencies in any particular matter addressed by this guidance will be made by applying the governing law and regulations to the relevant
facts. The purpose of the document is to provide policy and technical guidance to encourage the effective use of mitigation banks as a means of compensating for the
authorized loss of wetlands and other aquatic resources.<P>

                        <STRONG> <CENTER>Habitat Funding Requests Move Through Congress</CENTER> </STRONG><P>

<P>
<BR>
Congressional appropriations committees in the Senate and House of Representatives have marked funding levels for NMFS Office of Habitat Conservation programs for Fiscal Year 1997, which begins  October 1, 1996. The President s FY97 budget had requested increases of $2.3 million for the NMFS Habitat Conservation line item (from $8 to $10.3 million) and $1.5 million for habitat restoration under the NMFS Resource Information line item. The House did not provide any increased funding for these two high-priority program activities. However, the House did provide for an increase for the  Chesapeake Bay Studies program activities to restore funding to the level of the FY96 President s request. The Senate on the other hand provided sufficient funds for the habitat conservation and restoration requests, but did not restore the Chesapeake Bay funding.<P>

<P>
<BR>
The President s Habitat Conservation line item request related to supporting growing demands on NMFS to identify and preserve essential fish habitats, implement innovative approaches for the protection of coastal wetlands, and deal with the significantly increased influx of major hydroelectric dam relicensings during the late 1990 s. The habitat restoration funding request represents necessary base funding that has never been available to implement NMFS responsibilities under the NOAA Damage Assessment and Restoration Program, including funds necessary to initiate a restoration research program. Lack of base funding has restricted NMFS restoration activities to natural resource damage actions, collaborative projects with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other reimbursable projects.  <P>
<P>
<BR>
Support for increased NMFS activities is a key step towards implementing the NMFS Habitat Plan. Differences between the House and Senate appropriations levels will be resolved during a House-Senate conference in September.

<P>
<BR>

In late March, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the U.S. Senate marked up and reported S. 39, the <STRONG><EM>Sustainable Fisheries Act,</EM></STRONG> to the Senate floor. While the full Senate failed to take up S. 39 prior to recessing for the month of August, substantial progress was made in resolving concerns that have prevented floor action to date. Staff for Senators Stevens, Kerry, Gorton, Murray, Wyden, and Snowe appear to have reached agreement on the provisions of the manager s amendment that will enable the bill to go to the Senate floor on September 4 under unanimous consent.  <P>
<P>

Like H.R. 39, the <STRONG><EM>Fishery Conservation and Management Amendments of 1995,</EM></STRONG> which the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 388 to 37 last October, the Senate version provides for increased habitat conservation activities by the regional fishery management councils and the Secretary of Commerce. The strengthened habitat provisions call for the councils to identify essential fish habitat for each fishery and minimize adverse effects on habitat due to fishing. The bill also expands the existing authority of the councils and the Secretary to comment on Federal actions that would affect habitat.<STRONG> Ralph Lopez (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

 <STRONG>  <CENTER>Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks Published</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>

The final Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks was published in the Federal Register on November 28, 1995. It became effective on December 28, 1995, and will serve as guidance for all Federal agencies involved in mitigation banking. The guidance was developed as an interagency effort by staff from NMFS  Office of Habitat Conservation in cooperation with staff from the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The draft guidance was published in the Federal Register in March 1995 for public comment and revised after consideration of those comments.<P>
<P>
<BR>
The major purpose of the guidance is to coordinate and facilitate the establishment, use, and operation of mitigation banks to provide ecologically sound wetland mitigation. To that end, the guidance establishes an interagency process that allows resource protection agencies such as NMFS to have input into mitigation bank planning and operation, beginning at the earliest stages. By soliciting recommendations from resource protection agencies early in the planning process, bank sponsors are better able to plan mitigation banks that provide appropriate mitigation and whose use will be acceptable to the resource agencies.<P>
<P>
<BR>
The guidance has been sent to all NMFS Habitat field offices, is available as a WordPerfect file via e-mail (send an e-mail request to  Susan.Stedman@noaa.gov ), and can be accessed via the NMFS Habitat Program World Wide Web Homepage (http://www.kingfish.ssp.nmfs.gov/rschreib/habitat.html).  To further facilitate the establishment of good mitigation banks, an interagency group is working on a sample mitigation banking agreement and other technical appendices to the guidance. These documents will be publicized as they become available. <STRONG>Susan-Marie Stedman (301) 713-2325</STRONG><P>

<STRONG><CENTER> Corps Issues Draft Regulatory Guidance Letter on Programmatic General Permits</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>
On April 26, 1996 the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a draft Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) on Programmatic General Permits (PGPs) in the Federal Register for public comment.  PGPs are used extensively in the northeast United States and a few other parts of the country to coordinate state and Federal programs and provide a more efficient wetland regulatory process for permit applicants. There is substantial interest from both Federal and state agencies in expanding the use of PGPs because PGPs allow Federal agencies to screen proposed projects and concentrate their evaluation efforts on those projects with the greatest potential for harming the  environment, while allowing states to take the lead in wetland permitting.<P>
<P>
<BR>
As part of the White House Wetlands Working Group, NOAA and NMFS staff reviewed early drafts of the RGL and suggested improvements, most of which were incorporated into the current version of the RGL.  During the public comment period that ended May 28, we solicited input and formal comments on the draft RGL from NMFS field offices. Our comments generally supported the draft RGL, but suggested that the RGL be  amended to 1) direct the Corps to coordinate with Federal natural resource agencies during reviews of PGPs and 2) remove numerical examples in the discussion of review categories. Publication of the final RGL is expected by the end of the summer.

     <STRONG> <CENTER>Sustain Healthy Coasts FY98 Budget Initiative Well Received by NOAA</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>
NOAA s Sustain Healthy Coasts (SHC) budget team presented its FY98 budget initiative to the NOAA Administration on May 3, 1996. The Office of Habitat Conservation represents the NMFS on the SHC team. NOAA guided the teams to develop initiatives based on two tiers of budget growth. Based on the team's Strategic Plan goals to "Protect, Conserve and Restore Coastal Habitats," "Promote Clean Coastal Waters," and "Foster Well-Planned Coastal Communities," three initiatives were proposed.  NMFS and the Office of Habitat Conservation solicited input from the regions and incorporated this information into a series of new initiatives. <P>
<P>
<BR>
Within the "Strengthen National Coastal Monitoring and Assessment" initiative, NMFS proposed two activities: "Enhance the Coastal Change Analysis Program," and "Build an Integrated Information Base for Water Quality Management." Several activities were proposed by NMFS within the "Improve Ecosystem Approaches to Coastal Management" initiative, including: "Enhance Ability to Influence Decisions;" "Build Regional Ecosystem Management and Assessments;" "Enhance Habitat Restoration;" "Improve Collection and Use of Biodiversity Information;" and "Improve Coral Reef Ecosystem Management." The "Improved Guidance" activity within the third initiative, "Mitigate Impacts of Coastal Hazards: Reduce Losses of Life and Property," also included a NMFS component. Many of these activities include the other line-office members of SHC: NOS, COP, OAR, and NESDIS.<P>
<P>
<BR>
Initial feedback from NOAA Administration has indicated support for NMFS  proposals.  Each of the proposals submitted within the first tier was supported at or near requested levels and one activity proposed in the second tier was pulled into the first tier by NOAA. NOAA forwarded the final budget proposal to the Department of Commerce on June 17.

                               Weakfish Amendment</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) is working to improve the habitat sections of its interstate fishery management plans. Following a presentation on NMFS  activities in mapping fish habitats and distributions at their annual meeting (November, 1995),  ASMFC  looked to the Office of Habitat Conservation for assistance in developing a series of maps for amendment 3 to their weakfish FMP.<P>
<P>
<BR>
The Office of Habitat Conservation collected weakfish distribution data from several sources, including NOS, NMFS, and seven Atlantic states. Maps have been prepared to display seasonal distribution and relative abundance for juvenile and adult weakfish throughout its range. The package was distributed to the state commissioners for review at the ASMFC spring meeting, where it was well received. Final maps have been refined for the final document. A full complement of maps will be included in the source document, and a summary series of maps will be included in the final amendment. This information is especially useful to expand the habitat sections and improve the overall amendments.

         <STRONG>New Bedford Harbor: First Round of Restoration Ideas Selected</STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>

During the past six months, the restoration of New Bedford Harbor has begun to take shape. The New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council has moved to identify restoration ideas, partners, and levels of funding for its first round of restoration implementation, employing extensive public involvement. The restoration has received a great deal of media coverage and, at times, generated a fair amount of controversy.<P>
<P>
<BR>
Last October, the Trustee Council issued a  Request for Ideas  to solicit restoration ideas and to publicize evaluation criteria.  As a result, 56 ideas were received from citizens, non-profits, municipalities, academic institutions, state and Federal agencies, and private businesses. A 15-member Community Restoration Advisory Board (CRAB) was established in early February. Along with a Technical Advisory Committee and the Trustees  legal counsel, the CRAB reviewed restoration ideas and made recommendations to the Trustees. Public meetings and a public comment period ensured a full exchange of information between poject proponents, members of the public, and the Trustees throughout the evaluation process.<P>
<P>
<BR>
On May 14th, the Trustees announced their commitment to 13 restoration ideas, related to: salt marsh and sea grass; shellfish; anadromous fish runs; tern colonies; conservation land acquisition; harbor management planning; and contributions toward habitat and public access aspects of municipal park construction. Total cost of the Trustees commitments is estimated at approximately $5 million of the $20 million restoration fund.<P>
<P>
<BR>
Ideas notably omitted were a feasibility study for an aquarium complex in downtown New Bedford and a number of sewer projects submitted by area municipalities.In spite of intense lobbying by proponents, elected officials, and the New Bedford Standard-Times, the Trustee Council decided that these ideas did not clearly satisfy the Trustees  mandate to restore natural resources injured by PCB releases.<P>
<P>
<BR>
At present, Habitat staff are working with idea proponents to finalize project outlines. These will become the preferred alternatives in a Restoration Plan/Draft EIS that is being developed by Habitat staff, with help from the Department of the Interior. Once the RP/EIS is completed and financial decisions are rendered by the Trustee Council, funds can be awarded; implementation of selected projects is expected during the spring and summer of 1997.<P>
<P>
<BR>
The Trustee Council intends to initiate a second funding round once EPA issues a second Record of Decision for the Harbor cleanup; restoration activities will continue until EPA has completed remediation of the Harbor in about 10 years.

                          <STRONG><CENTER>Maryland State Programmatic 
                                 General Permit</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>

In March the Army Corps of Engineers  Baltimore District notified NMFS that they planned to issue the Maryland State Programmatic General Permit (SPGP) over NMFS objections. The SPGP would authorize a variety of construction activities in coastal and inland waters and wetlands throughout Maryland via a streamlined permitting process. Although NMFS supports the concept of streamlined wetlands permitting in Maryland, the SPGP would have allowed dredging or filling up to 5 acres of tidal waters and wetlands per project with minimal Federal oversight, leaving NMFS with much less opportunity to avoid and minimize the loss of important fish and shellfish habitat. In April NMFS elevated the issue to NOAA's Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere with a recommendation to seek review
of the Baltimore District s decision by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works pursuant to Section 404(q) of the Clean Water Act. After interagency discussions at the headquarters level NOAA decided not to refer the issue to Army under 404(q), but instead reached agreement with Army to resolve many of NMFS  concerns. The revised SPGP which became effective July 1, includes a reduced (3 acre) upper threshold for tidal waters and many procedural improvements that will
simplify NMFS efforts to review projects of concern to marine resources.<STRONG> Jon

The 1996 NSA annual meeting, held in Baltimore April 15-19, provided a forum for presenting results of more than 25 oyster disease research projects funded by NOAA through NCBO during 1993-94.  Abstracts of all papers are available. In addition a special Blue Crab Symposium, organized by Maryland Department of Natural Resources and NMFS scientists from the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory and NCBO, reviewed the current status of blue crab stocks, fisheries, and management throughout the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Preliminary results of the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee s blue crab stock assessment were presented. A break-out session was held to discuss research priorities for Chesapeake Bay blue crabs. The large uncertainty regarding the longevity of blue crabs was a major
topic of discussio since new information suggests the maximum age may be 6-8 years, rather than 4 years. A report for this symposium will be available shortly.

The Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee (CBSAC), chaired by NCBO, is nearly finished with its blue crab stock assessment. The assessment is based on size composition data from the NCBO-funded winter dredge survey, other long-term trawl surveys, biological information determined from NCBO-funded projects and other Bay-area blue crab scientific research. A subcommittee of state and NMFS fishery biologists completed a draft report in August, which will be reviewed initiatilly
through a mail review in September, followed by a review panel of stock assessment scientists in November, before final release of results.

             <STRONG> <CENTER> Dredged Material Placement in Upper Chesapeake Bay</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>
The NCBO and NMFS  Northeast Region have been participating with other stakeholders (state and Federal agencies, port industries, fishermen,  environmental groups) on technical and policy committees to evaluate options for disposal of clean dredged material from the Chesapeake Bay approach channels to Baltimore Harbor. About 108 million cubic yards of material will need to be dredged during the next
20 years, and existing placement sites will be filled up by fall 1997. The Governor has proposed a set of options developed through a consensus-based process that includes a mix of beneficial use, open water disposal, and containment sites. Chris Mantzaris, Habitat Division Chief, NMFS/NER, testified in general support of this process in a Maryland General Assembly hearing in March.<P>

<BR>
Habitat staff from the NCBO and NER have taken an active role in steering site selection away from areas of high living resource value, using a GIS overlay of key fish and waterfowl habitats and unique ecological features of the Bay. This new screening tool was developed by NCBO during the fall of 1995 in cooperation with other state and Federal natural resource agencies. The tool was instrumental in helping to narrow containment site options to four locations, three of which are in areas without high living resource value.  It has enabled NMFS to play a more constructive role in finding workable solutions to the dredged material placement issue, and may have applications elsewhere.<P>
<BR>
The Maryland General Assembly has pressured the state to identify two large containment sites in the upper Bay by September 1996 to solve the long-term capacity shortfall and calm the fears of port-related industries. Private industry has suggested dumping material into the "Deep Trough" of the Bay, an inexpensive but highly controversial option not in the Governor s action plan due to numerous environmental concerns, e.g., it is a refuge for over-wintering fish. The beneficial use/island restoration project at Poplar Island has broad support and is in the Governor s action plan but is very expensive relative to the other options. The Poplar Island project is expected to receive $22 million in FY97 from the Army Corps, with dike construction to begin this fall; no other option will be ready to accept material when capacity at existing sites runs out in 1997.<P>
<BR>
In early September, NMFS is expected to join other Federal and state resource agencies in signing a Statement of Cooperation to support the stae's efforts to identify a long-term economically and environmentally sound dredged material management plan, in accordance Federal and state laws.

                                Mitigation Bank</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>
NMFS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the South Carolina Departments of Transportation, Natural Resources and Health and Environmental Control; Federal Highway Administration; Corps of Engineers; Environmental Protection Agency; and the Fish and Wildlife Service to establish the $14 million Sandy Island Mitigation Bank. The agreement was produced as mitigation to offset the environmental impact of highway construction projects in South Carolina. Sandy Island comprises more than 9,000 acres of lands and wetlands of outstanding fish and wildlife value that
were faced with the imminent threat of development. The Agreement is intended to ensure that the area is maintained in its natural state in perpetuity. The agreement resolved complex issues and is an exceptional partnership effort between construction, regulatory, review, and private sector interests. According to Federal Highway Administration, they intend to use lessons learned in South
Carolina to foster better relations in other areas. NMFS notes that in South Carolina and Georgia the Federal Highway Administration has played an important role as mediator during negotiations regarding technical aspects of highway design and environmental protection compliance.<P>
<BR>

As an added bonus, the negotiations also resulted in the acquisition of an 8,000-acre tract of ecologically-important forested wetlands located in the Pee Dee River drainage in northeastern South Carolina. Reaction has been highly favorable and the land acquisitions have been regarded as being good investments because they foster needed highway projects and protect ecologically sensitive and
important areas. The purchase was made possible by eliminating extensive bridging of marginal value wetlands and re-diverting some funds to wetland and upland preservation.

                         <STRONG> <CENTER>Summary of CWPPRA Activities</CENTER></STRONG>

The  Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) was enacted November 29, 1990 to establish a Federal/State Interagency Task Force in Louisiana for the development, funding, and implementation of wetland restoration projects focused on the protection, conservation, enhancement, and restoration of eroding/threatened wetlands in the state. The goal of the Act is to reverse the long-term trend of coastal wetland loss. The focus on Louisiana is due to the state containing slightly more than 40% of the nation s coastal wetlands, but suffering 80% of total national wetland loss. A national component of the CWPPRA program is implemented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through two grants programs that fund wetlands conservation projects. The Task Force consists of:

      <UL>
<LI>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
</UL>

     <UL>
<LI> NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service (Department of Commerce)
</UL>

     <UL>

     <UL>
<LI> Environmental Protection Agency
</UL>

     <UL>
<LI> State of Louisiana (represented by the Governor s Office)

</UL><P>
<P>
<BR>

The principle responsibilities are development of a long-term restoration plan for Louisiana s coastal wetlands, and development of an annual priority project list for implementing wetland restoration projects.  Each restoration project is evaluated on anticipated benefits and cost-effectiveness and funded on a 75% Federal, 25% state cost-share basis. Currently more than 60 projects are authorized at a total cost of $160 million.  NMFS is the sponsor o 11 CWPPRA funded projects with approximately $40 million of funds (Federal and state) being allocated to the projects.  More than 40,000 acres are expected to benefit from these projects. The following four are representative:<P>
<P>
<BR>

     <STRONG> Mississippi River Feasibility Study and Diversion Project -</STRONG>  This study is
evaluating the large-scale use of river diversions to preserve, create, enhance, and protect Louisiana s wetlands.  NMFS was awarded one of the first large-scale wetland restoration projects by the CWPPRA Task Force. The Myrtle Grove Freshwater Diversion project was one of only two watershed scale "big picture" projects ever awarded funding by the Task Force.  The project is located in Plaquemines Parish (south of New Orleans) and will provide up to 2,100 cubic feet per second of freshwater from the Mississippi River to a 15,000 acre project area of eroding fresh and brackish marsh and wetlands. The project cost is estimated at $15 million.<P>
<P>
<BR>

      <STRONG>Vermillion Parish Wetlands  -</STRONG> The Little Vermillion Sediment Trapping/Terracing project will create wetlands by dredging small distributary channels into Little Vermillion Bay from the navigation channel.  The area has a large movement of sediment into the bay and the project will direct and trap the sediment into emergent marsh.<P>
<P>
<BR>
     <STRONG> Barrier Island EIS -</STRONG> NMFS signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)to develop  an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to restore Louisiana s barrier islands. The MOA is with the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and establishes the roles and funding for preparing the EIS. The MMS and NMFS are co-lead agencies for the EIS and the DNR is the lead cooperating agency for the state. The MMS is contracting the development of the EIS with Louisiana State University. The EIS scoping meeting was in May.  <P>

The Batiquitos Lagoon Enhancement Project, located near San Diego, California, is one of the most significant wetlands restoration projects in the United States. Restoration work to return the Lagoon to a full tidal system is ongoing and should be completed in early 1997. The project is funded by the Port of Los Angeles as a mitigation measure to offset the loss of deep-water marine habitat in outer Los
Angeles Harbor. When completed, the Lagoon will provide nearly 600 acres of restored subtidal, intertidal, and saltmarsh habitat. <STRONG>Robert Hoffman (310) 980-4043</STRONG><P>

                 <STRONG> <CENTER> Successful Live Coral Transplant in Hawaii</CENTER></STRONG><P>
<P>
<BR>

The world s first successful large-scale coral transpant took place in Kawaihae Bay, Hawaii. Over a period of six months, beginning in September 1995, nearly 15 tons of live coral colonies were transplanted from two breakwater alignments to two large sites under 15 to 20 feet of water. Additional coral transplants in 10 to 50 feet of water were relocated to seven other experimental sites.  <P>
<P>
<BR> 

"The Kawaihae project has been an unprecedented success, with ninety-nine percent of the coral surviving relocation," said Hilda Diaz-Soltero, NMFS Southwest Regional Administrator.<P>
<P>
<BR>

The coral transplant project was recommended by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service, through the Pacific Islands Habitat Program, to restore adjacent coral reef habitat which was damaged during construction of a small boat harbor. Negotiations to develop mitigation for coral loss during harbor construction began in 1992 between NMFS, other Federal agencies, and Hawaii resource agencies. <P>
<P>
<BR>

In September 1995 the coral transplant was started with funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE).  Volunteer divers from the Science Department of Hawaii Preparatory Academy were instrumental to the transplant effort. As coral heads were carefully detached by divers, then placed in large wire trays, they were lifted up off the bottom and transported by boat, still submerged, to the new sites. Several coral attachment methods were utilized and sediment traps were placed to measure sedimentation rates.<P>
<P>
<BR>
   
Photographic and visual sensoring techniques are being used to evaluate and monitor the coral survival.  Monitoring will continue through August 1998 under contract services with students and staff of the University of Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. Reports on the growth rates and mortality of the coral will be available during these three years.<P>
<P>
<BR>

Other parties participating in the project with NMFS and COE include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources, and the staff and students of the University of Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology and Hawaii Preparatory Academy.<P>
<P>
<BR>
 
As stated by Hilda Diaz-Soltero, this unprecedented project study "proves that large quantities of these living animals can survive the trauma of transplant."

<P>
Introduction<P></STRONG>

	 Every day a battle is waged to protect a vital part of our heritage and quality of life: the health and productivity of coastal habitats, such as mar shes, estuaries, reefs and banks.<P>
<P>
     The threat to these habitats is particularly challenging because no one person is responsible.  Rather, the continuing loss of coastal wetlands and degradation of coastal waters reflect thousands of decisions to proceed with habitat destroying human activities. The effects include reduced catches of commercial and sport fish, loss of jobs, dwindling wildlife populations and diminishing recreational opportunities such as fishing and wildlife-watching.<P>
<P>
     Many coastal activities, such as dredging or filling wetlands, require State and Federal permits.  Review of these permits provides an important opportunity for insuring that projects will not harm coastal habitats. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the U.S.  Department of Commerce uses its scientific expertise to review proposed projects and to help ensure that projects do not harm sensitive marine habitats.<P>
<P>
     This brochure is an introduction to the ocean world and some of the serious threats that now face it.<P>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>Earth is a Marine Habitat<P>
<P></STRONG>
	 Who can forget those first photographs of our Earth from space, a shimmering blue ball in the dark expanse of the solar system?<P> 

	Those early photographs by astronauts confirmed something we had always known but may not have fully grasped: the Earth's great continents are just islands in an even greater sea of blue.<P>
<P>

     In the 16th century, Copernicus also changed how the world was viewed when he demonstrated that it is the Sun, and not the Earth, around which the planets revolve. Unlike the Copernican revolution, however, the new view of the Earth as an ocean planet has not been fully recognized.<P>
<P>

     As we pursue our lives on the 30 percent of the Earth not covered by water, the oceans continue to generate winds and storms, to produce much of the oxygen we breathe, to reform and reshape the coastline where many of us live, work, or vacation...and to provide critical habitats for populations of marine life that are vital to our nutritional and economic well being.<p>


     Now, another long-held belief is being challenged: that we can pollute and even destroy coastal habitats, such as mar shes and offshore banks and reefs, without causing permanent losses of fish, sea birds, marine mammals, sea turtles and the many other creatures and plants of the oceans.<P>
<P>

<STRONG>The Web of Life<P></STRONG>


	 As on land, life in the oceans ultimately depends upon the Sun's energy. Like green plants on land, microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton capture this energy and use it to bind water and carbon dioxide together into packets of food. In shallow areas, sea grasses and mangroves provide additional food for fish and shellfish.<P>
<P>

     During this process which is called photosynthesis, these tiny plants do several important things.  First, they release great quantities of oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. Then animals that consume these plants are consumed by other, often larger animals.  For example, shrimp eat phytoplankton and are themselves eaten by fish. The fish, in turn, will be eaten by dolphins or humans. These tiny plants literally make the energy of the sun available to marine animals from the smallest shrimp to the great blue whale.<P>

<P>
<STRONG>Oceans and the United States<P>
</STRONG> 
	The United States possesses great ocean riches. We enjoy exclusive rights over fish, shellfish,  marine mammals, sea birds, and mineral resources within 200 miles of our shores. In 1990 U.S. commercial fishermen harvested 11 billion pounds of fish worth $3.9 billion, most within the near shore waters of our 2.2 million square miles of ocean territory. Marine recreational fisheries annually involve some 17 million anglers who expend over $7.2 billion.<P>
<P>

     Each year, tourists spend millions of dollars for nature cruises to observe such wildlife as marine mammals and sea birds. Beaches attract millions of people for relaxation and recreation. In California, money spent in coastal areas accounts for more than 80 percent of the State's tourism revenues.<P>
<P>

     Coasts and bays have always been favorite sites for cities. Even before the Industrial Revolution, manufacturers use coastal waters for cooling and disposal of wastes. From the earliest days of our Nation, commerce and daily life have depended on coastal ports for transport of goods and materials.<P>
<P>

     As our coastal settlements and industries have expanded we have changed marine areas, often irreversibly. The results have been drastic declines in populations of some fish an shellfish as well as increased instances of disease in fish and shellfish.<P>
<P>

<STRONG>How We Affect Marine Habitats<P></STRONG>

	We damage or destroy productive coastal habitats in several ways:<P>

  1 ) alteration of habitats,such as filling or dredging mar shes to build waterfront houses;<P>

  2) contamination of waters with toxic substances, such as industrial chemicals and pesticides;<P>

  3) pollution of waters with excessive nutrients, such as agricultural and home fertilizers and domestic sewage; and<P>

  4) construction on coastal rivers of dams, which block upstream fish migrations and destroy downstream migrants in power turbines and other intakes.<P>
<P>
     Our activities have direct and indirect effects. For instance, when we dredge a ship channel to remove accumulated sediment, we may also destroy sea grass beds and other habitats that provide food and shelter for fish and shellfish. Also, this can re suspend pollutants that have settled in the sediments. Recycled pollutants can harm fish and shellfish by reducing the ability of young to survive.<P>
<P>

     When we dredge, an area must be found to deposit the dredged materials. In the past, we have often deposited these materials in mar shes that many have regarded as worthless and suitable only for
development. In doing so, we have covered some of the most important and productive marine habitats.<P>
<P>

     Activities far from the coast can also damage marine habitats. Agricultural activities can result in soil, pesticides, fertilizer residues and other pollutants being carried into streams during rain storms and then to coastal waters. Excessive amounts of fertilizers washed into marine waters can ca undesirable blooms of algae. In high concentrations, otherwise beneficial algae screen sunlight from other marine plants that are depended upon by fish &amp; shellfish. When the algae die and decompose, they may deplete the oxygen from brood areas of water, killing fish and shellfish.<P>
<P>

     Dams on rivers often prevent marine fish that lay their eggs in fresh waters from completing their migration from ocean. Dams and diversions also reduce the flow of fresh water into bays and estuaries, resulting in loss of marshlands, sea grass beds and water quality important in the early life of marine  fishes and shellfish. <P>
<P>

     Highway construction, improper disposal of motor oil, use of pesticides and fertilizers in residential areas and on golf courses, release of poorly treated or untreated sewage, faulty septic tanks and discharge of toxic wastewater by industrial facilities all add contaminants to coastal waters.<P>
<P>
 
	 More often than not, habitat loss and degradation have caused serious reductions in fish and shellfish populations. From industrial giant to individual citizen, we all have a hand in determining the
health and productivity of our coastal waters.<P>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>A Habitat is a Home <P>
<P></STRONG>

     Animals and plants need shelter, sources of food and reproductive mates to live and reproduce.  Some types of animals and plants require specific kinds of food and shelter while others tolerate a wide range of conditions.<p>


     Many animals use different types of habitats at different times in their lives. Some species of fish and shellfish spend their early lives in mar shes or bays where food and shelter are plentiful. Later in life, these same animals move into different environments in the open ocean where they eat different types of food.<P>
<P>

     Some habitats are more productive than others.  For instance, coastal mar shes in the southeastern United States produce more tons of vegetation per acre than our rich Midwestern agricultural lands. As a result, bays and coastal waters are rich in shrimp, crabs and various  species of fish. On the other hand, waters far from land and not reached by nutrients brought to the ocean by rivers generally are not as productive. Here animal life is not so abundant.<P>
<P>

     Thus, coastal waters support larger populations of fish and shellfish largely because nutrients and shelter are more available. Almost one-half of the fish harvested in the United States are caught
within three miles of shore. It is this most productive part of our ocean waters that is increasingly vulnerable to our negligence.<P>
<P>
<P>
<STRONG>The Future of United States Marine Habitats<P></STRONG>


     Since World War II, Americans have moved increasingly to the coasts. By the year 2000, three out of four of us will likely live within an hour's drive of a coast. Much of this increase is expected to be in the Sun Belt; the population of Florida alone is predicted to increase by five million people, or 900  people a day.<P>
<P>

     With more people will come greater stress on the coastal mar shes and bays where most commercially and recreationally-valuable shellfish and fish spend critical parts of their life.  More and more people will live near, or visit, these fragile coastal habitats.  Demands for more homes, marinas, larger ports, deeper navigation channels, dams, roads, resorts and factories will threaten continued losses of our most productive coastal habitats.<P>
<P>

     We risk losing the quality and quantity of living marine resources which many of us depend upon for our livelihoods.<P>
<P>

     Finally, if the view of some scientists is correct, the Earth's climate is warming.  This warming would result in ocean waters expanding and rising.  Sea-level rise could pose a threat to coastal
buildings; it might also pose a threat to mar shes, coral reefs and other coastal habitats whose plant and animal communities may not be able to adapt to rapidly-changing conditions.<P>
<P>

<STRONG>
	A Response to the Challenge<P></STRONG>

<P>
	 Conservation of marine habitats requires a concerted effort by many people--often in places far removed from the coast. Federal, State and local government agencies, as well as concerned citizens, all have a role to play.<P>
<p>

     The NMFS exercises a key role in our Nation's efforts to conserve marine habitats. As a part of the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NMFS has a Federal
responsibility for conservation of the Nation's living marine resources.<P>
<P>

     The NMFS Habitat Conservation Program, of the Office of Protected Resources, seeks to conserve the habitats upon which our marine fish and shellfish depend. The program is based on Federal laws and the program's National Habitat Conservation Policy, issued in 1983.<P>
<P>

     The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act authorizes NMFS to evaluate developments proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other Federal agencies if these developments may alter the Nation's marine waters. Under the Coordination Act and other laws, the Habitat Conservation Program each year reviews several thousand individual requests for permits to dredge wetlands and bays, deposit dredge spoil in wetlands or coastal waters, drill for oil and gas, dump sewage sludge and chemical wastes and build dams.<P>
<P>

     The program is supported by NMFS research on the biological effects of human activities, the economic value of coastal habitats, and methods of reducing the loss of coastal habitats.<P>
<P>
<P>

<STRONG>Northeast Region<P></STRONG>

<P>
     The coastal habitats of New England and the Middle Atlantic States have many areas of rocky  shorelines in the north, extensive saltmarshes and long sandy beaches in the south.  Offshore, submerged banks provide vital habitats for commercially-valuable fish such as cod and haddock.  Georges Bank has historically been one of the richest fishing grounds in the world  Stellwagen Bank off Cape Cod also is a very productive submerged mountain that supports many species of fish.   
<P>
<P>
     The coastline in this region is one of the most heavily populated and visited in the country. Poorly-planned commercial and residential development has led to severe pollution problems in near shore areas such as Buzzards Bay and Boston Harbor.  Only a small fraction of the coastal mar shes in this region remain. Offshore drilling for oil and gas, as well as transportation of oil and other cargo, can pose
continuing threats. <P>
<P>

     Industrial, agricultural and urban wastes have produced such high nutrient levels in the Chesapeake and other bays that blooms of algae regularly rob some bay waters of oxygen, dredge spoil and industrial discharges reducing the area in which other plants and animals can live. Already, such contamination has contributed to drastic declines in landings of fish and shellfish, including oysters, shad, striped bass and river herring.<P>
<P>

<STRONG>Southeast Region <p>
</STRONG>

     The southeast region, which includes eight States from North Carolina to Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, contains 29,900 miles of tidal shoreline--more than half the tidal shoreline in
the lower 48 States.  Besides coral reefs and hard bottom areas offshore, the region has more than 300 estuaries containing 17.2 million acres of marsh.  The region supports most of our mangrove swamps and an estimated five million acres of sea grass meadows in which fish, shellfish and sea turtles feed and find shelter.<P>
<P>

     At least 96 percent of commercial and 70 percent of recreationally important fish and shellfish in this region need estuaries and near shore marine habitats at some point in their life cycles.  In 1990,
commercial landings amounted to about 1.9 billion ponds of fish and shellfish worth $810 million  dock side.  In 1985, 11 million recreational fisherman caught more than 222 million fish and spent more
than $3.4 billion in the process.<P>
<P>

     A tremendous increase in the number of coastal residents and industries is destroying and degrading coastal wetlands and waters. Pollutants from as far away as Montana and Pennsylvania are carried into the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi River alone.  Currently, tens of thousands of acres of coastal  wetlands are being lost annually in the region. In Louisiana, coastal mar shes are disappearing at rates
approaching 40 square miles per year. Texas has probably already lost a third of its one million acres of coastal mar shes and large areas of sea grass beds in the lagoons near Mexico.<P>
<P>

     Since 1982, fish and shellfish landings have decreased by 42 percent and recreational fishermen are having a harder time finding desirable fish to catch.  It is believed that wetland loss and pollution have contributed to these declines.<P>
 <P>

<P>
<STRONG>Southwest Region</STRONG>

<P>
     The California coastline has many areas of cliffs interspersed with sandy beaches.  San Francisco Bay is California's largest estuary and is surrounded by one of the most densely populated areas along the coast. Offshore, the flat slope of the continental shelf is broken by banks and canyons that  concentrate nutrients, thereby attracting fish, marine mammals and sea birds.<P>
<P>

     Unlike much of the Atlantic coast, which is influenced by the warm Gulf Stream, offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean are generally influenced by the cold, southerly-flowing California Current. Cold
water rich in nutrients regularly wells up from deeper offshore areas and enriches coastal waters, leading to blooms of phytoplankton which support dramatic increases in fish, marine mammals and sea bird populations.<P>
<P>

     While California's northern coast and offshore islands are relatively undeveloped, 90 percent of California's inland coastal wetlands has been converted to residential, commercial and agricultural
uses. San Francisco and Santa Monica are polluted by agricultural runoff, municipal sewage, dredge spoil and industrial discharges. Alteration of freshwater streams has led to dramatic declines in several historically-important salmon runs.<P>
<P>

     This region also includes the Central and West Pacific waters around the islands of Hawaii, Guam, Northern Marinas, Trust Territories of the Pacific, and Samoa, which are deep, clear and nutrient-poor. Coastline habitats include mud flats and mangrove forests. Coral reefs often ring islands and encircle lagoons.<P>
<P>

     While many island areas remain pristine, the more populated areas have suffered. Mangrove forests have been removed. Upland agriculture and alteration of stream flows have changed the chemical balance in lagoons and near shore areas, reducing the productivity of these sensitive habitats.<P>
<P>
     <P>
<STRONG>Northwest Region <P></STRONG>

<P>
     The coastlines of Oregon and Washington are rocky and mountainous and interspersed with sandy beaches. Rock islands, small bays, and estuary systems with mud flats are common. The generally rugged character of the Pacific Northwest coast is interrupted by the Columbia River estuary, an embayment characterized by high freshwater inflow and an inland marsh complex. Puget sound, a fjord, is an ecosystem unto itself, displaying most of the coastal features found worldwide in the
temperate latitudes.  Offshore, the continental shelf is cut through by canyons, some of which are extremely close to shore.<P>
<P>

     The effects of overfishing and land, water, and energy development activities on the Columbia and other Northwest rivers have devastated runs of salmon that historically supported large commercial and sport fisheries. Current runs are a fraction of those that existed 100 years ago.<P>
<P>

     Water quality is generally good, but localized areas in Puget Sound contain contaminated sediments.  Efforts are underway to clean up contaminated areas and develop regional plans that will reduce future pollution from urban, industrial, and agricultural sources.<P>
<P>

<P>
<STRONG>Alaska Region <P></STRONG>
<P>

 	The Alaska region includes half the coastline of the United States. This exceptionally long coastline contains a wide variety of habitats including fjords and ice fields found nowhere else in the United States. Large estuaries in southeastern Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, the Alaska peninsula and the Aleutian Islands provide nurseries for many marine species. Elsewhere, the coast is rocky and precipitous. Seasonal ice affects about 4,000 miles of the tidal shoreline. Nearly 70 percent of the U.S. continental shelf is off Alaska; roughly 90 percent of Alaska's landings of fish and shellfish are caught in these waters.<P>
<p>

     Alaskan waters support some of the heaviest fishing in the world including major runs of salmon.  Fisheries with billions of pounds of fish and shellfish, including pollock, halibut and king crabs depend
upon these relatively pristine waters.  These waters also host some of the world's largest populations of marine mammals and sea birds.<P>
<P>

     Alaska's small human population and limited industrial and hydroelectric development have kept destruction and degradation of important habitats to a minimum. This is changing as industry begins to exploit Alaska's nonrenewable resources, including petroleum, sand and gravel, as well as renewable resources such as timber, fish and shellfish. Development of these resources on land and at sea will
increasingly stress these habitats.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Sec. 106 (16 USC 1376) Seizure and forfeiture of cargo</H3></CENTER>

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Application of consistent provisions</STRONG>] -- Any vessel or other
conveyance subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that
is employed in any manner in the unlawful taking of any marine
mammal shall have its entire cargo or the monetary value thereof
subject to seizure and forfeiture. All provisions of law relating
to the seizure, judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of cargo
for violation of the customs laws, the disposition of such cargo,
and the proceeds from the sale thereof, and the remission or
mitigation of any such forfeiture, shall apply with respect to
the cargo of any vessel or other conveyance seized in connection
with the unlawful taking of a marine mammal insofar as such
provisions of law are applicable and not inconsistent with the
provisions of this subchapter.

<P>(b) [<STRONG>Penalties</STRONG>] -- Any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States that is employed in any manner in the unlawful
taking of any marine mammal shall be liable for a civil penalty
of not more than $25,000. Such penalty shall be assessed by the
district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the
vessel. Clearance of a vessel against which a penalty has been
assessed, from a port of the United States, may be withheld until
such penalty is paid, or until a bond or otherwise satisfactory
surety is posted. Such penalty shall constitute a maritime lien
on such vessel which may be recovered by action in rem in the
district court of the United States having jurisdiction over the
vessel.

<P>(c) [<STRONG>Reward for information leading to conviction</STRONG>] -- Upon the
recommendation of the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury is
authorized to pay an amount equal to one-half of the fine
incurred but not to exceed $2,500 to any person who furnishes
information which leads to a conviction for a violation of this
subchapter. Any officer or employee of the United States or of
any State or local government who furnishes information or
renders service in the performance of his official duties shall
not be eligible for payment under this section.

any failure to pay a penalty assessed under this subsection, the
Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil
action in a district court of the United States for any district
in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business to
collect the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to
hear and decide any such action.
<UL>
<P>(2) In any case involving an alleged unlawful importation of
a marine mammal or marine mammal product, if such importation is
made by an individual for his own personal or family use (which
does not include importation as an accommodation to others or for
sale or other commercial use), the Secretary may, in lieu of
instituting a proceeding under paragraph (1), allow the
individual to abandon the mammal or product, under procedures to
be prescribed by the Secretary, to the enforcement officer at the
port of entry.
</UL>
<P>(b) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this
subchapter or of any permit or regulation issued thereunder
(except as provided in section 1387 of this title) shall, upon
conviction, be fined not more than $20,000 for each such
violation, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

</UL>
<P>(e) [<STRONG>Disposition of seized cargo</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) Whenever any cargo or marine mammal or marine mammal
product is seized pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall
expedite any proceedings commenced under section 1375(a) or (b)
of this title. All marine mammal or marine mammal products or
other cargo so seized shall be held by any person authorized by
the Secretary pending disposition of such proceedings. The owner
or consignee of any such marine mammal or marine mammal product
or other cargo so seized shall, as soon as practicable following
such seizure, be notified of that fact in accordance with
regulations established by the Secretary.

<P>(2) The Secretary may, with respect to any proceeding under
section 1375(a) or (b) of this title, in lieu of holding any
marine mammal or marine mammal product or other cargo, permit the
person concerned to post bond or other surety satisfactory to the
Secretary pending the disposition of such proceeding.

<P>(3)(A) Upon the assessment of a penalty pursuant to section
1375(a) of this title, all marine mammals and marine mammal

<CENTER><H3>Sec. 2 (16 USC 1361) Congressional findings and declaration of policy</H3></CENTER>

<P>The Congress finds that--
<UL>(1) certain species and population stocks of marine
mammals are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a
result of man's activities;

<P>(2) such species and population stocks should not be
permitted to diminish beyond the point at which they cease to be
a significant functioning element in the ecosystem of which they
are a part, and, consistent with this major objective, they
should not be permitted to diminish below their optimum
sustainable population. Further measures should be immediately
taken to replenish any species or population stock which has
already diminished below that population. In particular, efforts
should be made to protect essential habitats, including the
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance for
each species of marine mammal from the adverse effect of man's
actions;

<P>(3) there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and
population dynamics of such marine mammals and of the factors
which bear upon their ability to reproduce themselves
successfully;

<P>(4) negotiations should be undertaken immediately to
encourage the development of international arrangements for
research on, and conservation of, all marine mammals;

<P>(5) marine mammals and marine mammal products either--
<UL>(A) move in interstate commerce, or
<P>(B) affect the balance of marine ecosystems in a
manner which is important to other animals and animal products
which move in interstate commerce, and that the protection and
conservation of marine mammals and their habitats is therefore
necessary to insure the continuing availability of those products
which move in interstate commerce; and
</UL>
<P>(6) marine mammals have proven themselves to be resources
of great international significance, esthetic and recreational as
well as economic, and it is the sense of the Congress that they
should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest
extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource
management and that the primary objective of their management
should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine
ecosystem. Whenever consistent with this primary objective, it
should be the goal to obtain an optimum sustainable population
keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the habitat.

<CENTER><H3>Sec. 101 (16 USC 1371) Moratorium on taking and importing marine
mammals and marine mammal products</H3></CENTER>

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Imposition; exceptions</STRONG>]  --  There shall be a moratorium on
the taking and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal
products, commencing on the effective date of this chapter,
during which time no permit may be issued for the taking of any
marine mammal and no marine mammal or marine mammal product may
be imported into the United States except in the following cases:
<UL>
<P>(1) Consistent with the provisions of section 1374 of
this title, permits may be issued by the Secretary for taking,
and importation for purposes of scientific research, public
display, photography for educational or commercial purposes, or
enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, or for
importation of polar bear parts (other than internal organs)
taken in sport hunts in Canada. Such permits, except permits
issued under section 1374(c)(5) of this title, may be issued if
the taking or importation proposed to be made is first reviewed
by the Marine Mammal Commission and the Committee of Scientific
Advisors on Marine Mammals established under subchapter III of
this chapter. The Commission and Committee shall recommend any
proposed taking or importation, other than importation under
section 1374(c)(5) of this title, which is consistent with the
purposes and policies of section 1361 of this title. If the
Secretary issues such a permit for importation, the Secretary
shall issue to the importer concerned a certificate to that
effect in such form as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes,
and such importation may be made upon presentation of the
certificate to the customs officer concerned.

<P>(2) Marine mammals may be taken incidentally in the
course of commercial fishing operations and permits may be issued
therefor under section 1374 of this title subject to regulations
prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1373 of
this title, or in lieu of such permits, authorizations may be
granted therefore under section 1387 of this title, subject to
regulations prescribed under that section by the Secretary
without regard to section 1373 of this title. In any event it
shall be the immediate goal that the incidental kill or
incidental serious injury of marine mammals permitted in the
course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious
injury rate; provided that this goal shall be satisfied in the
case of the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of
purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna by a continuation of the
application of the best marine mammal safety techniques and
equipment that are economically and technologically practicable.
The Secretary of the Treasury shall ban the importation of
commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with
commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental
kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of
United States standards. For purposes of applying the preceding
sentence, the Secretary--
<UL>
<P>(A) shall insist on reasonable proof from the
government of any nation from which fish or fish products will be
exported to the United States of the effects on ocean mammals of
the commercial fishing technology in use for such fish or fish
products exported from such nation to the United States;

<P>(B) in the case of yellowfin tuna harvested with
purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and products
therefrom, to be exported to the United States, shall require
that the government of the exporting nation provide documentary
evidence that--
<UL>
<P>(i) the government of the harvesting nation has
adopted a regulatory program governing the incidental taking of
marine mammals in the course of such harvesting that is
comparable to that of the United States; and 

<P>(ii) the average rate of that incidental taking
by the vessels of the harvesting nation is comparable to the
average rate of incidental taking of marine mammals by United
States vessels in the course of such harvesting, 
</UL>
<P>except that the Secretary shall not find that the regulatory program, or the
average rate of incidental taking by vessels, of a harvesting
nation is comparable to that of the United States for purposes of
clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph unless--
<UL><UL>
<P>(I) the regulatory program of the harvesting
nation includes, by no later than the beginning of the 1990
fishing season, such prohibitions against encircling pure schools
of species of marine mammals, conducting sundown sets, and other
activities as are made applicable to United States vessels;

<P>(II) the average rate of the incidental taking by
vessels of the harvesting nation is no more than 2.0 times that
of United States vessels during the same period by the end of the
1989 fishing season and no more than 1.25 times that of United
States vessels during the same period by the end of the 1990
fishing season and thereafter;

<P>(III) the total number of eastern spinner dolphin
(Stenella longirostris) incidentally taken by vessels of the
harvesting nation during the 1989 and subsequent fishing seasons
does not exceed 15 percent of the total number of all marine
mammals incidentally taken by such vessels in such year and the
total number of coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata)
incidentally taken by such vessels in such seasons does not
exceed 2 percent of the total number of all marine mammals
incidentally taken by such vessels in such year;

<P>(IV) the rate of incidental taking of marine
mammals by the vessels of the harvesting nation during the 1989
and subsequent fishing seasons is monitored by the porpoise
mortality observer program of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission or an equivalent international program in which the
United States participates and is based upon observer coverage
that is equal to that achieved for United States vessels during
the same period, except that the Secretary may approve an
alternative observer program if the Secretary determines, no less
than sixty days after publication in the Federal Register of the
Secretary's proposal and reasons therefor, that such an
alternative observer program will provide sufficiently reliable
documentary evidence of the average rate of incidental taking by
a harvesting nation; and

<P>(V) the harvesting nation complies with all
reasonable requests by the Secretary for cooperation in carrying
out the scientific research program required by section
1374(h)(3) of this title;
</UL></UL>
<P>(C) shall require the government of any intermediary
nation to certify and provide reasonable proof to the Secretary
that it has not imported, within the preceding six months, any
yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a
direct ban on importation to the United States under subparagraph
(B); 

<P>(D) shall, six months after importation of yellowfin
tuna or tuna products has been banned under this section, certify
such fact to the President, which certification shall be deemed
to be a certification for the purposes of section 1978(a) of
title 22 for as long as such ban is in effect; and

<P>(E)(i) except as provided in clause (ii), in the case
of fish or products containing fish harvested by a nation whose
fishing vessels engage in high seas driftnet fishing, shall
require that the government of the exporting nation provide
documentary evidence that the fish or fish product was not
harvested with a large-scale driftnet in the South Pacific Ocean
after July 1, 1991, or in any other water of the high seas after
January 1, 1993, and
<UL>
<P>(ii) in the case of tuna or a product containing tuna
harvested by a nation whose fishing vessels engage in high seas
driftnet fishing, shall require that the government of the
exporting nation provide documentary evidence that the tuna or
tuna product was not harvested with a large-scale driftnet
anywhere on the high seas after July 1, 1991. 
</UL>
For purposes of subparagraph (E), the term ``driftnet'' has the
meaning given such term in section 4003 of the Driftnet Impact
Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U.S.C. 1822
note), except that, until January 1, 1994, the term ``driftnet''
does not include the use in the northeast Atlantic Ocean of
gillnets with a total length not to exceed five kilometers if the
use is in accordance with regulations adopted by the European
Community pursuant to the October 28, 1991, decision by the
Council of Fisheries Ministers of the Community.
</UL>
<P>(3)(A) The Secretary, on the basis of the best scientific
evidence available and in consultation with the Marine Mammal
Commission, is authorized and directed, from time to time, having
due regard to the distribution, abundance, breeding habits, and
times and lines of migratory movements of such marine mammals, to
determine when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it
is compatible with this chapter to waive the requirements of this
section so as to allow taking, or importing of any marine mammal,
or any marine mammal product, and to adopt suitable regulations,
issue permits, and make determinations in accordance with
sections 1372, 1373, 1374, and 1381 of this title permitting and
governing such taking and importing, in accordance with such
determinations: <EM>Provided, however</EM>, That the Secretary,
in making such determinations must be assured that the taking of
such marine mammal is in accordwith sound principles of resource
protection and conservation as provided in the purposes and
policies of this chapter: <EM>Provided, further, however,</EM>
That no marine mammal or no marine mammal product may be imported
into the United States unless the Secretary certifies that the
program for taking marine mammals in the country of origin is
consistent with the provisions and policies of this chapter.
Products of nations not so certified may not be imported into the
United States for any purpose, including processing for
exportation.
<UL>
<P>(B) Except for scientific research purposes, photography
for educational or commercial purposes, or enhancing the survival
or recovery of a species or stock as provided for in paragraph
(1) of this subsection, or as provided for under paragraph (5) of
this subsection, during the moratorium no permit may be issued
for the taking of any marine mammal which has been designated by
the Secretary as depleted, and no importation may be made of any
such mammal.
</UL>
<P>(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C),
the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the use of
measures--
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) by the owner of fishing gear or catch, or an
employee or agent of such owner, to deter a marine mammal from
damaging the gear or catch;

<P>(ii) by the owner of other private property, or an
agent, bailee, or employee of such owner, to deter a marine
mammal from damaging private property;

<P>(iii) by any person, to deter a marine mammal from
endangering personal safety; or 

<P>(iv) by a government employee, to deter a marine
mammal from damaging public property, so long as such measures do
not result in the death or serious injury of a marine mammal.
</UL>
<P>(B) The Secretary shall, through consultation with
appropriate experts, and after notice and opportunity for public
comment, publish in the Federal Register a list of guidelines for
use in safely deterring marine mammals. In the case of marine
mammals listed as endangered species or threatened species under
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], the
Secretary shall recommend specific measures which may be used to
nonlethally deter marine mammals. Actions to deter marine mammals
consistent with such guidelines or specific measures shall not be
a violation of this chapter.

<P>(C) If the Secretary determines, using the best
scientific information available, that certain forms of
deterrence have a significant adverse effect on marine mammals,
the Secretary may prohibit such deterrent methods, after notice
and opportunity for public comment, through regulation under this
chapter.

<P>(D) The authority to deter marine mammals pursuant to
subparagraph (A) applies to all marine mammals, including all
stocks designated as depleted under this chapter.
</UL>
<P>(5)(A) Upon request therefor by citizens of the United
States who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial
fishing) within a specified geographical region, the Secretary
shall allow, during periods of not more than five consecutive
years each, the incidental, but not intentional, taking by
citizens while engaging in that activity within that region of
small numbers of marine mammals of a species or population stock
if the Secretary, after notice (in the Federal Register and in

to the taking of marine mammals under the authority of this
subparagraph.

<P>(vi) This subparagraph shall not govern the incidental

or decorating.
</UL></UL>
<P>(b) [<STRONG>Exemptions for Alaskan natives</STRONG>] -- Except as provided in
section 1379 of this title, the provisions of this chapter shall
not apply with respect to the taking of any marine mammal by any
Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who resides in Alaska and who dwells on
the coast of the North Pacific Ocean or the Arctic Ocean if such
taking--
<UL>
<P>(1) is for subsistence purposes; or

<P>(2) is done for purposes of creating and selling
authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing: Provided,
That only authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing
may be sold in interstate commerce: And provided further, That
any edible portion of marine mammals may be sold in native
villages and towns in Alaska or for native consumption. For the
purposes of this subsection, the term ``authentic native articles
of handicrafts and clothing'' means items composed wholly or in

taking of such marine mammals by any Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo
described in this subsection. Such regulations may be established
with reference to species or stocks, geographical description of
the area included, the season for taking, or any other factors
related to the reason for establishing such regulations and
consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Such regulations
shall be prescribed after notice and hearing required by section
1373 of this title and shall be removed as soon as the Secretary
determines that the need for their imposition has disappeared. In
promulgating any regulation or making any assessment pursuant to
a hearing or proceeding under this subsection or section
1386(b)(2) of this title, or in making any determination of
depletion under this subsection or finding regarding unmitigable
adverse impacts under subsection (a)(5) of this section that
affects stocks or persons to which this subsection applies, the
Secretary shall be responsible for demonstrating that such
regulation, assessment, determination, or finding is supported by
substantial evidence on the basis of the record as a whole. The
preceding sentence shall only be applicable in an action brought
by one or more Alaska Native organizations representing persons
to which this subsection applies.

<P>(c) [<STRONG>Taking in defense of self or others</STRONG>] -- It shall not be a
violation of this chapter to take a marine mammal if such taking
is imminently necessary in self-defense or to save the life of a
person in immediate danger, and such taking is reported to the
Secretary within 48 hours. The Secretary may seize and dispose of
any carcass.

</UL></UL>
<P>(C) A person to which a marine mammal is sold or exported or 
to which possession of a marine mammal is otherwise transferred
under the authority of subparagraph (B) shall have the rights and
responsibilities described in subparagraph (B) with respect to
the marine mammal without obtaining any additional permit or
authorization under this chapter. Such responsibilities shall be
limited to--
<UL>
<P>(i) for the purpose of public display, the responsibility
to meet the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of
subparagraph (A), 

<P>(ii) for the purpose of scientific research, the
responsibility to meet the requirements of paragraph (3), and

<P>(iii) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or
recovery of a species or stock, the responsibility to meet the
requirements of paragraph (4).
</UL>
<P>(D) If the Secretary--
<UL>
<P>(i) finds in concurrence with the Secretary of
Agriculture, that a person that holds a permit under this
paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights
under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of
subparagraph (A)(ii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those
requirements in the near future, or 

<P>(ii) finds that a person that holds a permit under this
paragraph for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights
under subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of
subparagraph (A)(i) or (iii) and is not reasonably likely to meet
those requirements in the near future, 
</UL>
<P>the Secretary may revoke the permit in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section, seize the marine mammal, or cooperate with
other persons authorized to hold marine mammals under this
chapter for disposition of the marine mammal. The Secretary may
recover from the person expenses incurred by the Secretary for
that seizure.

<P>(E) No marine mammal held pursuant to a permit issued under
subparagraph (A), or by a person exercising rights under
subparagraph (C), may be sold, purchased, exported, or
transported unless the Secretary is notified of such action no
later than 15 days before such action, and such action is for
purposes of public display, scientific research, or enhancing the
survival or recovery of a species or stock. The Secretary may
only require the notification to include the information required
for the inventory established under paragraph (10).
</UL>
<P>(3)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph
for scientific research purposes to an applicant which submits
with its permit application information indicating that the
taking is required to further a bona fide scientific purpose. The
Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph before the end
of the public review and comment period required under subsection
(d)(2) of this section if delaying issuance of the permit could
result in injury to a species, stock, or individual, or in loss
of unique research opportunities.
<UL>
<P>(B) No permit issued for purposes of scientific research
shall authorize the lethal taking of a marine mammal unless the
applicant demonstrates that a nonlethal method of conducting the
research is not feasible. The Secretary shall not issue a permit
for research which involves the lethal taking of a marine mammal
from a species or stock that is depleted, unless the Secretary
determines that the results of such research will directly
benefit that species or stock, or that such research fulfills a
critically important research need.

<P>(C) Not later than 120 days after April 30, 1994, the
Secretary shall issue a general authorization and implementing
regulations allowing bona fide scientific research that may
result only in taking by Level B harassment of a marine mammal.
Such authorization shall apply to persons which submit, by 60
days before commencement of such research, a letter of intent via
certified mail to the Secretary containing the following:
<UL>
<P>(i) The species or stocks of marine mammals which may be
harassed.

<P>(ii) The geographic location of the research.

<P>(iii) The period of time over which the research will be
conducted.

<P>(iv) The purpose of the research, including a description
of how the definition of bona fide research as established under
this chapter would apply.

<P>(v) Methods to be used to conduct the research.
</UL>
<P>Not later than 30 days after receipt of a letter of intent to 
conduct scientific research under the general authorization, the
Secretary shall issue a letter to the applicant confirming that
the general authorization applies, or, if the proposed research
is likely to result in the taking (including Level A harassment)
of a marine mammal, shall notify the applicant that subparagraph
(A) applies. 
</UL>
<P>(4)(A) A permit may be issued for enhancing the survival or
recovery of a species or stock only with respect to a species or
stock for which the Secretary, after consultation with the Marine
Mammal Commission and after notice and opportunity for public
comment, has first determined that--
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) taking or importation is likely to contribute
significantly to maintaining or increasing distribution or
numbers necessary to ensure the survival or recovery of the
species or stock; and

<P>(ii) taking or importation is consistent (I) with any
conservation plan adopted by the Secretary under section 1383b(b)
of this title or any recovery plan developed under section
1533(f) of this title for the species or stock, or (II) if there
is no conservation or recovery plan in place, with the
Secretary's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the
survival or recovery of the species or stock in light of the
factors that would be addressed in a conservation plan or a
recovery plan.
</UL>
<P>(B) A permit issued in accordance with this paragraph may
allow the captive maintenance of a marine mammal from a depleted
species or stock only if the Secretary--
<UL>
<P>(i) determines that captive maintenance is likely to
contribute to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by
maintaining a viable gene pool, increasing productivity,
providing biological information, or establishing animal
reserves;

<P>(ii) determines that the expected benefit to the affected
species or stock outweighs the expected benefit of alternatives
which do not require removal of animals from the wild; and

<P>(iii) requires that the marine mammal or its progeny be
returned to the natural habitat of the species or stock as soon
as feasible, consistent with the objectives of any applicable
conservation plan or recovery plan, or of any evaluation by the
Secretary under subparagraph (A).
</UL>
<P>The Secretary may allow the public display of such a marine
mammal only if the Secretary determines that such display is
incidental to the authorized maintenance and will not interfere
with the attainment of the survival or recovery objectives.
</UL>
<P>(5)(A) The Secretary may issue a permit for the importation
of polar bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport
hunts in Canada, including polar bears taken but not imported
prior to April 30, 1994, to an applicant which submits with its
permit application proof that the polar bear was legally
harvested in Canada by the applicant. Such a permit shall be
issued if the Secretary, in consultation with the Marine Mammal
Commission and after notice and opportunity for public comment,
finds that--
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport hunting
program consistent with the purposes of the Agreement on the
Conservation of Polar Bears;

<P>(ii) Canada has a sport hunting program based on
scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the
affected population stock at a sustainable level;

<P>(iii) the export and subsequent import are consistent
with the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other
international agreements and conventions; and

<P>(iv) the export and subsequent import are not likely to
contribute to illegal trade in bear parts.
</UL>
<P>(B) The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee
for permits issued under this paragraph. All fees collected under
this paragraph shall be available to the Secretary for use in
developing and implementing cooperative research and management
programs for the conservation of polar bears in Alaska and Russia
pursuant to section 1383(d) of this title.

<P>(C)(i) The Secretary shall undertake a scientific review of
the impact of permits issued under this paragraph on the polar
bear population stocks in Canada within 2 years after April 30,
1994. The Secretary shall provide an opportunity for public
comment during the course of such review, and shall include a
response to such public comment in the final report on such
review.
<UL>
<P>(ii) The Secretary shall not issue permits under this
paragraph after September 30, 1996, if the Secretary determines,
based on the scientific review, that the issuance of permits
under this paragraph is having a significant adverse impact on
the polar bear population stocks in Canada. The Secretary may
review such determination annually thereafter, in light of the
best scientific information available, and shall complete the
review not later than January 31 in any year a review is
undertaken. The Secretary may issue permits under this paragraph
whenever the Secretary determines, on the basis of such annual
review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph is not
having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population
stocks in Canada.
</UL></UL>
<P>(6) A permit may be issued for photography for educational or
commercial purposes involving marine mammals in the wild only to 
an applicant which submits with its permit application
information indicating that the taking will be limited to Level B
harassment, and the manner in which the products of such
activities will be made available to the public.

<P>(7) Upon request by a person for a permit under paragraph
(2), (3), or (4) for a marine mammal which is in the possession
of any person authorized to possess it under this chapter and
which is determined under guidance under section 1421a(a) of this
title not to be releasable to the wild, the Secretary shall issue

<P>(I) notify the Secretary of the birth of such progeny
within 30 days after the date of birth; and 

<P>(II) notify the Secretary of the sale, purchase, or
transport of such progeny no later than 15 days before such
action.
</UL>
<P>(ii) The Secretary may only require notification under clause
(i) to include the information required for the inventory
established under paragraph (10).
</UL>
<P>(C) Any progeny of a marine mammal born in captivity before

<P>(g) [<STRONG>Fees</STRONG>] -- The Secretary shall establish and charge a
reasonable fee for permits issued under this section.

<P>(h) [<STRONG>General permits; extension of general permit to American
Tunaboat Association; monitoring of incidental taking of marine
mammals</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) Consistent with the regulations prescribed pursuant to
section 1373 of this title and to the requirements of section
1371 of this title, the Secretary may issue general permits for
the taking of such marine mammals, together with regulations to
cover the use of such general permits.

<P>(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the general permit issued
under paragraph (1) on December 1, 1980 to the American Tunaboat
Association is extended to authorize and govern the taking of
marine mammals incidental to commercial purse seine fishing for
yellowfin tuna during each year after December 31, 1984.
<UL>
<P>(B) The extension granted under subparagraph (A) is subject
to the following conditions:
<UL>
<P>(i) The extension shall cease to have force and effect at
the time the general permit is surrendered or terminated.

<P>(ii) The permittee and certificate holders shall use the
best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment that are
economically and technologically practicable.

<P>(iii) During the period of the extension, the terms and
conditions of the general permit that are in effect on July 17,
1984, shall apply, except that--
<UL>
<P>(I) the Secretary may make such adjustments as may be
appropriate to those terms and conditions that pertain to fishing
gear and fishing practice requirements and to permit
administration;

<P>(II) any such term and condition may be amended or
terminated if the amendment or termination is based on the best
scientific information available, including that obtained under
the monitoring program required under paragraph (3)(A); and 

<P>(III) during each year of the extension, not to
exceed 250 coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) and not
to exceed 2,750 eastern spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris)
may be incidentally taken under the general permit, and no
accidental taking of either species is authorized at any time
when incidental taking of that species is permitted.
</UL>
<P>(iv) The Secretary shall, by January 1, 1989, prescribe
regulations to ensure that the backdown procedure during sets of
the purse seine net on marine mammals is completed and rolling of
the net to sack up has begun no later than thirty minutes after
sundown. The Secretary may waive or otherwise modify such
regulations for--
<UL>
<P>(I) a designated certificate holder on an observed
trip if the Secretary determines, based on observer reports, that
such restriction is not necessary because the certificate holder
has consistently utilized fishing techniques and equipment so as
to result in an incidental marine mammal mortality rate during
sundown sets that is no higher than the average such rate for the
fleet during daylight sets; or

<P>(II) all certificate holders on observed trips if the
Secretary determines that such restriction is not necessary
because all certificate holders have developed and are utilizing
fishing techniques and equipment that assure that the incidental
marine mammal mortality rate during sundown sets will be no
higher than such rate during daylight sets.
</UL>
<P>(v) The Secretary may authorize, after public notice and
opportunity for comment, designated certificate holders to
conduct experimental fishing operations on observed trips, under
such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, for the
purpose of testing proposed improvements in fishing techniques
and equipment that may reduce the incidental mortality of marine
mammals in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing
operations, and the Secretary may waive such terms and conditions
of the general permit and this section, other than the quotas on
incidental taking of marine mammals and the prohibition against
encircling pure schools of certain species of marine mammals, as
the Secretary determines to be necessary and appropriate for the
conduct of such experimental fishing.

<P>(vi) The Secretary, after public notice and opportunity
for comment and consultation with the skippers' panel of experts
established pursuant to the general permit, shall develop and
implement by not later than the beginning of the 1990 fishing 
season a system of performance standards to maintain the
diligence and proficiency of certificate holders in the use of
the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment that are
economically and technologically practicable. The system shall
include such arrangements as are necessary for the identification
of certificate holders whose incidental marine mammal mortality
rate is consistently and substantially higher than the average
rate of the fleet, and for the supplemental training and
observation of such certificate holders, and provisions for
suspension or revocation of certificates of inclusion of those
certificate holders whose unacceptably high rate of incidental
taking reflects a lack of diligence or proficiency in the use of
the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment.

<P>(vii) It shall be unlawful to use any explosive devices
other than class C explosive pest control devices in the course
of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing subject to the general
permit. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations, effective
April 1, 1990, to prohibit or restrict the use of class C
explosive pest control devices in the course of commercial
yellowfin tuna fishing unless the Secretary determines, based on
a study which the Secretary shall undertake, that the use of suchdevices does not result in physical impairment or increased
mortality of marine mammals.

<P>(viii) During the 1989 and subsequent fishing seasons,
each certificated vessel shall carry on every fishing trip
subject to this subsection an official observer certified by the
Secretary or by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission for
the purpose of conducting research and observing fishing
operations unless, for reasons beyond the control of the
Secretary, an observer is not available for such purpose. The
Secretary may waive this requirement after the 1991 fishing
season and establish a less extensive observer program if the
Secretary, after notice and opportunity for comment, determines
that such an alternative program will provide sufficiently
reliable information. 

<P>(ix) The Secretary shall annually convene meetings with
representatives of conservation and environmental organizations, 
the commercial tuna fishing industry, and other interested
persons for the purpose of discussing the results of efforts to
reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine
mammals under this subsection as well as throughout the
international fleet as a whole and developing plans for such
efforts during the next year. On or before April 1, 1992, the
Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries of the House of Representatives a comprehensive
report on the results of such efforts. The report shall discuss
the results of the scientific research programs, performance
standards, observer program, prohibition on sundown sets,
development of alternative fishing techniques, and other efforts
required by this section, and shall include recommendations for
such action as the Secretary considers necessary and desirable to
reduce further the total mortality and serious injury of marine
mammals in the course of commercial yellowfin tuna fishing
throughout the international fleet.
</UL>
<P>(C) The quota on the incidental taking of coastal spotted
dolphin and eastern spinner dolphin under paragraph
(2)(B)(iii)(III) shall be treated--
<UL>
<P>(i) as within, and not in addition to, the overall annual
quota under the general permit on the incidental taking of marine
mammals; and

<P>(ii) for purposes of paragraph (2)(B)(iii)(II), as a term
of the general permit in effect on July 17, 1984.
</UL></UL>
<P>(3)(A) The Secretary shall, commencing on January 1, 1985,
undertake a scientific research program to monitor for at least
five consecutive years, and periodically as necessary thereafter,
the indices of abundance and trends of marine mammal population
stocks which are incidentally taken in the course of commercial
purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical
Pacific Ocean.
<UL>
<P>(B) If the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best
scientific information available (including that obtained under
the monitoring program), that the incidental taking of marine
mammals permitted under the general permit referred to in
paragraph (2) is having a significant adverse effect on a marine
mammal population stock, the Secretary shall take such action as
is necessary, after notice and an opportunity for an agency
hearing on the record, to modify the applicable incidental take
quotas or requirements for gear and fishing practices (or both
such quotas and requirements) for such fishing so as to ensure
that the marine mammal population stock is not significantly
adversely affected by the incidental taking.

<P>(C) For each year after 1984, the Secretary shall include in
his annual report to the public and the Congress under section
1373(f) of this title a discussion of the proposed activities to
be conducted each year as part of the monitoring program required
by subparagraph (A).

<P>(D) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department
of Commerce for purposes of carrying out the monitoring program
required under this paragraph not to exceed $4,000,000 for the
period beginning October 1, 1984, and ending September 30, 1988.

<P>(A) in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission established
by section 1401 of this title, undertake a study of the North
Pacific fur seals to determine whether herds of such seals
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are presently at
their optimum sustainable population and what population trends
are evident; and

<P>(B) in consultation with the Secretary of State, promptly
undertake a comprehensive study of the provisions of this
chapter, as they relate to North Pacific fur seals, and the
provisions of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention signed on
February 9, 1957, as extended (hereafter referred to in this
subsection as the "Convention"), to determine what modifications,
if any, should be made to the provisions of the Convention, or of
this chapter, or both, to make the Convention and this chapter
consistent with each other.
</UL>
<P>The Secretary shall complete the studies required under this
paragraph not later than one year after October 21, 1972, and
shall immediately provide copies thereof to Congress.

<P>(2) If the Secretary finds--
<UL>
<P>(A) as a result of the study required under paragraph (1)(A) of
this subsection, that the North Pacific fur seal herds are below
their optimum sustainable population and are not trending upward
toward such level, or have reached their optimum sustainable
population but are commencing a downward trend, and believes the
herds to be in danger of depletion; or

<P>(B) as a result of the study required under paragraph (1)(B) of
this subsection, that modifications of the Convention are 
desirable to make it and this chapter consistent;
</UL>
<P>he shall, through the Secretary of State, immediately initiate
negotiations to modify the Convention so as to (i) reduce or halt
the taking of seals to the extent required to assure that such
herds attain and remain at their optimum sustainable population,
or (ii) make the Convention and this chapter consistent; or both,
as the case may be. If negotiations to so modify the Convention
are unsuccessful, the Secretary shall, through the Secretary of
State, take such steps as may be necessary to continue the
existing Convention beyond its present termination date so as to
continue to protect and conserve the North Pacific fur seals and
to prevent a return to pelagic sealing.
</UL>
<P>(c) [<STRONG>Description of annual results of discussions; proposals for
further action</STRONG>] -- The Secretary shall include a description of
the annual results of discussions initiated and conducted
pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, as well as any
proposals for further action to achieve the purposes of that
subsection, in the report required under section 1373(f) of this
title.

<P>(a) [<STRONG>State enforcement of State laws or regulations prohibited
without transfer to State of management authority by Secretary</STRONG>]
-- No State may enforce, or attempt to enforce, any State law or
regulation relating to the taking of any species (which term for
purposes of this section includes any population stock) of marine
mammal within the State unless the Secretary has transferred
authority for the conservation and management of that species
(hereinafter referred to in this section as ``management
authority'') to the State under subsection (b)(1) of this
section.

<P>(b) [<STRONG>Findings prerequisite to transfer of authority; State
program; implementation</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (f) of this section,
the Secretary shall transfer management authority for a species
of marine mammal to a State if the Secretary finds, after notice
and opportunity for public comment, that the State has developed
and will implement a program for the conservation and management
of the species that--

<P>(A) is consistent with the purposes, policies, and goals of this
chapter and with international treaty obligations; 

<P>(B) requires that all taking of the species be humane;

<P>(C) does not permit the taking of the species unless and until--
<UL>
<P>(i) the State has determined, under a process consistent with the
standards set forth in subsection (c) of this section--
<UL>
<P>(I) that the species is at its optimum sustainable population
(hereinafter in this section referred to as "OSP"), and

<P>(II) the maximum number of animals of that species that may be
taken without reducing the species below its OSP, and 
</UL>
<P>(ii) the determination required under clause (i) is final and
implemented under State law, and, if a cooperative allocation
agreement for the species is required under subsection (d)(1) of
this section, such as agreement is implemented;
</UL>
<P>(D) does not permit the taking of a number of animals of the
species that exceeds the maximum number determined pursuant to
subparagraph (C)(i)(II), and, in the case of taking for
subsistence uses (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of this
section), does not permit the taking of a number of animals that
would be inconsistent with the maintenance of the species at its
OSP;

<P>(E) does not permit the taking of the species for scientific
research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery
of a species or stock, except for taking for such purposes that
is undertaken by, or on behalf of, the State;

<P>(F) provides procedures for acquiring data, and evaluating such
data and other new evidence, relating to the OSP of the species,
and the maximum take that would maintain the species at the

amending determinations under subparagraph (C)(i);

<P>(G) provides procedures for the resolution of differences between
the State and the Secretary that might arise during the
development of a cooperative allocation agreement under
subsection (d)(1) of this section; and

<P>(H) provides for the submission of an annual report to the
Secretary regarding the administration of the program during the
reporting period.
</UL>
<P>(2) During the period between the transfer of management
authority for a species to a State under paragraph (1) and the
time at which the implementation requirements under paragraph
(1)(C)(ii) are complied with--
<UL>
<P>(A) the State program shall not apply with respect to the taking
of the species within the State for any purpose, or under any
condition, provided for under section 1371 of this title; and 

<P>(B) the Secretary shall continue to regulate, under this
subchapter, all takings of the species within the State.
</UL>
<P>(3) After the determination required under paragraph (1)(C)(i)
regarding a species is final and implemented under State law and
after a cooperative allocation agreement described in subsection
(d)(1) of this section, if required, is implemented for such
species--
<UL>
<P>(A) such determination shall be treated, for purposes of applying
this subchapter beyond the territory of the State, as a
determination made in accordance with section 1373 of this title
and as an applicable waiver under section 1371(a)(3) of this
title;

<P>(B) the Secretary shall regulate, without regard to this section
other than the allocations specified under such an agreement, the
taking of the species--
<UL>
<P>(i) incidentally in the course of commercial fishing operations
(whether provided for under section 1371(a)(2) or (4) of this
title), or in the course of other specified activities provided
for under section 1371(a)(5) of this title, in the zone described
in section 1362(14)(B) of this title, and

<P>(ii) for scientific research, public display, or enhancing the
survival or recovery of a species or stock (other than by, or on
behalf of, the State), except that any taking authorized under a
permit issued pursuant to section 1371(a)(1) of this title after
October 9, 1981, allowing the removal of live animals from
habitat within the State shall not be effective if the State
agency disapproves, on or before the date of issuance of the
permit, such taking as being inconsistent with the State program;
and
</UL>
<P>(C) section 1371(b) of this title shall not apply.
</UL></UL>
<P>(c) [<STRONG>Standards with which State process must comply</STRONG>] -- The State
process required under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section must
comply with the following standards:
<UL>
<P>(1) The State agency with management authority for the species
(hereinafter in this section referred to as the "State agency")
must make an initial determination regarding the factors
described in clause (i) of that subsection. The State agency must
identify, and make available to the public under reasonable
circumstances, the documentation supporting such initial
determination. Unless request for a hearing under paragraph (2)
regarding the initial determination is timely made, the initial
determination shall be treated as final under State law.

<P>(2) The State agency shall provide opportunity, at the request of
any interested party, for a hearing with respect to the initial
determination made by it under paragraph (1) at which interested
parties may--
<UL>
<P>(A) present oral and written evidence in support of or against
such determination; and

<P>(B) cross-examine persons presenting evidence at the hearing.
</UL>
<P>The State agency must give public notice of the hearing and make
available to the public within a reasonable time before
commencing the hearing a list of the witnesses for the State and
a general description of the documentation and other evidence
that will be relied upon by such witnesses.

<P>(3) The State agency, solely on the basis of the record developed
at a hearing held pursuant to paragraph (2), must make a decision
regarding its initial determination under paragraph (1) and shall
include with the record a statement of the findings and
conclusions, and the reason or basis therefor, on all material
issues.

<P>(4) Opportunity for judicial review of the decision made by the
State agency on the record under paragraph (3), under scope of
review equivalent to that provided for in section 706(2)(A)
through (E) of title 5, must be available under State law. The
Secretary may not initiate judicial review of any such decision.
</UL>
<P>(d) [<STRONG>Cooperative allocation agreements</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) If the range of a species with respect to which a
determination under paragraph (1)(C)(i) of subsection (b) of this
section is made extends beyond the territorial waters of the
State, the State agency and the Secretary (who shall first
coordinate with the Marine Mammal Commission and the appropriate
Regional Fishery Management Council established under section
1852 of this title) shall enter into a cooperative allocation
agreement providing procedures for allocating, on a timely basis,
such of the number of animals, as determined under paragraph
(1)(C)(i)(II) of subsection (b) of this section, as may be
appropriate with priority of allocation being given firstly to
taking for subsistence uses in the case of the State of Alaska,
and secondly to taking for purposes provided for under section
1371(a) of this title within the zone described in section
1362(14)(B) of this title. 

<P>(2) If the State agency requests the Secretary to regulate the
taking of a species to which paragraph (1) applies within the
zone described in section 1362(14)(B) \1\ of this title for
subsistence uses or for hunting, or both, in a manner consistent
with the regulation by the State agency of such taking within the
State, the Secretary shall adopt, and enforce within such zone,
such of the State agency's regulatory provisions as the Secretary
considers to be consistent with his administration of section
1371(a) of this title within such zone. The Secretary shall adopt
such provisions through the issuance of regulations under section
553 of title 5, and with respect to such issuance the Regulatory
Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], the Paperwork Reduction
Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], Executive Order Numbered 12291,
dated February 17, 1981, and the thirty-day notice requirement in
subsection (d) of such section 553 shall not apply. For purposes
of sections 1375, 1376, and 1377 of this title, such regulations
shall be treated as having been issued under this subchapter.
</UL>
<P>(e) [<STRONG>Revocation of transfer of management authority</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall revoke, after
opportunity for a hearing, any transfer of management authority
made to a State under subsection (b)(1) of this section if the
Secretary finds that the State program for the conservation and
management of the species concerned is not being implemented, or
is being implemented in a manner inconsistent with the provisions
of this section or the provisions of the program. The Secretary
shall also establish a procedure for the voluntary return by a
State to the Secretary of species management authority that was
previously transferred to the State under subsection (b)(1) of
this section.

<P>(2)(A) The Secretary may not revoke a transfer of management
authority under paragraph (1) unless--
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) the Secretary provides to the State a written notice of
intent to revoke together with a statement, in detail, of those
actions, or failures to act, on which such intent is based; and

<P>(ii) during the ninety-day period after the date of the notice of
intent to revoke--
<UL>
<P>(I) the Secretary provides opportunity for consultation between
him and the State concerning such State actions or failures to
act and the remedial measures that should be taken by the State,
and

<P>(II) the State does not take such remedial measures as are
necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary, to bring its
conservation and management program, or the administration or
enforcement of the program, into compliance with the provisions
of this section.
</UL></UL>
<P>(B) When a revocation by the Secretary of a transfer of
management authority to a State becomes final, or the State
voluntarily returns management authority to the Secretary, the
Secretary shall regulate the taking, and provide for the
conservation and management, of the species within the State in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter (and in the case
of Alaskan Natives, section 1371(b) of this title and subsection
(i) of this section shall apply upon such revocation or return of
management authority).
</UL></UL>
<P>(f) [<STRONG>Transfer of management authority to State of Alaska</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary may not transfer management authority to the
State of Alaska under subsection (b)(1) of this section for any
species of marine mammal unless--
<UL>
<P>(A) the State has adopted and will implement a statute and
regulations that insure that the taking of the species for
subsistence uses--
<UL>
<P>(i) is accomplished in a nonwasteful manner, 

<P>(ii) will be the priority consumptive use of the species, and

<P>(iii) if required to be restricted, such restriction will be
based upon--
<UL>
<P>(I) the customary and direct dependence upon the species as the
mainstay of livelihood, 

<P>(II) local residency, and

<P>(III) the availability of alternative resources; and
</UL></UL>
<P>(B) the State has adopted a statute or regulation that requires
that any consumptive use of marine mammal species, other than for
subsistence uses, will be authorized during a regulatory year
only if the appropriate agency first makes findings, based on an
administrative record before it, that--
<UL>
<P>(i) such use will have no significant adverse impact upon
subsistence uses of the species, and

<P>(ii) the regulation of such use, including, but not limited to,
licensing of marine mammal hunting guides and the assignment of
guiding areas, will, to the maximum extent practicable, provide
economic opportunities for the residents of the rural coastal
villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of that
species.
</UL></UL>
<P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "subsistence uses"
means the customary and traditional uses by rural Alaska
residents of marine mammals for direct personal or family
consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or
transportation; for the making and selling of handicraft articles
out of nonedible byproducts of marine mammals taken for personal
or family consumption; and for barter, or sharing for personal or
family consumption. As used in this paragraph--
<UL>
<P>(A) The term ``family'' means all persons related by blood,
marriage, or adoption, or any person living within a household on
a permanent basis.

<P>(B) The term ``barter'' means the exchange of marine mammals or
their parts, taken for subsistence uses--
<UL>
<P>(i) for other wildlife or fish or their parts, or

<P>(ii) for other food or for nonedible items other than money if
the exchange is of a limited and noncommercial nature.
</UL></UL></UL>
<P>(g) [<STRONG>Environmental impact statement not required</STRONG>] -- Neither the
transfer of management authority to a State under subsection
(b)(1) of this section, nor the revocation or voluntary return of
such authority under subsection (e) of this section, shall be
deemed to be an action for which an environmental impact
statement is required under section 4332 of title 42.

<P>(h) [<STRONG>Taking of marine mammals as part of official duties</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) Nothing in this subchapter or subchapter V of this chapter
shall prevent a Federal, State, or local government official or
employee or a person designated under section 1382(c) of this
title from taking, in the course of his or her duties as an
official, employee, or designee, a marine mammal in a humane
manner (including euthanasia) if such taking is for--
<UL>
<P>(A) the protection or welfare of the mammal,

<P>(B) the protection of the public health and welfare, or

<P>(C) the nonlethal removal of nuisance animals.
</UL>
<P>(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the Secretary or a
person designated under section 1382(c) of this title from
importing a marine mammal into the United States if such
importation is necessary to render medical treatment that is not
otherwise available.

<P>(3) In any case in which it is feasible to return to its natural
habitat a marine mammal taken or imported under circumstances
described in this subsection, steps to achieve that result shall
be taken.
</UL>
<P>(i) [<STRONG>Regulations covering taking of marine mammals by Alaskan
natives</STRONG>]-- The Secretary may (after providing notice thereof in
the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation,
and through appropriate electronic media, in the affected area
and providing opportunity for a hearing thereon in such area)
prescribe regulations requiring the marking, tagging, and
reporting of animals taken pursuant to section 1371(b) of this
title.

management programs</STRONG>] -- The Secretary may make grants to States
to assist them--
<UL>
<P>(1) in developing programs, to be submitted for approval under
subsection (b) of this section, for the conservation and
management of species of marine mammals; and

<P>(2) in administering such programs if management authority for
such species is transferred to the State under such subsection. 
</UL>
<P>Grants made under this subsection may not exceed 50 per centum of
the costs of developing a State program before Secretarial
approval, or of administering the program thereafter.

<P>(k) [<STRONG>Delegation of administration and enforcement to States</STRONG>] -- 
The Secretary is authorized and directed to enter into
cooperative arrangements with the appropriate officials of any
State for the delegation to such State of the administration and
enforcement of this subchapter: Provided, That any such

commercial fishing operations</STRONG>] -- The Secretary, after
consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, is authorized and
directed to issue, as soon as practicable, such regulations,
covering the twenty-four-month period referred to in section
1371(a)(2) of this title, as he deems necessary or advisable, to
reduce to the lowest practicable level the taking of marine
mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. Such
regulations shall be adopted pursuant to section 553 of title 5.
In issuing such regulations, the Secretary shall take into
account the results of any scientific research under subsection
(a) of this section and, in each case, shall provide a reasonable
time not exceeding four months for the persons affected to
implement such regulations.

<P>(c) [<STRONG>Reduction of level of taking of marine mammals in tuna
fishery</STRONG>] -- Additionally, the Secretary and Secretary of State
are directed to commence negotiations within the Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission in order to effect essential compliance
with the regulatory provisions of this chapter so as to reduce to
the maximum extent feasible the incidental taking of marine
mammals by vessels involved in the tuna fishery. The Secretary
and Secretary of State are further directed to request the
Director of Investigations of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission to make recommendations to all member nations of the
Commission as soon as is practicable as to the utilization of
methods and gear devised under subsection (a) of this section.

<P>(d) [<STRONG>Research and observation</STRONG>] -- Furthermore, after timely
notice and during the period of research provided in this
section, duly authorized agents of the Secretary are hereby
empowered to board and to accompany any commercial fishing vessel

</UL>
<P>Except to the extent authorized by the provisions of subsection
(e) of this section, the program shall not include placement of
observers aboard exempted vessels.

<P>(2) Information obtained under this subsection shall be subject
to the confidentiality provisions of subsection (j) of this
section.
</UL>
<P>(e) [<STRONG>Observers on board exempted vessels; confidentiality of
information; authorization of appropriations</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) For each fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of
this section, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the
appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, other Federal
and State agencies, and other interested parties, and subject to
paragraph (6), place observers on board exempted vessels so as to
monitor not less than 20 percent nor more than 35 percent of the
fishing operations by vessels in the fishery to obtain
statistically reliable information on the species and number of
marine mammals incidentally taken in the fishery. If the
Secretary determines that fewer than 20 percent of the fishing
operations by vessels in the fishery will be monitored during the
course of the fishing season, the Secretary shall implement the
alternative observation program described in subsection (f) of
this section to the extent necessary to supplement the observer
program described in this subsection.

<P>(2) When determining the distribution of observers among
fisheries and between vessels in a particular fishery, the
Secretary shall be guided by the following standards:
<UL>
<P>(A) the requirement to obtain the best scientific information
available;

<P>(B) the requirement that assignment of observers is fair and
equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;

<P>(C) consistent with paragraph (1), the requirement that no
individual person or vessel, or group of persons or vessels, be
subject to excessive or overly burdensome observer coverage; and

<P>(D) where practicable, the need to minimize costs and avoid
duplication.
</UL>
<P>(3) If the Secretary finds that, for reasons beyond his or her
control, the Secretary cannot assign observers to all the
fisheries identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this
section at the level of observer coverage set forth in paragraph
(1), the Secretary shall allocate available observers among such
fisheries, consistent with paragraph (2), according to the
following priority:
<UL>
<P>(A) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from
any population stock designated as depleted;

<P>(B) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from
population stocks that the Secretary believes are declining;

<P>(C) those fisheries other than those described in subparagraphs
(A) and (B) in which the greatest incidental take of marine
mammals occur; and

<P>(D) any other fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of
this section.
</UL>
<P>The Secretary may, with the consent of the vessel owner, station
an observer on board a vessel engaged in a fishery not identified
under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section.

<P>(4) Information gathered by observers shall be subject to the
provisions of subsection (j) of this section. Consistent with the
requirements of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, if requested
by the Appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council, or in the
case of a State fishery, the State, require observers to collect
additional information, including but not limited to the
quantities, species, and physical condition of target and
non-target fishery resources and, if requested by the Secretary
of the Interior, seabirds.

<P>(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (4), the
Secretary may decline to require observers to collect information
described in such paragraph, if the Secretary finds in writing,
following public notice and opportunity for comment, that such
information will not contribute to the protection of marine
mammals or the understanding of the marine ecosystem, including
fishery resources and seabirds.

<P>(6) The Secretary shall not be required to place an observer on a
vessel in a fishery if the Secretary finds that--
<UL>
<P>(A) in a situation where harvesting vessels are delivering fish
to a processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board the
harvesting vessel, statistically reliable information can be
obtained from an observer on board the processing vessel to which
the fish are delivered;

<P>(B) the facilities of a vessel for the quartering of an observer,
or for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or
unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe
operation of the vessel would be jeopardized; or

<P>(C) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer
is not available.
</UL>
<P>(7)(A) An observer on a vessel (or the observer's personal
representative) under the requirements of this section or section
1374 of this title that is ill, disabled, injured, or killed from
service as an observer on that vessel may not bring a civil
action under any law of the United States for that illness,
disability, injury, or death against the vessel or vessel owner,
except that a civil action may be brought against the vessel
owner for the owner's willful misconduct.
<UL>
<P>(B) This paragraph does not apply if the observer is engaged by
the owner, master, or individual in charge of a vessel to perform
any duties in service to the vessel.
</UL>
<P>(8) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of
Commerce for the purposes of carrying out this subsection not to
exceed $2,700,000 for fiscal year 1989 and not to exceed
$8,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992, and
1993.
</UL>
<P>(f) [<STRONG>Alternative observation program</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall establish an alternative observation
program to provide statistically reliable information on the
species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in those
fisheries identified pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this
section for which the required level of observer coverage has not
been met or for any other fisheries about which such reliable
information is not otherwise available. The alternative program
shall include, but not be limited to, direct observation of
fishing activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.

<P>(2) Individuals engaged in the alternative observation program
shall collect scientific information on the fisheries subject to
observation, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1)
and subsection (e)(4) and (5) of this section. All information
collected shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (j) of
this section.
</UL>
<P>(g) [<STRONG>Review of information and evaluation of effects of
incidental taking on population stocks of marine mammals;
promulgation of emergency regulations to mitigate immediate and
significant adverse impacts; action to mitigate non-immediate
impacts</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall review information regarding the
incidental taking of marine mammals and evaluate the effects of
such incidental taking on the affected population stocks of
marine mammals.

<P>(2) If the Secretary finds, based on the information received
from the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e),
and (f) of this section, that the incidental taking of marine
mammals in a fishery is having an immediate and significant
adverse impact on a marine mammal population stock or, in the
case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific fur seals, that more
than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed
during a calendar year, the Secretary shall consult with
appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils and State
fishery managers and prescribe emergency regulations to prevent
to the maximum extent practicable any further taking. Any
emergency regulations prescribed under this paragraph--
<UL>
<P>(A) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering
with existing State or regional fishery management plans;

<P>(B) shall be published in the Federal Register together with the
reasons therefor;

<P>(C) shall remain in effect for not more than one hundred and
eighty days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is
earlier; and

<P>(D) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by
publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination if
the Secretary determines the reasons for the emergency
regulations no longer exist.
</UL>
<P>In prescribing emergency regulations under this paragraph, the
Secretary shall take into account the economics of the fishery
concerned and the availability of existing technology to prevent
or minimize incidental taking of marine mammals.

<P>(3) If the Secretary finds, based on information received from
the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f)
of this section, that incidental taking of marine mammals in a
fishery is not having an immediate and significant adverse impact
on a marine mammal population stock but that it will likely have
a significant adverse impact over a period of time longer than
one year, the Secretary shall request the appropriate Regional
Fishery Management Council or State to initiate, recommend, or
take such action within its authority as it considers necessary
to mitigate the adverse impacts, including adjustments to
requirements on fishing times or areas or the imposition of
restrictions on the use of vessels or gear.

<P>(4) The Secretary shall impose appropriate conditions and
restrictions on an exemption granted under subsection (b) of this
section if--
<UL>
<P>(A) a Regional Fishery Management Council or State does not act
in a reasonable period of time on a request made by the Secretary
under paragraph (3); or

<P>(B) if the Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for
public comment that the purposes of this section would be better
served by such action.
</UL></UL>
<P>(h) [<STRONG>Information and management system for processing and
analyzing reports and information; accessibility to public</STRONG>] --
The Secretary shall design and implement an information
management system capable of processing and analyzing reports
received from the programs established under subsections (c),
(d), (e), and (f) of this section, and other relevant sources,
including Federal and State enforcement authorities, marine

<CENTER><H3>Sec. 115 (16 USC 1383b) Status review; conservation plans</H3></CENTER>

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Determinations by rule; notice and hearing; findings; final
rule on status of species or stock involved</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) In any action by the Secretary to determine if a species or
stock should be designated as depleted, or should no longer be
designated as depleted, regardless of whether such action is
taken on the initiative of the Secretary or in response to a
petition for a status review, the Secretary shall only make such
a determination by issuance of a rule, after notice and
opportunity for public comment and after a call for information
in accordance with paragraph (2).

<P>(2) The Secretary shall make any determination described in
paragraph (1) solely on the basis of the best scientific
information available. Prior to the issuance of a proposed rule
concerning any such determination, the Secretary shall publish in
the Federal Register a call to assist the Secretary in obtaining
scientific information from individuals and organizations
concerned with the conservation of marine mammals, from persons
in any industry which might be affected by the determination, and
from academic institutions. In addition, the Secretary shall
utilize, to the extent the Secretary determines to be feasible,
informal working groups of interested parties and other methods
to gather the necessary information.

<P>(3)(A) If the Secretary receives a petition for a status
review as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish
a notice in the Federal Register that such a petition has been
received and is available for public review.
<UL>
<P>(B) Within sixty days after receipt of the petition, the
Secretary shall publish a finding in the Federal Register as to
whether the petition presents substantial information indicating
that the petitioned action may be warranted.

<P>(C) If the Secretary makes a positive finding under subparagraph
(B), the Secretary shall include in the Federal Register notice,
a finding that--
<UL>
<P>(i) a review of the status of the species or stock will be
commenced promptly; or

<P>(ii) a prompt review of the petition is precluded by other
pending status determination petitions and that expeditious
progress is being made to process pending status determination
petitions under this subchapter.
</UL>
<P>In no case after making a finding under this subparagraph shall
the Secretary delay commencing a review of the status of a
species or stock for more than one hundred and twenty days after
receipt of the petition.

<P>(D) No later than two hundred and ten days after the receipt of
the petition, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register
a proposed rule as to the status of the species or stock, along
with the reasons underlying the proposed status determination.
Persons shall have at least sixty days to submit comments on such
a proposed rule.

<P>(E) Not later than ninety days after the close of the comment
period on a proposed rule issued under subparagraph (D), the
Secretary shall issue a final rule on the status of the species
or stock involved, along with the reasons for the status
determination. If the Secretary finds with respect to such a
proposed rule that there is substantial disagreement regarding
the sufficiency or accuracy of the available information relevant
to a status determination, the Secretary may delay the issuance
of a final rule for a period of not more than six months for
purposes of soliciting additional information.

<P>(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph
and section 553 of title 5, the Secretary may issue a final rule
as to the status of a species or stock any time sixty or more
days after a positive finding under subparagraph (B) if the
Secretary determines there is substantial information available
to warrant such final status determination and further delay
would pose a significant risk to the well-being of any species or
stock. Along with the final rule, the Secretary shall publish in
the Federal Register detailed reasons for the expedited
determination.
</UL></UL>
<P>(b) [<STRONG>Conservation plans; preparation and implementation</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall prepare conservation plans--
<UL>
<P>(A) By December 31, 1989, for North Pacific fur seals;

<P>(B) by December 31, 1990, for Steller sea lions; and

<P>(C) as soon as possible, for any species or stock designated as
depleted under this subchapter, except that a conservation plan
need not be prepared if the Secretary determines that it will not
promote the conservation of the species or stock.
</UL>
<P>(2) Each plan shall have the purpose of conserving and restoring
the species or stock to its optimum sustainable population. The
Secretary shall model such plans on recovery plans required under
section 1533(f) of this title.

<P>(3) The Secretary shall act expeditiously to implement each
conservation plan prepared under paragraph (1). Each year, the
Secretary shall specify in the annual report prepared under
section 1373(f) of this title what measures have been taken to
prepare and implement such plans.

<P>(4) If the Secretary determines that a take reduction plan is
necessary to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals in
the course of commercial fishing operations from a strategic
stock, or for species or stocks which interact with a commercial
fishery for which the Secretary has made a determination under
section 1387(f)(1) of this title, any conservation plan prepared
under this subsection for such species or stock shall incorporate
the take reduction plan required under section 1387 of this title
for such species or stock.

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Short title</STRONG>] -- This section may be cited as the "Dolphin
Protection Consumer Information Act".

<P>(b) [<STRONG>Findings</STRONG>] -- The Congress finds that--
<UL>
<P>(1) dolphins and other marine mammals are frequently killed in
the course of tuna fishing operations in the eastern tropical
Pacific Ocean and high seas driftnet fishing in other parts of
the world;

<P>(2) it is the policy of the United States to support a worldwide
ban on high seas driftnet fishing, in part because of the harmful
effects that such driftnets have on marine mammals, including
dolphins; and

<P>(3) consumers would like to know if the tuna they purchase is
falsely labeled as to the effect of the harvesting of the tuna on
dolphins.
</UL>
<P>(c) [<STRONG>Definitions</STRONG>] -- For purposes of this section--
<UL>
<P>(1) the terms "driftnet" and "driftnet fishing" have the meanings

that is exported from or offered for sale in the United States to
include on the label of that product the term "Dolphin Safe" or
any other term or symbol that falsely claims or suggests that the
tuna contained in the product was harvested using a method of
fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if the product contains--
<UL>
<P>(A) tuna harvested on the high seas by a vessel engaged in
driftnet fishing; or

<P>(B) tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a
vessel using purse seine nets which do not meet the requirements
for being considered dolphin safe under paragraph (2).
</UL>
<P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a tuna product that
contains tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by
a fishing vessel using purse seine nets is dolphin safe if--

effort, of such incidental mortality and serious injury, and an
analysis stating whether such level is insignificant and is
approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate;
</UL>
<P>(5) categorize the status of the stock as one that either--
<UL>
<P>(A) has a level of human-caused mortality and serious injury that
is not likely to cause the stock to be reduced below its optimum
sustainable population; or

<CENTER><H3>Sec. 118 (16 USC 1387) Taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations</H3></CENTER>

<P>(a) [<STRONG>In general</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) Effective on April 30, 1994, and except as provided in
section 1383a of this title and in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4)
of this subsection, the provisions of this section shall govern
the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of
commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the
United States or vessels which have valid fishing permits issued
by the Secretary in accordance with section 1824(b) of this
title. In any event it shall be the immediate goal that the
incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals
occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations be
reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and
serious injury rate within 7 years after April 30, 1994.

<P>(2) In the case of the incidental taking of marine mammals
from species or stocks designated under this chapter as depleted
on the basis of their listing as threatened species or endangered
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531
et seq.), both this section and section 1371(a)(5)(E) of this
chapter shall apply.

<P>(3) Sections 1374(h) of this title and subchapter IV of this
chapter, and not this section, shall govern the taking of marine
mammals in the course of commercial purse seine fishing for
yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.

<P>(4) This section shall not govern the incidental taking of
California sea otters and shall not be deemed to amend or repeal
the Act of November 7, 1986 (Public Law 99-625; 100 Stat. 3500). 

<P>(5) Except as provided in section 1371(c) of this title, the
intentional lethal take of any marine mammal in the course of
commercial fishing operations is prohibited.

<P>(6) Sections 1373 and 1374 of this title shall not apply to
the incidental taking of marine mammals under the authority of
this section.
</UL>
<P>(b) [<STRONG>Zero mortality rate goal</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) Commercial fisheries shall reduce incidental mortality and
serious injury of marine mammals to insignificant levels
approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate within 7
years after April 30, 1994.

<P>(2) Fisheries which maintain insignificant serious injury and
mortality levels approaching a zero rate shall not be required to
further reduce their mortality and serious injury rates.

<P>(3) Three years after April 30, 1994, the Secretary shall
review the progress of all commercial fisheries, by fishery,
toward reducing incidental mortality and serious injury to
insignificant levels approaching a zero rate. The Secretary shall
submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries
of the House of Representatives a report setting forth the
results of such review within 1 year after commencement of the
review. The Secretary shall note any commercial fishery for which
additional information is required to accurately assess the level
of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in
the fishery.

<P>(4) If the Secretary determines after review under paragraph
(3) that the rate of incidental mortality and serious injury of
marine mammals in a commercial fishery is not consistent with
paragraph (1), then the Secretary shall take appropriate action
under subsection (f) of this section.
</UL>
<P>(c) [<STRONG>Registration and authorization</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall, within 90 days after April 30, 1994--

period of not less than 90 days, any necessary changes to the
Secretary's list of commercial fisheries published under section
1383a(b)(1) of this title and which is in existence on March 31,
1994 (along with an explanation of such changes and a statement
describing the marine mammal stocks interacting with, and the
approximate number of vessels or persons actively involved in,
each such fishery), with respect to commercial fisheries that
have--
<UL>
<P>(i) frequent incidental mortality and serious injury of marine
mammals;

<P>(ii) occasional incidental mortality and serious injury of
marine mammals; or

<P>(iii) a remote likelihood of or no known incidental mortality
or serious injury of marine mammals;
</UL>
<P>(B) after the close of the period for such public comment,
publish in the Federal Register a revised list of commercial
fisheries and an update of information required by subparagraph
(A), together with a summary of the provisions of this section
and information sufficient to advise vessel owners on how to
obtain an authorization and otherwise comply with the
requirements of this section; and

<P>(C) at least once each year thereafter, and at such other
times as the Secretary considers appropriate, reexamine, based on
information gathered under this chapter and other relevant
sources and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the
classification of commercial fisheries and other determinations
required under subparagraph (A) and publish in the Federal
Register any necessary changes.
</UL>
<P>(2)(A) An authorization shall be granted by the Secretary in
accordance with this section for a vessel engaged in a commercial
fishery listed under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii), upon receipt by
the Secretary of a completed registration form providing the name
of the vessel owner and operator, the name and description of the
vessel, the fisheries in which it will be engaged, the
approximate time, duration, and location of such fishery
operations, and the general type and nature of use of the fishing
gear and techniques used. Such information shall be in a readily
usable format that can be efficiently entered into and utilized
by an automated or computerized data processing system. A decal
or other physical evidence that the authorization is current and
valid shall be issued by the Secretary at the time an
authorization is granted, and so long as the authorization
remains current and valid, shall be reissued annually thereafter. 
<UL>
<P>(B) No authorization may be granted under this section to the
owner of a vessel unless such vessel--
<UL>
<P>(i) is a vessel of the United States; or

<P>(ii) has a valid fishing permit issued by the Secretary in
accordance with section 1824(b) of this title.
</UL>
<P>(C) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, an
authorization granted under this section shall allow the
incidental taking of all species and stocks of marine mammals to
which this chapter applies.
</UL>
<P>(3)(A) An owner of a vessel engaged in any fishery listed
under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii) shall, in order to engage in
the lawful incidental taking of marine mammals in a commercial
fishery--
<UL><UL>
<P>(i) have registered as required under paragraph (2) with the
Secretary in order to obtain for each such vessel owned and used
in the fishery an authorization for the purpose of incidentally
taking marine mammals in accordance with this section, except
that owners of vessels holding valid certificates of exemption
under section 1383a of this title are deemed to have registered
for purposes of this subsection for the period during which such
exemption is valid;

<P>(ii) ensure that a decal or such other physical evidence of a
current and valid authorization as the Secretary may require is
displayed on or is in the possession of the master of each such
vessel;

<P>(iii) report as required by subsection (e) of this section;
and  

<P>(iv) comply with any applicable take reduction plan and
emergency regulations issued under this section.
</UL>
<P>(B) Any owner of a vessel receiving an authorization under
this section for any fishery listed under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or
(ii) shall, as a condition of that authorization, take on board
an observer if requested to do so by the Secretary.

<P>(C) An owner of a vessel engaged in a fishery listed under
paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii) who--
<UL>
<P>(i) fails to obtain from the Secretary an authorization for
suchvessel under this section;

<P>(ii) fails to maintain a current and valid authorization for
such vessel; or

<P>(iii) fails to ensure that a decal or other physical evidence
of such authorization issued by the Secretary is displayed on or
is in possession of the master of the vessel, and the master of
any such vessel engaged in such fishery, shall be deemed to have
violated this subchapter, and for violations of clauses (i) and
(ii) shall be subject to the penalties of this subchapter, and
for violations of clause (iii) shall be subject to a fine of not
more than $100 for each offense.
</UL>
<P>(D) If the owner of a vessel has obtained and maintains a
current and valid authorization from the Secretary under this
section and meets the requirements set forth in this section,
including compliance with any regulations to implement a take
reduction plan under this section, the owner of such vessel, and
the master and crew members of the vessel, shall not be subject
to the penalties set forth in this subchapter for the incidental
taking of marine mammals while such vessel is engaged in a
fishery to which the authorization applies.

<P>(E) Each owner of a vessel engaged in any fishery not listed
under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii), and the master and crew
members of such a vessel, shall not be subject to the penalties
set forth in this subchapter for the incidental taking of marine
mammals if such owner reports to the Secretary, in the form and
manner required under subsection (e) of this section, instances
of incidental mortality or injury of marine mammals in the course
of that fishery.
</UL>
<P>(4)(A) The Secretary shall suspend or revoke an authorization
granted under this section and shall not issue a decal or other
physical evidence of the authorization for any vessel until the
owner of such vessel complies with the reporting requirements
under subsection (e) of this section and such requirements to
take on board an observer under paragraph (3)(B) as are
applicable to such vessel. Previous failure to comply with the
requirements of section 1383a of this title shall not bar
authorization under this section for an owner who complies with
the requirements of this section.
<UL>
<P>(B) The Secretary may suspend or revoke an authorization
granted under this subsection, and may not issue a decal or other
physical evidence of the authorization for any vessel which fails
to comply with a take reduction plan or emergency regulations
issued under this section.

<P>(C) The owner and master of a vessel which fails to comply
with a take reduction plan shall be subject to the penalties of
sections 1375 and 1377 of this title, and may be subject to
section 1376 of this title.
</UL>
<P>(5)(A) The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with the
appropriate States, affected Regional Fishery Management
Councils, and other interested persons, the means by which the
granting and administration of authorizations under this section
shall be integrated and coordinated, to the maximum extent
practicable, with existing fishery licenses, registrations, and
related programs.
<UL>
<P>(B) The Secretary shall utilize newspapers of general
circulation, fishery trade associations, electronic media, and
other means of advising commercial fishermen of the provisions of
this section and the means by which they can comply with its
requirements.

<P>(C) The Secretary is authorized to charge a fee for the
granting of an authorization under this section. The level of
fees charged under this subparagraph shall not exceed the
administrative costs incurred in granting an authorization. Fees
collected under this subparagraph shall be available to the Under
Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere for expenses incurred in the
granting and administration of authorizations under this section. 
</UL></UL>
<P>(d) [<STRONG>Monitoring of incidental takes</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall establish a program to monitor
incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during
the course of commercial fishing operations. The purposes of the
monitoring program shall be to--
<UL>
<P>(A) obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental
mortality and serious injury;

<P>(B) determine the reliability of reports of incidental
mortality and serious injury under subsection (e) of this
section; and

<P>(C) identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may
increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.  
</UL>
<P>(2) Pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary may place observers
on board vessels as necessary, subject to the provisions of this
section. Observers may, among other tasks--
<UL>
<P>(A) record incidental mortality and injury, or by catch of
other nontarget species;

<P>(B) record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and

<P>(C) perform other scientific investigations.
</UL>
<P>(3) In determining the distribution of observers among
commercial fisheries and vessels within a fishery, the Secretary
shall be guided by the following standards:
<UL>
<P>(A) The requirement to obtain statistically reliable
information. 

<P>(B) The requirement that assignment of observers is fair and
equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery.

<P>(C) The requirement that no individual person or vessel, or
group of persons or vessels, be subject to excessive or overly
burdensome observer coverage.

<P>(D) To the extent practicable, the need to minimize costs and
avoid duplication.
</UL>
<P>(4) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall allocate
observers among commercial fisheries in accordance with the
following priority:
<UL>
<P>(A) The highest priority for allocation shall be for
commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious
injury of marine mammals from stocks listed as endangered species
or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973
(16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).

<P>(B) The second highest priority for allocation shall be for
commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality and serious
injury of marine mammals from strategic stocks.

<P>(C) The third highest priority for allocation shall be for
commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious
injury of marine mammals from stocks for which the level of
incidental mortality and serious injury is uncertain.
</UL>
<P>(5) The Secretary may establish an alternative observer
program to provide statistically reliable information on the
species and number of marine mammals incidentally taken in the
course of commercial fishing operations. The alternative observer
program may include direct observation of fishing activities from
vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.

<P>(6) The Secretary is not required to place an observer on a
vessel in a fishery if the Secretary finds that--
<UL>
<P>(A) in a situation in which harvesting vessels are delivering
fish to a processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board
the harvesting vessel, statistically reliable information can be
obtained from an observer on board the processing vessel to which
the fish are delivered;

<P>(B) the facilities on a vessel for quartering of an observer,
or for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or
unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe
operation of the vessel would be jeopardized; or

<P>(C) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an
observer is not available.
</UL>
<P>(7) The Secretary may, with the consent of the vessel owner,
station an observer on board a vessel engaged in a fishery not
listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section. 
(8) Any proprietary information collected under this subsection
shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except--
<UL>
<P>(A) to Federal employees whose duties require access to such
information;

<P>(B) to State or tribal employees pursuant to an agreement with
the Secretary that prevents public disclosure of the identity or
business of any person;

<P>(C) when required by court order; or

<P>(D) in the case of scientific information involving fisheries,
to employees of Regional Fishery Management Councils who are
responsible for fishery management plan development and
monitoring.
</UL>
<P>(9) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as may be
necessary to preserve such confidentiality, except that the
Secretary shall release or make public upon request any such
information in aggregate, summary, or other form which does not
directly or indirectly disclose the identity or business of any
person.
</UL>
<P>(e) [<STRONG>Reporting requirement</STRONG>] -- The owner or operator of a
commercial fishing vessel subject to this chapter shall report
all incidental mortality and injury of marine mammals in the
course of commercial fishing operations to the Secretary by mail
or other means acceptable to the Secretary within 48 hours after
the end of each fishing trip on a standard postage-paid form to
be developed by the Secretary under this section. Such form shall
be capable of being readily entered into and usable by an
automated or computerized data processing system and shall
require the vessel owner or operator to provide the following: 
<UL>
<P>(1) The vessel name, and Federal, State, or tribal registration
numbers of the registered vessel.

<P>(2) The name and address of the vessel owner or operator.

<P>(3) The name and description of the fishery.

<P>(4) The species of each marine mammal incidentally killed or
injured, and the date, time, and approximate geographic location
of such occurrence.
</UL>
<P>(f) [<STRONG>Take reduction plans</STRONG>] --
<UL>
<P>(1) The Secretary shall develop and implement a take reduction
plan designed to assist in the recovery or prevent the depletion
of each strategic stock which interacts with a commercial fishery
listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, and
may develop and implement such a plan for any other marine mammal
stocks which interact with a commercial fishery listed under
subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section which the Secretary
determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, has
a high level of mortality and serious injury across a number of
such marine mammal stocks.

<P>(2) The immediate goal of a take reduction plan for a
strategic stock shall be to reduce, within 6 months of its
implementation,  the incidental mortality or serious injury of
marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial
fishing operations to levels less than the potential biological
removal level established for that stock under section 1386 of
this title. The long-term goal of the plan shall be to reduce,
within 5 years of its implementation, the incidental mortality or
serious injury of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course
of commercial fishing operations to insignificant levels
approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate, taking into
account the economics of the fishery, the availability of
existing technology, and existing State or regional fishery management
plans.

<P>(3) If there is insufficient funding available to develop and
implement a take reduction plan for all such stocks that interact
with commercial fisheries listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or
(ii) of this section, the Secretary shall give highest priority
to the development and implementation of take reduction plans for
species or stocks whose level of incidental mortality and serious
injury exceeds the potential biological removal level, those that
have a small population size, and those which are declining most
rapidly.

<P>(4) Each take reduction plan shall include--
<UL>
<P>(A) a review of the information in the final stock assessment
published under section 1386(b) of this title and any substantial
new information;

<P>(B) an estimate of the total number and, if possible, age and
gender, of animals from the stock that are being incidentally
lethally taken or seriously injured each year during the course
of commercial fishing operations, by fishery;

<P>(C) recommended regulatory or voluntary measures for the
reduction of incidental mortality and serious injury;

<P>(D) recommended dates for achieving the specific objectives of
the plan.
</UL>
<P>(5)(A) For any stock in which incidental mortality and serious
injury from commercial fisheries exceeds the potential biological
removal level established under section 1386 of this title, the
plan shall include measures the Secretary expects will reduce,
within 6 months of the plan's implementation, such mortality and
serious injury to a level below the potential biological removal
level.
<UL>
<P>(B) For any stock in which human-caused mortality and serious
injury exceeds the potential biological removal level, other than
a stock to which subparagraph (A) applies, the plan shall include
measures the Secretary expects will reduce, to the maximum extent
practicable within 6 months of the plan's implementation, the
incidental mortality and serious injury by such commercial
fisheries from that stock. For purposes of this subparagraph, the
term "maximum extent practicable" means to the lowest level that
is feasible for such fisheries within the 6-month period.
</UL>
<P>(6)(A) At the earliest possible time (not later than 30 days)
after the Secretary issues a final stock assessment under section
1386(b) of this title for a strategic stock, the Secretary shall,
and for stocks that interact with a fishery listed under
subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section for which the Secretary
has made a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary may-- 
(i) establish a take reduction team for such stock and appoint
the members of such team in accordance with subparagraph (C); and 
(ii) publish in the Federal Register a notice of the team's
establishment, the names of the team's appointed members, the
full geographic range of such stock, and a list of all commercial
fisheries that cause incidental mortality and serious injury of
marine mammals from such stock.
<UL>
<P>(B) The Secretary may request a take reduction team to address
a stock that extends over one or more regions or fisheries, or
multiple stocks within a region or fishery, if the Secretary
determines that doing so would facilitate the development and
implementation of plans required under this subsection.

<P>(C) Members of take reduction teams shall have expertise
regarding the conservation or biology of the marine mammal
species which the take reduction plan will address, or the
fishing practices which result in the incidental mortality and
serious injury of such species. Members shall include
representatives of Federal agencies, each coastal State which has
fisheries which interact with the species or stock, appropriate
Regional Fishery Management Councils, interstate fisheries
commissions, academic and scientific organizations, environmental
groups, all commercial and recreational fisheries groups and gear
types which incidentally take the species or stock, Alaska Native
organizations or Indian tribal organizations, and others as the
Secretary deems appropriate. Take reduction teams shall, to the
maximum extent practicable, consist of an equitable balance among
representatives of resource user interests and nonuser interests. 

<P>(D) Take reduction teams shall not be subject to the Federal
Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.). Meetings of take
reduction teams shall be open to the public, and prior notice of
meetings shall be made public in a timely fashion.

<P>(E) Members of take reduction teams shall serve without
compensation, but may be reimbursed by the Secretary, upon
request, for reasonable travel costs and expenses incurred in
performing their duties as members of the team.
</UL>
<P>(7) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a
strategic stock is estimated to be equal to or greater than the
potential biological removal level established under section 1386
of this title for such stock and such stock interacts with a
fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this
section, the following procedures shall apply in the development
of the take reduction plan for the stock:

consensus. In the event consensus cannot be reached, the team
shall advise the Secretary in writing on the range of
possibilities considered by the team, and the views of both the
majority and minority.
</UL>
<P>(B)(i) The Secretary shall take the draft take reduction plan
into consideration and, not later than 60 days after the
submission of the draft plan by the team, the Secretary shall
publish in the Federal Register the plan proposed by the team,
any changes proposed by the Secretary with an explanation of the
reasons therefor, and proposed regulations to implement such
plan, for public review and comment during a period of not to
exceed 90 days.
<UL>
<P>(ii) In the event that the take reduction team does not submit
a draft plan to the Secretary within 6 months, the Secretary
shall, not later than 8 months after the establishment of the
team, publish in the Federal Register a proposed take reduction
plan and implementing regulations, for public review and comment
during a period of not to exceed 90 days.
</UL>
<P>(C) Not later than 60 days after the close of the comment
period required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall issue
a final take reduction plan and implementing regulations,
consistent with the other provisions of this section.

publication of a final take reduction plan, utilize newspapers of
general circulation, fishery trade associations, electronic
media, and other means of advising commercial fishermen of the
requirements of the plan and how to comply with them.

<P>(E) The Secretary and the take reduction team shall meet every
6 months, or at such other intervals as the Secretary determines
are necessary, to monitor the implementation of the final take
reduction plan until such time that the Secretary determines that
the objectives of such plan have been met.

<P>(F) The Secretary shall amend the take reduction plan and
implementing regulations as necessary to meet the requirements of
this section, in accordance with the procedures in this section
for the issuance of such plans and regulations.
</UL>
<P>(8) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a
strategic stock is estimated to be less than the potential
biological removal level established under section 1386 of this
title for such stock and such stock interacts with a fishery
listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) or (ii) of this section, or
for any marine mammal stocks which interact with a commercial
fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section for
which the Secretary has made a determination under paragraph (1),
the following procedures shall apply in the development of the
take reduction plan for such stock:
<UL>
<P>(A)(i) Not later than 11 months after the date of
establishment of a take reduction team for the stock, the team
shall submit a draft take reduction plan for the stock to the
Secretary,
consistent with the other provisions of this section.
<UL>
<P>(ii) Such draft take reduction plan shall be developed by
consensus. In the event consensus cannot be reached, the team
shall advise the Secretary in writing on the range of
possibilities considered by the team, and the views of both the
majority and minority.
</UL>
<P>(B)(i) The Secretary shall take the draft take reduction plan
into consideration and, not later than 60 days after the

determines are necessary, to monitor the implementation of the
final take reduction plan until such time that the Secretary
determines that the objectives of such plan have been met. 

<P>(F) The Secretary shall amend the take reduction plan and
implementing regulations as necessary to meet the requirements of
this section, in accordance with the procedures in this section
for the issuance of such plans and regulations.
</UL>
<P>(9) In implementing a take reduction plan developed pursuant
to this subsection, the Secretary may, where necessary to
implement a take reduction plan to protect or restore a marine
mammal stock or species covered by such plan, promulgate
regulations which include, but are not limited to, measures to--
<UL>
<P>(A) establish fishery-specific limits on incidental mortality
and serious injury of marine mammals in commercial fisheries or
restrict commercial fisheries by time or area;

<P>(B) require the use of alternative commercial fishing gear or
techniques and new technologies, encourage the development of
such gear or technology, or convene expert skippers' panels; 

<P>(C) educate commercial fishermen, through workshops and other
means, on the importance of reducing the incidental mortality and
serious injury of marine mammals in affected commercial
fisheries; and

<P>(D) monitor, in accordance with subsection (d) of this
section, the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce the level
of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in
the course of commercial fishing operations.
</UL>
<P>(10)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (6), in the case of any
stock to which paragraph (1) applies for which a final stock
assessment has not been published under section 1386(b)(3) of
this title by April 1, 1995, due to a proceeding under section
1386(b)(2) of this title, or any Federal court review of such
proceeding, the Secretary shall establish a take reduction team
under paragraph (6) for such stock as if a final stock assessment
had been published.
<UL>
<P>(B) The draft stock assessment published for such stock under
section 1386(b)(1) of this title shall be deemed the final stock
assessment for purposes of preparing and implementing a take
reduction plan for such stock under this section.

<P>(C) Upon publication of a final stock assessment for such
stock under section 1386(b)(3) of this title the Secretary shall
immediately reconvene the take reduction team for such stock for
the purpose of amending the take reduction plan, and any
regulations issued to implement such plan, if necessary, to
reflect the final stock assessment or court action. Such
amendments shall be made in accordance with paragraph (7)(F) or
(8)(F), as appropriate.

<P>(D) A draft stock assessment may only be used as the basis for
a take reduction plan under this paragraph for a period of not to
exceed two years, or until a final stock assessment is published,
whichever is earlier. If, at the end of the two-year period, a
final stock assessment has not been published, the Secretary
shall categorize such stock under section 1386(a)(5)(A) of this
title and shall revoke any regulations to implement a take
reduction plan for such stock.

<P>(E) Subparagraph (D) shall not apply for any period beyond two
years during which a final stock assessment for such stock has
not been published due to review of a proceeding on such stock
assessment by a Federal court. Immediately upon final action by
such court, the Secretary shall proceed under subparagraph (C). 
(11) Take reduction plans developed under this section for a
species or stock listed as a threatened species or endangered
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531
et seq.) shall be consistent with any recovery plan developed for
such species or stock under section 4 of such Act [16 U.S.C.
1533].
</UL>,</UL>
<P>(g) [<STRONG>Emergency regulations</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) If the Secretary finds that the incidental mortality and
serious injury of marine mammals from commercial fisheries is
having, or is likely to have, an immediate and significant
adverse impact on a stock or species, the Secretary shall take
actions as follows:
<UL>
<P>(A) In the case of a stock or species for which a take
reduction plan is in effect, the Secretary shall--
<UL>
<P>(i) prescribe emergency regulations that, consistent with such
plan to the maximum extent practicable, reduce incidental
mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and

<P>(ii) approve and implement, on an expedited basis, any
amendments to such plan that are recommended by the take
reduction team to address such adverse impact.
</UL>
<P>(B) In the case of a stock or species for which a take
reduction plan is being developed, the Secretary shall--
<UL>
<P>(i) prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental
mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and

<P>(ii) approve and implement, on an expedited basis, such plan,
which shall provide methods to address such adverse impact if
still necessary.
</UL>
<P>(C) In the case of a stock or species for which a take
reduction plan does not exist and is not being developed, or in
the case of a commercial fishery listed under subsection
(c)(1)(A)(iii) of this section which the Secretary believes may
be contributing to such adverse impact, the Secretary shall--
<UL>
<P>(i) prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental
mortality and serious injury in that fishery, to the extent
necessary to mitigate such adverse impact;

<P>(ii) immediately review the stock assessment for such stock or
species and the classification of such commercial fishery under
this section to determine if a take reduction team should be
established; and

<P>(iii) may, where necessary to address such adverse impact on a
species or stock listed as a threatened species or endangered
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531
et seq.), place observers on vessels in a commercial fishery
listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii) of this section, if the
Secretary has reason to believe such vessels may be causing the
incidental mortality and serious injury to marine mammals from
such stock.
</UL></UL>
<P>(2) Prior to taking action under paragraph (1)(A), (B), or
(C), the Secretary shall consult with the Marine Mammal
Commission, all appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils,
State fishery managers, and the appropriate take reduction team
(if established).

<P>(3) Emergency regulations prescribed under this subsection-- 
<UL>
<P>(A) shall be published in the Federal Register, together with an
explanation thereof;

<P>(B) shall remain in effect for not more than 180 days or until
the end of the applicable commercial fishing season, whichever is
earlier; and

<P>(C) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by
publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination,
if the Secretary determines that the reasons for emergency
regulations no longer exist.
</UL>
<P>(4) If the Secretary finds that incidental mortality and
serious injury of marine mammals in a commercial fishery is
continuing to have an immediate and significant adverse impact on
a stock or species, the Secretary may extend the emergency
regulations for an additional period of not more than 90 days or
until reasons for the emergency no longer exist, whichever is
earlier.
</UL>
<P>(h) [<STRONG>Penalties</STRONG>] -- Except as provided in subsection (c) of
this section, any person who violates this section shall be
subject to the provisions of sections 1375 and 1377 of this
title, and may be subject to section 1376 of this title as the
Secretary shall establish by regulations.

<P>(i) [<STRONG>Assistance</STRONG>] -- The Secretary shall provide assistance to
Regional Fishery Management Councils, States, interstate fishery
commissions, and Indian tribal organizations in meeting the goal
of reducing incidental mortality and serious injury to
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious
injury rate.

<P>(j) [<STRONG>Contributions</STRONG>] -- For purposes of carrying out this
section, the Secretary may accept, solicit, receive, hold,
administer, and use gifts, devises, and bequests.

<P>(k) [<STRONG>Consultation with Secretary of the Interior</STRONG>] -- The
Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior prior
to taking actions or making determinations under this section
that affect or relate to species or population stocks of marine
mammals for which the Secretary of the Interior is responsible
under this subchapter.

<P>(l) [<STRONG>Definitions</STRONG>] -- As used in this section and section
1371(a)(5)(E) of this title, each of the terms "fishery" and
"vessel of the United States" has the same meaning it does in
section 1802 of this title.

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Findings</STRONG>] -- The Congress finds the following:
<UL>
<P>(1) The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific
Ocean has resulted in the deaths of millions of dolphins. 

<P>(2) Significant awareness and increased concern for the health
and safety of dolphin populations has encouraged a change in
fishing methods worldwide.

<P>(3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world in
the development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities
in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and United States tuna
processing companies have voluntarily promoted the marketing of
tuna that is dolphin safe.

<P>(4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical
Pacific Ocean have indicated their willingness to participate in
appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and eventually
eliminate, dolphin mortality in that fishery.
</UL>
<P>(b) [<STRONG>Policy</STRONG>] -- It is the policy of the United States to--
<UL>
<P>(1) eliminate the marine mammal mortality resulting from the
intentional encirclement of dolphins and other marine mammals in
tuna purse seine fisheries;

<P>(2) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce, and
eventually eliminate, the mortality referred to in paragraph (1);

<P>(3) ensure that the market of the United States does not act
as an incentive to the harvest of tuna caught in association with
dolphins or with driftnets;

<P>(4) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to ensure that
United States tuna fishing vessels shall have continued access to
productive tuna fishing grounds in the South Pacific Ocean and
elsewhere; and

<P>(5) encourage observer coverage on purse seine vessels fishing
for tuna outside of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in a
fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a regular and
significant association occurs between marine mammals and tuna,
and in which tuna is harvested through the use of purse seine
nets deployed on or to encircle marine mammals.

<P>(a) [<STRONG>Limitation on application of ban on imports</STRONG>] -- Except as
provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of the
Treasury shall not, under section 1371(a)(2)(A) and (B) of this
title, ban the importation of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna
products from a country that transmits to the Secretary of State
a formal communication in which the country commits to--
<UL>
<P>(1) implement a moratorium of at least 5 years duration
beginning March 1, 1994, on the practice of harvesting tuna
through the use of purse seine nets deployed on or to encircle
dolphins or other marine mammals unless the moratorium is
terminated in accordance with section 1412(c) of this title;

<P>(2) require an observer on each vessel of the country larger
than 400 short tons carrying capacity which engages in purse
seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific
Ocean, and ensure that at least 50 percent of all such observers
are responsible to, and supervised by, a competent regional
organization;

<P>(3) reduce the dolphin mortality resulting from purse seine
net operations conducted by vessels of the country in 1992 to a
level that is lower than such mortality in 1991 by a
statistically significant margin; and

<P>(4) reduce the dolphin mortality resulting from purse seine
net operations conducted by vessels of the country in the period
beginning January 1, 1993, and ending February 28, 1994, to a 
level that is lower than such mortality in 1992 by a
statistically significant margin.
</UL>
<P>(b) [<STRONG>Subsequent bans on fish and fish product imports for
failure to comply with commitments</STRONG>] -- 
<UL>
<P>(1) Ban on imports of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna
products -- The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of
State, shall periodically determine whether each country which
has transmitted a formal communication expressing the commitments
described in subsection (a) of this section is fully implementing
those commitments. If the Secretary determines that any such
country is not implementing those commitments--
<UL>
<P>(A) the Secretary shall notify the President and the Congress
of that determination; and

<P>(B) 15 days after such notification, the Secretary of the
Treasury shall ban the importation from that country of all
yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products.
</UL>
<P>(2) Ban on imports of other fish and fish products -- 
<UL>
<P>(A) In general -- If--
<UL>
<P>(i) a country does not, within 60 days after the establishment
with respect to that country of a ban on importation under
paragraph (1)(B), certify and provide reasonable proof to the
Secretary that the country has fully implemented the commitment
described in subsection (a)(1) of this section or has taken the
necessary actions to remedy its failure to comply with the
commitments described in subsection (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this
section; and

<P>(ii) the Secretary does not, before the end of that 60-day
period, certify to the President that the country has provided
such certification and proof;
</UL>
<P>the President shall direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
ban the importation from that country of all articles (other than
those subject to an importation ban under paragraph (1)(B)) that
are classified under one or more of those fish and fish product
categories that the President, subject to subparagraph (B),
considers appropriate to carry out this paragraph.

<P>(B) Ban criteria -- The one or more fish and fish product
categories to which the President imposes an import ban under
subparagraph (A) with respect to a country must be a fish and
fish product category or categories with respect to which the
articles classified thereunder and imported from that country in
the base year had an aggregate customs valuation equal to 40
percent of the aggregate customs valuation of all articles
classified under all fish and fish product categories that were
imported from that country during the base year.

<P>(C) ``Base year'' defined -- For purposes of subparagraph (B),
the term "base year" means the calendar year immediately
occurring before the calendar year in which the import ban under
subparagraph (A) commences with respect to the country.
</UL>
<P>(3) Duration of import bans -- Bans on importation imposed
under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to a country shall
continue in effect until the Secretary determines that the
country is implementing the commitments described in subsection
(a) of this section.

<P>(4) Implementation of import bans -- The Secretary of the
Treasury shall take such action as may be necessary or
appropriate to implement importation bans imposed under
paragraphs (1) and (2).
</UL>
<P>(c) [<STRONG>Reviews and reports</STRONG>] -- The Secretary, in consultation
with the Secretary of State, shall--
<UL>
<P>(1) periodically review the activities of countries which have
transmitted to the Secretary of State formal communications
expressing the commitments described in subsection (a) of this
section, to determine whether those countries are complying with
those commitments; and 

<P>(2) include the results of those reviews in annual reports
submitted to the Congress pursuant to section 1414(a) of this

<CENTER><H2>Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports</H2></CENTER>

<P>On April 30,1994, Public Law 103-238 was enacted allowing significant changes to provisions within the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries are now addressed under three new Sections.  This new regime replaced the interim exemption that has regulated fisheries-related incidental takes since 1988.  Section 117, Stock Assessments, required the establishment of three regional scientific review groups to advise
and report on the status of marine mammal stocks within Alaskan waters, along the Pacific Coast (including Hawaii), and the Atlantic Coast (including the Gulf of Mexico). 

<P>Each stock assessment includes a description of the stock's geographic range, a minimum population estimate, current population trends, current and maximum net productivity rates, optimum sustainable population levels and allowable removal levels, and estimates of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury through interactions with commercial fisheries and subsistence hunters.  Under the new regime, these data will be used to evaluate the progress of each fishery towards achieving its goal of zero mortality and serious injury.

KMPC RADIO HIRES DAVE COOKE AS NEW 
OPERATIONS MANAGER / PROGRAM DIRECTOR</FONT></TH></TR> 
<TR><TD>


	<P>LOS ANGELES - Maureen Lesourd, KABC / KMPC / KLOS President and General Manager, 
announced today that Dave Cooke has been appointed the new Operations Manager / Program Director 
of KABC and KMPC Radio, effective August 12, 1996.<P>

	<P>Cooke is a News/Talk Radio veteran who has successfully worked as a news director, 
on-air talent, researcher and programming consultant. "Dave brings a tremendous amount of 
knowledge and radio experience to our heritage stations," said Lesourd. "His reputation is 
sterling and he has been heralded by many colleagues as an outstanding programming professional. 
I'm certain that Dave will be a wonderful addition to our team."<P>

	<P>For the past 10 years, he has been a partner in Roberts/Cooke Media Research & Resources 
in San Rafael, California. The company provides programming consulting and research for 
News/Talk radio stations. Some of the firm's clients have included: KRLD-AM Dallas; KMOX-AM St. 
Louis; KIRO-AM/FM Seattle; WCBS-AM New York; KMBZ/KCMO-AM Kansas City; and KXL-AM Portland.<P>

	<P>Prior to founding his company, Cooke was the Vice President & Director of News for RKO 
Radio Networks in New York. In addition, Dave has worked in Boston as the News Director for 
WHDH-AM; served as the News & Public Affairs Director for KHJ-AM in Los Angeles; acted as an 
Anchor and Correspondent for ABC Radio Network in New York; and was News Director of KFRC-AM in 
San Francisco. He began his radio career in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, first as an afternoon 
News Anchor at WFAA-AM and later as the News Director of KNUS-FM.<P>

	<P>"I am very excited about working at KABC / KMPC radio,'" says Cooke. "These are two 
stations with a tremendous heritage, premiere talent and a dynamic general manager. My first 
priority is to help re-focus the stations and ultimately re-claim their dominance." <P>

	<P>Cooke holds a Journalism/Political Science degree from the University of North Texas. 
Andy Ludlum will continue to act as the Program Manager of KABC / KMPC, reporting to Cooke.<P>

<H1>"Terrell and Katz Show"</H1>
<H3>Monday - Friday<BR> Noon - 3 p.m.</H3>
<P>
 

<P>Tune in the "Terrell and Katz Show" weekdays from Noon to 3 p.m. on 710 Talk / KMPC. <A HREF="../Bios/LT.htm">Leo Terrell</A> 
and <A HREF="../Bios/BK.htm">Burt Katz</A> engage in entertaining and thought-provoking discussions regarrding news events 
and the latest legal issues and cases. With years of experience within the judicial system, both 
Terrell and Katz offer valuable insight to the legal system through their point/counterpoint 
show. The show covers all angles from both the conservative and liberal viewpoints.<P>

<P>Burt Katz served as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for 14 
years, during which he specialized in celebrated homicide cases. He may be best known for his 
work as one of the chief prosecutors in the Charles Manson family murders. He later became a Superior 
Court Judge where he presided for nine years over many controversial and celebrated cases. He 
has also supervised and presided over Juvenile Courts, working closely with delinquent children, 
Juvenile Judges and experts.<P>

<P>Leo Terrell is a former High School teacher who graduated from the U.C.L.A. Law School. He began 
his career in civil rights in the state of Arkansas. After passing the California Bar Exam, 
Terrell returned to Los Angeles, where he established his own law practice. He has served as 
Legal Redress Counsel for the Los Angeles Chapter of the NAACP and has been involved in many 
other organizations with goals such as the control and elimination of hate-crime, and the 
establishment of improved race relations. In addition to participating in public service 
activities, Terrell has provided extensive media coverage of important civil rights proceedings, 
such as the Rodney King and Reginald Denny trials.<P>

<P>There are few people in the world who can claim to have eaten in as many restaurants as has 
Elmer Dills. He has sampled, enjoyed and even despised food from all around Southern California 
and the globe.<P>

<P>During his weekly Sunday program on KABC Talkradio, Elmer discusses restaurants and shares his recommendations with his 
listening audience. In addition to reviewing restaurants, Elmer focuses on various unique travel destinations for Southern 
Californians, including bed and breakfasts and romantic weekend getaways.<P>

<P>Elmer developed his love of traveling and dining during his 22 years as a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. State 
Department, where he specialized in protocol matters. The majority of his job entailed entertaining,  and dining with, 
diplomats. His assignments included working in Europe and the Middle East. According to Dills, "My passion has always been 
trying new and exciting restaurants. That's how I spent my free time and money overseas." Later, he moved to Washington 
D.C., then finally to Los Angeles for six years of service. Elmer enjoyed L.A. so much that, when it came time to be 
transferred out, he decided to take an early retirement instead.<P>

<P>With  his international dining experience, Elmer was hired to write a Sunday restaurant review column that lasted four 
years with the former Los Angeles Herald Examiner. In 1970, the column provided him with the opportunity  to audition for a 
radio show on KABC Talkradio. Today, his program is one of the longest running and most popular programs on the station. In 
1977, Elmer transitioned into TV where he began restaurant reviews for KHJ-TV (Channel 9). After a year, he moved to KABC-TV 
Eyewitness News, where he has been ever since.<P>

<P>Two years ago, he married Lynn,  his long-time sweetheart. The two live in Pasadena. In 
addition, Elmer's family includes four grown children from his previous marriage.<P>

<TD>Born in Denver, Fox became smitten with travel at an early age when his parents took him and his 
three siblings on long auto trips throughout most of the United States and Canada.  After 
graduating from Harvard and the Columbia Graduate School of Business, Fox attended the London 
School of Economics and Political Science.  He believes that it was during his term breaks in 
London that he truly developed his passion for traveling with extended trips throughout Europe, 
the Middle East and North Africa.<P>

        Returning to New York City, Fox entered the advertising agency business working on 
Proctor and Gamble, Gillette, Miles Laboratories and ARCO products for several large agencies.  
During this time he traveled extensively throughout the United States to test market new 
products, and because of his fluency in French, he also produced commercials for the French 
Canadian market in Montreal.<P>

When the ARCO account was transferred to the corporation's new Los Angeles headquarters, Fox 
moved to Southern California.  The following year, he was hired to write advertising copy for 
Universal Television, and he soon became an associate producer and writer for episodic 
television.  Among his television credits, Fox was head writer for the "Quiz Kids Challenge," 
won a best writer award for "Cagney & Lacey," a Humanities Award writing nomination for "Fame," 
and helped produce the NBC television movies, "Brave New World" and "Tailgunner Joe."<P>

While writing and producing television, Fox began writing travel columns for LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE
 where he eventually became a Contributing Editor.  He subsequently wrote free-lance articles on 
travel, food and wine for TRAVEL & LEISURE, FOOD & WINE, BON APPETIT, and PLEASURES OF JAPAN.  
Two years later, Fox became a syndicated travel columnist with the Copley News Service with two 
weekly columns in four hundred newspapers nationwide with six million readers.  In addition, he 
also writes food and travel columns for THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER and is the Travel and Restaurant 
Editor for PERFORMING ARTS MAGAZINE.<P>

In 1984, Fox wrote "THE TRIVIA CHALLENGE," published by Simon & Schuster, which was cited as a 
top  performing title of that year.  He also co-authored with Bobby Chandler, "VIOLENT SUNDAYS," 
an expose of professional football published by Simon & Schuster.  In 1991, Fox co-authored with 
Steve and Pat Zifferblatt, "THE BETTER LIFE INSTITUTE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN," published by Thomas 
Nelson and translated for distribution throughout the world.<P>

Seeking a radio outlet for his accumulated travel expertise, Fox spent a year and a half hosting 
a call-in show, "Travel Talk" on KTMS-AM in Santa Barbara.   Concurrently, he also had a weekly 
feature,  "Traveling," on KCRW-TV in Los Angeles, one of the country's largest Public 
Broadcasting affiliates.  This led to his being hired in 1994 to host a two-hour weekly travel 
talk show on KMPC-AM in Los Angeles.<P>

	<P>Rod Lurie is the popular film critic for 710 TALK / KMPC. Lurie was also the film 
critic, investigative reporter, and contributing editor to Los Angeles Magazine. He is the 
nation's only film critic to be (1) "Banned for Life" from a major studio; (2) almost divorced 
for trying to name his newborn son Ben-Hur; and (3) quoted in an advertisement for a Chuck 
Norris film.<P>

	<P>In his capacity as an investigative reporter on the entertainment industry, Lurie has 
been the subject of feature stories and segments on 60 Minutes, Entertainment Tonight, The Larry 
King Show, Nightline, Geraldo, the Jane Whitney Show, to name a few. Lurie was also "The Guy" on 
an episode of To Tell The Truth. For the record, Lurie was picked out by all the panelists, 
including Kitty Carlisle, who slept through the entire question and answer segment. Lurie also 
won prizes totaling $17,000 on Classic Concentration. But, that was when he was an unknown 
writer.<P>

	<P>Lurie, like most film critics, was educated at the United States Military Academy at 
West Point. He graduated in 1984. He served four years in the United States Army as a Combat 
Arms officer and is currently (God help us all) a Captain in the reserves. <P>

	<P>He worked as an entertainment reporter for the New York Daily News and was the film 
critic and celebrity interviewer for Channel 12 in Connecticut. He was also a frequent 
contributor to Premiere, Movieline, and Entertainment Weekly Magazines.<P>

	<P>Rod began writing film criticism for Los Angeles Magazine in 1991. However, Lurie's 
primary acclaim has come for his investigative pieces. His look into the unethical and illegal 
practices of the tabloid newspapers, gained national attention, including a piece by the 
top-rated 60 Minutes.<P>

	<P>Lurie's investigative book Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was published in May, 1995 by 
Random House and is currently available in bookstores across the country. The book has been 
optioned to be made into a major motion picture.<P>

	<P>Currently, Lurie is directing his first feature length film titled "Porkchop," which is 
based on a screenplay he wrote. Lurie lives in Pasadena, California with his wife Gretchen, and 
their children Hunter and Paige.<P>

<P>        Chuck Madden is the sports reporter for the "Peter Tilden Show
with Tracey Miller," heard weekdays from 5:30 to 9 a.m. on 710 TALK / KMPC.
His odd sense of humor and entertaining approach to sports are a perfect
complement to the hilarious morning talk show.<P> 

<P>         Madden was raised in Rochester, New York, and moved to Dallas at
age 10.  He remained there through high school, then, continued his
education at a small college in Alabama, where he earned a degree in
Chemistry. After college, Madden returned to Dallas where he enrolled in a
six-week broadcasting course. There, armed with his broadcasting
certificate, he was hired at a radio station in a small Louisiana town.
That job propelled him to a succession of other radio spots in such markets
as Joplin, Missouri; Dallas, Texas; Huron, South Dakota; and Monterey and
San Jose in California.<P> 

<P>          In 1993, Chuck joined KMPC as a sports talk show host. When
Capital Cities / ABC purchased the station, he became the morning sports
reporter. Madden also hosted a Sunday sports show that was broadcast live
from Trophys in Newport Beach.<P> 

<P>         Madden enjoys watching sports on the weekends as well as catching
up on movies. He is single and lives in Long Beach, California.<P>

<P>          Ten years ago, when a friend was accosted and viciously raped,
Paxton Quigley, a divorced mother of two with a Masters in Anthropology
from the University of Chicago, decided not to let it happen to her.<P>  

<P>          Her quest for personal security has transformed her into a national
authority on personal protection strategies including the use of a handgun.
Tom Browkaw on NBC Nightly News, called her "guru" to eleven million women.
Morely Safer on 60 Minutes saw her as "the great persuader."<P>  

<P>          Espousing the essence of the popular Des'ree song: You got to be
bold. You got to be stronger and wiser, the pert Chicago-born Quigley has
taught thousands of women in her "Women's Empowerment in the 90's"
seminars, how not to become victims, through training, awareness and
preparation.<P>  

<P>          A spirited fusion of mid-western conservatism and enlightened
feminism, empowermentor Quigley enthusiastically advocates that women step
out of character, abandon age-old bonds of male-dependence and free
themselves from the cycle of fear and despair that has plagued them from
time immemorial.<P>  

<P>          Author of the best selling ARMED AND FEMALE (E.P. Dutton and St.
Martins Press) and NOT AN EASY TARGET (Simon & Schuster), Quigley has
appeared on more than 300 TV and radio shows including "The Today Show,"
"Good Morning America," "Larry King," "Montel Williams," "Regis and Kathy
Lee," "Hard Copy," "The NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" and "60 
Minutes."<P>  

<P>          Her recent week-long hosting of the top-rated, nationally
syndicated Ken Hamblin radio show extended her message of personal reliance
and responsibility in an increasingly violent society to millions of
concerned women, as well as the men who love and care about them. As of
March 1996, she's doing the same weekly via L.A.'s 710 TALK / KMPC on the
Paxton Quigley Empowerment Hour.<P>  

<P>          The subject of front page profiles in both the Wall Street Journal
and Investors Business Daily, Quigley has also been featured in Elle,
Glamour, Cosmopolitan, People, Harpers Bazaar, Entrepreneur, Ladies Home
Journal and MS, and widely quoted in America's leading newspapers. Her
"poster girl" ad for Working Woman Magazine including the quote: "I didn't
get where I am today reading Good Housekeeping," received the Ad Week award
as one of the ten best advertisement campaigns of 1994.<P>  

<P>          Quigley was also the featured guest speaker at the 1991 U.S.
Congressional Sportsmen Caucus in Washington D.C., won the Outstanding
Public Service Award of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, and
was recently voted "Most Popular Speaker" by L.A.'s Women in Management.<P>  

<P>          Organizations that have relied on Quigley's expertise include: The
National Congress of the National Safety Council, the Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power, the Young President's Organization, Sarah Lawrence
College, Westec Security, the Beverly Hills Real Estate Board, the
Hillcrest Country Club, Los Angeles Women in Business, Prudential Reality,
Cedars Sinai Hospital and the City of Hope.<P>  

<P>          Prior to her work in personal security and empowerment, Quigley was
an executive with Playboy Enterprises, reporting directly to Christie
Hefner, President and CEO. She also served as Director of Promotions for
the Jimmy Stewart National Relay Marathon, and edited the Valley Magazine,
in San Fernando Valley, California.<P>  

<P>        Paxton Quigley enjoys going at it with gusto at the broad range of
daily issues that challenge women as they prepare for the onrushing 21st
Century. Who better to spread the message of empowerment than someone who
has done it for herself.<P>

<P>While with Irvine Ranch, Ms. Scanlon created a weekly "Ask the Dietitian" newspaper column. Its success in drawing reader response resulted in her re-introduction of the column, on a continuing basis, for a group of Southern California newspapers. 

<P>Upon graduation with a B.S. in Food and Science at Cal State-L.A., second highest in her class after four years on the Dean's Honor List, Ms. Scanlon provided counseling for both corporate and individual clients. During that time, she was approached by a public company seeking to expand its weight management plan on a nationwide basis as part of the growing trend toward industry workforce wellness programs. She joined that firm as Vice-President, Corporate Sales and Nutrition Counsel, and created and supervised a field network of thirty Registered Dietitians throughout the U.S.

<P>Having worked with thousands of "diet patients" and having analyzed the problems that too often result in failure and frustration, Ms. Scanlon left her position and returned to private practice and the media, in order to better inform consumers about safe, healthful lifestyle eating management and successful dieting techniques.

<P> As a member of the National Speakers Association, Ms. Scanlon lectures to organizations and other groups on the subjects of nutrition for health and beauty, effective lifestyle management, and the special nutritional needs of the "baby boomer" generation. She has taught courses on Weight Management and Nutrition for Seniors at Emeritus College, and has lectured at the UCLA Medical Center.

<P>Prior to attending Cal State-L.A., Ms. Scanlon studied Medical Record Science at East Los Angeles College, where she earned the Medical Record Association award for scholastic achievement. Subsequently, she became an accredited Medical Record Technician, and received her Associate of Arts Degree from Santa Monica City College before entering Cal State-L.A. For several years, extending into early college, Ms. Scanlon worked throughout the world as a fashion and photography model, including extensive appearances in Paris' Pret a Porte fashion collections, and in such leading magazines as Vogue.

<P>In 1991 and 1992, Deralee Scanlon served the membership of Dietitians in Business and Communications (DBC) as Geographic Representative for Area 1, which covers eight Western states. She also served as Southern California Chairperson for DBC and is the current national DBC newsletter editor. Deralee is a member of the following additional organizations: the American Dietetic Association, California Dietetic Association, Society for Nutrition Education, National Speakers Association, and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). Ms Scanlon is profiled in both the 1994/1995 and 1995/1996 editions of "Who's Who in the West."

<P>        When Southern Californians need their morning news, Joe West is
there for them. He can be heard on 710 TALK / KMPC during the "Peter Tilden
Show with Tracey Miller," which airs from 5:30 to 9 a.m.<P>

<P>        West began his radio career while attending the University of
Northern Colorado. His first radio job, at age 18, was as a disc jockey for
country music stations KYOU-AM and KGRE-FM in Greeley, Colorado. He soon
realized his hunger was for news reporting, and shifted stations to KFKA-AM
and KGBS-FM, which better suited his taste.<P>

<P>        In the early 1980s, Joe began handling a range of duties and
entertainment functions for the NFL's Denver Broncos and the short-lived
USFL's Denver Gold. However, he soon joined the Navy, where he became a
highly decorated serviceman during Operation Desert Storm.<P>

<P>        West was given an honorable discharge after Desert Storm, and moved
to Los Angeles where he was hired by CBS affiliate KNX Newsradio as a news
writer. He later served as the Los Angeles Bureau Chief at Metro Networks
News, and also began doing voice-overs for various radio and television
advertising campaigns. Joe's voice can be heard throughout the Southland
delivering the "on-hold" message for thousands of businesses.<P>

<P>        West enjoys the outdoors and plans to participate in the San
Francisco to Los Angeles AIDS Bike-A-Thon. He also enjoys reading and
working on his old Corvette.<P>

<P>Okay, gang- Christmas- Hanukkah - time to reach in your pockets and buy gifts for those that you love and those that you 
need to suck up to.  There is only one kind of gift-getter on my list: The movie lover.  If they are not one now, they will 
be when I get through with them.   The following are gift ideas for the movie aficionado. These are unsolicited by the 
merchants mentioned and  are not, in any way, a form of paid advertisement. As a result, you may see a valley influence to 
my list because I reside in Pasadena. If you have any ideas of your own, e-mail me from the menu-bar below or call into my 
show (remember. Saturdays from 8-10AM).<P><P>

<OL>
<LI> Scripts. C'mon. Think of a cooler idea than this.  Let's say that you have a friend who is a freak about, oh, say, "All 
The President's Men." You can get him the movie, but he or she probably already has it. Why not go and purchase the original 
script? At Book City in Burbank, they have a quizillion scripts. What makes them fun is that they are rarely the exact 
shooting script. This means that they often include scenes that were omitted from the film. Check out, for example, the 
170+ page script of "Rain Man" or Stallone's original "Rocky."  Great stuff and not too expensive. You can reach the folks 
at Book City at 818-577-7035<P><P>


<LI> Laser Discs. I have said it before and I will say it again.  Video is a tool of the devil. The sound sucks. The films are 
rarely in wide-screen (and thus the dreaded pan and scan). There is a general lack of crispness to the images. Laser disc 
solves all these problems in one final swoop.  Discs are more expensive to buy than videos (although they can often be 
rented for less), but the good news is that a used laser is often as good as a brand new one.  For the best prices on used 
DISCS I would go down to the Laser Library in Pasadena. Their number is  818-577-7035<P><P>

For the record, here are the twenty-five discs I would most recommend you purchase. They are in no particular order.<P>
<OL>
<LI> ET- Special edition
<LI> Terminator 2- Special edition
<LI> Ben-Hur- Special edition
<LI> Top Gun
<LI> Lawrence of Arabia - Criterion version
<LI> Star Wars threesome- Image's latest version
<LI> Toy Story
<LI> Lion King- Special edition
<LI> Amadeus- Special edition
<LI> Taxi Driver- Criterion
<LI> Last Tango in Paris- Criterion
<LI> Last Picture Show- Criterion
<LI> 2001: A Space Odyssey- 25th anniversary edition
<LI> Braveheart
<LI> Pulp Fiction- Criterion
<LI> Beatles Anthology
<LI> Young Frankenstein- new Special edition
<LI> Scarface- Special edition
<LI> Natural Born Killers- special edition
<LI> Platoon- special edition (box set)
<LI> Schindler's List- box set
<LI> Murder in the First
<LI> All the President's Men
<LI> The Day the Earth Stood Still- autographed box set
<LI>  They Shoot Horses Don't They- autographed box set
</OL>

<BR><BR>

<LI> Laser disc players. If you can afford a VCR you can afford one of these. There are great prices at Dave's in North 
Hollywood.  They can be reached at  818-760-3472<P><P>


<LI> There are a number of new film books I would recommend strongly:  First, there is "Toxic Fame," maybe the best film 
interview compilation book I have ever come across. It certainly has the widest variety of celebrities ever to make it 
between any two covers. Dynamite stuff and fab bedside reading.  Next,  Roger Ebert's Book of Film is a collection of 
film-related essays. At times cute and fun and at other times serious and esoteric. Never boring. The Rolling Stone Film 
Reader has tons of great interviews and set pieces from the renegade magazine. The Bill Zehme interview with Warren Beatty 
is a classic.  I also recommend: "The Making of Blade Runner," "The Kennedys in Hollywood" (for good Camelot gossip), 
"Stone," and "David  Lean."<P><P>

<P><B>"I have often heard the notion that a picture cannot win the best picture award without it's director winning. But what 
about the screenplay? Isn't that just as important?"</B>  <I>CJ- Hermosa Beach</I>
<P>
<P>That's a great question. I also believe that the writer is too often ignored in ever element of the Hollywood press 
game. However, the simple fact is that some very well written films simply do not translate to visually exciting 
entertainment. This is often true of stage plays that transfer to screen. "Marvin's Room," while a competent film, simply 
does not have the emotional fireworks it had on screen (while Arthur Miller sufficiently opened up 'The Crucible" to make 
it an exhilarating thunderclap of a film). Another example? "Platoon" was a gorgeous bit of emotional film making. It 
certainly deserved it's Oscar for best picture. But it did not win the screenplay award- that went to the much sharper 
dialogue of "Hannah and her Sisters'  Then there is politics. In 1959 "Ben -Hur" won eleven of twelve Oscars. It's only loss 
was for it's screenplay, which was mired in a union arbitration.
<P>
<P><B>You talk a great deal about laser discs and the laser disc player, but won't DVD make it obsolete?</B>  <I>TR- Glendale</I>
<P>
<P>I don't think so.  First of all, it will take years and years for the studios to  be able to match lasers in terms of titles. Right now, there are 10,000 films on laser, many of them in special edition. Pioneer, Voyager, and Image all have contracts to create lasers well into the next century. There is also some concern about the quality of DVD which explains why it has been so often delayed.

<P>It is simplest to put it this way. "Sling Blade" is a masterpiece.  Billy Bob Thornton, it's star, writer, and director, is not only a major find, he may be, if this film is the barometer,  the most compelling all consuming creative force in  American  movies since Orson Welles. I know that this seems like hyperbole. I know. I know.  But I challenge you to see the film and come back to me with any other example wherein one man  has achieved so much, with such a sure hand, across the board.
<P>
<P>"Sling Blade" deals with a mentally ill man who is released from a state institution where he had been held for almost thirty years for having killed his mother and her boyfriend with a sling blade. The doctors say he's fine and that he must be released. Big new world out there. Go get it. Only thing is, he's not fine. We know it and Carl knows it and very probably the doctors know it. And so a sense of doom creeps like a virus throughout the film.  But, oddly, the tension in the film is created through a sense of relaxation. Not much happens through most of "Sling Blade." There are no plot twists, no car chases, no sex.  But we know it  is coming. We're not sure what that it is, but it is there, and so we wait for it, our psyche starts to play games with us.
<P>
<P>There are many surprising performances in "Sling Blade". There is the country music star Dwight Yoakim as the abusive boyfriend of the mother of Carl's twelve year old best friend. John Ritter as the mother's gay best friend. Startling cameos by Robert DuVall and John Heard and Molly Ringwald. But at the top is the extraordinary work of  Thornton himself as Carl. 
<P>
<P>When you watch the film you might be reminded of Tom Hanks as Gump or Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man" or one of the many actors who played Lenny in "Of Mice and Men."  But  as Karl, Thornton has created a viciously original character,  a  talk-only-when-talked-to simpleton who is driven by a peculiar decency. 
<P>
<P>In retrospect it seems to me that this is an amazing feat of directing. Thornton's Karl is one of the most inwardly drawn characters ever captured on screen, yet, somehow, as a director, Thornton was  able to keep a precise eye on his supporting cast.  This might have been especially difficult with a non actor like Yoakim, who's swing between abusiveness and cowardice (often the two are mingled together) is nothing short of masterful.
<P>
<P>Unlike "Fargo" the film is not visually dazzling or even  visually interesting. The lighting is mediocre. There is not much editing to speak of given the multitude of one shots in the film.  What holds it together are these fully realize characters who make us, God help us, care what happens to them.  I cannot recommend this film more. It is the best film of the year and the most perfectly acted project since "All the President's Men."

<P>Okay, I am asked this time and time again. So, finally, I'll put my opinions on paper, or the 
airwaves, or cyberspace - my list of the ten best English language films. I have revealed your
favorite movies on <A HREF="list.htm">this page</A>.

<P>E-mail me through this web site with YOUR ten best films of all time. Rank them in order. We 
will tabulate and give the results to you on an on-going basis. In the meantime, here's my picks, in 
rank order:
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
1. <STRONG>"All the President's Men"</STRONG> - We all know the story, but what a thriller it was nonetheless. 
Redford, Hoffman, and Robards were the quintessence of acting, solid and understated performances 
that did not lapse into one iota of hysteria or broadness. William Goldman's screenplay is a 
textbook of adapting a complicated book.
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
2. <STRONG>"Paths of Glory"</STRONG> - There has never been as serene or horrifying a testament against war and 
the expectations of man's limits at Kubrick's elegant masterpiece. Kirk Douglas at his very, very 
best.<BR>
2a. <STRONG>"The Killing,"</STRONG> also by Kubrick.
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
3. <STRONG>"Raging Bull"</STRONG> - De Niro in maybe the greatest performance of all time. Never has cruelty been 
packaged in so magnificent a package as it was by Martin Scorcese. The finest editing (Thelma 
Schoonmaker) in the history of film.<BR>
3a. <STRONG>"Taxi Driver"</STRONG> - Scorcese's bold and frightening elegy.<BR>
3b. <STRONG>"Rocky"</STRONG> - Boxing becomes sweet and tender.
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
4. <STRONG>"Midnight Cowboy"</STRONG> - The only X-rated film to win the Oscar. Jon Voight's performance as a 
street hustler and Dustin Hoffman as his crippled, pathetic pimp was a tragedy of almost a 
Shakesperean order.
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
5. <STRONG>"Platoon"</STRONG> and <STRONG>"Born on the Fourth of July"</STRONG> - Oliver Stone's films have to be seen one after 
another to get the full impact. The latter features a performance by Tom Cruise that seems almost 
divine. Never has an adult played a teen so well. Brilliant and moving. The only film that ever 
provoked full out tears from me.<BR>
5a. <STRONG>"JFK"</STRONG>  - As politically astute as it was or wasn't, was a magnificent advance in cinema style.
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
6. <STRONG>"The Godfather"</STRONG> - A film that violates all the rules of modern film making, yet still slick 
and fast  - one of the most violent yet poetic films of our time.<BR> 
6a. Okay, <STRONG>"The Godfather II."</STRONG><BR>
6b. While we are on the subject of Coppola - <STRONG>"Apocalypse Now."</STRONG>
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
7. <STRONG>"Pulp Fiction"</STRONG> - The most important American film since "Nashville" - in terms of it's 
inventive narrative structure. Travolta made his come back. That makes it good enough for me.<BR>
7a. <STRONG>"The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three"</STRONG> - a film that Tarantino acknowledges ripping off.<BR>
7b. Since we brought it up - <STRONG>"Nashville."</STRONG>
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
8. <STRONG>"Lawrence of Arabia"</STRONG> - Peter O'Toole yelling "Aquaba! Aquaba!" Enough said.<BR>
8a. <STRONG>"The Bridge on the River Kwai."</STRONG>
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
9. <STRONG>"Braveheart"</STRONG> - For the finest and most heart-stopping battle scenes ever filmed.<BR>
9a. For the thrill of it - <STRONG>"The Road Warrior."</STRONG>
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
10. <STRONG>"E.T."</STRONG>  - This is the "Wizard of Oz" of my generation, with the best little boy performance ever.<BR>
10a. <STRONG>"Schindler's List"</STRONG> - For the other side of the Spielberg coin<BR>
10b. That also applies to <STRONG>"Jaws."</STRONG>
</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>
<OL>
<LI> <STRONG>SLING BLADE</STRONG> -  This voracious  directorial debut, made on a budget of less
than one million dollars,  marks the greatest confluence of talent since
Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane." Billy Bob Thornton, as an actor, writer, and
director, has created a shattering and tragic film character in the retarded
Karl.
<BR><BR>
<LI> <STRONG>THE CRUCIBLE/THE ENGLISH PATIENT</STRONG> - A tie. It took Arthur Miller himself to
"open" up his classic play.  What was once an allegory to the McCarthy
 hearings is now a cautionary tale against any kind of social or political
judgementality.  With gorgeous performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul
Scofield, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, and Bruce Davison.  The flip side of "The
Crucible" deals with forbidden love, which is the hallmark of Anthony
Minghella's "The English Patient." Some may be disturbed by romantacizing
infidelity, but Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas are so searing that we
give a damn about them anyway.  At $20 million, there has never been a
greater visual  bang for the buck.
<BR><BR>
<LI> <STRONG>FARGO </STRONG> - The Coen Brothers at their most macabre and, since "Blood Simple"
anyway, their most fun. Never has so much art been made out of blankets of
snow.
<BR><BR>
<LI> <STRONG>LA HAINE </STRONG>- The shocking and tragic black and white French tale of disturbed
youth. At least the French are as messed up as we are.
<BR><BR>
<LI> <STRONG>THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLYNT </STRONG>- Milos Forman, who lived under iron curtain
oppression,  has made one of the classic filmic essays on the wisdom of the
Constitution. Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love are in brilliant form and
newcomer Edward Norton is Dustin Hoffman waiting to happen.
<BR><BR>
<LI> <STRONG>WHEN WE WERE KINGS </STRONG>- A documentary about the Ali-Foreman fight in Zaire.
Taylor Hackford's non-narrated film is really an examination about the power
of charisma.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  <STRONG>HAMLET </STRONG>- Kenneth Branagh continues to seek higher office. In this grand
70mm adaptation of le bard, we are sucked into the anguished world of the
great Dane prince with more sheer visionary power than ever before.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  <STRONG>SOME MOTHER'S SON </STRONG>- This year's great political thriller and, to boot, a
true story. On it's face, the epic  and tragic battle waged by Bobby Sands
seems to be a great natural for film. But to tell it from his mother's point
of view and bestow that role on the great Helen Mirren is  nothing short of
brilliant.
<BR><BR>
<LI>  <STRONG>BOUND </STRONG> - It's enough that two beautiful are going at it and ..... oops,
let's put the testosterone on hold there. This is a film of, all puns aside,
boundless good fun and energy, with more twists than chubby Checker on
amphetamines.
<BR><BR>
<LI> THE SUBSTANCE OF FIRE </STRONG> -  "Shine" has won all the domineering Jewish father
accolades this year, but shocking overlooked is this remarkable tale of a
publishing house about to go under because of one man's unhealthy obsession
with his tragic past. Ron Rifkin in a performance of grace and elegance and
sheer horror.

<P>SCARFACE-  Yup, we're talking about the Brian De Palma remake of the 
classic gangster film starring Paul Muni.  The 1983 film was reviled 
when it came out, with critics attacking it's flamboyance and 
exorbitant violence. One scene in particular, in which Colombian drug 
dealers start to cut up a rival with a chainsaw, almost gave the film 
an X-rating.  It may be fair to say that there  is no film in the 
eighties that has undergone so much critical revisionism than 
"Scarface," which is now being hailed by critics as an almost 
"Godfather"-like study of the modern drug world. Me? I've always been 
a fan of the film, especially Michelle Pfeiffer's great and sexy 
entrance.  Universal's new "signature" edition of the film is aces, 
with a near perfect transfer and some wonderfully entertaining 
outtakes (although you can understand - from a story structure point 
of view- why De Palma removed them).  Most enjoyable, however, are the 
interviews at the end of the film - with De Palma and a wonderfully 
galvanized Pacino.<P>

<P>Early in his Presidency, John Kennedy declared his love for the James Bond novels, setting off  
a frenzy sales for the already popular books written bu Ian Fleming.  This mania clearly 
translated itself to the screen, first with "Dr. No' then "From Russia with Love," and, perhaps 
at it's zenith with "Goldfinger."<P>

<P>There have been about six different pressings of the film, regarded by many as the 
quintessential Bond film,  but none more impressive than Image's box set.  For one thing, the 
film is in CAV, a crisper format that I personally love. I'm a nut about freeze-framing and took 
delight in stopping the film cold when we see the "gold lady" or the great laser beam sequence 
("No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die").  Then there are the Behind-the scenes footage, a 
documentary about "Goldfingermania," and interview with Sean Connery, and even an hysterical 
screen test that the Israeli singer Theodore Bikel gave as Goldfinger himself.  For more info,

<P>When "Natural Born Killers" opened two summers ago I was in the front
line of critics who despised the film, dismissed it as the ultimate
act of cinema overindulgence.  It wasn't that I "didn't get" what
Stone was trying to say about the carniverous strength of the media,
but that I got it all to clearly. After two plus hours, my head was a
bashed in mush.  After seeing the film on CAV Laser disc my opinion
hasn't changed. What warrants this film to be a  Pick of the Week  is
Stone's cerebral analog track.  After all, this is a man who has
created some of the greatest cinema of the modern era and he deserves
his say.  It's fascinating to see some of the footage that the MPAA
banned from the "R" rated footage, including a graphic rape scene and
an extended prison riot sequence. With this disc, Stone has his clear
day in court.  There is also a wonderful series of interviews with
Stone and his stars Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones,
Tom Sizemore, and Robert Downey Jr..  Love it or, as I did, hate it,
"NBK" is nonetheless a MUST for Stone fans.

<P>Any real fan of "Pulp Fiction," and there are a ton of us out there, has to - has to, has to, 
has to - own the Criterion laser disc special edition. Even if you don't own a laser disc 
player, you should get it just for show. Going over the film's essential plot elements seems 
superfluous here and so I'll divigate away from that. What's important to know about the special 
collection is that it has four deleted scenes - one of which should have stayed in the film. 
(You watch them and guess which one I am talking about). You have much of the standard laser 
special stuff - the posters from around the world, the various trailers and commercial spots - 
but the most fun exists in the hour long interview between Tarantino and the interviewer Charlie 
Rose. I'm not sure (e-mail if I am wrong on this) that any other disc has this level of film 
maker interview. For more info go to www.voyagerco.com

<P>Oliver Stone's  "Platoon" is an outright  masterpiece, one of the great
studies of war and the submergence of the human soul ever recorded. It's on
my ten best of all time list. Pioneer's special edition of the film is one of
the great laser discs available. There is, above  anything else, save for the
movie itself, the analog track, in which Stone takes us  through the film
step by step, image by image. metaphor by metaphor. Captain Dale Dye, the
projects military adviser, does the same.  The package also comes with not
only Stone's script (he unfail lost the Oscar that year - in this category
only - to Woody Allen for "Hannah and her sisters." ) but a documentary about
the casting, making, and aftermath of this most magnificent effort.  For

<P>Marty Scorcese, who began his career as a screen minimalist, has certainly
become filmdom's most dynamic dazzlist. His films have a rip-roaring style
that go to a level which would be, with any OTHER director, wildly
over-the-top. "Casino" may be his most technically accomplished work. He's
working with most of the same team that turned "Raging Bull" into such a
phenomenal piece of work. With this amazing transfer, you can hear every
clink of the dice, every rattling of a chip. It's also fun to move frame by
frame and analyze some of Marty's brilliant transitions from shot to shot.
In any case, bravo to any man who directs Sharon Stone to an Oscar
nomination. For more go to <A HREF="http://www.mcauniversalhomevideo.com">www.mcauniversalhomevideo.com</A>

	<P>The beauty of "<A HREF="http://www.mgmua.com/getshorty">Get Shorty</A>" was in the performance of John Travolta as Chili Palmer, 
the hitman/collector for the mob who becomes enamored (aren't we all) with Hollywood. Has there 
ever been an actor who has had a better time on screen than Travolta? I think not. He was denied 
an Oscar nomination for the film, probably because he insisted on being paid $20 million and one 
dollar for his latest film -  which many people considered an act of outright arrogance. 
Nevertheless, it's a performance worthy of that honor.
<P>
	<P>The beauty of this pristine laserdisc comes in both the analog track (featuring director Barry Sonenfeld) 
and the inclusion of a deleted scene from the film. It shows us Gene Hackman at work on a movie 
set, working with director Ben Stiller. It's fun and witty and puts the entire film in a better 
perspective.

	<P>For years, audiences had been waiting for a handsome Brit to utter the words 
"Bond.... James Bond." They had waited even longer for it to be done with competence. "Lisence 
to Kill" and "The Living Daylights," those Bond films starring Timothy Dalton had been abysma 
failures. Now, however, all is well worth the world again. As Agent 007, Pierce Brosnan found 
himself somewhere inbetween the fierce masculine nobility of Sean Connery and the tongue in 
cheek style of Roger Moore. "Goldeneye" for the sheer thrill of it, is a must-see, with the best 
opening stunt since the sky-dive in "Moonraker."<P>

	<P>This laser disc is especilly fun. You not only get a gorgeous THX-master transfer of the 
film (movies like this, with explosions and noisy gadgets, are just made for laser), but 
wonderful extras: Every trailer put out by MGM, an hour long television special in honor of 
Bond, a dubbing of one scene in German, Italian, and French, and, for me this is the most fun, 
the video of the Tina Turner title song -  the best in the history of the Bond series.<P>

<P>Steven Spielberg's "1941" was an immensely anticipated film. It was the brash young director's 
first project since "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and, as importantly, John Belushi's 
first film since his triumphant debut in "Animal House."  Perhaps because the hype surrounding 
the film was overwhelming, "1941" was a critical and financial disaster.<P>

<P>Now, we have a chance to re-evaluate the film. MCA has re-mastered the comedy film (in the THX 
format) and included footage that never existed in the theatrical version of the film. Included 
in the box se are interviews, conducted only recently with the writers John Milius, Bob Gale, 
and Robert Zemeckis (yes, him) and Spielberg himself, who seems to have warmed to the project he 
has previously shown disdain for.<P>

<P>As is typical of the MCA Signature Collection, there are wonderful extras: The original trailers 
for the film, outtakes (which are genuinely hysterical), and the storyboards for the project. 
"1941" is a must for Spielberg aficionados.<P>

<P>David Fincher's "Seven" was nothing short of a phenom when it came out. If nothing else, it 
demonstrated what the essence of star power is all about - in particular, the apparently magnetic 
lure of Brad Pitt. I say this because the film itself was as dark as the backside of Pluto, with 
images and emotional violence as powerful as anything ever put on screen. The film was a visual 
tour de farce, with one of the most exciting land chases ever filmed.
<P>
<P>Criterion has just come out with a wonderful four box set which should satisfy even the most 
depraved among us. In addition to the brilliant transfer of the film, we also get analog 
commentary from Fincher. Included is the original first scene of the film. Though very well done, 
I can understand exactly why it was dropped: It does not suck you as quickly into the film as 
the actual start does. There is also an "alternate" credit sequence that was junked for the 
creepier version that was used in the film.
<P>
<P>I believe my favorite part of this disc set is the story board (you have to 'step' your way 
through) of the film's original ending... which I will not spoil for you here. If you have 
trouble finding the film, you can go to the Criterion Web Site at

<B>ROD'S WEEKLY REVIEW: EVITA</B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+3>B+  </FONT><BR>
<BR>
Starring: MADONNA, JONATHAN PRYCE, ANTONIO BANDERAS. <BR>
Directed by ALAN PARKER<BR>

<P>Would it  be fair  to describe "Evita" as the most anticipated film of the year?  probably.  Not because the film is abuzz with hyperbolic talk of it's quality or poetic resonance 	or because it is swallowing up the critics awards (it is not) , but because  it's arduous history has become the stuff of mini-Hollywood legend.  Audiences are either  expecting and wanting  a n "Annie-style disaster (inspired by a [popular anti-Madonna sweep in Hollywood) or a brazen new form of American musical cinema.  At the end, booth sides will be disappointed..
<P>
<P>Ever since the Andrew Lloyd Weber stage play won eight Tony awards, there have been attempts to make it into a major motion picture (it can only be a MAJOR motion picture, right?). Oliver Stone was one of the many directors attached to it as was Francis Ford Coppola.  As for the various Evita Perons? There was  Meryl Streep, Ann-Margret, Michelle Pfeiffer, and so on. Even when the current production, this one directed by Alan Parker and starring a pregnant Madonna,  went before the cameras in Argentina, all  social hell seemed to disrupt in that country.
<P>
<P>But, now here it is. Finally.  And you can practically see the sweat dripping from it with exhaustion. The film is big and bold and beautiful, huge and triumphant, and also a little bit out of control- like an elephant on fire.  With it's huge set and crowd pieces and with it's historical perspective, it is easy to see why so many directors were drawn to it.  I am not sure that there has ever been quite such an epic  musical ever created. What baffled me is why anybody was drawn to Alan Parker.  Sure, he has made a couple of successful semi-musicals ("Fame," Bugsy Malone," "The Commitments"). But for the most part his dramas have been crammed with wretched, almost obscene excess. Films like "Angel Heart" and "The Wall" are almost unwatchable.  But here, to his credit,  Parker seeks to entertain and not overwhelm.
<P>
<P>It is the entertainment factor that, in retrospect, makes  it seem that Madonna may well have been the best choice for the film.  If anything, the chick has  presence, which was the essence of Evita Peron.  As a critic I was yearning to laugh at her, standing on that balcony in the palace square, arms raised up in dictatorial triumph like  a Rose queen. But she embodies Peron so well, that we accept her  seriously and without a hint of pretension. Conversely, She is also a remarkable vocalist and it is impossible to concentrate on anything other than the instrument of her vocal chords when her mouth opens.
<P>
<P>But therein also lies the films problem. "Evita" is an opera, which basically means that we never hear a spoken word. The presents us with two problems. First, it is difficult to follow a definitive and, at times, politically complicated storyline. Two, the film has the look of a two hour and fifteen minute MTV video - though a robust one at that.  As such, the film, at that long length, will eventually lose your interest. You will gain almost as much simply listening to the CD as watching the film.

<LI>     <STRONG>Jodie Foster in "Taxi Driver" </STRONG> -  Okay, a shocker for my number one choice. It was, of course, a supporting role. But has ever such a small amount of screen time so haunted an audience. As the twelve year old hooker Iris, Foster was concurrently downtrodden  and a free-spirit. In this magical performance (some magic- Scorsese was guiding her), Foster displayed the talent for cracking the little ticks of human nature that has made her the pre-eminent realist actor of her generation and, maybe, ever.    -Oscar nomination
<P>
<P>1 (A) <STRONG> Foster in "The Accused" </STRONG> - Oscar winner<P>


<LI> 	<STRONG>Mimi Rogers in "The Rapture" </STRONG> -  The most sexually  daring performance since Marlon Brando's far more pretentious take in "Last Tango in Paris."  The role of the swinger turned religious zealot was passed on by actress after actress, until it finally landed square in Rogers' hands.  You'll have to wait until the end of the film to see why the role was so unpopular and, perhaps, why it failed at the box office.

<P>2(A) <STRONG> Rogers in "Bulletproof Heart" </STRONG><P>

<LI> 	<STRONG>Anne Bancroft in "The Graduate" </STRONG> - Mrs. Robinson has created what I am sure is a great ambivalence with Bancroft. On the one hand, it was a performance of historic importance,  certainly the one piece of work that propelled her into the highest echelon of actresses. On the other, she played the cold ice bitch with such pure calculation, that I am sure she finds herself in the odd position of being an intimidating and unapproachable presence in real life.

<P>3(A) <STRONG> Bancroft in "The Miracle Worker" </STRONG> - Oscar winner<P>



<LI> 	<STRONG>Diane Keaton in "Reds" </STRONG> -  If nothing else, Warren  Beatty knows how to direct other actors into sweeping, moving performances. As Louise Bryant, Keaton offered the odd duality of social rebel and devoted lover and wife.  Keaton was unfairly locked out of the Oscar because of the Academy's relentless umbilical cord relationship with Kate Hepburn who won for playing a geriatric in "On Golden Pond."

<P>4(A) <STRONG>Keaton in "Looking For Mr. Goodbar," "Annie Hall," and  "Marvin's Room" </STRONG><P>

<LI> 	<STRONG>Geena Davis in "Thelma and Louise" </STRONG> -  For her ferocious performance as a housewife turned into a gun-totting fugitive from the law, Geena Davis soared into the rarefied aeries of classic screendom. Why not Sarandon here? Simple. She was the chick with the "arc." It was her character that changed the more dramatically and, I might add, convincingly. - Oscar nomination

<P>5(A) <STRONG>Davis in "The Accidental Tourist" </STRONG> - Oscar winner<P>

<LI> 	<STRONG>Faye Dunaway in "Bonnie and Clyde" </STRONG> - Not since Vivien Leigh landed that part in GWTW has there been a more obvious, or more successful, star-creating vehicle. As Bonnie Parker, the sexually frustrated depression-era bank robber, Dunaway was sexy and brazenly dangerous at the same time

<P>6(A)- <STRONG>Dunaway in "Network" </STRONG><P>

<P>
     
Looking forward to your comments and disagreements. Send me Your ten best performances list at..........   And we'll compile a listener chart!
<p>

<OL>
<LI> <B><font size=+1> Morgan Freeman- Street Smart</font> </B>
<p>
Probably the least seen performance on the list, and maybe the most unexpected.  It is one of those rare beings, a perfect pearl in a banged-up, crusty clam.  In the lead role of an unethical reporter, Christopher Reeve gave an almost laughable performance.  But as the pimp Fast Black, Reeve's antagonist, Freeman soared.  Never has uneducated cool menace been so forcefully played on screen.   It is a difficult piece: How does one create a character that is supposed to scare an audience senseless yet come across as sufficiently seductive and charming that he might control women to the degree Fast Black does. It's a mystery to me. I guess that's why Freeman is the actor and I'm the writer.<p>

<b>Best scene</b>:  Fast Black threatening to blind the prostitute played by Kathy Baker.
<p>
<u>And  for that Matter:</u>
<p>
Morgan Freeman in "Glory," "The Shawshank Redemption" Eric Roberts in  "Star 80,"   James Woods in "Casino,"  Harvey Keitel in "Taxi Driver," Ben Gazzarra in "St. Jack"<p>

<br><br>

<LI> <b><font size=+1>Robert  DeNiro- Raging Bull</font></b>
<p>
Textbook great acting. Every portrayal of a boxer will be judged against this one. Every performance of a lost soul - of  a wife abuser - of a man losing control of his life- as well. De Niro's prep for his portrayal of Jake La Motta is now the meat of legends (his weight gain, his training), and it shows.  You can judge a great performance by monitoring if you can clearly imagine a character continuing on even after a scene has ended.  It's a rare feat, but De  Niro achieves it.<p>
<p>
<b>Best  Scene</b> -  Jake slowly going nuts when he begins to think that his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) might be keeping his wife's infidelities from him.
<p>
<u>And for that matter:</u>
<p>
De Niro in "The Godfather II,"  "The Deer Hunter,"  "Taxi Driver," "The King of Comedy"
Sylvester Stallone in "Rocky,"  Kirk Douglas in "Champion," Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront."
<p>

<br><br>

<LI>  <b><font size=+1>Gregory Peck- To Kill a Mockingbird</font></b>
<p>
There has never been as essentially a dignified performance as this. As Atticus Finch,  Peck was the embodiment of dignity and respect without once teetering into self righteousness.  There is a sense of good in the world after watching "mockingbird" and it all stems from this Oscar-winning performance.<p>
<p>
Best Scene : The courtroom
<p>
<u>And for that matter:</u>
<p>
Gregory peck in "Gentleman's Agreement"
Paul Newman in "The Verdict,"  James Stewart in "Anatomy of a Murder"
<p>
<br><br>

<LI> <b><font size=+1>Steve Martin- All of Me</font></b>
<p>
Think about  it. Martin has to play a man half possesed by a woman. But not any woman.  Lily Tomlin.  It  may be the greatest and most intelligent slapstick of the sound era, a film and performance that could have teetered over-the-top into Monty Python-ville, but which Martin kept on the ground with his remarkable restraint.  The performance becomes so effective that you really do believe that is Lily up there on the screen.
<p>
<b>Best Scene</b> -  The courtroom.
<p>
<u>And for that matter:</u>
<p>
Steve Martin in  "Parenthood"
<p>
Jack Lemmon in "Some Like it Hot,"  Dustin Hoffman in "Tootsie"
<p>
<br><br>

<LI>  <font size=+1><b>Martin Landau- Crimes and Misdemeanors</b></font>
<p>
The greatest  Doestevskian performance in the history of movies. As an optamologist who plots to have his mistress killed, Landau gives a performance of such tragic resonance that   you  worry for the physical health of the actor himself.<p>
<p>
<b>Best Scene</b>  -   When Landau learns about the death of Anjelica Huston
<p>
<u>And for that matter:</u>
<p>
Martin Landau in "Ed Wood" and  "Tucker: A Man and his Dream"
<p>
<br><br>

<LI>  <b><font size=+1>Robert Shaw- The Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three</font></b>
<p>
Robert Shaw, Okay. But in "the Taking of..." C'mon, ya gotta be kidding me. Nope. Not at all. I don't believe any  heist cum hostage film has ever provided this much tension. Most of that is a direct result of Shaw's assured and controlled performance.  He brings an elegance and tick-tick excitement that would have been overblown and hyper with, say, Pacino in the role of  the leader of a group of criminals who take over a subway car in Manhattan
<p>
<b>BEST SCENE</b> - Shaw's confrontation with Walter Matthau
<p>
<u>And for that matter:</u>
<p>
Robert Shaw in. "Jaws" and "A Man for All Seasons."
Al Pacino in "Dog Day Afternoon,"  Dustin Hoffman in "Straw Dogs,"  Michael Madsen in "Reservoir Dogs" 
<p>
<br><br>

<LI>  <b><font size=+1>Elliott Gould- The Long Goodbye</font></b>
<p>
Many people, critics in particular, regard this as Robert Altman's actual bona-fide masterpiece. If that's the case ( I happen to think that it is), than  Altman should erect a statue of reverence to Gould, who largely improvised his performance as the great detective Marlowe.  His casual, shuffling style,   slowly sucking us into his character's brain, was like great Brando without the pretension. 
<p>
BEST SCENE- Getting cat food
<p>

Call him whatever you wish, but KMPC's Bob Heckler believes everyone is
entitled to his or her opinion. His aptly-suited last name could be
described as the theme of his conservative talk show on weekdays from
9 a.m. to Noon.  His intensity on the radio seems to bring out the
most in his listeners and callers, and serves to fire himself up.

<P>
 Bob spent a short time in the Navy before getting into the business world.
 Heckler's Loew Chemical Company was his first successful venture. That, in
 turn, allowed him to finance various other businesses, such as founding <I>Lighting Dimensions magazine</I> a
 trade magazine for TV, motion picture and theatrical lighting designers, a chemical manufacturing
  business, and a flight school where he piloted planes
 and helicopters. Bob also was President and CEO of the National Ticket
 Network/The Ticket Channel, a cable television network that was later
 sold to the Home Shopping Network.

<P>
 Bob began his radio career in Denver, where his passionate style of talk
 made him a fixture in the city's radio market. He had been conducting
 business seminars on how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act,
 when he was asked to appear on a financial radio program on KNUS-AM in
 Denver. His self-professed "mike fright" on the initial broadcast 
turned out
 to be not as bad as he believed. Afterwards, he was asked to do fill in on
 various shifts, and eventually was given a permanent evening time slot.

<P>
 His radio life began at KNUS-AM 710, airing the evening shift for Mile
 High Broadcasting in Denver. He later worked at Salem broadcasting at KRKS
 94.7 FM in Denver, as the host of the only secular talk show on Christian
 radio.  In August of 1995, he moved to
 KABC Talkradio in Los Angeles and, on January 22, 1996, he moved to 
 its sister station, KMPC.
 Bob has one saying to callers who are unable
 to accept his views and opinions: "Deal with it!"

<P>
 Bob has one son and a Welsh Corgi dog, and looks forward to  
 flying helicopters and airplanes in the skies above Southern California.

	<P>Burt Katz, a man whose name is synonymous with the legal profession, is a retired 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge and cohost of the "Terrell and Katz Show" on 710 TALK / KMPC. <P>

	<P>Katz and his cohost, Leo Terrell, discuss current events and legal issues with the 
hope that they provide a better understanding of the legal system for their radio audience. The 
show promises to be anything but low key, as Katz's conservative views often conflict with 
Terrell's liberal perspective.<P>

as a prosecutor, defense attorney, judge, witness, teacher and even as a victim of crime. He also 
 served as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for 14 years. During

one of the chief prosecutors in the Charles Manson family murders involving the slayings of Gary Hinman 
and Donald "Shorty" Shea.<P> 

	<P>Judge Katz served on the Los Angeles Municipal and Superior Courts for nearly nine years, 
presiding over many controversial and celebrated cases including the strangulation killing of 
actress, Dominque Dunne. Katz has supervised and presided over Juvenile Courts, working closely 
with delinquent children, juvenile judges and child welfare experts.	In additon, Burt has 
served as "Legal Liaison Aide" for the District Attorney of Los Angeles County and was the 
Director of the District Attorney's "Less Lethal Weapons Task Force" in which fifty police 
agencies participated.<P>

	<P>He has taught criminal law and justice, trial advocacy and crime scene investigation at 
law schools, police academies and the California Specialized Training Institute. He has also been 
a consultant to Gavin de Becker, who has developed "Mosaic 5" the pre-incident indicators of 
predictable violence for stalkers. He has also been an instructor at the prestigious California 
Judges Association and C.J.E.R. (Continuing Education for Judges) Institute and lecturer on the 
law throughout the United States.<P>

	<P>Burt has given speeches regarding his legal experience as an attorney, judge and legal 
commentator. He has also been featured as legal expert and commentator on Larry King Live, 
Rivera Live, The Charles Grodin Show, BBC, Canadian Broadcast System, Fox, 
E! Entertainment, Good Morning America, Today Show, America's Talking, Day and Date and various 
Los Angeles TV news programs. During the Simpson Trial, he wrote a weekly column for theMalibu 
Times newspaper titled O.J. Update.<P>

	<P>In addition to being a commentator and broadcaster - Katz is a writer. Over the past 
eight years, he has written about the criminal justice system including a screen play which was 
nominated for the prestigious Diane Thomas Award, a mini-series, and a play which will be 
produced and performed later this year. Currently, Burt is writing a book which is a searing 
analysis of the criminal justice system titled, "May The Judge Approach The People" (What's 
Wrong With The Criminal Justice System). The book will be published early 1997 by Time-Warner 
Books.<P>

<TR><TD>
<B>Here are my predictions of the order in which the summer films will play 
themselves out:</B>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
1.  <B>INDEPENDENCE DAY:</B>  Roland Emmerich is about a month away from becoming the biggest foreign 
director in the world.   "ID4" will not only be the biggest hit of the summer, but it has a shot 
at being the most successful film in history.  It combines the key elements of three 
supersmashes:  "Jurassic Park," "Star Wars," and "The Towering Inferno/Earthquake."
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
2.  <B>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</B>  The star power (read: Tom Cruise) and sheer number of screens (almost 
4000) will assure this rather mediocre film's rise to the (near) top.  However, look for bad 
word of mouth on the meandering and incomprehensible plot to devastate the film's second week 
box office take.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
3.  <B>THE ROCK:</B>  An Oscar Winner in an action film.  Has it ever been done?  Not since Gene 
Hackman in "The Poseidon Adventure" filmgoers can attend this one guilt-free due to the presence 
of Nick Cage.  Killer trailer.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
4.  <B>TWISTER:</B>  The huge opening weekend number was due more to the fact that the only competition 
was a Janeane Garafalo film than anything else.  It will end up with "Speed"-like numbers.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
5.  <B>ESCAPE FROM L.A.:</B>  What one must factor in the millions and millions who became HUGE fans 
of "Escape from New York" via the video.  Kurt Russell's stock as an  action star has risen 
considerably after "Stargate" and "Executive Decision."
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
6.  <B>THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:</B>  Why is a Disney animated feature NOT number one?  The subject 
matter for one.  What's next, Mickey Mouse as Oskar Schindler?  Care to guess which film wins 
the best song Oscar this year?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
7.  <B>THE NUTTY PROFESSOR:</B>  Eddie Murphy had to look back to an old master to return to his glory 
days.  If this one doesn't work, well...... "I'll take Eddie in the center square to block."
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
8.  <B>A TIME TO KILL:</B>  Okay, you combine Grisham with the hottest actress in Hollywood (Sandra 
Bullock) and is there even the slightest chance that it won't hit.  Look for "Client"-style 
numbers on this one.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
9.  <B>THE CABLE GUY:</B>  It's Jim Carey, so there is a certain built-in audience, like it or not.  
But will they come to see this very, very dark film more than once.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
10.  <B>ERASER:</B>  It will be a hit, but will not recoup it's money in the United States.  Hey, 
Arnold is the one who bombed as an "Action Hero" and as a "Junior."
</TD></TR>

<IMG SRC="me.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>The all-new Mercedes-Benz E-class cars, on the market for a bit more than a
year, have succeeded in capturing the imagination of car-lovers worldwide. With
a front-end style at once completely modern and at the same time a throwback to
the most classic-looking Mercedes models of the 1930s, the E-class, which
includes the 320 and 420 models, are being judged by experts as some of the
finest cars made...ever.<P>

<P>Especially the E420.<P>

<P>I have spent a week at a time in both cars, and there's no doubt that the E320
is a solid, taut and fully Germanic automobile. Four-wheel anti-lock disc
brakes, traction control (called Automatic Slip Reduction on M-B autos) and a
classic front-engine, rear-drive layout provide most all that a real sedan-lover
could ask for in a modern-day auto.<P>

<P>The E-class also comes with frontal driver, passenger AND side airbags (built
into the front doors). So the Mercedes tradition of providing more safety than
you'll probably ever need continues with both of the E-class cars. In fact, it
has been said through the years with more than a kernel of truth that if you get
killed in a Mercedes-Benz, it was probably your own fault.<P>

<P>The 320 car comes with an inline 6 cylinder engine that is a high-on-torque
powerhouse which gets you off the line quickly but takes bit longer than you
might like to get up and running at freeways speeds. Remember, all that tautness
in M-B vehicles is in large part due to the basic heavy weight of the
Mercedes...if there is such a thing as an "overbuilt" car, it is any Mercedes
four-door sedan.<P>

<P>But if it is power which you demand, then don't bother with the $45,000 or so
E320...add a few grand more to the price and get yourself the E420, the same
basic car (with the same beautiful lines) as the E320...but with a 4.2 liter V8
engine.<P>

<P>The engine is as smooth and quiet as absolutely any engine sold by any other car
company in the world. Mated with a five-speed (yes, FIVE-speed) automatic
transmission the driver can control via a nifty center-mounted gated lever, the
drivetrain is every bit as confidence-inspiring as that found in the
now-legendary Lexus LS400...except the Mercedes has a bigger engine, and the
Mercedes is simply a more solid-feeling car (due again, basically, to that heavy
weight).<P>

<P>The E420 also gets appropriately beefed-up in the suspension, braking and
steering department. M-B engineers were not going to let the powerful
V8-equipped out of the stable without the right "teaks" to allow the driver to
handle all that power without the proper total equipment package underneath him
or her.<P>

<P>Here's how much I think of the E420: I drive at least one brand-new car every
week for hundreds of miles, and my girlfriend Carey gets to hear (whether she
wants to or not) what I think about them. And I drive them all...from the basic
Hyundai to the $360,000 Bentley Continental T.<P>

<P>After driving the M-B E420 for two days, I drove over to Carey's and announced,
"I think I may have found the perfect car for me".<P>

<P>That says a lot.<P>

<P>I don't like a very big car...but I do like a sedan which can seat four
comfortably, five in a pinch. I like a lot of trunk room. I like all the modern
conveniences and the latest safety devices. I like to feel very connected to the
road. I like a responsive car which jumps when and where I tell it to. I like
rear drive, though with a lot of today's modern front-wheel drive cars, most
people can't really tell the difference. I like a car with a stiffer suspension
than most Americans prefer, also.<P>

<P>The Mercedes fills almost all my likes (including a front-seat cupholder which
is a prime example of what can happen when you give a German engineer too much
time and money)...this is that very rare car about which I have virtually no
complaints.<P>

<P>Sure, the "winter/summer" transmission switch which chooses whether or not the
car will start out in first or second gear (first in summer, second in winter
for added traction) is too close to the power window buttons, the gas filler
door can not be controlled independent of the car's central locking mechanism
and visibility out the windshield is obscured a bit by too-thick A-pillars...but
don't sweat the small stuff.<P>

<P>The positives of the E-class cars, especially the E420, outweigh any negatives
so strongly that complaining at all seems to be nit-picking.<P>

<P>Mercedes-Benz is now starting to "ramp up" for production of their all-new AAV
sport/utility vehicle at a brand-new plant in Vance, Alabama. Thus, Mercedes
joins BMW in building cars and trucks in the USA (BMW is located in Greer, South
Carolina...that's where they are building the little Z3 sports car).<P>

<P>What other German company once built cars in America? Volkswagen...they built
their Rabbit model at a plant in western Pennsylvania...until slow sales and
poor quality forced them to close that factory about a decade ago.<P>

<P>I mentioned all the positives of the E420...but left out one big negative:
Price. You'll have to cough up around $60,000 or so to bring one of these babies
home...but if you have the green stuff (or can swing a lease deal), you can be
confident you're driving one of the best cars built today.<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="ft"><B>1997 FORD TAURUS</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="ft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>One of the most highly-awaited cars of recent times has turned out to be, well,
something of a sales dud.<P>

<P>The all-new Taurus from Ford has not been selling anywhere near the huge
company's expectations, and you don't have to look much farther than the Taurus'
sheetmetal to see what at least one of the problems is.<P>

<P>The car is simply too highly-styled for the average man and women the car is
aimed at. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that Ford made at least some
use of their new partners at Mazda (Ford controls Japan's Mazda these days) in
designing this car; many critics think this tenth-anniversary Taurus looks more
like a pumped-up Mazda RX-7  than anything else.<P>

<P>Ovoid this, round that, not a square shape or hard angle in sight on this car.<P>

<P>And the American public responded to all this by staying away from the Taurus in
droves. In fact, as of this writing, Ford is offering incentives of up to $1500
on retail Taurus sales...something which would have been thought unheard of just
two years ago...and the Honda Accord has recently passed-up Taurus as the
best-selling car in America.<P>

<P>It's a shame, because Taurus is a very good car. But it has that pesky styling
problem, and it is pricey. A Chevrolet Lumina with more interior room and a more
powerful engine (and more traditional, conservative "American-type" styling) can
be had for up to...get this...$3000 less than a top-line Taurus.<P>

<P>With competitive cars like the Lumina, Camry and Accord on the market, Ford
could not afford to make any mistakes whatsoever with their Taurus. However, by
putting this "far out" sheetmetal on top of a very reliable, dependable and
proven auto...traditionally one of the nation's best-sellers...a lot of industry
analysts think they ruined the car for the average American.<P>

<P>But you have to respect them for coming out with a car which takes to the limit
the rounded "jelly bean" concept of the original Taurus, a concept developed by
Ford designer Jack Telnack, and a concept which has worked not only for the
Taurus but for the entire industry for the better part of the last decade.<P>

<P>It appears Ford had too much confidence in this style, though. That rounded look
is considered old and tired by a lot of new-car buyers, and in fact Toyota is
telling the press that they expect to take a lot of potential Taurus buyers away
from Ford with their all-new 1997 Camry...a car which purposely utilizes more
sharp-edged lines than rounded ones.<P>

<P>The same thing happened...virtually overnight...with hatchbacks in this country.
Hatchbacks were all the rage throughout the 1970s and into the mid-1980s...then
one day sales stopped as surely as someone had turned a switch "off".<P>

<P>You can't explain it....the best which the automotive product planners in the
world can do is try and predict what the public will want a few years from now.
When this all-new Taurus was designed, probably in 1992, the "jelly bean" style
was still all the rage. But those days of public acceptance and approval seem
gone, and with them Ford's very high hopes for Taurus.<P>

<P>A solid front-wheel drive powerplant and drivetrain, safe and reliable
operation, enough power to cruise (if not race) in-town and on long highway
trips in comfort and security, solid fuel mileage figures and a near
emissions-less V6, tens of millions of advertising and marketing dollars to
back-up the product in the marketplace...so what went wrong?<P>

<P>The all-new Taurus, if nothing else, is a prime example of how incorrectly
gauging the public's changing tastes can result in a corporate defeat.<P>

<P>Sales of the Taurus do not look all that bad on paper...but way too many of them
are being sold to corporate fleets and daily rental companies. And these are not
the markets which pay the high retail prices that turn a car into a true
"success".<P>

<P>Ford no doubt wanted this Taurus to wind up in college and industry textbooks
for more than a few reasons...but poor sales sure wasn't one of them!<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="cc"><B>1997 CADILLAC CATERA</B></A></CENTER>
<IMG SRC="cc.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>The big question about the Cadillac Catera is, simply: Why?<P>

<P>Cadillac has to lower the average age of their buyers; there's no doubt about 
that. But Cadillac has spent almost the past decade convincing us that their 
Northstar System, a sophisticated 4.6 liter dual overhead cam V8 front-wheel 
drive system, putting out as much as 300 horsepower and then some, is about 
the best powertrain on the planet. And you know what? They're right.<P>

<P>So, why, oh why, oh why, would Cadillac, in attempting to bring in new, 
younger buyers to their showrooms, come out with a V6-powered rear wheel 
drive car?<P>

<P>The answer: Costs. The Cadillac Catera is nothing more than a re-worked 
version of car which has been for sale for some time in Europe, a car called 
the Opel Omega. The Omega is a very nice car, no doubt about that. But is it 
the car which Cadillac should be trying to sell to American Yuppies?<P>

<P>By using the Omega as the basis for their new car, Cadillac has been able to 
avoid some of the huge costs involved with developing a true "all-new" 
automobile. As an example, Ford admitted publicly that their Contour, which 
is sold in Europe as the Mondeo, cost the company more than $6 Billion 
dollars to bring to the market. Yes, $6 *B*illion.<P>

<P>Catera handling is sportier and the suspension stiffer than traditional 
Cadillacs, another remnant of the car's very direct European heritage.<P>

<P>The Catera is a pretty good-looking four-door sedan which some of you might 
think looks a bit too suspiciously like a Nissan Maxima on steroids. The V6 
powerplant displaces 3 liters and produces 200 horsepower; not bad for a rear 
drive car with a stick shift, but the Catera will be available only with a 
four-speed automatic. And the car weighs in at well over 3500 pounds. So that 
is NOT a lot of power for this car.<P>

<P>The interior and exterior fit and finish on Catera appears to be world-class 
and then some, something Cadillac should be proud of and talk about...a lot.<P>

<P>Is the car worth as much as $36,000, which is what it will cost 
fully-equipped? Probably not...there are simply better cars for the money 
on-sale in America. Catera prices will start at just over $30,000.<P>

<P>One also must wonder about Cadillac bringing out an entry-level car (for 
them, at least) with the name Catera. Remember the Cimarron, the last Caddy 
entry-level attempt? <P>

<P>The car was an unmitigated disaster, and I think Cadillac marketing people 
must have been off the day the company got General Motors to approve the 
name. It's just too similar to Cimarron, and I guarantee that you'll be 
seeing the similarity talked about (and joked about) in all the enthusiast 
magazines.<P>

<P>Cadillac produces some of the best cars in the world...all of them featuring 
the front-wheel drive Northstar V8 power system. The Catera does not have 
that system, though it sports a pretty good drivetrain of its own, with 
electronic traction control and anti-lock brakes as standard equipment.<P>

<P>Whether this will be enough to allow Cadillac to capture buyers in the 
all-important "near-luxury" market remains to be seen. The Cadillac name 
itself can still bring a lot of people into their showrooms; whether or not 
this car will bring in people under 50 years of age is something other 
automakers will watching very closely.<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="fe"><B>1997 FORD EXPEDITION</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="fe.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>Ford has finally done it...and in a big, seemingly successful way.<P>

<P>After years of allowing General Motors truck and Chevrolet to virtually 
dominate alone the full-sized sport/utility market in this country with their 
Tahoe, Yukon and Suburban vehicles, Ford has bowed to market pressures and 
brought out their Expedition...the company's very first full-sized four-door 
sport/utility vehicle.<P>

<P>If this is all a bit confusing, look at it this weay: The incredibly popular 
Ford Explorer is built on the same platform as the small Ranger pick-up; the 
Blazer and Jimmy from GM and Chevrolet are built on the same platform as the 
S-10 and S-15 small pick-ups.<P>

<P>Now, go up a step: The Yukon and Tahoe and Suburban (which is also known as 
the National Truck Of Texas, so well does it sell there) are built on the 
full-sized pickup platforms, what is known in the business as the C and K 
platforms.<P>

<P>Got that so far?<P>

<P>Okay...now the full-sized Ford pickup is built on the F-series platform. And 
that is the same platform on which the Expedition is built.<P>

And as popular as the all-new F-series has been, so, I precict, will be the 
Expedition. In fact, Ford has already boasted, practically before the first 
retail Expedition has left the showroom floor, that the company will sell 
140,000 of these all-new trucks in the first model year alone.<P>

<P>A lot of those buyers will be folks who do not want to wait the 2-3 months 
which it now takes to get a GM or Chevy sport/utility. And many of the buyers 
will be diehard Ford fans who simply could not bear the thought of driving 
one of The General's vehicles...no matter how good it is.<P>

<P>Ford has been controlling the overall light truck market for some years in 
America. The company sells more than *1,200* Explorers every DAY...and sales 
of their full-sized pickups are currently more than *200,000* ahead of Chevy 
and GMC for the 1996 model year.<P>

<P>How did they do this? They planned ahead. Somehow, the product planners at 
Ford saw the current truck boom coming as much as 10 years ago, and they 
planned for the tooling and the factories they would need to meet the demand. 
Ford simply beat GM on this one, fair and sqaure.<P>

<P>On the other hand, GM has only one plant in America which still builds 
rear-wheel drive cars, and that is in Arlington, TX. After January, 1997, 
that plant will no longer build the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster or 
Cadillac Fleetwood...all those cars will be discontinued. Instead, the huge 
plant will be dedicated to building...you guessed it...trucks. It's something 
GM probably should have done 5 years ago...and they know they are sacrificing 
at last 40,000 sales of Caprices to police departments every year, but 
change-over the plant to trucks-only they are doing none the less. (And a lot 
of those lost police sales will be made up by the Ford Crown Victoria, the 
last full-sized rear-drive car made in America after the end of this year).<P>

<P>Now, the discussion about whether or not GM could build trucks AND cars at 
that plant is another story entirely...I hav been to enough plants in Japan 
where trucks, vans, cars and even station wagons are built by the same 
workers on the same line...but the United Auto Workers in this country want 
to make a LOT more money to do that kind of work. And they probably should.<P>

<P>But back to our vehicle at hand, the Ford Expedition. It comes, surprisingly 
and distressingly, with the 4.6 liter V8 overhead cam engine. I say 
distressingly, because this is the heart of the vehicle and it also may be 
its weakest point. Overhead cam engines make their torque and horsepower at 
the higher end of the rpm (engine speed) range; pushrod, or overhead valve 
engines, make more torque, or pulling power, at the lower end of the rpm 
range. <P>

<P>For instance, diesel engines make almost ALL their torque at VERY low engine 
rpm's, or engine speeds. That's why diesels are used to power over-the-road 
long-haul trucks.<P>

<P>Ford considered using the 5 liter V8 found in the older Mustang (and the 
newer Explorer), a pushrod engine, for the Expedition (and for the F-series 
pickup). But the engine could not pass fuel and emissions standards now and 
in the future as easily as the more sophisticated 4.6 liter overhead cam 
powerplant.<P>

<P>So while on paper the two versions of the 4.6 liter engine offered do have 
the necessary pulling torque, in real-world usage it does not feel as strong 
as I would like for a truck of this size and weight (almost 5000 pounds...and 
with a full load of 8 passengers (with an optional third rear seat) and 
baggage, that weight figure could easily be much higher).<P>

<P>In fact, the pushrod V6 engines found in smaller GM and Chevy trucks produce 
almost the same horsepower and torque as the larger and more expensive Ford 
V8 engines found in their new trucks.<P>

<P>Fit and finish in the Expedition is nothing short of wonderful; once the 
vehicle is up and running at freeway speeds (which can take some time) it 
feels like a luxury car. It's quiet, smooth and purposeful. Plus, it's 
good-looking, with the same really nifty front-end design found on the 
F-series full-sized pickup.<P>

<P>Expedition is available with a variety of trailering and four-wheel drive 
packages as you might image. The cost for all this luxury and power (though 
we wish there were MORE power): Prices range from about $28,000 to just over 
$38,000...equitable with similar GM truck and Chevrolet vehicles.<P>

<P>Is Expedition worth it? Probably. Finally, Ford has a vehicle which can 
match, feature for feature, the proven and excellent full-sized 
sport/utilties from Chevy and GM truck. <P>

<P>If they'd add a bit more low-end torque tot hate engine, I'd be a true 
believer. And, if Dodge would ever come out with a full-sized sport/utility 
based on their popular Ram truck, we'd have a great selection of three big 
sport/utes in this country instead of just two very good ones. But 
wait...Dodge WILL be coming out with an all-new sport/ute based on their new 
mid-sized Dakota...but more on that later!<P>

<P>The truckin' hits keep on coming!<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="in"><B>1997 INFINITI Q45</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="in.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>
They've shrunk the car, lowered the horsepower, done away with a suspension 
system like no other in the world...and they still want to charge more than 
$50,000 for it. Is this any way to run an automotive luxury division?<P>

<P>Infiniti, the luxury sales arm of Nissan, has always had its work cut out for 
itself in this country. Infiniti has always been seen as nothing more than an 
"answer" to Lexus and Acura, and that is unfortunate, because Infiniti offers 
some very good cars for some reasonably good prices.<P>

<P>For 1997, Infiniti offers an all-new version of their Q45 model, the car 
which has always been the flagship luxury sedan of the Infiniti division.<P> 

<P>The Q45 has been, up until now, something of a technological tour de force 
for Infiniti, being the only production car in the world to feature a 
full-active suspension system, an innovative and modern suspension system 
which was originally developed for Formula One racing cars. Only the 
engineers at Nissan/Infiniti took the chance to translate this 
racing-oriented suspension system into one for a mass-produced luxury sedan.<P>

<P>But for the 1997 model year, Infiniti has sadly discontinued the availability 
of the full-active suspension option, and for several reasons. The main 
explanation which Infiniti would like to have us all believe is behind their 
decision to drop the full-active suspension option is simply that enough 
people did not order it on their Q45's in the past. And indeed, in past 
years, only about 15% of Q45 buyers in America have spent the almost $5000 
extra for the full-active option. However, in Japan, where the buying public 
seems as enamored as ever by hi-tech gadgets, fully 80% of Q45 model buyers 
opt for the expensive full-active option.<P>

<P>Another reason for the discontinuation of the full-active option on 
American-market Q's, and perhaps the most important element behind Nissan's 
decision, is that, in order to satisfy the advanced on-board diagnostic 
systems mandated by Federal law to be on all 1997 cars, it was simply going 
to cost Nissan/Infiniti a prohibitive amount per full-active-equipped car.<P>

<P>I've had the opportunity to drive Q45a models (the 'a' denoting a car 
equipped with the full-active system) and it is an amazing experience. The 
car's front end will not lift no matter how hard you accelerate, and will not 
dive even under the most powerful braking. Going into a corner at high 
speeds, in a situation which would have any other two-ton luxury sedan 
rolling on its axis from side to side, is an experience in rock-hard 
stability. The Q45a models were revelations of what a modern-day four-door 
high-powered sedan is capable of with the latest equipment. But Infiniti, in 
doing away with the full-active option, makes a used Q45a possibly the best 
buy in the marketplace today...and that could prove a boon to the smart, 
sophisticated and aware used car buyer.<P>

<P>The Lexus LS400 sedan, built by Toyota, was the first true V8-powered luxury 
sedan to come out of Japan for the US market, and it was an immediate hit. 
Nissan had Q45 models ready for road-testing by American car magazines at the 
same time they tested the Lexus model, but for some reason they made the 
decision to wait with the Q45, and give it to magazines several months after 
they had completed their initial, glowing tests of the LS400. What this meant 
was that from the very start, the Infiniti was always perceived as an 
upstart, Johnny-come-lately answer by Nissan to Toyota's Lexus, but nothing 
could have been further from the truth. However, Nissan's decision to wait 
branded the Infiniti line in general and the Q45 in particular as "too 
little, too late". <P> 

<P>But the "Q" was appreciated by those "in the know", the driver looking for 
more of an intimate experience with their car. If the Lexus was truly a 
Japanese version of the staid, conservative, ultra-reliable and safe 
Mercedes-Benz, then truly the Infiniti became quickly known as the "Japanese 
BMW", a sedan aimed not at the average driver, but at the sporting driver 
looking for some fun in the mix.<P>

<P>The Q's styling was innovative and unique. The first few years the car had no 
front grille, and indeed did not need one...cooling air was sucked into the 
engine bay from below the car, not in front. However, the car now sports a 
classic, traditional-looking front grille, due to customer demand more than 
anything else. Infiniti stylists went along with public focus groups which, 
evidently, wanted the car to look more like Jaguar than an Infiniti.<P>

<P>This year the Q has all-new body panels and the car is smaller and lighter 
than it has been in the past. However, Infiniti engineers have done some 
magic by creating more room than ever before for rear seat passengers, in 
spite of the car's smaller overall size (and a weight of just under 4000 
pounds).<P>

<P>The interior of the Q, the quality of fit and finish and the comfort levels, 
as well as the levels of "NVH" (noise, vibration and harshness) remain 
world-class and much what you would expect from a car with a base price of 
near $50,000.<P>

<P>A lot of the Q's original magic, apart from the somewhat daring styling and 
the availability of the full-active suspension, was in the engine.<P>

<P>A 4.5 liter 32-valve V8 which produced more than 300 horsepower (though the 
company would never publicly admit to that figure, as Japanese car-makers 
have sort of a "gentlemen's agreement" to keep horsepower below the 300 
mark), the roaring powerplant could propel the car to freeway speeds in 
surprisingly little time. Smooth and docile in town, the Q's engine could 
turn into a screaming wildcat at the touch of the right foot to the throttle 
pedal.<P>

<P>So what has Infiniti done with the 1997 model? They have lowered the engine 
displacement (size) and its horsepower rating as well. The engine is now a 
4.1 liter unit, though it is still a sophisticated 32-valve dual over head 
cam-equipped motor, and produced, according to Infiniti, about 266 horses. 
While reducing the weight and size of the car has helped the Q keep some of 
that original "off the line" feeling it was known for in certain enthusiast 
circles, the car is still almost a full second slower in 0-60 times with this 
all-new model.<P>

<P>Using the 4.1 litere V8 made things easier on the pocketbook for Nissan. The 
4.5 was used only in the Q, out of all the aNissan offered worldwide, but the 
4.1 is used in the Q and other Nissan models. That makes it less expensive 
for Nissan by allowing them share the 4.1 in several different vehicles.<P>

<P>Also, a racing version of the 4.1 liter V8 will be seen on the track during 
the Indy 500 next year.<P>

<P>So what have they done to the Q45? It appears an exorcism of sorts was 
performed...the Nissan/Infiniti engineers and stylists managed to keep the 
shell and some of the spirit of the original car, but by going to a smaller, 
less powerful engine and deleting the full-active suspension option, they 
have just about taken the devil, or almost all of the fun, out of this car.<P>

<P>Rather than stand apart from the crowd, as it has for years, the 1997 
Infiniti Q45 becomes just another ho-hum yawner of a $50,000+ sedan. Where, 
indeed, is the beef?

<CENTER><A NAME="ja"><B>1997 JAGUAR XK8</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="ja.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>

<P>Jaguar has a challenge on their hands, no doubt about that. After decades of 
building exceptionally pretty cars with a reputation for poor reliability, 
the car company has realized that tradition and history alone are no longer 
enough to get people, Americans especially, to buy their motor cars.<P>

<P>With their all-new XK8 coupe and convertible, with a DOHC V8 engine and 
modern conveniences Jaguar could not have dreamed of even ten years ago, the 
car has the looks and pedigree to change Jaguar's image 180 degrees in the 
United States. The company has a lot riding on this car's success...but can 
they pull it off? Have the Jaguar's problems, especially the electrical ones, 
been solved?<P>

<P>Not that Jaguar has not been capable at times of building dependable cars. 
During the 1950s and '60s, the company built some of the world's greatest 
road racing cars, and many race car builders in Europe would specify that 
Jaguar engines only be used in their racing vehicles. However, their street 
cars never seemed able to reach the level of quality for which their race 
cars were known.<P>

<P>The XK road car series of the 1950s certainly captured the imagination of 
car-lovers worldwide. Elegant and classy-looking, with interiors suggesting 
the best "clubby" atmosphere of a British collegiate society, the XK cars 
looked great but were at best quirky in their performance.<P>

<P>The same was true of the beautiful XK-E series, introduced in the 1960s and 
considered today still as some of the most gorgeous cars ever designed. With 
straight-6 engines or powerful V12 powerplants, the XK-E cars looked fast 
standing still...and unfortunately too much of the time that's all they did. 
In fact, though the XK-E cars' popularity essentially saved Jaguar from going 
out of business (myth has it that Elves and Leprechauns helped design the car 
to save the company) the company continued to develop a reputation for cars 
which spent more time in the shop than on the road.
<P>

<P>Things did not get much better with the newer-generation XJ series of cars, 
including the XJ-6, XJ-12 and XJ-S and -R motor cars. Some of the 
best-looking cars on the road, they nonetheless had, compared to other cars 
of the 1980s and '90s, terrible quality.<P>

<P>This in spite of the fact that Ford Motor Company paid more than $2.5 billion 
for Jaguar and took the company over as the decade of the '90s came upon us. 
In an attempt to both get involved with Jaguar and yet, at the same time, 
keep a "hands off" distance in order to respect Jaguar's heritage, Ford was 
sort of caught in the middle.<P>

<P>Quality has improved in the past few years, but for the most part not to the 
extent that I could recommend a new Jaguar purchase to anyone I considered a 
friend. Especially with the advent of the Japanese luxury cars and the 
lowered prices of BMW and Mercedes-Benz autos, Jaguar become less and less of 
a choice for car-buyers looking for dependability.<P>

<P>The heart of the Jaguar problem always seemed to revolve around their use of 
electronic components from a British company called Lucas, a company with 
such a poor reputation that their nickname is "Prince of Darkness". Why do 
the British drink warm beer? They have Lucas refrigerators. What are the 
three settings on a Lucas headlamp switch? Dim, flicker and off.<P>

<P>You get the idea.<P>

<P>Finally, Ford has done something about it.<P>

<P>The 1997 XK8, the first all-new Jaguar the company has built since Ford took 
over, is one the streets and early reports have the car to be nothing short 
of miraculous in terms of overall quality and dependability.<P>

<P>Powered by Jaguar's first-ever V8 engine, a dual overhead cam almost-300 
horsepower unit built in Wales, the XK8 contains all the modern 
conveniences...from dual airbags to anti-lock disc brakes to specific Pirelli 
tires for each corner of the car to traction control...and it's all 
electronically controlled by components made not by Lucas, but by one of 
Japan's best-known automotive electronic firms, Nippon Denso.<P>

<P>This is a big thing. English car companies and their suppliers are considered 
some of the last vestiges of the "Empire", and no one in the U.K. likes to 
admit that maybe their industry would be better off with some other suppliers 
from some other countries. So Ford went very much against the grain in 
choosing a Japanese company to supply the XK8's electronics, but they did 
what had to be done.<P>

<P>Available as a coupe or convertible (and the convertible top is a one-button 
unit which operates as easily as the legendary power top in the Mercedes SL 
models) the XK8 has captured the imagination of Jaguar-lovers worldwide, men 
and women who had given up on the car as a form of daily transport, yet still 
appreciate them as a direct link to European automotive history and as 
hand-built works of functional art.<P>

<P>The XK8 even has a wooden-spoked steering wheel...something impossible in 
modern cars as far as safety officials are concerned, if not for the driver's 
airbag. Other classic and welcome interior touches include generous dollops 
of wool carpeting, leather, chrome and burled walnut paneling.<P>

<P>This front-engine, rear-drive car has loads of torque, giving it the 
get-up-and-go a fairly heavy car needs on Southern California freeway 
on-ramps. It is quiet (perhaps too quiet...I'd like more of an exhaust note), 
exceptionally smooth at all speeds, handles and corners like a slightly 
overweight older road racer, and stops on a dime thanks to those four wheel 
anti-lock disc brakes and corner-specific tires.<P>

<P>And...the XK8 is as beautiful a car as Jaguar, or any car company, has ever 
offered to the public. In fact, some of the very same stylists and designers 
who worked on the now-legendary and collectible XK-E had more than a bit of 
input to the XK8. The front oval air intake on the XK8, for example, is taken 
almost directly from the original XK-E.<P>

<P>It's a new kind of Jaguar, dependable and reliable. And it is exactly what 
the company needs to bring to the American automotive marketplace. With 
Ford's help and Japanese electronics, the car appears to be a winner.<P>

<P>And let's face it...in 1997, and for prices hovering around the $75,000 mark, 
anything less than a completely dependable car would make Jaguar the 
laughingstock of the auto world. They simply can not afford for this car to 
have ANY problems.<P>

<P>Should you join John Travolta and Jay Leno as some of the first XK8 owners? 
My recommendation would be to wait for one year or so...let's first see if 
the car works as well on the road as it does on paper. <P>

<CENTER><A NAME="ch"><B>CHEVROLET S-SERIES THREE-DOOR PICKUP</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="ch.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>

<P>
By Steve Parker &#169; 1997
<P>
<P>For 1997 Chevrolet rocks the small pickup truck market with the only 
mini-truck available with not two, but three doors. The extended cab version 
of the S-series trucks are available with a third door on the driver's side 
of the truck, a door which allows passengers easy access to the rear area 
(and a fold-down third seat) as well as an easy way to get to stowed, locked 
and secured equipment. The third door can only be opened if the driver's door 
is open, for added safety.<P>

<P>Dodge, Ford and Chevrolet offer third-door models on their larger, full-size 
models for 1997. But only Chevy has it on the small truck for 1997, and that 
will pay off for them in extra sales, and they deserve it. Why the industry 
waited this long for a third door on pickups is beyond me, anyway. It's 
simply an idea which makes great and perfect sense.<P>

<P>There was a time when a pickup truck was the dependable workhorse of the 
American highway and the back roads as well. On the farm and off, the classic 
pickup truck was built to work and work hard, day in and day out, year in and 
year out. And it did it all very well indeed. Any job you asked of it, any 
challenge you threw at it, the American pickup, whether Ford, Chevy, GMC or 
Dodge, responded each and every time.<P>

<P>"Reliable" and "consistent" were the best words to describe these trucks. 
They would start, run and haul when you asked them to; nothing fancy about 
these rigs, just the basics, ma'am.<P>

<P>"Comfort" and "luxury" were words which traditionally had absolutely nothing 
to do with pickup trucks. But sometime in the 1970s, there was a sea change 
in the pickup, and it all started with the appearance of the mini-pickup, 
developed and sold first in America by Toyota and Datsun (the company we 
today call Nissan). <P>

<P>And those small pickup trucks, cute and manageable and useful (and as stingy 
with gas) as they were, were immediately seized upon by two groups which up 
until that time would have nothing to do with the time-proven and large 
American pickups: Women and teenagers.<P>

<P>Within just a few years after the imports' appearance, Chevrolet was selling 
a small pickup built by Isuzu (the L.U.V. truck, which stood for "light 
utility vehicle"), Ford was selling a truck built by Mazda and Dodge was 
selling a mini-truck built by Mitsubishi. Everyone was getting into the small 
truck act. Remember the Subaru B.R.A.T.? (That stood for Bi-drive 
Recreational All-Terrain vehicle, believe it or not).<P>

<P>And with pickup trucks now being viewed by the entire marketplace, not just 
working men, as a possible answer to personal transportation needs, the 
truck-makers decided to "gussie up" their little workhorses and make them, 
quite literally, as comfortable inside and as good-looking outside as almost 
any family car.<P>

<P>With the advent of the current model F-series Ford, C/K series Chevy and GMC 
trucks and the Ram from Dodge, the full-size pickup is now as acceptable in 
the executive parking lot as it is in the corporate motor pool.<P>

<P>The popularity and acceptance of the modern pickup, both large and small 
models, led directly to the sales explosion of the sport/utility vehicles 
based on the pickup platforms, but that's another story.<P>

<P>And the pickup truck made available a few things which American cars once 
offered, but for the most part had gone away. For one thing, pickup trucks 
are rear-wheel drive. The majority of cars sold in this country are no longer 
RWD models, but have front-wheel drive (which makes for more interior space 
and is cheaper for manufacturers to build). Also, full-size pickups are all 
available with a variety of powerful V8 engines, and even the smaller trucks 
have spunky V6 powerplants. <P>

<P>Rear drive and a powerful engine? That's exactly why the pickup truck has 
become the hot rod of the 1990s. You literally can not find a new family car 
with these features in America for under $40,000 (apart from the Chevy 
Caprice, Buick Roadmaster and Ford Crown Victoria/Mercury Grand Marquis) and 
a full-size Chevy pickup with a V8 is base-priced at right around $15,000.<P>

<P>Add a seemingly simple thing like a third door to the mix in the small 
S-series truck from Chevrolet and you have one neat vehicle.<P>

<P>The standard 4.3 liter V6 in the S-series truck produces 180 horsepower in 
the 4x4 (175hp in the 4x2 model), and an engine option develops 190 
horsepower. In a vehicle which weighs less than 3000 pounds that's a lot of 
power. <P>

<P>My test truck came with a four-wheel drive system, a system unacceptable 
these days. That's because the transfer case controls are big, bulky and 
mechanical. In 1997, you should be able to push a button on the dash to get 
in and out of four-wheel drive and not have to stop the vehicle and throw a 
lever in the cockpit...that's simply too primitive for the late 1990s. <P>

<P>Also, fuel mileage in the test truck averaged about 16 miles per gallon, 
combined city and freeway driving. That figure is unacceptable for a V6 
engine in a fairly lightweight truck. <P>

<P>The test truck also came with four-wheel anti-lock brakes...and all for a 
price hovering right around the $20,000 mark. Find all those features in a 
new car for that price and I'll buy it for you. <P>

<P>One note: You'll generally find only a driver's side airbag on most trucks in 
1997, and not a passenger side bag, as they are not mandated by law on that 
side in trucks for another couple of years. The Chevy S-series has only a 
driver's side airbag in 1997.<P>

<P>Inside, comfort and convenience prevails. Let's just put it this way: If you 
have not sat in or driven a small pickup truck in the past ten years, do 
yourself a favor and test-drive one from Chevrolet soon, a model like I 
drove, with the third door option. A lot of you will start considering what a 
few years ago you have considered an impossibility: You might just buy a 
pickup truck. <P>

<P>And you know what? You can own a pickup and still be for gun control and vote 
Democratic...or not. That's what's really great about pickups...there's truly 
something for everyone.<P>

<IMG SRC="chc.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>


By Steve Parker (c) 1996<P>

<P>It's a front-wheel drive four-cylinder car available as a two-door, four-door 
or a convertible. It gets great mileage, it's cute, it produces adequate 
horsepower and best of all...all the models are available for right around 
$15,000, fully-equipped. Anti-lock brakes are standard, traction control is 
an option on the convertible, a five-speed stick shift is standard and an 
automatic transmission is optional. And dual front airbags come with each and 
every car.<P>

<P>Just two or three years ago, that description probably would have fit only a 
Japanese import, and all the American car-makers realized it. That's why 
Detroit's Big Three have gone on a small-car development binge the past few 
years, desperately trying to create affordable, sporty and dependable 
transportation for the masses at a quality level approaching the best which 
Toyota, Nissan and all the others have to offer.<P>

<P>With the Chevrolet Cavalier (and its twin, the Pontiac Sunfire), General 
Motors has come as close as anyone to building a car containing that elusive 
Japanese concept of "things gone right".<P>

<P>That's how the Japanese started building their cars and trucks at the start 
of the '90s. Rather than concentrating on "things gone wrong", as did 
American and European auto-makers, the Japanese focused instead on taking 
their vehicles, which were already achieving unheard-of heights of consumer 
satisfaction, and making them even better.<P>

<P>With the Cavalier, Chevrolet finally has a home-grown small car of which they 
can be justly proud. It's got the right style, the right standard equipment 
and options and most of all...a price which makes sense. And the marketplace 
is supporting this particular small-car effort from General Motors...the 
Cavalier and Sunfire are selling very well.<P>

<P>While it may be too little too late in terms of grabbing market share back 
from the Japanese, at least consumers who want to "buy American" whenever 
possible now have an all-American choice when it comes to a small car in this 
very important class of vehicles.<P>

<P>And the reason this class of cars is oh-so-very important is quite simple. A 
car priced, styled and equipped such as the Cavalier is very likely to be the 
first car a person buys, helping to establish their buying patterns for the 
next 30 or 40 or even 50 years. <P>

<P>One reason the American manufacturers have lost so much market share in the 
past two decades is that, more and more often, young Americans are growing up 
in families where cars like Buicks, Dodges and Lincolns simply were not in 
the garage. Hondas, Toyotas and Infinitis are the cars in the family driveway 
these days, especially in Southern California.<P>

<P>I can remember a billboard on the Santa Ana Freeway in 1961 which said, 
simply, "You're probably following a Chevrolet". And they were right. Today, 
that billboard in Southern California would be very out of place. In fact, on 
a recent trip to England to visit the British Motor Show and do some TV work 
there, I saw the back page of the Motor Show's program. Emblazoned there was 
an advertisement which read "The car in front is a Toyota". How things change!<P>

<P>Most everything about the Cavalier is so right that it's hard to find more 
than minor things about which to complain. And for a car in this range, that 
is the price of admission into the segment, and Chevrolet has done well in 
that respect. They are to be seriously commended.<P>

<P>But one area of Cavalier (and Sunfire) falls woefully short of success. And 
it is a very important aspect of the car, some would say the most important.<P>

<P>When the GM engineers designed this platform, they decided to make the engine 
bay large enough only for a GM four cylinder engine. The previous generation 
Cavalier and Sunfire were available with V6 powerplants, but only a 120 
horsepower 2.2 liter four can be had with this Cavalier. And there is no 
step-up engine, no power option to add a little pizzazz to the unit.<P>

<P>And that's a shame, because this little car, especially with the optional RS 
package, which adds a bit beefier and capable tire, wheel and suspension 
package, could benefit heartily from even the somewhat-anemic 3.1 liter V6 
which GM has "on the shelf". <P>

<P>But weight and size and price and fuel economy restrictions being what they 
are for this category of car (not to mention insurance costs, which rise with 
a V6 as opposed to the four), meant that GM wanted a small engine for the car 
and that is what they got. While the 2.2 two-valve engine is just okay and 
perhaps enough power for the average buyer of this car (young, working-class 
or student and probably female), putting a V6 in this car would make it a 
little pocket rocket, putting it much closer to a true sports car rather than 
a mere "sporty" car.<P>

<P>Even the original version of the 2.2 would make a better fit in this car. 
Initially conceived and built as a 16-valve engine (four valves per cylinder, 
making it quite a bit more powerful) and called the Quad Four, the GM 2.2 was 
their corporate answer to the dual overhead cam engines in small cars which 
were coming into this country in droves from Japan in the late 1980s. But GM 
had a lot of problems with that engine (notably in the vibration and 
dependability areas), so the 16-valves were reduced to the more conventional 
8 there now (one intake and one exhaust valve per cylinder), so the trade-off 
for smoothness and reliability was made, and successfully so.<P>

<P>In all, a fine small car effort from The General, with the Chevrolet version 
of the car generally being priced a bit lower than the Pontiac. Everything 
works the way it should, and even the convertible top on that priciest 
version of the car is easy to put up and down, fits well and does not leak at 
all, which is saying a lot for a car in this price and size class.<P>

<P>You really can't ask for anything more for the price...and it's all made in 
America...but if only it came with a V6!<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="bpa"><B>1997 BUICK PARK AVENUE ULTRA</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="bpa.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>

<P>
By Steve Parker (c) 1996<P>


<P>This is the top-of-the-line for Buick these days. No more rear-drive 
Roadmaster, no more V8 power, no more interiors which seem like they were 
ripped right out of a New Orleans bordello.<P>

<P>Nope, today's proper top-line American car calls for a supercharged V6 
engine, a front-drive platform and a sensible, comfortable and not 
over-wrought interior.<P>

<P>Buick's Park Avenue Ultra is the biggest and best four-door Buick you can 
buy. Production of the Roadmaster is over with for the 1997 model year; the 
factory in Arlington, TX which made all the big rear-wheel drive GM cars has 
been converted to truck production. That same factory also produced the 
Chevrolet Caprice, Impala SS and Cadillac Fleetwood. The only rear-drive 
passenger cars available from General Motors these days are the Firebird, 
Camaro and Corvette.<P>

<P>And at almost 3800 pounds, the question inevitably arises: Is the Park Avenue 
from Buick simply too big for a front-drive platform?<P>

<P>The answer: Yes and no. <P>

<P>No, if you are the "average" or "typical" Buick driver: A little older, 
fairly conservative, more likely to be in the far right lane of the freeway. 
Not, by any means, Mario Andretti looking for a car which can handle the 
curves of the Long Beach Grand Prix.<P>

<P>However, the answer is "yes" if you are an aggressive driver attempting to 
make use of the 240 horsepower available in the supercharger-equipped Park 
Avenue Ultra model. The car goes and stops great...as long as you are going 
or stopping in a fairly straight line. But stand on the power in a cornering 
situation, and even with the optional traction control system activated and 
working in your favor, the dreaded tendency of an overpowered front-drive car 
to "push" (or "understeer") is clearly evident.<P>

<P>That inclination of front-wheel drive cars was once best explained by 
champion NASCAR driver Ernie Irvan. "Push", said Irvan, "is when you see the 
crash you're about to be involved in".<P>

<P>What he meant is that when a vehicle understeers, it continues to go straight 
when you try to turn it. In the case of an oval track race car, that means 
the car goes straight (into the wall) even when you turn the wheel.<P>

<P>Rear-wheel drive cars, on the other hand, tend to "oversteer". This means 
that when you turn the steering wheel, the rear end of the car tries to come 
around to the front...and you spin. Anyone who has ever driven a rear-drive, 
rear-engine Porsche knows all too well what "oversteer" can do in a dicey 
driving situation.<P>

<P>On the Park Avenue, as it is a front-wheel drive car, the engine weight is on 
the drive wheels, and this makes it harder for the wheels to maneuver into a 
corner when you turn the steering wheel.<P>

<P>It's not an inherently dangerous condition; it's something most people who 
have driven a front-drive car have experienced at one time or another.<P>

<P>However, for someone coming out of a traditional American rear-wheel drive 
car and getting into a Park Avenue with it's front-drive platform, it 
definitely is something which can take some getting used to.<P>

<P>Apart from that major complaint (and keep in mind it will only be a major 
complaint for someone looking for a car with excellent cornering 
capabilities), the Park Avenue Ultra is a nice gem of a car.<P>

<P>The 3.8 liter V6 engine in the car produces 205 horsepower in its base 
version, but in the Ultra model, a supercharger is added to the mix and 240 
horses are trotted out for your driving pleasure. The Ultra supercharger 
"blower" also makes available a full 280 pounds feet of torque...that 
down-low power which gives Ultra a very satisfying "launch" from stop lights. 
This also makes for fine freeway on-ramp acceleration, and the standard four 
wheel anti-lock brake system makes stopping this almost two-ton missile an 
unexpected pleasure.<P>

<P>The best thing about that V6 engine is that there is nothing fancy about it. 
No multi-valve overhead cam set-up; you car nuts out there will recognize the 
arrangement in this engine as a traditional American pushrod assembly. And it 
works very well, delivering all that horsepower and the added bonus of more 
than 18 miles per gallon combined in city and highway driving...and that's 
with the driver pushing the engine pretty hard.<P>

<P>A supercharger pumps air into the top of engine's combustion chambers, adding 
extra levels of "atmospheres" and, simply put, making the fuel/air mixture 
"explosion" which drives the pistons all that more efficient. It does, 
essentially, the same thing a turbocharger does, but a turbocharger is 
powered by the pressure of the engine's exhaust gasses, so you have to wait a 
few seconds for a turbocharger to "spool up" and produce that extra power.<P> 

<P>A supercharger, on the other hand, runs directly off the engine and comes on 
as soon as you step on the gas pedal. Thus, there's no "turbo lag". And even 
though the engine is robbed of a tiny bit of power to operate the 
supercharger (a phenomenon called "parasitic drag"), the benefits far 
outweigh the drawbacks.<P>

<P>So, why isn't every car equipped with either a supercharger or turbocharger? 
The answer is easy: Cost and complexity. It costs more to make an engine with 
one of these units, and the car-makers are in the business of making the 
least-expensive vehicles they can and selling them for as much as they can. <P>

<P>In fact, turbochargers and superchargers provide so much extra bonus power 
and better fuel mileage and lower emissions that many large, expensive 
over-the-road diesel trucks are actually equipped with BOTH a supercharger 
and a turbocharger to get the most out of the engine.<P>

<P>Outside, the Park Avenue is elegant and understated. You would not be 
surprised to see a dignitary of some sort in the large, comfortable rear 
seat. With the optional heated front seats, the driver and passenger frontal 
area is a pleasure, especially with separate temperature controls for the air 
conditioning for the driver and passenger (a set-up which no doubt has saved 
many marriages!).<P>

<P>Park Avenue Ultra has every feature you can pack into a luxury car, save for 
a sunroof. There's a huge trunk, and a nifty computer monitoring system which 
tracks everything from tire pressure to the oil level. Dual front airbags are 
standard, of course, as is the very smooth shifting four-speed automatic 
transmission. <P>

<P>I have complaints about the placement of some controls and gauges, but I also 
have to keep in mind that this is NOT a "driver's car", no matter how 
powerful the engine may be. This is an "older" person's car, and not for an 
older "aggressive" driver, either.<P>

<P>This Park Avenue Ultra is a great car for the audience at which it is aimed. 
I'll always miss the full-size V8 rear-wheel drive Roadmaster, but times 
change and our vehicles must change with them. Priced in the mid-$30's, the 
Ultra is right on target. For traditional rear-drive V8 power and similar 
luxury appointments, as you'd find in a Lexus, BMW or Mercedes-Benz, you'd 
have to spend at least $10,000 more.<P>

<P>And you know what? At right around $30K, the Park Avenue without a 
supercharger is a darn nice car as well, at a very attractive price.<P>

<P>Buick was always known as "the doctor's car". This tag goes back to the days 
when doctors actually made house calls, and it was felt that to pull up to a 
patient's home in a Cadillac was too ostentatious...but the Buick allowed the 
family doc to ride in dependable luxury and comfort without being overly 
showy.<P>

<P>The Buick line still fills that bill. It's the next best thing to a Cadillac 
in the GM line-up and with Ultra, they have a four-door luxury car which is 
certainly not the best in the world, but surely can be considered one of the 
best in its class.<P>

<P>
By Steve Parker (c) 1996<P>



<P>You've seen the cute TV and print ads, you've heard all the hype. And now, you
can lease the car. But you can't buy one. Yet.<P>

<P>In other words, they're ba-a-ack!<P>

<P>Electric cars and trucks, which, believe it or not, once outsold
gasoline-powered vehicles in the USA (in some years before the 1920's), are
rearing their heads and being welcomed by a segment of the public eager for the
dual promises of cheap fuel and clean air.<P>

<P>The reason gasoline-powered cars replaced EVs early in this century was because
internal combustion engines were (and still are) much more efficient in turning
fuel into motivating power. And there was a hell of a lot more gasoline and oil
available than electricity in those days.<P>

<P>But the heavy batteries in these modern vehicles last only a few thousand miles
before they need to be replaced. The best of the EVs can go little more than 100
miles before needing a complete recharging, which can take up to 12 hours. EVs
have not been crash-tested by the government, and no one really knows for sure
what 1100 pounds or so of poisonous batteries will do in a high-speed crash.
There are real questions about the national infrastructure's ability to produce
the electricity needed to power EVs, not to mention the problem of disposing of
used, toxic batteries. And as far as the true expense of EVs...well, today it's
a given that we all will be paying for them in one way or another as public
utilities and municipalities, the first big users of EVs, will simply pass along
their costs to customers and citizens.<P>

<P>GM is building the first modern-day mass-market EV (called EV1) and is leasing
it at Saturn dealers, initially in California, Arizona and Nevada, for about
$35,000. That works out, with state and federal tax credits, to a 3-year lease
for California residents at a cost of about $450 a month.<P>

<P>Specially-trained and knowledgeable "EV specialists" at these select Saturn
dealers will treat the customer right; Saturn is already the King of customer
service and has set the customer satisfaction standard of the industry.<P>

<P>Many consumer groups are complaining that this vehicle, aimed at a very elite
audience, offers the buyers heavy tax credits which the rest of us wind up
paying for.<P>

<P>The car is being offered in the Southwest first for two reasons: 1) The smog
problem is pretty bad out here, and 2) Batteries do better in warm weather. Cold
temperatures kill their ability to hold a charge.<P>

<P>You'll also need to lease a 220-volt charger from your local utility for about
$50 a month, and pay an as-yet- undetermined amount to have the charger
installed on your property.<P>

<P>GM's Hughes Electronics subsidiary developed the nifty magnetic inductive
"paddle" you stick in the EV1 to recharge it...you can't get a shock from it,
even in a rainstorm.<P>

The EV1 is the first vehicle ever sold under the name "General Motors"; not
Buick, Cadillac, Olds, Pontiac or Chevy or GMC...just GM. You can look at this
two ways: Either no one Division in the Corporation wanted responsibility for
it, or, GM is so proud of the vehicle, they want everyone in the Corporation to
share in the honor.<P>

<P>The EV1 is hand-built at a small craft center in Lansing, Michigan. Not many
will ever be produced; perhaps a few thousand at the most. GM advertisements
will soon be shouting with glee that they are selling "all the EV1's being
built"...but keep in mind they won't be building that many to begin with. So
don't be fooled.<P>

<P>California determined some years ago that starting early in the 21st century,
major car-sellers in the state must augment their fleets with "zero-emissions"
vehicles, that is, vehicles without tailpipes. Worldwide, car-makers have
rallied against these rulings, and it appears that California has seemingly
blinked, and state agencies are backing away from these very strict rules,
having figured out their guidelinesare hindering development of other  very-low
emissions vehicles.<P>

<P>Car-makers in Europe and Japan are seriously working on hydrogen-powered
vehicles (whose emissions are pure water), and hybrid vehicles (cars and trucks
which use a combination of electric motors and batteries and small internal
combustion engines to keep the batteries charged).  But General Motors decided
they better have a showcase electric vehicle to feature in California...hence
the EV1.<P>

<P>But keep in mind...you still have to make the electricity for these cars
somewhere, and while it might give EV1 drivers a warm and fuzzy feeling to have
no emissions coming out of their short-ranged, expensive vehicles, there will be
a lot more coal being burned at power plants in the Four Corners area to keep
these cars on the road.<P>

<P>The EV1 is the most aerodynamic production car sold in the world. It even has
rear fender skirts to help the air flow smoothly over the car. The special tires
run at a very high 50 psi of air pressure, meaning the ride in the car is quite
stiff...you feel every pebble in the road.<P>

<P>It weighs about 3200 pounds, 1100 pounds of which are low-tech lead acid
batteries arranged in a 'T' shape under the car. The body panels are lightweight
and expensive plastic, just like on a Saturn.<P>

<P>EV1 comes complete with a heat pump-type air conditioner which does not work
impressively at all, but it is full of very hi-tech gimmicks like a regenerative
braking system which takes the heat generated when you hit the brakes and turns
it into electricity to help keep the batteries charged.<P>

<P>The front-wheel drive car seats only two, and has a trunk large enough to hold a
set of golf clubs.<P>

<P>The car is fun to drive, no doubt about that. It is virtually silent, and has a
lot of surprising power off the line with its 147 horsepower motor. Electric
motors have a lot of torque when they first come on, so the car's "launch" is
quite impressive.<P>

<P>GM says EV1 can cruise up to about 100 miles before needing a complete recharge,
depending on many conditions. But, if you live like most of us and never really
know when you're going to get stuck in a freeway traffic jam, you might leave
the EV1 at home unless you know the roads are going to be wide open. Running out
of power in EV1 presents an entirely different set of problems than running out
of gas in the old family four-door.<P>

<P>The true long-term, common-sense future for EVs? Probably hybrid vehicles, with
a combination of batteries and a small gas or diesel engine which serves as an
on-board recharging station. The longer-term future will see ultra capacitors in
use (like the ones used to store up energy for your camera's flash) along with
flywheels, which store energy mechanically rather than chemically (actor Kevin
Costner is a big investor in a flywheel development company).<P>

<P>We'll also see hydrogen used to power internal combustion engines and the use of
super-exotic fuel cells, like those used on spacecraft. Mercedes-Benz already
has fleets of vehicles running around Europe testing both these systems.<P>

<P>Finally, there's solar power. For the past several years, days-long solar
powered races have been run in (sunny) locations around the world testing the
mettle of teams ranging from universities to major car manufacturers.<P>

<P>The true beauty of all these technologies? They already exist and are in use in
various industries...they just need to be developed to point where millions of
them can be made and sold to the decidedly untechnical drivers of America.<P>

<P>And just like the space program, the consumer spin-offs from the development of
all sorts of EVs will benefit society.<P>

<P>GM is to be commended for being the first on the block with an EV1-type vehicle,
but I had hoped that the days of consumers doing the last 100,000 miles of
research and development for GM were over in the 1970s.<P>

<IMG SRC="cdc.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>


<P>This is the longest, heaviest Cadillac you can buy these days. And in many ways,
for those of us who remember BIG American cars from the past few decades, this
auto is a thing of wonder.<P>

<P>Why?<P>

<P>Well, imagine if you will a 17 1/2 foot long, 4052 pound four-door car with a V8
engine producing a crisp 300 horsepower, carrying five adults in world-class
comfort...and doing all this while getting you an average of more than 17 miles
per gallon and producing emissions barely more noxious than a baby's breath.<P>

<P>They don't make the Fleetwood anymore (the plant in Arlington, TX where they
used to make it is now in the business of turning out the luxury vehicles of the
'90s...trucks), so if you're looking for sheer power and bombast, DeVille
Concours is your only choice if a Cadillac it must be. Sad, isn't it? I mean, a
world where the Cadillac Fleetwood is no longer made...barely worth living in!<P>

<P>But I digress into sentimentality...<P>

<P>The DeVille line has been completely recast for the 1997 model year, and I think
they have done just about everything as right as can be expected from
Cadillac...which is pretty damn close to perfection.<P>

<P>Behold the wonder of DeVille Concours! It has all the elegance and style and
comfort you'd expect from a (ahem) $46,000 land yacht, and it comes with an
amazing array of seamless, transparent hi-tech systems which rival the Space
Shuttle.<P>

<P>All 1997 DeVilles have restyled sheet metal outside and restyled interiors and
instrument panels inside, with dual front seat airbags and super-hip side
airbags for front seat occupants as well. The rear wheel wells were opened up
and the rear wheels pulled out to give the car just a bit of a younger, less
formal look.<P>

<P>DeVille is Cadillac's biggest seller, and has been since just about anyone can
remember. This is not a car the Division can afford to make a mistake with. Even
though the company knows they have to attract younger buyers, they can not in
any way offend their traditional, loyal (translation: old) buyers, and in the
DeVille Concours they have developed a very nice package of power and comfort
and convenience which should appeal to buyers ranging in age from 45 to 95 (and
let's face it...most folks under 45 won't be able to afford this car, anyway).<P>

<P>There are three different DeVille models for 1997, all with the highly-venerated
Northstar front-wheel drive "system", but only the Concours model allows this
wondrous engine to develop its current full potential of 300 horses (the other
models are held to only 275).<P>

<P>That engine has only gotten better since its introduction at the start of this
decade in the Seville model. (Oldsmobile likes it so much they use a smaller
version of it in their Aurora).<P>

<P>It's a 4.6 liter V8 with dual overhead cams and a total of 32 (count 'em)
valves. It is mated to what is without a doubt the smoothest-shifting four-speed
automatic in the industry.<P>

<P>The front-wheel drive system exhibits all the understeer you'd expect in a car
this heavy and powerful (that's the tendency of the car to try and go straight
even when you're turning the steering wheel). However, let's be honest about
this: Most DeVille Concours drivers are not going to be very aggressive on the
roadways, and the front-drive understeer probably will never get them into
trouble. In fact, most unsophisticated drivers wouldn't be able to tell you if
this car is driven by the front or rear wheels.<P>

<P>DeVille Concours comes with standard traction control for the front wheels and a
newly-developed and standard stability enhancement system to detect and help
correct rear-end fishtailing. Of course there are anti-lock brakes on all four
corners.<P>

<P>The car I tested for a week came equipped with GM's OnStar cellular phone
security system. It's about a $1000 option available on all Cadillacs (except
Catera) in 1997 and will eventually be available throughout the complete GM line
of pricier cars and trucks.<P>

<P>Here's what OnStar does: Pushing one button on the Hughes Electronics hands-free
cellular phone puts you instantly in touch with an operator in a central service
center (currently located in Michigan, but eventually there will be centers all
over the nation). That operator, once you give him or her your personal code
number, will know (through a satellite Global Positioning System built by
industry-leader Trimble) your exact location to within a few yards, anywhere in
the nation. The operator can give you directions to specific locations if you
are lost, or direct you to the nearest restaurant of your choice, or a hospital,
police station, etc.<P>

<P>Locked your keys in the car?<P>

<P>Get on any phone, call the service center, and the OnStar operator can (get
this) unlock the doors for you.<P>

<P>Lost your car in a big parking lot?<P>

<P>Call the OnStar center and the operator will make your Cadillac flash its
headlights and beep its horn.<P>

<P>If any of the airbags in the car is deployed for any reason, the cell phone in
the car automatically calls the OnStar center and they alert local authorities
to your exact location.<P>

<P>OnStar's secret?<P>

<P>It's wired into the car's engine and chassis computers. The possibilities are
about limitless. For instance, there's no reason why OnStar operators could not,
sometime in the near future, totally disable your car if you call and report it
stolen...and alert local cops to the car's location.<P>

<P>It's worth a trip to your local Cadillac dealer just to try-out OnStar...it's
that much fun! (Lincoln offers a similar system on some of their models called
RESCU).<P>

<P>There are some things about the car I do not like. The memory seat system is way
too complicated and has too many items tied into it...including the radio
station pre-sets. The radio itself has too many unnecessary audio
settings...Caddy is guilty here of using technology just because it's there.<P>

<P>The car does not have seat heaters, front or rear, and at these prices it should
have them all over the place.<P>

<P>But really, I don't have a lot of other objections. I'd like the CD changer to
be in the passenger compartment, as it is in the similarly-priced Lexus LS400,
and not in the trunk, as it is in this DeVille Concours.<P>

<P>Final verdict? If this is what Cadillac considers their top of the line
performance/comfort model for the late 1990s, they could have done a lot worse.
The car is classy, elegant, capable, as safe as a car can be in the late 20th
century, and does it all subtly and effortlessly.<P>

<P>Good on you, Cadillac. This car is a winner we can all aspire to.<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="pgpg"><B>PONTIAC GRAND PRIX GTP</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="pgpg.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>


<P>It isn't often that I come across a car which seems "worth the money." And 
more often than not, that statement can only said to be true of very 
expensive cars; cars with outlandish interior appointments, incredible 
drivetrains and sophisticated styling.<P>

<P>Almost never are cars in the mid-price range "worth the money". Yet I think I 
have found one for you, and one of the best things about it is that it is an 
American car with the best musclecar "pedigree" you can find anywhere in the 
worldwide automotive industry.<P>

<P>The Pontiac Grand Prix with the optional GTP supercharger package is 
available for 1997 as either a four-door or two-door, and the car is without 
a doubt "worth the money".<P>

<P>In fact, if this car were priced even a few thousand dollars MORE than its 
sticker price, it would still most surely be "worth the money". You can't say 
this about many cars and truck sold in our country in the 1997 model year, 
and to be able to say it about an all-American performance coupe and sedan is 
more than a pleasure...it's almost a thrill!<P>

<P>Coming in at under $25,000, the Grand Prix GTP offers 240 horsepower, a 
sumptuous interior and a "boy racer" exterior appearance which will turn all 
the heads in your neighborhood. Plus, it gets all that horsepower through the 
use of a supercharger...just like the Big Boys at the drag strip get THEIR 
extra motivation!<P>

<P>In fact, one of the few cars in the "worth the price" league I can think of 
to compare to GTP to in terms of performance is the mighty little four-door 
Acura Integra equipped with Honda's super high-tech four-cylinder VTEC engine 
package. But, in terms of styling and comfort, the Pontiac simply blows that 
car away.
<P>
<P>The Grand Prix will hold four fully-grown adults in comfort with no problem 
at all. And the front-driver packs the kind of whallop which can make taking 
your best friends to the movies quite a joy ride in itself...who said getting 
there was only "half" the fun?  I can remember when I got my first motorcycle 
back in 1973...I would run ANY errand for my parents, the thing was so much 
fun to ride!<P>

<P>For men and women with that kind of memory of their first car or truck or 
motorcycle, this could very well be the car for you, to help you through that 
mid-life excitement "crisis" you're going through right now.<P>

<P>Not only that, but this will definitely be one of the vehicles to help the 
Pontiac Division of General Motors through the mid-life crisis they are 
currently undergoing!<P>

<P>Not so very long ago, Pontiac was selling, regularly, more than 500,000 cars 
a year. Remember those days? Oldsmobile was selling more than 1,000,000 cars 
a year, Cadillac was the best car your money could buy, and the thought of 
driving any import other than a British sports car was simply ludicrous.<P>

<P>In 1964, Pontiac stunned the world with the introduction of the GTO, the 
world's first true factory-built musclecar, and it was marketed as such by 
the company. What Pontiac did was stuff the big 389 cubic inch V8 into the 
smallish Pontiac LeMans as an option package...and voila! The GTO, and a lot 
of automotive history, was made.<P>

<P>But even before the GTO left the Pontiac plant, the company was already 
making a wonderful "personal luxury coupe", the Grand Prix. Due to the 
determination of Pontiac's then-new General Manager, Semon E. "Bunkie" 
Kundsen, to make Pontiac a GM Division idolized by the youth of the nation, 
Pontiac created a car whose name lives on today.<P>

<P>Cadillac was supposed to get this car first; but Caddy didn't need the car 
because their sales were very good. They couldn't build enough cars to 
fulfill their dealers' orders. The last thing they needed was a new model to 
try and sell. Buick Division needed help and GM eventually gave them the 
Caddy design to make their own, and they did, as the Riviera, in 1964.<P>

<P>These were the days when each GM Division was essentially its own car 
company; the sharing of anything, from platforms to engineers to engines, was 
unheard of. Each Division had their own factories and their own complete (and 
huge) staffs of thousands of automotive specialists. So when Bunkie Knudsen 
told his Division to build a luxury sport coupe (two-door) and get it on the 
market FAST, before Buick or Caddy or anyone else, they could do it...without 
any other GM Division really knowing what they were up to. <P>

<P>Grand Prix sold great right out of the chute and sales didn't slow down for 
several years. But starting in the mid-1970s, with government mandates for 
emissions and fuel mileage targets, cars like Grand Prix began dying their 
slow death. The country, in the throes of the Vietnam war and the beginnings 
of environmental consciousness, didn't want two-door performance/luxury cars 
anymore which could barely manage more than 12 miles per gallon. Those days 
were over, and Grand Prix seemed to be over as well.<P>

<P>So starting in the '70s and throughout the '80s we saw various incarnations 
of the Grand Prix, almost all of them terrible. When a four-door model was 
introduced, it was regarded as a sacrilege by Grand Prix aficianados. There 
were some signs that Grand Prix might be ready for a revival in the very late 
'80s, and the car we have today is surely a worthy modern-day successor to 
the original Grand Prix, which was introduced more than 30 years ago.<P>

<P>This all-new car is a revelation. Dual front seat airbags, a great driver's 
cockpit where all the gauges and switchgear are right where they should be, 
four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, traction control, a four-speed automatic 
transmission (no which available) which can handle the 280 foot pounds of 
torque produced by the supercharged engine, a powerful exhaust note and 
more...Grand Prix GTP is a musclecar for the '90s and beyond.<P>

<P>Each Grand Prix model is a nice car at a nice price. Engines available 
include the 160 horsepower 3.1 liter V6 and the 195 horsepower 3.8 liter V6, 
an engine which GM is using in all sorts of cars and trucks to prove that a 
"low-tech" pushrod engine can compete favorably in today's multi-valve, dual 
overhead cam world. <P>

<P>Add a supercharger to that same 3.8 liter unit and you wind up with 240 
horsepower, instantly available at the touch of the accelerator...you don't 
have to wait for the power to "spool up" as you do with many turbochargers; 
with a supercharger, the extra power is right there, right now. Even at 
slightly over 3400 pounds, this family fun four-door simply gets up and GOES!<P>

<P>Pontiac had a great opportunity with this car which they screwed up. They 
Division got permission from NASCAR to run the 1997 Grand Prix during the 
1996 NASCAR stock car racing season, before it was available for sale to the 
public. I think NASCAR has done this only once before in the past.<P>

<P>So here is Pontiac with their all-new car with the great old name in front of 
a total of hundreds of millions of spectators and TV viewers during an entire 
NASCAR season, and the car barely makes a dent in the Ford T-Bird/Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo domination of the series racing .<P>

<P>For the 1997 NASCAR season, Pontiac promises they will be back and strongly 
so, with some of NASCAR's most famous teams running their cars. This is 
certainly something Pontiac should have had assured for the 1996 season, 
before they ever made a commitment to NASCAR to publicly introduce  the car 
through that series. <P>

<P>Pontiac's General Manager John Middlebrook has, in the past year, left the 
Division to go head up Chevrolet, the most plum job at GM, a job which is 
often the precursor to someone becoming President of the Corporation.<P>

<P>In Middlebrook's place is Roy Roberts, heading up a newly-married Pontiac and 
GMC Division (many Pontiac dealers were carrying GMC trucks anyway). Roberts 
is not a big race fan, but he comes from a manufacturing background so he 
sure knows how to BUILD cars, the kid  of cars the public likes. Roberts is 
also the first black GM Divisional chieftain and the highest-ranking black 
man anywhere in the world automotive industry. He'll want to do a good job, 
and part of that good job will be supporting his Division's racing division 
and getting them to win some NASCAR races.<P>

<P>There you have it...a great new car with a great, well-known name (hell 
they're even using the "Wide Track" line to sell this new car, a line 
originated in the early 1960s)...and yes, in its supercharged GTP version, it 
IS worth the money!<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="cvm"><B>1997 CHEVROLET VENTURE MINIVAN</B></A></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="cvm.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>

<P>Chevrolet, along with other General Motors Divisions, has had a tough time in 
a lot of markets in the past 10 years, but none tougher than in one of the 
most important segments of the marketplace...minivans.<P>

<P>Now, Chevy, Pontiac and Oldsmobile (and soon Buick) have brand-new minivans 
on the market, designed and produced in part in conjunction with GM's 
European affiliates. Now, I really liked the previous generation of GM 
minivans, derided almost universally as the "Dustbusters" because of their 
unusual front-end shape and steeply raked windshields.<P>

<P>There really wasn't much wrong with those minivans that a little creative 
marketing and advertising could not have solved for GM, but The Corporation 
has been lacking in those areas for some time until very recently. And GM has 
a bad insecurity problem concerning minivans now because of their failure in 
the market, so rather than gussie-up their existing minivans and roll them 
out as "new and improved", they have spent several billion dollars developing 
these all-new models.<P>

<P>Has their money been well spent? Probably not, is the short answer. I think 
GM should have had more confidence in their previous models, added a fourth 
door to all of them (which they did do with the Oldsmobile Silhouette) and 
re-introduced them with facelifts and some spiffy advertising and marketing 
programs.<P>

<P>Remember the great line in the movie "Get Shorty", when John Travolta finds 
out his rental car is actually an Olds minivan? "It's the Cadillac of 
minivans," says the rental shuttle driver to Travolta...and that becomes a 
running gag throughout the movie. Well, that product placement in that movie 
(a project done by Vista Group of Burbank) was the BEST thing that ever 
happened to the GM minivans...and in true GM fashion, they did NOTHING with 
it in their advertising or marketing programs. Here it was, handed to them on 
a silver platter, and they did not take advantage of the public awareness of 
their product generated by this smash-hit movie at all. I guess they figured 
it was better to spend several billion on an all-new model...oh, well...<P>

<P>And what can you say about minivans which hasn't been said already...100 
times?<P>

<P>While most industry analysts say the minivan was introduced for the first 
time in America by the Chrysler Corporation in the mid-80s, minivans had 
actually been around a lot longer than that in this marketplace. Anyone 
remember the Volkswagen Vanagon and its predecessors?<P>

<P>The Japanese have never learned how to make a good minivan on their own...it 
was a vehicle which never made sense to them in their home markets. Many 
early efforts from Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan were sales disasters, and 
for good reasons. Even today, Toyota and Honda (with their cute little 
Odyssey) have yet to put a V6 in their vehicles...they will come in the next 
year or so.<P>

<P>Lee Iacocca is credited with steering Chrysler into the minivan market, but 
it was really one of the product planners he took with him when he was fired 
from Ford and was hired (for $1 a year) by Chrysler who had the idea. Henry 
Ford II himself rejected the minivan concept for Ford, which opened the door 
for Chrysler to take advantage of Ford's lack of foresight.<P>

<P>The main ideas behind the minivan concept? That it would hold passengers 
comfortably and, most importantly, fit into the average American garage.<P>

<P>The Chrysler minivans were hits from the first day they went on sale and 
their domination of the market continues to this day. Of more than one 
million minivans now sold annually in America, fully half of them are 
Chryslers, Dodges or Plymouths. Every other car company is still playing 
catch-up, more than a decade after the American introduction of the minivan.<P>

<P>So, enter gigantic GM. With their first-generation of minivans unadulterated 
failures, here they are with their latest efforts. The Pontiac is still the 
Trans Sport, the Olds is still the Silhouette but the Chevy gets a new name, 
changed from Lumina to Venture. And the latest word from GM is that Buick 
will have its own minivan based on the same platform by the year 2002...so GM 
will be fighting itself once again with four of their 7 Divisions selling 
essentially the same vehicle.<P>

<P>Add to this the fact that many industry analysts believe if there is one 
segment in the business ready to cool off, it is the minivan segment, and you 
have GM jumping with both feet into a now-hot area of sales which may cool 
very rapidly.<P>

<P>Both the short and long-wheelbase versions of the Venture come with 180 
horsepower 3.4 liter V6 engines...and all the bells and whistles you'd expect 
from a late 20th century front-wheel drive minivan platform. Anti-lock 
brakes, four-speed automatic transmission (only), high-end sound and AC 
systems...it's all here.<P>

<P>I found the Venture to be quite delightful...it tracks well and powerfully 
and even on the most uneven and scored freeway lanes it went right where I 
pointed it and never drifted away from my control. <P>

<P>Gauges and switchgear are right where they should be; the optional fourth 
sliding door can be opened electronically by remote control and is a very 
nice feature, especially when you are walking up to the vehicle with a lot of 
packages and want to get them into the van quickly.<P>

<P>In other words, the Venture is a winner...in a field where there are already 
a lot of winners. Prices are comparable to the Chrysler-made vehicles, though 
the Plymouth Voyager still appears to be the best buy in the minivan 
marketplace. Ford does not yet offer a fourth-door on their Windstar (and 
will not until at least 1998...in an incredible, costly and rare Ford 
product-planning mistake this decade) so I can't count them as among the 
"best" out there from the Big Three.<P>

<P>GM is going to find the exact same problems with this generation of minivans 
as they did with their last...they have some great vehicles which will not 
move off the showroom floors if they can't give the public a compelling 
reason to come into the showrooms and test-drive them. This very serious 
problem is what plagued GM with their minivans the past five years, and 
instead of improving the marketing and advertising of the product, they 
re-did the product.<P>

<P>When you are as big as GM, you can get away with that type of thinking...but 
only for a finite period of time.<P>

<P>GM has the winning product in these all-new minivans; it's going to be up to 
the GM marketing gurus to get Americans to want to buy them.<P>

KMPC RADIO HIRES DAVE COOKE AS NEW 
OPERATIONS MANAGER / PROGRAM DIRECTOR</FONT></TH></TR> 
<TR><TD>


	<P>LOS ANGELES - Maureen Lesourd, KABC / KMPC / KLOS President and General Manager, 
announced today that Dave Cooke has been appointed the new Operations Manager / Program Director 
of KABC and KMPC Radio, effective August 12, 1996.<P>

	<P>Cooke is a News/Talk Radio veteran who has successfully worked as a news director, 
on-air talent, researcher and programming consultant. "Dave brings a tremendous amount of 
knowledge and radio experience to our heritage stations," said Lesourd. "His reputation is 
sterling and he has been heralded by many colleagues as an outstanding programming professional. 
I'm certain that Dave will be a wonderful addition to our team."<P>

	<P>For the past 10 years, he has been a partner in Roberts/Cooke Media Research & Resources 
in San Rafael, California. The company provides programming consulting and research for 
News/Talk radio stations. Some of the firm's clients have included: KRLD-AM Dallas; KMOX-AM St. 
Louis; KIRO-AM/FM Seattle; WCBS-AM New York; KMBZ/KCMO-AM Kansas City; and KXL-AM Portland.<P>

	<P>Prior to founding his company, Cooke was the Vice President & Director of News for RKO 
Radio Networks in New York. In addition, Dave has worked in Boston as the News Director for 
WHDH-AM; served as the News & Public Affairs Director for KHJ-AM in Los Angeles; acted as an 
Anchor and Correspondent for ABC Radio Network in New York; and was News Director of KFRC-AM in 
San Francisco. He began his radio career in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, first as an afternoon 
News Anchor at WFAA-AM and later as the News Director of KNUS-FM.<P>

	<P>"I am very excited about working at KABC / KMPC radio,'" says Cooke. "These are two 
stations with a tremendous heritage, premiere talent and a dynamic general manager. My first 
priority is to help re-focus the stations and ultimately re-claim their dominance." <P>

	<P>Cooke holds a Journalism/Political Science degree from the University of North Texas. 
Andy Ludlum will continue to act as the Program Manager of KABC / KMPC, reporting to Cooke.<P>

Tom Leykis, the man who is changing the face of today's talk radio, is host of 710 Talk/KMPC's 
weekday afternoon drive program The Tom Leykis Show from 3 to 7 p.m. Tom's show brings a unique 
dimension to the talk format with a cutting-edge style that draws a new and younger audience.<P>
	
Being the only nationally syndicated talk program to originate from Los Angeles, Tom taps into  
a guest list of Hollywood's elite and outrageous to appear on the show. Guests vary from actors, 
comedians and rock stars to politicians and opinion-makers and there's no telling what particular 
topic he may choose to arouse his audience. In addition to talking with in-studio guests and 
taking calls from listeners across the nation, Tom had no qualms about telling stories about his 
personal life and often provokes his listeners with his opinions.<P>
	
A self-described "computer fanatic," Leykis also intends to bring an interactive element to his show  via the nation's largest commercial computer networks. Subscribers to Prodigy, CompuServe   and American Online will be able to communicate with Leykis 
by posting E-Mail messages to him while his show is on the air.<P>
	
Tom Leykis built his radio career on the air in some of America's largest markets including Los 
Angeles, Boston, Miami and Phoenix. After early stints in markets such as Albany, New York and 
Staunton, Virginia, Leykis moved to Miami where he had the number one rated nighttime talk show. 
In 1985 he became Program Director of Phoenix's KFYI, also serving as the afternoon drive 
personality for three years. In the Spring of 1988, Leykis moved to the L.A. talk radio outlet 
KFI where his afternoon drive show was the highest rated talk program in its time slot. During 
his L.A. term, he gained world-wide attention for many of his wild antics and on-air stunts. 
Then in May of 1993, Leykis moved to Boston where his mid-day show on WRKO Radio helped bring 
the station's Arbitron ranking up from #12 in the summer to #2 in the fall. Tom continued at WRKO until moving back to Los Angeles in the Spring of 1994 to take on his national audience with Westwood One and Los Angeles on 710 Talk/KMPC.<P>

	Michael Reagan's talk show, heard on 710 TALK / KMPC in Los Angeles, provides listeners 
a national forum to discuss substantive issues with politicians, opinion leaders and news makers.<P>

	<P>Michael has earned record ratings as the number one host in dozens of markets since he 
started his national radio talk show. His radio career began as a guest host for the Michael 
Jackson Show on KABC Talkradio in Los Angeles. In turn, Reagan was hired as the host of a 
top-rated local radio program in San Diego until he launched his national program in 1992. <P>

	<P>Prior to his radio career, Michael was active in power boat racing, setting six world 
records (he still holds the record for the fastest passage from Ketchikan to Seattle). In total, 
he has raised 1.5 million dollars for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Diabetes Foundation, the 
United States Olympic Committee and the Statute of Liberty Restoration Fund through his racing. 
Michael also received the "Victor Award" for outstanding sports and humanitarian achievement.<P>

	<P>Reagan is the author of a best-selling autobiography, On the Outside Looking In, and the 
forthcoming Making Waves: Bold Exposs On The Issues That Made Michael Reagan Talk Radio's 
Number One Nighttime Host. He is co-author of the Great American Quote Book. Like his father, 
former President of the United States Ronald Reagan, Michael has been an actor.<P> 

	<P>Michael founded the Reagan Information Interchange, which includes his newsletter, the 
Monthly Monitor, and his top-rated World Wide Web site - reagan.com. He has appeared on 
television programs including The Tonight Show, Good Morning America, Today Show and Politically 
Incorrect.<P>

	<P>In addition, Reagan was one of two Americans named an honorary Member of the 104th 
Congress. On the eve of swearing-in of the first Republican Congressional majority in four 
decades and the first "Conservative Opportunity Congress" in history, Michael delivered the 
keynote address to the freshmen Members of Congress.
<P>
	<P>Michael married Colleen Sterns in 1975 and they live with their children, Cameron and 
Ashley, in Sherman Oaks, California. He is also an avid golfer.<P>

<P>
<P>There's no doubt that Tom is one of a kind. As <I>The Los Angeles 
Times</I> reported, people don't have luke-warm feelings about Tom 
Leykis.	 He brings a unique dimension to the talk radio format with a 
cutting-edge style that draws a new and younger
 audience. In Tom's words, it's talk radio you can dance to.  He taps 
into a guest list of Hollywood's elite and outrageous who appear on his 
show. Guests vary from actors, comedians and rock stars to politicians 
and opinion-makers. There's no telling 
what particular topic he may choose to arouse his audience.

<H1>Bob Heckler</H1>
<H3>Monday - Friday<BR> 9 a.m. to Noon</H3>
<P>
 If you want a debatable, fiery and conservative radio host, then
 KMPC's Bob Heckler is what you are looking for.  Bob is the host with 
the most in terms of in-your-face,
 "no-looking-back" talk. He has a history of being the "black sheep" of the
 airwaves. His career began in Denver, where he was the host of the only
 secular talk show on Christian radio. Bob's energizing and fast-paced 710
 TALK / KMPC show covers current events with a significant right-wing
 feel to it. So if you can handle being shocked, and having your ideology
 chewed up without losing it, tune in Bob Heckler on KMPC.

<H1>Michael Reagan</H1>
<H3>Monday-Friday<BR>3 - 7 p.m.</H3>
<P>
<P>
Michael Reagan, son of President Ronald Reagan, joins the KMPC line-up with a national talk show 
that focuses on Congress, the Executive Branch and politics. His show features one-on-one 
interviews with influential newsmakers, congressional leaders and opinion makers.<P>
<P>
Michael adds humor, wit and warmth while addressing some of the most important political and 
social issues with callers from across the nation. Reagan broadcasts his KMPC Talk Show live 
from Los Angeles and always looks to his fellow Southern Californians for input and lively 
debate.<P>
<P>
Michael began his radio career as a guest host on KABC Talkradio in Los Angeles. His L.A. 
appearances helped pave the way for a full-time talk show in San Diego and ultimately a national 
talk program.  Since then, he has built a loyal national audience.<P>
<P>
Prior to his radio career, Reagan was active in power boat racing, which earned him world 
records and raised millions of dollars for various charities. In addition, he is an author of a 
best-selling autobiography, On the Outside Looking In, and was one of two Americans named 
Honorary Members of the 104th Congress.<P>

1,879 people, including 718 government representatives from 122 countries, 105 delegates of UN and other inter-governmental organisations, 471 non-governmental organisation representatives, 47 youth/co-sponsor delegates and 538 members of the world's press, met in Stockholm, Sweden, 27 - 31 August 1996 at the first World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.<BR>
<BR>
In the words of the General Rapporteur, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, &quot;there can be no more delusions&quot; -- no-one can deny that the problem of children being sold for sex exists, here and now, in almost every country in the world.<BR>

<P>A Declaration and Agenda for Action (see &quot;Declaration&quot;) were unanimously adopted and strategic alliances formed to fight against those who sell and buy children for sex.  Updates of documents at this site are in progress.<BR>

<P><H2>Overview</H2><BR>

<H4>Whatever the underlying causes, the agents involved or the associated issues, commercial sexual exploitation is always fundamentally defined in the same way:  it is <I>the exploitation, for sexual purposes, and for financial or in-kind profit, of children</I> (defined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a person under the age of 18 or as otherwise defined by an individual country).  It is an extremely hazardous form of child labour, an abuse of power over children and a way to dominate them.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Additionally, although the phenomenon of  sex tourism  involving mainly men travelling to other countries to engage in sex with children  is well documented, commercial sexual exploitation of children is predominantly a local issue, with both clients and agents coming from the local community.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The exact nature of the exploitation differs from one country to another:1	The regional descriptions which follow are simplified in order to give a generalised global snapshot of the principal characteristics of commercial sexual exploitation of children in different regions.  In reality, the phenomenon is complex and can take many forms.  However, the descriptions indicate the form of exploitation most usually recognised as predominating in each region.</H4>
<P>
<H4>  in<B> Asia</B>, for example, commercial sexual exploitation of children typically takes the form of local men using the services of child prostitutes, or of so-called sex tourism.  Sometimes children are sold into the sex trade by families or friends, sometimes knowingly, sometimes in the mistaken belief that the children will become domestic servants or otherwise earn money for the family.  Sometimes the children are kidnapped, trafficked across borders or from rural to urban areas, and moved from place to place so that they effectively disappear.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In <B>South America</B>, information has come principally from people working with children who are already forced to earn a living on the streets and may ultimately either choose or be forced to enter the sex trade.  By the precariousness of their situation, they are vulnerable to pimps and other criminal elements who exploit them for profit and offer them protection which masks abuse, often violence and too often drug-dependency.  Sometimes, however, they enter the sex trade voluntarily, seeking to earn more from sex than they can from other forms of street labour, to finance a drug habit, purchase consumer goods otherwise out of their reach, or simply to be able to eat.</H4>
<P>
<H4>In <B>Europe</B>, children are trafficked across the borders of mainland Europe from poorer countries in the East to wealthier countries where the market for children is fuelled by organised paedophile rings and high-tech information services.   There has also been an increase in consumer-driven child prostitution, where out-of-control consumerism and the pressure of advertising and expectations push children into the sex trade in order to buy high-cost consumer items or drugs.  This phenomenon also exists in industrialised countries like <B>the United Kingdom,</B> <B>Canada, the United States </B>and <B>Australia</B>.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In <B>Africa</B>, evidence suggests that the employment of children as domestic servants often includes sexual exploitation.  There are also indications that children are employed in hotels, restaurants and brothels, where they are sexually exploited.  Additionally, there is evidence of commercial sexual exploitation of children  particularly girls  in refugee camps, where the large number of single men assembled in one place drives demand for sex, and of exploitation of camp children by men in surrounding communities.  This same phenomenon underlies the evidence of children  this time often young boys  recruited into the armed forces not only to fight but to service the soldiers  In many parts of Africa, governments continue to deny that the problem exists.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In the <B>Middle East</B>, too, some governments deny the problem exists.  The recruitment of children as domestic help, however, is common and, as in Africa, often extends to use of the children for sexual purposes.  Moreover, early marriage has been seen as a convenient means of legitimising sex with children and fuelling demand.  In such situations, there is invariably an exchange of money or goods.  The practice of polygamy is considered by some to reinforce the low status of women and girls and lead to a denial of their dignity and rights, making them vulnerable to exploitation.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This outline picture of the range and varieties of commercial sexual exploitation of children in the world only hints at the complexity of the problem.  The covert nature of the activity, moreover, means that precise data are difficult to obtain, and the not infrequent involvement of local authorities and law enforcement agents means that often those who should be identifying and reporting the incidence of commercial sexual exploitation are hiding the facts.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>What is beyond doubt, however, is that <B>worldwide children are being sold into sex</B>.  It has been estimated that every year one million children are in the sex trade, exploited by people or by circumstance.  </H4>

<P><H2>Scope of the problem</H2><BR>

<H4>Because of the criminal nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children, it is difficult to collect accurate data.  However, it is known to be a multi-billion dollar sex trade, into which each year some one million children are drawn.  Research suggests that the age of the children involved is decreasing.  Most are poor children between the ages of 13 and 18, although there is evidence that very young children, babies even, are also caught up in this horrific trade.  They come from all parts of the world.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The Council of Europe began collecting data in the late 1980s and, in a submission to the Council in 1988, it was estimated that some 5,000 boys and 3,000 girls were working in the streets of Paris alone, although this estimate was later queried.  The non-governmental organisation Defence of the Child International has cited 1,000 children working as prostitutes in the Netherlands.  A study published in 1996 underlines the alarming growth of prostitution among Russian, Polish, Romanian, Hungarian and Czech children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In Asia, because groups working against commercial sexual exploitation of children have been active there for longer and have been able to build up a more accurate picture, data  are more complete.  As a result, it often seems that Asia is the worst affected region.  In 1991, a survey by India Today put the number of child prostitutes in India between 400,000 and 500,000.  Estimates of the child sex industry in Thailand vary between 80,000 and 800,000.  This latter figure comes from the Centre for the Protection of Childrens Rights, which has been working in the field for 18 years.  In Indochina, after a decade of restriction on most forms of prostitution under communist regimes, Vietnam and Cambodia have serious problems of child prostitution and trafficking.  Sri Lankas sex industry is known to have grown to around 20,000 children today.  The problem of young girls, in particular, being kidnapped in Nepal and shipped across the border to India is acute.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>A recent survey in the Dominican Republic estimated that some 25,400 minors were engaged in prostitution.  A June 1994 study in Colombia counted 3,000 minors working as prostitutes in the capital Bogota alone.  In many other parts of the South and Central America, including Brazil, the problem of street children working in prostitution is well documented.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Data on Africa is scarce, but many of the conditions that underlie commercial sexual exploitation of children are common there:  poverty, family disintegration, wars in Mozambique, Sudan, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia and Angola in recent years.  Such conflicts devastate normal social mechanisms, separate families, expose women and children to widespread and systematic abuse and leave children, in particular, isolated and vulnerable to exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some of these same factors:  economic inequalities, family dysfunction, isolation, lack of support structures, abuse and breakdown of moral values, also underlie much of the commercial sexual exploitation of children in developed countries.  Substance abuse also plays a part, as children and exploiters look to earn money to support drug habits by selling sex.  As a result, it is known that there are increasingly large numbers of children being exploited on the streets of New York, London, Paris, Sydney.  </H4>

<P><H2>Contributing Factors</H2><BR>

<H4>The causes of commercial sexual exploitation of children are diverse.  Although it may be easy to place blame on criminal syndicates, to reduce exploiters to pimps and perverts, to disparage the children themselves as promiscuous or sexually irresponsible, no social sector can escape responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The underlying causes are numerous, and include:  economic injustice and resulting disparities between rich and poor, large-scale migration and urbanisation, family disintegration.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>They include historic and continuing cultural values which discriminate against girls and women, the influx of materialist values and goods, perpetrated by the media, and the subsequent deterioration of traditional community and cultural support systems.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Ignorance certainly plays a role in the commercial sexual exploitation of children but is something that can be remedied.  In particular, educating parents on the fate of their children sold into labour, bondage and sex, would reduce the numbers of parents willing to even consider such sale.  In some parts of the world, such as Nepal, local community groups are working with the press and media to show parents what can happen when they deliver their children into the hands of an agent who promises money and a better life.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Consumerism is a major factor in the increasing incidence of commercial sexual exploitation of children. The push to own, buy, rent, have  fuelled by advertising, TV and video images, magazines and entertainment media  encourages those who do not value their children and respect their rights to quite simply trade them for something they want more.  In some parts of the world children themselves, faced with the competition of peers and the desire to keep up, sell their bodies for the money to buy consumer items they cannot otherwise afford.  They are exploited by circumstance, by a society which constantly tells them that possessions are more important than dignity.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>&quot;Contact&quot; refers to what happens when a community  is subjected to values and behaviour which are different from its own, usually over a long period.  Some researchers believe that this factor was at play in parts of Asia, for example, where communities such as those in the Philippines were host to large foreign armed services encampments, or UN contingents over a long time.  Aside from the threat often caused by stationing large contingents of men without their families and in a difficult, strange living situation, such an influx of outsiders can introduce into a society values, habits and demands which are not necessarily known or understood or, on the other hand, can make sexual practices that did occur in the host society, but which were considered exceptional or wrong, now seem not so unusual and therefore more acceptable.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In this way, abuse by outsiders sometimes grows out of an already existing local supply.  Vietnam is an example,  Following years of occupation by foreign military, it has been suggested that Vietnamese society was not only more ready to accept liberal attitudes towards sex in general but was also left with a developed sex trade which only survived after the troops had left by increasing demand among locals.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Allied to foreign contact is widespread contact with myths originating in other countries.  There is a widely-held belief in Asia, for example, based on a Chinese myth, that sex with a virgin improves business and power.  Since virginity is associated with youth, this myth contact often underlies sexual exploitation of children.  Such contact is also common in Africa</H4>

<P><H2>The sex exploiter</H2><BR>

<H4>The people who have sex with children vary from those who choose to engage in this activity, to those who do not care, to those who do not realise.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>First and most easily distinguishable -- but in the minority -- are paedophiles.  Paedophilia is a condition in which adults prefer to have sex with pre-pubescent girls and boys.  Paedophile behaviour follows quite defined patterns:  often paedophiles put themselves in situations where they come regularly into contact with children.  They find relationships with adults difficult but claim to have a &quot;caring&quot; relationship with a child, often suggesting that they are paying the child for sex in order to help the child and its family financially, or to help the child to learn about sex from a caring person.  Paedophiles regularly obtain pornography involving children and are &quot;collectors&quot; of photos, videos and other keepsakes of the children they come into contact with, in order to &quot;freeze&quot; the age of the child and replay it time and again.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There are also people who do not care whether their sexual partner is a child or not.  The globalised flow of money has increased demand for commercial sex, and many exploiters are local men, often regular users of commercial sex workers, who do not distinguish on the basis of age.  In some cases, demand for children for sex is based on a belief that children are less likely to have had multiple partners, and so are less likely to transmit infection.  In some instances, there are myths that having sex with children can cure disease, rejuvenate or even improve business.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some people have sex with children without questioning the age of the partner.  They may be people who, in &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, would not choose to have sex with a child but for a variety of reasons do.  These reasons include:  the freedom of a holiday in a foreign &quot;exotic&quot; location, being drunk or affected by drugs, ignorance or lack of care in recognising the likelihood that an offered partner is under-age.  Such ignorance is not excusable</H4>

<P><H2>Pornography</H2><BR>

<H4>Child pornography is the &quot;sexually explicit reproduction of a child's image&quot;.  It is, in itself, a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children.  Encouraging, forcing or fooling children (often with the use of drugs) to pose for pornographic photographs, or take part in pornographic videos, is demeaning and designed to take away a childs dignity and self-respect.  It reduces the value of the childs body to nothing, teaching the child that the body is for sale and has no other value.  It can consequently often be a first step on the road to prostitution or a part of prostitution.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Often, also, child pornography involves coercion and violence.  Not only are these sometimes part of the story line of a video or photo shoot, they are regularly inflicted on the unwilling child to secure submission and cooperation.  Some exploiters satisfy their sexual fantasies by producing child pornography, or playing a part in shoots themselves.  Some of the actors in child porn are exploiters who gain pleasure from the production of the materials.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Child pornography is also, once produced, a means of fuelling demand for child sex.  Images of children engaged in sex, or posing in lewd poses, whether still or video  are used to titillate and increase demand.  Advances in technology have made child pornography easier to produce, more difficult to stop and easier to distribute.  In particular, the availability of the home video camera, editing and reproduction equipment has made home video easy and cheap.  The advent of computer graphics and global transmission via the Internet means that images can now be transmitted worldwide and downloaded at home.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Significant research into child pornography began in the mid-1980s, and in 1987 a report pointed to Europe as the source of most pornographic films and photos.  INTERPOL has cited Germany as a major producer, the Netherlands and the UK as distribution centres and the US as the largest market, with annual turnover of US$1 billion in 1980.  New laws in the eighties have more recently shifted much of the industry to South East Asia.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Such laws have gone some way to outlawing pornography but they are now becoming obsolete in countries where the advance of technology has enabled pornography producers to create images using a computer-generated child. As a result, laws which protect children do not always take into account situations where a computer image, not a real child, is used.</H4>

<P><H2>Family</H2><BR>

<H4>Families are the first nurturers, educators and protectors of children and their rights.  Family values are essential to the child's perception of itself and the world in which it lives.  When, for whatever reason, the family does not fulfil this obligation and trust, the child's first line of defence against an incomprehensible and unsafe world breaks down</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Worldwide, researchers have noted the strong correlation between family abuse of children, especially girls, and the drive to enter the sex trade.  The mother, in particular, plays a central role in her daughter's life decisions.  Widespread evidence of family involvement in the direct commercial sexual exploitation of children is disturbing but perhaps not surprising, given the heavy burden of severe economic inequities and hardships under which many families labour.  Carriers of poverty and despair, inherited and newly dislocating values that view children and property and hence as a source of economic support, families pass these values and their consequences on to their children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In fact, most often, parents who sell their children into the sex trade do so unwittingly.  They are told, and believe, that their children are going into domestic service or some other form of labour, or marriage.  Many remain ignorant of the eventual fate of their working children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>However, some parents sell their children into the sex trade in full awareness of where they are going, although not always of the potential consequences of such activity.  It has been reported that, in some parts of Asia, families who traditionally have wished for sons to work for the family now hope to have girl children to sell, since their earning potential is greater.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Poverty is often quoted as the underlying cause of sale of children into labour, but it is important to note that not all poor families sell their children.   What pushes a poor family to make money by selling a child has been called poverty plus the closing of options.  It often involves an already poor family facing unemployment, forced migration, stigmatisation by the community, substance dependency or raised expectations from contact with consumerism.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Sometimes, however, a child is sold into commercial sex by parents who have themselves sexually or otherwise abused the child.  The child is then seen as ready for sex and able to earn money for the family.  The handing-over of a sum of money to the parents puts the child into debt bondage, a situation in which the child is forced to provide sex to earn money to repay the familys debt to the exploiter.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Another thing to note when looking at family issues involved in commercial sexual exploitation of children is how the family reacts when a child who has worked in the sex trade is able to escape and return home (sometimes alone, sometimes helped by organisations working to release children from exploitation).  Sometimes the family cannot  or will not  cope with the stigma of having a former prostitute in the family, and rejects the child.  There is then a great danger that the child might return to prostitution, or be returned to it.  The cycle begins again.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There are also indications that older siblings or other female family members take up or contribute to prostitution to protect  younger siblings from being pulled into the trade.</H4>

<P><H2>Children as commodities</H2><BR>

<H4>Commercial sexual exploitation of children has many characteristics of an organised industry sector:  from small businesses to large enterprises, with bank accounts, advertising campaigns and glossy brochures.  There are marketers who use technology to sell the product, hierarchies of profit-takers (always with the child on the bottom of the ladder) and strategic planners who work to protect and promote good business.  This industry is a flagrant abuse of children, involving deception, kidnapping, enslavement, smuggling, false passports, bribery, and corruption at many levels.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In recent years, the demand for children for sex has increased.  The reasons for this include rising incomes and  purchasing power which have put children as goods within the reach of more people.  Misconceptions about childrens immunity to infection including HIV/AIDS, a proliferation of entertainment services which titillate and tease, and the growing consumerism of recently industrialised societies also create an environment in which children are devalued, reduced to the level of consumer disposables, available for sale and abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Media interest in child pornography and prostitution can unintentionally fuel demand, and the ease of access of information both opens up supply routes and increases demand.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The same causal factors are at play in both demand and supply.  However, what comes into particular play in the supply side of the equation is human greed.  These economic and sociological factors provide the supply of children for sale and perpetuate the opportunities for the middle man (or woman)  the pimp, brothel owner, madam or other racketeer whose sole aim is to make money from child sex  who bridges the gap between supply and demand, ensuring supply and fuelling demand.  </H4>

<P><H2>Impact</H2><BR>

<H4>The impact of commercial sexual exploitation on a child is enormous.  The child loses its childhood, its dignity, often its future.  These are unquantifiable costs, but there are consequences of exploitation which are more readily measurable.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The most obvious of these relates to the health of the child. HIV/AIDS is both a cause and a consequence of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The evidence shows that in some parts of the world, children are being chosen as sex partners in the mistaken belief that sex with a child is safer.  Having sex with a child, it is thought, protects the abuser from HIV/AIDS because the child is more likely to be clean and to have had fewer sex partners.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Quite the opposite is true.  Because of their vulnerability and weakness, children in prostitution are often forced to take more clients than an adult might accept, and are generally powerless to ask the client to use a condom.    Moreover, children are physically more vulnerable to infection, not only because they are more easily damaged internally (and are often treated with violence by their clients), but also because young membranes are more porous.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The pure virgin child is sought by many customers as the safest bet.  Reconstructive surgery is common practice, so that some commercially sexually exploited children are sold as virgins even though they have had multiple sex partners.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The reality is that many children forced into commercial sex are becoming infected with HIV.  Children rescued from brothels in parts of South East Asia are immediately tested for HIV/AIDS.  Rates of 50 per cent positive are normal, with up to 90 per cent seropositivity being found in some cases.  Not only is this in itself a death sentence, it also means that what is left of a childs life may well be a time of loss of family and community, dignity and options.  HIV-positive children face discrimination and rejection.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There are other serious physical and psychological repercussions of forcing children into sex.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Children are robbed of their childhood and of the leisure of formative years.  This deprivation leaves scars that can take years to heal.  Children lose trust in others, particularly adults, and become vulnerable to further exploitation.  They also become more liable to grow into exploiters themselves in turn.  They lose self-respect and dignity, and can develop a range of post-traumatic stress symptoms such as depression, aggression and violence, loss of self-control and self-mutilation.  Their lives frequently end in suicide.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>And there are long-lasting physical effects.  Not only are children trapped in the cycle of commercial sexual exploitation often physically abused, beaten, burned, tortured and deprived of food, air, light and movement, they are also vulnerable to kidney infections, cervical cancer, early and repeated pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Numerous studies have also shown high levels of substance abuse by children involved in prostitution.  Drugs are often used to keep children taken into prostitution submissive.  They may also be a self-medicating means to numb the pain of hunger or despair.  </H4>

<P><H2>Legal protection</H2><BR>

<H4>The majority of police and law enforcement agencies around the world are working to combat commercial sexual exploitation of children.  Internationally INTERPOL, for example, has a Standing Working Party on Offences against Minors, which includes representatives  of non-governmental organisations working against commercial sexual exploitation of children, and has been active in promoting extraterritorial legislation, detection and conviction of criminals.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>At the national level, most countries do have laws making abuse of children a crime.  Additionally, 188 countries (at 1 May 1996) have signed or ratified the United Nations <I>Convention on the Rights of the Child</I> and have enacted legislation in its wake to help them keep the promises they have made by signing this important Convention.  There are also many divers national laws which prohibit or otherwise regulate under-age sex, prostitution, pornography, kidnapping, enslavement, abuse  a whole range of criminal acts, in fact, which occur in the arena of commercial sexual exploitation of children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In recent years there has been growing awareness, too, of the transnational nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children.  Pornography and children are trafficked across borders.  Exploiters travel to set up their networks.  Clients travel to buy services on foreign shores.  Inter-government cooperation is consequently absolutely vital, not only in defining the problem but also in policing it, cracking down on it and then publicising successful convictions.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Several countries have enacted extraterritorial legislation which, with the cooperation of other governments, allows them to investigate crimes outside their country of jurisdiction and/or bring their nationals to justice when they return home.  As a result, the phenomenon of foreigners arrested for child sex crimes bribing their way to freedom and escaping to their home country no longer offers protection.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Ironically, existing laws often punish the children more than the exploiters.  Between 1989 and 1993, for example, 1,500 convictions were secured in England and Wales against children for offences relating to prostitution.  Other laws cause trafficked children to be deported, back to the place  which sold them in the first place.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It has also been clearly documented that children found in brothels, massage parlours, the streets or other places where they are being sexually exploited for profit are often locked up in cells with adults who abuse them.  In western countries, often their faces are shown in the press and media whereas the face of the adult exploiter is masked to protect his or her identity, and they are treated as criminals.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>But making laws is not the same as enforcing them.  It is certainly difficult to make laws work well against covert activity. It is more difficult when, as in some documented cases, local law enforcers are themselves involved in corruption and make a profit from exploiting the children.  It is often neglected, for example, in the face of pressures to promote tourism in a country and authorities turn a blind eye to activity which otherwise brings revenue.  But laws must be enforced.  They are the ultimate protection for children, and not enough is being done either to make laws sufficiently strong or to enforce them when they are in place.</H4>

<P><H2>Rescue and reintegration</H2><BR>

<H4>What happens to children rescued from prostitution?  Often nothing, which is part of the problem.  NGOs working in this field conduct rescue missions to deliver children from the slavery of commercial sexual exploitation, but support services are not yet developed to cope with the overwhelming needs of rescued children:  needs which embrace health services including psychological and trauma support, the difficulties -- perhaps even impossibility -- of reintegrating sexually exploited children into their communities, and the stigma and lack of understanding facing them.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>First of all, children rescued from prostitution must be returned, where possible, to good health.  They have been physically and mentally abused, and their physical and mental health must be re-established.  Sometimes the physical harm cannot be entirely undone:  children who are HIV-positive, for example, or who have become infertile through STD infection, will continue to live with the results of their exploitation.  Mental good health is supported through counselling specifically aimed at children who have been exploited.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Rehabilitation also aims to help survivors of commercial sexual exploitation to reduce their vulnerability in future.  Children receive training in skills which will allow them to earn a living and support themselves.  They may have the opportunity to live in a shelter specifically designed to put training and counselling at their disposal.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Perhaps the most difficult step on the road to rehabilitation, however, is restoration of family and friends, of home life and self-esteem within society.  In many instances, children who have been exploited in prostitution are not accepted back into the family or community because of the stigma associated with the work they have been forced to perform.  This is particularly true if they are HIV-positive and additionally in such cases, the question of confidentiality of the HIV status of a child further complicates the situation.  In such cases, a new home must be found in order to prevent the child from falling back into the grips of exploiters.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The vulnerability of children who have been commercially sexually exploited is great, and it is vital that, once rescued, they should not be put into a position of increased or similar vulnerability, either because they have no family or community support, no means to earn a living, illegal status in a country, poor health or any form of dependency.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Many NGOs and international agencies work across this range of issues to provide support for the rescued child and to build a future for the child in which he or she will not be exploited again and will not become an exploiter in turn.</H4>

<P><H2>Technology and the media</H2><BR>

<H4>The enormous advances in technology have made child pornography  a major factor in commercial sexual exploitation of children  easier, cheaper, difficult to detect and easy to distribute.  Camcorders, VCRs, home editing desks, computer-generated graphics and editing:  all these have moved the child porn industry into the home, where it is more difficult to police and has developed into a multi-million dollar industry.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The advent of the Internet has opened up new channels of information for those seeking access to children for sex.  The inter-active nature of Internet technology means that information can be shared real-time and special requests dealt with by procurers and suppliers of children for sex.  Pornographic images and video clips can be uploaded almost anonymously and downloaded equally anonymously.  At the moment, the only intervention point for law enforcers seems to be via service providers, who can refuse to sell space to anyone they know is providing child sex materials.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Beyond technology, the press and media also play a major role in the domain of commercial sexual exploitation of children, both positive and negative.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>On the negative side, the media have undoubtedly contributed to the liberalisation of sexually explicit imagery, and to shifts in moral values.  Satellite technology, international travel and a breakdown in support infrastructures means that such images are often received in a non-supportive context, or even in a whole society for which they were not specifically intended.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Many television viewers are adolescents, and the attitude of some media to adolescence itself -- the so-called &quot;Beavis and Butthead syndrome&quot; which shows adolescents as worthless and easily exploitable -- can contribute to young people's images of themselves and their place in society.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Also on the negative side, many well-meaning reporters investigating commercial sexual exploitation of children have reported  information which has helped exploiters  street names, location of villages, readily identifiable pictures of beaches and so on.  Often, too, the temptation to broadcast or print sensational pictures has itself verged on pornography and thus on exploitation, and has given rise to criticisms of titillation television.  In a few cases, journalists have unwittingly corrupted evidence by paying for stories, enabling criminals to escape conviction on a technicality.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>But the role of the press and media can also be immensely positive.  Journalists have access to information which others ordinarily find difficult to obtain.  They have worked hand-in-hand with non-governmental organisations and police to locate exploiters and places of exploitation and uncover them, and they have then reported arrests and convictions, contributing to deterrence.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The press and media can also contribute greatly to advocacy, underlining positive moral values and human rights.  They can support positive family values and inform parents when their children are at risk.  They help the children themselves to draw moral lines on their own behaviour and to identify risk factors or situations in which they might be endangered.  They are the most powerful educators.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Most important of all, press and media have recognised that they are important players in the whole area of commercial sexual exploitation of children, and are actively engaged in debate to examine their role and commit to the ethical underpinnings of their calling.</H4>

<P><H2>Child sex tourism</H2><BR>

<H4>Sexually-oriented tourism is a developed arm of the exploitation industry, with its own paraphernalia of promotional materials ranging from glossy brochures, through organised clubs to the availability of tour information on the Internet.  This interactive technology makes information and advice available and allows clients to customize their holiday requirements in advance.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Developed sex tour industries have been documented in the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand.  More recently, sex tours from North America to Brazil and the Dominican Republic have increased.  In Sri Lanka, several thousand boys are reported to be available for sex with male tourists in some areas.  It is likely that sex tours in the countries of Eastern Europe are increasing.   Today, also, most sex tourists travel singly or in pairs on normal air flights.  In the past, sex tours were easy to identify and to condemn, so those who organise sex tours today send their customers in a less obtrusive manner.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Since 1990 ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) has been monitoring and acting against sex tourism in Asia and, in recent times, elsewhere.   ECPAT has been successful in promoting transnational governmental cooperation, extraterritorial legislation which allows governments to bring their nationals to trial for crimes committed in other countries, and in drawing public attention to the arrest, detention and conviction of paedophiles engaged in sex tourism.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>ECPAT has also successfully engaged the interest and commitment of world tourism authorities, travel agents. holiday guide publishers and tour promoters in actively working against sex tourism.</H4>

<P><H2>Trafficking routes</H2><BR>

<H4>In 1987, a report to the Council of Europe identified five international trafficking networks into Europe known to involve children:</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Latin America to Europe and the Middle East</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	South East Asia to northern Europe and the Middle East</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	a European regional market</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	an Arab regional market</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	exports of girls from West Africa.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In Eastern Europe today, the traffic generally moves east to west.  Girls from </H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Russia, Ukraine and White Russia are transported in 				significant numbers to Poland, Hungary, the Baltic states, or on 		to </H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	western European capitals, joined by girls from bordering 			countries.  </H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Researchers have also identified traffic in Romanian 				prostitutes to Italy, Cyprus and Turkey.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There are also several well defined routes in South East Asia:</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Myanmar (Burma) to Thailand</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Southern China to Thailand via Myanmar</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Cambodia and Vietnam to Thailand</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Internally within Thailand and other countries where child 			prostitution is common</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	To China, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and the US</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Thailand and the Philippines, as well as some other less well			documented countries, to Australia, New Zealand and 				Taiwan</H4>
<P>
<H4>	 	Nepal and Bangladesh to India</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The most lucrative child trafficking routes are from South East Asia to Japan and Hawaii via Hong Kong.  The trafficking of South Asians (from India and Pakistan) to the Middle East is also extensive.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Undoubtedly there are other routes.  </H4>

<P><H2>Stopping it</H2><BR>

<H4>The counter-offensive against commercial sexual exploitation of children is working at many different levels.  Non-governmental organisations and UN agencies  have for some years been involved in investigation and monitoring, identifying children at risk and already involved, and identifying and bringing exploiters to justice where possible.  NGOs have also been instrumental in encouraging governments to enact extraterritoriality laws, and have worked with tourism organisations to mobilise their help in combating child sex tourism.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The NGO coalition ECPAT has published widely, in many languages, and has mobilised the press and media to raise public awareness to unprecedented levels.  It was thanks to an initiative of ECPAT that the first World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children was proposed and that the Swedish Government offered to host it in Stockholm in August 1996.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Recovery and reintegration work is complex.  Some communities find it difficult to accept returning children, and it then falls to NGOs to help integrate these children into new communities.  NGOs also set up centres for those who can return, and offer vocational training to give the children a means to earn their livelihood, counselling and other services.  More than a thousand NGOs work with street children.  Others work specifically with HIV-positive children and in other areas of health care.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>UN agencies work alongside NGOs, for example in Cambodia, on projects to monitor and mitigate trafficking of children.  More specifically, UNICEF and NGOs work together  on long-term prevention programmes and in the area of policy formulation, advocacy and regulation.  UNICEFs focus includes girls education, education for street children, health outreach, policy development and training on child rights, communication and advocacy.  UNICEF also supports programmes and focuses on preventive measures.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>UN agencies and NGOS are also actively involved in encouraging and contributing to the training of legal professionals, police enforcement agencies and others in areas where the commercial sexual exploitation of children is involved, for example in cross-border operations.</H4>

<P><H2>The World Congress</H2><BR>

<H4>The World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, from August 27 to 31 1996, was part of the broader process of protecting childrens rights.  It focused on three elements of the commercial sexual exploitation of children:  child prostitution, the trafficking and sale of children for sexual purposes, and child pornography.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The primary purpose of the Congress was to draw international attention to the problems of commercial sexual exploitation of children and to promote the development of national policies and programmes to combat all forms of such exploitation in the specific contexts in which they occur.  To this end, the Congress considerd and adopted a Declaration and Agenda for Action.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The Congress provided an open forum for discussion through workshops and presentation of case studies, in which all segments of society exchanged experiences.  It defined the scope of the problem, explored the underlying causes and the specific forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children in different countries and regions.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The most important aim, however, was to lay the groundwork for national action by increasing awareness, forging national partnerships and coalitions involving governments, NGOs, civil society and international organisations.  The Congress was only a step in this important process.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It took place at this time because some aspects of sexual exploitation of children are clearly growing.  The spread of HIV/AIDS and globalisation have led to an increase in exploitation.  Additionally, the international community has become increasingly aware of the problem, and the level of outrage has grown.  This Congress was the first international attempt to co-ordinate international co-operation on transnational issues and to bring together international players.</H4>

<P><H2>Care-takers</H2><BR>

<H4>Many people devote their lives to taking care of children, and it is important to recognise that such people are motivated by a deep, generous desire to make the world a better place for children to live in.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In a way, such people are exploited too, by those who abuse the position of care-taker to gain access to children and earn their trust, setting them up for abuse and exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>At the same time,  in countries of the industrialised world in particular, there have been recent examples of men (and sometimes women) who take up employment in childrens agencies, local authority departments, organisations like scouts and guides, youth clubs and half-way houses for street kids, specifically to put them in a position where they can identify and have access to vulnerable children, gain their trust and encourage them to pose for pornographic pictures or videos, engage in sex or provide sex to others in exchange for favours.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Such people often escape detection because they are in positions of trust, and even those who may have concerns about their habits or behaviour find it difficult to believe that they might be involved in sexually exploiting children.  </H4>
<P>
<H4>Australia, even as this document is being prepared, has announced a Police Royal Commission into childrens service organisations in local government in New South Wales, following documented examples of government workers engaged in organised paedophilia, child pornography and sexual exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In some developing countries, care-takers find their equivalents in procurers who entrap children by setting up bogus street children centres or vocational training establishments, or by organising beauty contests or charm and fashion contests.  Often children are trapped in such institutions because they are far removed from their families, in unknown areas or countries with a different language.  Even if they escape, they often face being charged with illegal immigrant status.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Ultimately all social sectors are responsible for taking care of children, and all must accept responsibility for allowing their exploitation to continue.  The vast majority of people do not exploit children, but are silently complicit.</H4>

<P><H2>Vue d'ensemble</H2><BR>
Quels qu'en soient les causes profondes, les agents impliqu&eacute;s ou les questions associ&eacute;es, l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales est toujours d&eacute;finie fondamentalement de la m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re: c'est <I>l'exploitation, &agrave; des fins sexuelles, et pour un profit financier ou en nature, d'un enfant</I> (d&eacute;fini dans la <B>Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant</B> comme tout &ecirc;tre humain de moins de 18 ans sauf si un pays particulier accorde la majorit&eacute; plut t&ocirc;t). Il s'agit d'une forme extr&ecirc;mement dangereuse de travail des enfants, un abus de pouvoir sur les enfants et une fa&ccedil;on de les dominer.<BR>

<P>De plus, bien que le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne du &quot;tourisme sexuel&quot; - qui concerne essentiellement des hommes se rendant &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger pour s'y livrer &agrave; des pratiques sexuelles sur des enfants - ait fait l'objet de nombreuses &eacute;tudes, l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales est au premier chef une question locale, les clients et les agents &eacute;tant originaires de la communaut&eacute; autochtone.<BR>

<P>La nature exacte de l'exploitation diff&egrave;re d'un pays &agrave; l'autre. En <B>Asie</B>, par exemple, l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement le fait d'une client&egrave;le locale masculine qui a recours aux services d'enfants prostitu&eacute;s, ou du &quot;tourisme sexuel&quot;. Il arrive que les enfants soient vendus sur le march&eacute; du sexe par des parents ou des amis, quelquefois en connaissance de cause, d'autres fois avec l'id&eacute;e erron&eacute;e que les enfants deviendront domestiques ou gagneront d'une autre mani&egrave;re de l'argent pour la famille. Les enfants sont parfois enlev&eacute;s, transport&eacute;s clandestinement &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger ou de la campagne &agrave; la ville, et sont sans cesse transf&eacute;r&eacute;s afin de &quot;dispara&icirc;tre&quot; effectivement.<BR>

<P>En <B>Am&eacute;rique du Sud</B>, l'information &eacute;mane principalement des personnes travaillant avec des enfants qui sont d&eacute;j&agrave; forc&eacute;s de gagner leur vie dans les rues et peuvent en dernier ressort choisir ou &ecirc;tre oblig&eacute;s de s'adonner &agrave; la prostitution. En raison de la pr&eacute;carit&eacute; de leur situation, ils sont vuln&eacute;rables aux souteneurs et autres d&eacute;linquants qui les exploitent &agrave; leur profit et leur offrent une &quot;protection&quot; qui cache de mauvais traitements, souvent des violences et trop fr&eacute;quemment la toxicomanie. Quelquefois, n&eacute;anmoins, ces enfants se livrent &quot;volontairement&quot; au commerce du sexe, cherchant ainsi &agrave; gagner davantage qu'avec d'autres formes de travail des rues, pour financer leurs besoins de drogue, acheter des biens de consommation qui seraient autrement hors de leur port&eacute;e ou simplement manger. <BR>

<P>En <B>Europe</B>, les enfants font l'objet d'un trafic depuis les pays pauvres de l'Est vers les pays riches du continent o&ugrave; le march&eacute; des enfants est aliment&eacute; par des r&eacute;seaux p&eacute;dophiles organis&eacute;s et des services d'information de pointe. On a &eacute;galement enregistr&eacute; une augmentation de la prostitution des enfants due au consum&eacute;risme effr&eacute;n&eacute; et aux pressions de la publicit&eacute; et des attentes qui poussent les enfants dans le commerce du sexe afin de se procurer des articles tr&egrave;s co&ucirc;teux ou de la drogue. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne existe &eacute;galement dans des pays industrialis&eacute;s comme le <B>Royaume-Uni, le Canada, les Etats-Unis et l'Australie</B>.<BR>

<P>En <B>Afrique</B>, tout indique que l'emploi d'enfants comme domestiques va souvent de pair avec l'exploitation sexuelle. Il semble &eacute;galement que des enfants soient employ&eacute;s dans des h&ocirc;tels, des restaurants et des maisons de passe qui les exploitent sexuellement. De plus, on dispose des preuves de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants - en particulier de fillettes - &agrave; des fins commerciales dans les camps de r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s, o&ugrave; les hommes seuls qui y sont rassembl&eacute;s en grand nombre cr&eacute;ent une demande de sexe, et de l'exploitation des enfants des camps par les hommes vivant dans les communaut&eacute;s environnantes. C'est le m&ecirc;me ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne qui explique que des enfants - cette fois souvent de jeunes gar&ccedil;ons - soient recrut&eacute;s dans les forces arm&eacute;es non seulement pour combattre, mais aussi pour se pr&ecirc;ter aux d&eacute;sirs des soldats. Dans de nombreuses r&eacute;gions d'Afrique, les gouvernements continuent de nier que le probl&egrave;me existe.<BR>

<P>Au <B>Moyen-Orient</B> aussi, certains gouvernements d&eacute;mentissent l'existence du probl&egrave;me. Pourtant, le recrutement d'enfants comme domestiques est fr&eacute;quent et, comme en Afrique, il comporte souvent l'emploi des enfants &agrave; des fins sexuelles. En outre, les mariages pr&eacute;coces ont &eacute;t&eacute; consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme un moyen pratique de &quot;l&eacute;gitimer&quot; les relations sexuelles avec des enfants et d'alimenter la demande. Dans ces situations, on proc&egrave;de invariablement &agrave; un &eacute;change d'argent ou de biens. Certains estiment que la pratique de la polygamie renforce le statut inf&eacute;rieur des femmes et des jeunes filles et leur retire dignit&eacute; et droits, les rendant vuln&eacute;rables &agrave; l'exploitation.<BR>

<P>Cet aper&ccedil;u de l'ampleur et de la diversit&eacute; de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales dans le monde ne fait qu'esquisser la complexit&eacute; du probl&egrave;me. De surcro&icirc;t, le secret dont cette activit&eacute; s'entoure rend difficile d'obtenir des donn&eacute;es pr&eacute;cises et, puisqu'il n'est pas rare que des autorit&eacute;s locales et des agents charg&eacute;s de faire appliquer la loi soient impliqu&eacute;s dans cette activit&eacute;, ceux qui devraient d&eacute;couvrir et signaler l'incidence de l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale la cachent.<BR>

<P>Il ne fait n&eacute;anmoins aucun doute que, de par le monde, des enfants sont vendus sur le march&eacute; du sexe. On a estim&eacute; que, chaque ann&eacute;e, un million d'enfants pratiquent le commerce du sexe, exploit&eacute;s par des individus ou pouss&eacute;s par les circonstances.<BR>

<P><I>Note: Les descriptions r&eacute;gionales donn&eacute;es ici sont simplifi&eacute;es afin de brosser un tableau d'ensemble des principales caract&eacute;ristiques de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales dans diff&eacute;rentes r&eacute;gions. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne est complexe et peut rev&ecirc;tir de nombreuses formes. N&eacute;anmoins, les descriptions indiquent la forme d'exploitation qui est habituellement jug&eacute;e pr&eacute;dominante dans chaque r&eacute;gion.</I>

<P><H2>L'ampleur du probl&egrave;me</H2><BR>
En raison de la nature criminelle de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales, il est difficile de recueillir des donn&eacute;es dignes de foi. N&eacute;anmoins, on sait que le commerce du sexe brasse plusieurs milliards de dollars et qu'il attire dans ses filets environ un million d'enfants chaque ann&eacute;e. La recherche indique que l'&acirc;ge des enfants concern&eacute;s diminue. Il s'agit pour la plupart d'enfants pauvres de 13 &agrave; 18 ans, bien que l'on sache que de tr&egrave;s jeunes enfants, et m&ecirc;me des b&eacute;b&eacute;s, sont pris au pi&egrave;ge de ce commerce odieux. Ils viennent de toutes les r&eacute;gions du monde.<BR>

<P>Le Conseil de l'Europe a commenc&eacute; &agrave; recueillir des donn&eacute;es &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 80 et une &eacute;tude pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e au Conseil en 1988 estimait qu'environ 5 000 gar&ccedil;ons et 3 000 filles travaillaient rien que dans les rues de Paris, bien que cette estimation ait &eacute;t&eacute; ult&eacute;rieurement contest&eacute;e. L'organisation non gouvernementale Defence of the Child International a cit&eacute; le chiffre d'un millier d'enfants travaillant comme prostitu&eacute;s aux Pays-Bas. Une &eacute;tude publi&eacute;e en 1996 souligne la croissance inqui&eacute;tante de la prostitution parmi les enfants russes, polonais, roumains, hongrois et tch&egrave;ques.<BR>

<P>En Asie, o&ugrave; les groupes travaillant contre l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale des enfants sont actifs depuis plus longtemps et ont pu peindre une image plus exacte, les donn&eacute;es sont plus compl&egrave;tes. En cons&eacute;quence, il semble souvent que l'Asie est la r&eacute;gion la plus touch&eacute;e. En 1991, une enqu&ecirc;te r&eacute;alis&eacute;e par India Today a &eacute;valu&eacute; le nombre d'enfants prostitu&eacute;s en Inde de 400 000 &agrave; 500 000. Les estimations du nombre d'enfants participant &agrave; l'industrie du sexe en Tha&iuml;lande oscille de 80 000 &agrave; 800 000. Ce dernier chiffre est donn&eacute; par le Centre de protection des droits de l'enfant, qui travaille sur le terrain depuis 18 ans. En Indochine, apr&egrave;s une d&eacute;cennie de restrictions de la plupart des formes de prostitution sous les r&eacute;gimes communistes, le Vietnam et le Cambodge connaissent de graves probl&egrave;mes de prostitution et de traite d'enfants. On sait que l'industrie du sexe au Sri Lanka touche jusqu'&agrave; 20 000 enfants aujourd'hui. Le probl&egrave;me des jeunes filles, en particulier, enlev&eacute;es au N&eacute;pal et transport&eacute;es clandestinement en Inde, est aigu.<BR>

<P>Une r&eacute;cente enqu&ecirc;te men&eacute;e dans la R&eacute;publique dominicaine estimait qu'environ 25 400 mineurs se livraient &agrave; la prostitution. Une &eacute;tude de juin 1994 en Colombie a d&eacute;nombr&eacute; 3 000 mineurs travaillant comme prostitu&eacute;s dans la seule capitale de Bogota. Dans de nombreuses autres r&eacute;gions d'Am&eacute;rique centrale et du Sud, y compris au Br&eacute;sil, le probl&egrave;me des enfants des rues qui se prostituent est tr&egrave;s bien document&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Les donn&eacute;es sur l'Afrique sont rares, mais beaucoup des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes qui sont &agrave; l'origine de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants y sont fr&eacute;quents: pauvret&eacute;, d&eacute;sint&eacute;gration de la famille, guerres ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es au Mozambique, au Soudan, au Lib&eacute;ria, au Rwanda, en Somalie et en Angola. Ces conflits d&eacute;truisent les m&eacute;canismes sociaux normaux, s&eacute;parent les familles, exposent les femmes et les enfants &agrave; des violences syst&eacute;matiques et g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;es et placent en particulier les enfants dans un &eacute;tat d'isolement et de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; &agrave; l'exploitation.<BR>

<P>Certains de ces m&ecirc;mes facteurs - in&eacute;galit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques, dysfonctionnement de la famille, isolement, manque de structures d'appui, violence et effondrement des valeurs morales - expliquent &eacute;galement une bonne part de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales dans les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s. La toxicomanie joue aussi un r&ocirc;le, puisque les enfants et les exploiteurs cherchent &agrave; gagner de l'argent pour satisfaire leurs besoins de drogue en vendant leur corps. Par cons&eacute;quent, on sait que des enfants sont de plus en plus nombreux &agrave; &ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;s dans les rues de New York, Londres, Paris et Sydney.

<P><H2>Les causes </H2><BR>
Les origines de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales sont diverses. Bien qu'il soit facile d'accuser les syndicats du crime, de juger que tous les exploiteurs sont des souteneurs et des pervers, de rabaisser les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes en les accusant d'immoralit&eacute; ou d'irresponsabilit&eacute; sexuelle, aucun secteur social n'est d&eacute;nu&eacute; de responsabilit&eacute; en mati&egrave;re d'exploitation sexuelle des enfants.<BR>

<P>Les causes profondes incluent: l'injustice &eacute;conomique et les disparit&eacute;s en r&eacute;sultant entre les riches et les pauvres, la migration et l'urbanisation &agrave; grande &eacute;chelle, la d&eacute;sint&eacute;gration de la famille. Elles comprennent des valeurs historiques et culturelles qui exercent une discrimination &agrave; l'encontre des filles et des femmes, l'apparition des valeurs mat&eacute;rialistes, propag&eacute;es par les m&eacute;dias, et la d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration subs&eacute;quente des syst&egrave;mes communautaires et culturels traditionnels de soutien.<BR>

<P>L'ignorance joue un r&ocirc;le dans l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. En particulier, informer les parents du sort qui attend leurs enfants vendus comme travailleurs, esclaves et prostitu&eacute;s r&eacute;duirait le nombre de parents souhaitant m&ecirc;me envisager une telle vente. Dans certaines r&eacute;gions du monde, comme au N&eacute;pal, les groupes communautaires locaux travaillent avec la presse et les m&eacute;dias pour montrer aux parents ce qui peut se produire quand ils remettent leurs enfants dans les mains d'un agent qui promet de l'argent et &quot;une vie meilleure&quot;.<BR>

<P>Le consum&eacute;risme est un facteur majeur. Le d&eacute;sir de poss&eacute;der, d'acheter, de louer, d'avoir - stimul&eacute; par la publicit&eacute;, les magazines et les m&eacute;dias - encourage ceux qui n'accordent pas de valeur &agrave; leurs enfants et ne respectent pas leurs droits &agrave; tout simplement les &eacute;changer contre quelque chose qu'ils souhaitent encore plus. Dans certaines r&eacute;gions du monde, les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes, en concurrence avec leurs camarades et voulant &quot;rester dans le coup&quot; vendent leur corps contre l'argent dont ils ont besoin pour acheter des biens de consommation qui seraient autrement hors de leur port&eacute;e. Ils sont exploit&eacute;s par les circonstances, par une soci&eacute;t&eacute; qui leur r&eacute;p&egrave;te constamment que les possessions sont plus importantes que la dignit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le &quot;contact&quot; se rapporte &agrave; ce qui arrive quand une communaut&eacute; entre en relation, sur une longue p&eacute;riode, avec des valeurs et des comportements diff&eacute;rents des siens. On pense que ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne a exerc&eacute; une influence dans certaines r&eacute;gions, en Asie par exemple o&ugrave; des communaut&eacute;s comme celles des Philippines ont accueilli pendant de longues ann&eacute;es des forces arm&eacute;es &eacute;trang&egrave;res ou des contingents des Nations Unies. Outre la menace fr&eacute;quemment caus&eacute;e par la pr&eacute;sence de nombreux soldats stationn&eacute;s sans leur famille dans un environnement difficile et &eacute;trange, un tel afflux d'&eacute;trangers peut introduire dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; des valeurs, des habitudes et des besoins qui ne sont pas n&eacute;cessairement connus ou compris ou, d'autre part, peuvent rendre des pratiques qui existaient dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; h&ocirc;te, mais &eacute;taient consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme exceptionnelles ou r&eacute;pr&eacute;hensibles, moins inhabituelles et donc plus acceptables.<BR>

<P>De cette mani&egrave;re, les abus perp&eacute;tr&eacute;s par des &eacute;trangers se d&eacute;veloppent sur le terrain d'une offre locale d&eacute;j&agrave; existante. Le Vietnam en est un exemple. Apr&egrave;s des ann&eacute;es d'&quot;occupation&quot; par des militaires &eacute;trangers, on pense que la soci&eacute;t&eacute; vietnamienne &eacute;taient non seulement plus pr&ecirc;te &agrave; accepter des attitudes lib&eacute;rales envers le sexe, mais qu'elle avait h&eacute;rit&eacute; d'un commerce du sexe d&eacute;velopp&eacute; qui n'a surv&eacute;cu apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;part des troupes qu'en stimulant la demande parmi la population locale. Il faut mettre en parall&egrave;le de ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne le contact avec des mythes originaires d'autres pays. Ainsi, il existe une croyance tr&egrave;s r&eacute;pandue en Asie, fond&eacute;e sur un mythe chinois, qui veut que des relations sexuelles avec une vierge am&eacute;liorent les affaires et la puissance. Puisque la virginit&eacute; est associ&eacute;e avec la jeunesse, ce &quot;contact avec un mythe&quot; est souvent &agrave; l'origine de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants. Ce contact est &eacute;galement fr&eacute;quent en Afrique.

<P><H2>Qui sont les exploiteurs?</H2><BR>
Des personnes peuvent avoir des relations sexuelles avec les enfants en toute connaissance de cause, par manque d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t ou par ignorance. Les premiers et les plus faciles &agrave; distinguer - mais qui repr&eacute;sentent une minorit&eacute; - sont les p&eacute;dophiles.<BR>

<P>La p&eacute;dophilie est une condition dans laquelle les adultes pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent avoir des relations sexuelles avec des filles et des gar&ccedil;ons pr&eacute;pub&egrave;res. Le comportement p&eacute;dophile suit des caract&eacute;ristiques assez bien d&eacute;finies: souvent les p&eacute;dophiles se placent dans des situations o&ugrave; ils sont en contact r&eacute;gulier avec les enfants. Ils ont des relations difficiles avec les adultes, mais affirment &quot;bien s'occuper&quot; de l'enfant, indiquant souvent qu'ils r&eacute;mun&egrave;rent leurs rapports avec l'enfant pour aider financi&egrave;rement l'enfant et sa famille, ou pour aider l'enfant &agrave; d&eacute;couvrir le sexe avec une personne attentionn&eacute;e. Les p&eacute;dophiles obtiennent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement des oeuvres pornographiques r&eacute;alis&eacute;es avec des enfants et &quot;collectionnent&quot; les photos, vid&eacute;os et autres souvenirs des enfants avec lesquels ils entrent en relation, afin de &quot;geler&quot; l'&acirc;ge de l'enfant et revivre sans cesse cette exp&eacute;rience.<BR>

<P>D'autres personnes ne souhaitent pas savoir si leur partenaire sexuel est un enfant. Le flux mondialis&eacute; d'argent a accru la demande de sexe commercial et de nombreux exploiteurs sont des autochtones, qui ont souvent recours aux prostitu&eacute;s et ne font pas de distinction en fonction de l'&acirc;ge. Dans certains cas, les clients demandent des enfants car ils croient que les enfants auront moins de partenaires sexuels et seront donc moins &agrave; m&ecirc;me de transmettre une infection. Dans certains cas, des mythes affirment que les relations sexuelles avec des enfants peuvent gu&eacute;rir des maladies, rajeunir ou m&ecirc;me am&eacute;liorer les affaires.<BR>

<P>Certaines personnes ont des relations sexuelles avec les enfants sans demander l'&acirc;ge du partenaire. Il peut s'agir de personnes qui dans des circonstances &quot;normales&quot; n'auraient pas choisi d'avoir des rapports avec un enfant, mais qui, pour plusieurs raisons, le font. Ces raisons incluent: la libert&eacute; ressentie &agrave; l'occasion de vacances dans un pays &eacute;tranger &quot;exotique&quot;, l'&eacute;bri&eacute;t&eacute; ou la prise de drogue, l'ignorance ou le manque d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t pour se rendre compte que le partenaire propos&eacute; est probablement un mineur. Cette ignorance n'est pas excusable.

<P><H2>La pornographie</H2><BR>
La pornographie enfantine est la &quot;reproduction sexuellement explicite de l'image d'un enfant&quot;. C'est, en soi, une forme d'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. Encourager, forcer ou convaincre les enfants (souvent avec l'emploi de drogues) &agrave; poser pour des photographies pornographiques, ou &agrave; prendre part &agrave; des vid&eacute;os pornographiques, est d&eacute;gradant et destin&eacute; &agrave; d&eacute;pouiller un enfant de sa dignit&eacute; et de son amour-propre. Cela enl&egrave;ve toute valeur au corps de l'enfant et lui montre que le corps est en vente et ne sert &agrave; rien d'autre. Cela peut donc &ecirc;tre un premier pas vers la prostitution ou s'inscrire dans le cadre de la prostitution.<BR>

<P>Souvent, &eacute;galement, la pornographie enfantine comporte la coercition et la violence. Non seulement ces manifestations font parfois partie du &quot;sc&eacute;nario&quot; d'un film vid&eacute;o ou d'une s&eacute;ance de photos, mais elles sont r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement inflig&eacute;es &agrave; l'enfant rebelle pour s'assurer de sa soumission et sa coop&eacute;ration. Certains exploiteurs satisfont leurs fantaisies sexuelles en produisant de la pornographie enfantine ou &quot;en jouant un r&ocirc;le&quot; dans les clich&eacute;s. Dans la pornographie enfantine, certains des &quot;acteurs&quot; sont des exploiteurs qui retirent du plaisir lors de la production du mat&eacute;riel.<BR>

<P>Une fois produite, la pornographie enfantine est &eacute;galement un moyen d'alimenter la demande d'enfants prostitu&eacute;s. Les images d'enfants se livrant &agrave; des rapports sexuels ou pris dans des poses obsc&egrave;nes - que ce soit en photo ou en vid&eacute;o - sont utilis&eacute;es pour exciter et accro&icirc;tre la demande. Les progr&egrave;s technologiques ont rendu la pornographie infantile plus facile &agrave; produire, plus difficile &agrave; arr&ecirc;ter et plus ais&eacute;e &agrave; distribuer. En particulier, la disponibilit&eacute; de cam&eacute;scopes et d'&eacute;quipements de r&eacute;alisation et de reproduction a rendu le &quot;film vid&eacute;o amateur&quot; facile et peu co&ucirc;teux. L'av&egrave;nement du graphisme sur ordinateur et de la transmission mondiale par le biais d'Internet signifie que les images peuvent maintenant &ecirc;tre transmises dans le monde entier et &quot;livr&eacute;es&quot; chez soi..<BR>

<P>Les recherches sur la pornographie enfantine ont commenc&eacute; au milieu des ann&eacute;es 80, et en 1987, un rapport citait l'Europe comme la source de la plupart des films et photographies pornographiques. INTERPOL estime que l'Allemagne est le principal producteur, les Pays-Bas et le Royaume-Uni sont des centres de distribution et les Etats-Unis repr&eacute;sentent le plus vaste march&eacute;, avec un chiffre d'affaires annuel d'un milliard de dollars en 1980. Dans les ann&eacute;es 80, de nouvelles lois ont oblig&eacute; &agrave; transf&eacute;rer l'essentiel de l'activit&eacute; en Asie du Sud-Est.<BR>

<P>Ces l&eacute;gislations ont fait progresser vers l'interdiction de la pornographie, mais elles deviennent maintenant obsol&egrave;tes dans les pays o&ugrave; les progr&egrave;s de la technologie ont permis aux producteurs de cr&eacute;er des images en utilisant un &quot;enfant&quot; cr&eacute;&eacute; par l'ordinateur. En cons&eacute;quence, les lois qui prot&egrave;gent les enfants ne tiennent pas toujours compte de situations o&ugrave; une image &eacute;lectronique, et non un v&eacute;ritable enfant, est employ&eacute;e.

<P><H2>La famille</H2><BR>
La famille nourrit, &eacute;duque et prot&egrave;ge les enfants et leurs droits. Les valeurs familiales sont essentielles pour la perception que l'enfant a de lui-m&ecirc;me et du monde dans lequel il vit. Quand, pour quelque raison que ce soit, la famille ne s'acquitte pas de ses obligations et n'est pas digne de sa confiance, la premi&egrave;re ligne de d&eacute;fense de l'enfant contre un monde incompr&eacute;hensible et dangereux s'effondre.<BR>

<P>Dans le monde entier, des chercheurs ont mis en exergue la forte corr&eacute;lation qui existe entre la maltraitance des enfants, particuli&egrave;rement des filles, dans la famille et la propension &agrave; se livrer &agrave; la prostitution. La m&egrave;re, en particulier, joue un r&ocirc;le central dans les d&eacute;cisions essentielles de sa fille. Les fr&eacute;quentes preuves de la participation des familles &agrave; l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale directe des enfants est inqui&eacute;tante mais n'est peut-&ecirc;tre pas surprenante, compte tenu des graves in&eacute;galit&eacute;s et difficult&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques auxquelles de nombreuses familles doivent faire face. Porteuses de pauvret&eacute; et de d&eacute;sespoir, de valeurs destructrices h&eacute;rit&eacute;es ou apparues r&eacute;cemment qui consid&egrave;rent les enfants comme un bien et donc comme un soutien &eacute;conomique, les familles transmettent ces valeurs et leurs cons&eacute;quences &agrave; leurs enfants.<BR>

<P>En fait, le plus souvent, les parents qui vendent leurs enfants sur le march&eacute; du sexe le font involontairement. On leur dit, et ils croient, que leurs enfants sont engag&eacute;s comme domestiques ou pour r&eacute;aliser un autre travail, ou qu'ils vont se marier. Beaucoup ignorent le sort ult&eacute;rieur qui est r&eacute;serv&eacute; &agrave; leurs enfants &quot;qui travaillent&quot;. N&eacute;anmoins, certains parents vendent leur enfant sur le march&eacute; du sexe en sachant o&ugrave; il va, bien qu'ils ne soient pas toujours conscients des cons&eacute;quences potentielles de cette activit&eacute;. Il semble que dans certaines r&eacute;gions d'Asie, les familles qui souhaitaient traditionnellement des fils capables de travailler pour la famille esp&egrave;rent maintenant avoir des filles &agrave; vendre puisque leur potentiel &eacute;conomique est plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.<BR>

<P>La pauvret&eacute; est souvent cit&eacute;e comme la cause profonde de la vente des enfants, mais il est important de noter que toutes les familles pauvres ne vendent pas leurs enfants. Ce qui pousse une famille pauvre &agrave; gagner de l'argent en vendant un enfant, c'est &quot;la pauvret&eacute; plus l'absence d'options&quot;. Il s'agit souvent d'une famille d&eacute;j&agrave; pauvre qui se trouve confront&eacute;e au ch&ocirc;mage, &agrave; la migration forc&eacute;e, &agrave; l'ostracisme de la communaut&eacute;, &agrave; la toxicomanie ou &agrave; des attentes accrues en raison du contact avec le consum&eacute;risme.<BR>

<P>Parfois, un enfant est vendu par des parents qui ont eux-m&ecirc;mes abus&eacute; sexuellement de l'enfant ou l'ont maltrait&eacute; d'autres fa&ccedil;ons. L'enfant est alors jug&eacute; &quot;pr&ecirc;t&quot; &agrave; avoir des relations sexuelles et &agrave; gagner de l'argent pour la famille. La remise de l'argent aux parents place l'enfant dans une &quot;servitude pour dettes&quot;, qui le force &agrave; avoir des relations sexuelles pour rembourser la dette de sa famille &agrave; l'exploiteur.<BR>

<P>Un autre facteur &agrave; noter est la mani&egrave;re dont la famille r&eacute;agit quand un enfant qui s'est prostitu&eacute; parvient &agrave; s'&eacute;chapper et rentre chez lui (parfois seul, parfois avec l'aide d'organisations qui travaillent pour lib&eacute;rer les enfants de l'exploitation). Parfois, les parents ne peuvent - ou ne veulent - pas supporter la marque infamante que suppose d'avoir un &quot;ancien prostitu&eacute;&quot; dans la famille et ils rejettent l'enfant. L'enfant court alors un risque tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; de revenir &agrave; la prostitution ou d'y &ecirc;tre forc&eacute;. Le cycle recommence.<BR>

<P>Il semble &eacute;galement que les a&icirc;n&eacute;s ou les autres membres f&eacute;minins de la famille se livrent &agrave; la prostitution pour &eacute;viter aux enfants plus jeunes d'&ecirc;tre happ&eacute;s par ce commerce.

<P><H2>Les enfants comme des produits de base</H2><BR>
L'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales pr&eacute;sente beaucoup des caract&eacute;ristiques d'un secteur organis&eacute; d'activit&eacute;: des petites affaires ou de grandes entreprises, avec des comptes en banque, des campagnes de publicit&eacute; et des brochures en papier glac&eacute;. Des sp&eacute;cialistes du marketing vendent le &quot;produit&quot;, des hi&eacute;rarchies de personnes r&eacute;alisent des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices (l'enfant &eacute;tant toujours le dernier servi), et des planificateurs strat&eacute;giques travaillent pour prot&eacute;ger et promouvoir &quot;les bonnes affaires&quot;. Cette &quot;activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique&quot; est une violation flagrante des enfants et fait intervenir la tromperie, l'enl&egrave;vement, l'esclavagisme, la contrebande, les faux passeports, les pots-de-vin et la corruption &agrave; de nombreux niveaux.<BR>

<P>Ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, la demande d'enfants pour le commerce du sexe a augment&eacute;. L'une des raisons de cet accroissement est la hausse des revenus et du pouvoir d'achat qui a mis les enfants comme &quot;biens&quot; &agrave; la port&eacute;e de davantage de personnes. Les id&eacute;es fausses sur l'immunit&eacute; des enfants aux infections, y compris le VIH/SIDA, une prolif&eacute;ration de services de divertissement qui stimulent et excitent les d&eacute;sirs, ainsi que le consum&eacute;risme croissant des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment industrialis&eacute;es cr&eacute;ent &eacute;galement un environnement dans lequel les enfants sont d&eacute;valu&eacute;s, r&eacute;duits au niveau de marchandises en vente, dont on peut user et abuser.<BR>

<P>L'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des m&eacute;dias pour la pornographie et la prostitution enfantines peut involontairement alimenter la demande et la facilit&eacute; d'acc&egrave;s aux informations &eacute;largit les voies d'approvisionnement tout en accroissant la demande.<BR>

<P>Les m&ecirc;mes causes entrent en jeu aussi bien dans la demande que l'offre. N&eacute;anmoins, le principal &eacute;l&eacute;ment intervenant du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'offre est la cupidit&eacute; humaine. Ces facteurs &eacute;conomiques et sociologiques alimentent l'offre d'enfants &agrave; vendre et perp&eacute;tuent les occasions pour les interm&eacute;diaires (hommes ou femmes) - les maquereaux, les propri&eacute;taires de maisons de passe, les ma&icirc;tresses de maison close et autres racketteurs dont le seul objectif est de gagner de l'argent en prostituant les enfants - qui comblent l'&eacute;cart entre l'offre et la demande, garantissant l'offre et stimulant la demande.

<P><H2>Les cons&eacute;quences</H2><BR>
Les cons&eacute;quences de l'exploitation sexuelle d'un enfant &agrave; des fins commerciales sont tragiques. L'enfant perd son enfance, sa dignit&eacute;, souvent son avenir. Il s'agit l&agrave; de co&ucirc;ts impossibles &agrave; quantifier, mais certains r&eacute;sultats de l'exploitation sont plus faciles &agrave; mesurer.<BR>

<P>Le plus &eacute;vident se rapporte &agrave; la sant&eacute; de l'enfant. Le VIH/SIDA est &agrave; la fois une cause et une cons&eacute;quence de l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale des enfants.<BR>

<P>Tout indique que dans certaines r&eacute;gions du monde, les enfants sont choisis comme partenaires sexuels dans l'id&eacute;e fausse que les rapports avec eux sont &quot;plus s&ucirc;rs&quot;. On pense qu'avoir des relations avec un enfant prot&egrave;ge le violeur du VIH/SIDA parce que l'enfant a plus de chances d'&ecirc;tre &quot;propre&quot; et d'avoir eu moins de partenaires sexuels.<BR>

<P>C'est plut&ocirc;t le contraire. En raison de leur vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; et de leur faiblesse, les enfants prostitu&eacute;s sont souvent forc&eacute;s &agrave; prendre plus de clients qu'un adulte n'en accepterait et sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement dans l'impossibilit&eacute; de demander au client d'employer un pr&eacute;servatif. De plus, les enfants sont physiquement plus vuln&eacute;rables aux infections, non seulement parce qu'ils subissent plus facilement des l&eacute;sions internes (et sont souvent trait&eacute;s avec violence par leurs clients) mais &eacute;galement parce que les jeunes membranes sont plus poreuses.<BR>

<P>La &quot;pure vierge&quot; est recherch&eacute;e par de nombreux clients comme le &quot;pari le plus s&ucirc;r&quot;. La chirurgie reconstructive est une pratique fr&eacute;quente, ce qui fait que certains enfants exploit&eacute;s sexuellement &agrave; des fins commerciales sont vendus comme vierges m&ecirc;me s'ils ont eu de multiples partenaires sexuels.<BR>

<P>La r&eacute;alit&eacute; est que de nombreux enfants forc&eacute;s &agrave; se livrer au commerce du sexe contractent le VIH. Les enfants lib&eacute;r&eacute;s des maisons de passe en Asie du Sud-Est subissent imm&eacute;diatement le test du VIH/SIDA. Il est normal de trouver des taux de s&eacute;ropositivit&eacute; de 50%, allant parfois jusqu'&agrave; 90%. Il s'agit non seulement d'une condamnation &agrave; mort, mais ce r&eacute;sultat signifie &eacute;galement que l'enfant risque de passer ce qui lui reste de vie hors de sa famille et de sa communaut&eacute;, frustr&eacute; de sa dignit&eacute; et de toute option. Les enfants s&eacute;ropositifs sont en effet en butte &agrave; la discrimination et au rejet.<BR>

<P>Les enfants oblig&eacute;s d'avoir des relations sexuelles connaissent d'autres s&eacute;quelles physiques et psychologiques graves.<BR>

<P>On vole &agrave; ces enfants leur enfance et les jeux de leurs ann&eacute;es de formation. Cette privation laisse des cicatrices qui peuvent prendre des ann&eacute;es pour se refermer. Les enfants perdent leur confiance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard d'autrui, particuli&egrave;rement des adultes, et deviennent vuln&eacute;rables &agrave; une autre exploitation. Il courent &eacute;galement plus de risques de devenir eux-m&ecirc;mes exploiteurs. Ils perdent leur estime et leur dignit&eacute; et peuvent pr&eacute;senter un &eacute;ventail de sympt&ocirc;mes de stress post-traumatique comme la d&eacute;pression, l'agressivit&eacute; et la violence, la perte du contr&ocirc;le de soi et l'automutilation. Leur vie se termine souvent par le suicide.<BR>

<P>Il conservent longtemps certaines cons&eacute;quences physiques. Les enfants pris au pi&egrave;ge de l'exploitation sexuelle sont souvent maltrait&eacute;s, battus, br&ucirc;l&eacute;s, tortur&eacute;s et priv&eacute;s de nourriture, d'air, de lumi&egrave;re et de mouvement, mais ils sont &eacute;galement vuln&eacute;rables aux infections des reins, au cancer du col de l'ut&eacute;rus, aux grossesses pr&eacute;coces et &agrave; r&eacute;p&eacute;tition et aux maladies sexuellement transmissibles.<BR>

<P>De nombreuses &eacute;tudes ont &eacute;galement montr&eacute; des niveaux &eacute;lev&eacute;s de toxicomanie chez les enfants pratiquant la prostitution. La drogue est souvent employ&eacute;e pour assurer la soumission des enfants prostitu&eacute;s. Elle peut &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre un moyen m&eacute;dical d'all&eacute;ger la douleur de la faim ou du d&eacute;sespoir.

<P><H2>La protection juridique</H2><BR>
La majorit&eacute; des organismes de police et d'application de la loi dans le monde luttent contre l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. A l'&eacute;chelon international, par exemple, le Groupe de travail permanent d'Interpol sur les d&eacute;lits contre les mineurs, qui inclut des repr&eacute;sentants d'organisations non gouvernementales travaillant contre l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale des enfants, a fait beaucoup pour promouvoir la l&eacute;gislation, la d&eacute;tection et la condamnation extra-territoriales des coupables.<BR>

<P>Au niveau national, la plupart des pays disposent de lois qui classent l'abus sexuel des enfants parmi les crimes. De plus, 188 pays (au 1er mai 1996) avaient sign&eacute; ou ratifi&eacute; la Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits de l'enfant et avaient adopt&eacute; par la suite une l&eacute;gislation pour les aider &agrave; concr&eacute;tiser les promesses qu'ils ont faites en signant cette importante Convention. Plusieurs lois nationales interdisent ou r&eacute;glementent d'une autre mani&egrave;re les pratiques sexuelles, la prostitution, la pornographie, l'enl&egrave;vement, l'esclavagisme, l'abus de mineurs - un &eacute;ventail complet d'actes criminels, en fait, qui se produisent lors de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales.<BR>

<P>Ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, le monde a pris conscience de la nature transnationale de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants. Le trafic de pornographie et la traite d'enfants ne connaissent pas de fronti&egrave;res. Les exploiteurs voyagent pour cr&eacute;er leurs r&eacute;seaux. Les clients se d&eacute;placent pour acheter les services dans des pays &eacute;trangers. La coop&eacute;ration intergouvernementale est par cons&eacute;quent absolument vitale, non seulement pour d&eacute;finir le probl&egrave;me, mais aussi pour le r&eacute;glementer, le vaincre et donner le retentissement voulu aux condamnations.<BR>

<P>Plusieurs Etats ont adopt&eacute; une l&eacute;gislation extra-territoriale qui, avec la coop&eacute;ration d'autres gouvernements, leur permet d'enqu&ecirc;ter sur des crimes commis hors de leur pays et/ou poursuivre leurs ressortissants quand ils reviennent chez eux. En cons&eacute;quence, les &eacute;trangers arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s pour des crimes sexuels sur les enfants n'ont plus la possibilit&eacute; de se faire lib&eacute;rer gr&acirc;ce aux pots-de-vin et de s'&eacute;chapper dans leur pays &agrave; l'abri des poursuites.<BR>

<P>Paradoxalement, les lois en vigueur punissent souvent les enfants plus s&eacute;v&egrave;rement que les exploiteurs. Entre 1989 et 1993, par exemple, 1 500 condamnations d'enfants ont &eacute;t&eacute; prononc&eacute;es en Angleterre et au Pays de Galles pour des d&eacute;lits li&eacute;s &agrave; la prostitution. D'autres lois ont motiv&eacute; l'expulsion d'enfants vers le lieu o&ugrave; ils avaient &eacute;t&eacute; vendus la premi&egrave;re fois.<BR>

<P>Beaucoup de documents montrent &eacute;galement sans doute possible que les enfants trouv&eacute;s dans les maisons de passe, les salons de massage, les rues ou ailleurs o&ugrave; ils sont exploit&eacute;s sexuellement &agrave; des fins commerciales sont souvent enferm&eacute;s dans des cellules avec des adultes qui les maltraitent. Dans les pays occidentaux, leur visage est souvent montr&eacute; &agrave; la presse et aux m&eacute;dias alors que le visage de l'exploiteur adulte est masqu&eacute; pour prot&eacute;ger son identit&eacute;, et ils sont trait&eacute;s comme des criminels.<BR>

<P>Mais il ne suffit pas d'adopter des lois pour qu'elles soient appliqu&eacute;es. Il est certainement difficile de bien mettre en oeuvre la l&eacute;gislation quand l'activit&eacute; est clandestine. Cela l'est encore plus quand, comme dans certains cas prouv&eacute;s, les agents charg&eacute;s de faire respecter la loi sont eux-m&ecirc;mes corrompus et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient de l'exploitation des enfants. C'est un fait souvent n&eacute;glig&eacute; face aux pressions exerc&eacute;es pour promouvoir le tourisme dans un pays et les autorit&eacute;s ferment les yeux sur une activit&eacute; cr&eacute;atrice de revenus. Mais les lois doivent &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es. Elles sont l'ultime protection des enfants et il faut faire davantage pour renforcer la l&eacute;gislation ou pour l'appliquer quand elle existe.

<P><H2>Sauvetage et r&eacute;insertion</H2><BR>
Qu'arrive-t-il aux enfants sauv&eacute;s de la prostitution? Souvent rien, ce qui est un aspect du probl&egrave;me. Les ONG travaillant dans ce domaine m&egrave;nent des missions de sauvetage pour d&eacute;livrer les enfants de l'esclavage de l'exploitation sexuelle, mais les services d'appui ne sont pas encore d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s pour faire face aux besoins formidables des enfants sauv&eacute;s: des services de sant&eacute; comprenant un soutien psychologique et post-traumatique, des m&eacute;canismes pour surmonter les difficult&eacute;s - peut-&ecirc;tre m&ecirc;me l'impossibilit&eacute; - &agrave; r&eacute;int&eacute;grer les enfants exploit&eacute;s sexuellement dans leurs communaut&eacute;s, et l'ostracisme et le manque de compr&eacute;hension qu'ils connaissent.<BR>

<P>Tout d'abord, les enfants sauv&eacute;s de la prostitution doivent &ecirc;tre remis, si possible, en bonne sant&eacute;. Ils ont subi des violences physiques et psychologiques et il faut r&eacute;tablir leur sant&eacute; physique et psychologique. Parfois, les dommages physiques ne peuvent &ecirc;tre enti&egrave;rement gu&eacute;ris: les enfants s&eacute;ropositifs, par exemple, ou devenus st&eacute;riles en raison d'infections dues aux MST, continueront de vivre avec les s&eacute;quelles de leur exploitation. La gu&eacute;rison des blessures psychologiques est aid&eacute;e par des services de consultations sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; l'intention des enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; exploit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>La r&eacute;&eacute;ducation vise &eacute;galement &agrave; aider les survivants de l'exploitation sexuelle commerciale &agrave; r&eacute;duire leur vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; &agrave; l'avenir. Les enfants re&ccedil;oivent une formation afin d'acqu&eacute;rir des capacit&eacute;s qui leur permettront de gagner leur vie. Ils peuvent &ecirc;tre plac&eacute;s dans un foyer con&ccedil;u sp&eacute;cialement pour leur proposer des activit&eacute;s de formation et d'orientation.<BR>

<P>L'&eacute;tape la plus difficile sur la voie de la r&eacute;&eacute;ducation est peut-&ecirc;tre le retour aupr&egrave;s de la famille et des amis, reprendre la vie familiale et retrouver l'estime de soi dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Souvent, les enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; exploit&eacute;s dans la prostitution se voient rejet&eacute;s par leur famille ou leur communaut&eacute; en raison du d&eacute;shonneur associ&eacute; avec le travail qu'ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; forc&eacute;s d'accomplir. C'est particuli&egrave;rement vrai s'ils sont s&eacute;ropositifs et la question de la confidentialit&eacute; du diagnostic sur l'&eacute;tat de l'enfant complique encore la situation. Dans ces cas, une &quot;nouvelle&quot; famille doit &ecirc;tre trouv&eacute;e pour emp&ecirc;cher l'enfant de retomber dans les griffes des exploiteurs.<BR>

<P>Les enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; exploit&eacute;s sexuellement sont extr&ecirc;mement vuln&eacute;rables et il est capital de veiller &agrave; ce que, lorsqu'ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; sauv&eacute;s, ils ne soient pas plac&eacute;s dans une position de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; accrue ou similaire, parce qu'ils n'ont pas de soutien familial ou communautaire, qu'ils n'ont aucun moyen de gagner leur vie, qu'ils sont en situation irr&eacute;guli&egrave;re dans un pays, en mauvaise sant&eacute; ou subissent une quelconque forme de d&eacute;pendance.<BR>

<P>De nombreuses ONG et institutions internationales travaillent sur cet &eacute;ventail de questions pour fournir un appui aux enfant sauv&eacute;s et pour leur construire un avenir o&ugrave; ils ne seront pas exploit&eacute;s &agrave; nouveau et ne deviendront pas &agrave; leur tour des exploiteurs.

<P><H2>La technologie et les m&eacute;dias</H2><BR>
Les progr&egrave;s formidables de la technologie ont rendu la pornographie enfantine - un volet majeur de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales - plus facile, plus abordable, plus difficile &agrave; d&eacute;tecter et plus facile &agrave; distribuer. Les cam&eacute;scopes, les magn&eacute;toscopes, les &eacute;quipements de r&eacute;alisation pour amateurs, les graphismes cr&eacute;&eacute;s par l'ordinateur et l'&eacute;dition &eacute;lectronique sont autant de techniques qui ont fait entrer la pornographie enfantine &agrave; la maison, o&ugrave; il est plus difficile &agrave; la police de la trouver et qui l'ont transform&eacute;e en une industrie brassant plusieurs milliards de dollars.<BR>

<P>L'av&egrave;nement d'Internet a ouvert de nouvelles voies d'information &agrave; ceux qui souhaitent se livrer &agrave; des pratiques sexuelles sur les enfants. La nature interactive de la technologie d'Internet signifie que l'information peut &ecirc;tre partag&eacute;e en temps r&eacute;el et que les &quot;demandes sp&eacute;ciales&quot; sont trait&eacute;es par les personnes se chargeant de trouver des enfants pour les pratiques sexuelles. Les images pornographiques et les clips vid&eacute;os peuvent &ecirc;tre transmis presque anonymement et re&ccedil;us tout aussi anonymement. Actuellement, les seuls points d'intervention des agents charg&eacute;s de faire respecter la loi semblent &ecirc;tre les serveurs, qui peuvent refuser de vendre de l'espace &agrave; toute personne dont ils savent qu'elle fournit du mat&eacute;riel relatif &agrave; la prostitution enfantine.<BR>

<P>Au-del&agrave; de la technologie, la presse et les m&eacute;dias jouent &eacute;galement un r&ocirc;le majeur dans le domaine de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants, &agrave; la fois positif et n&eacute;gatif.<BR>

<P>Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; n&eacute;gatif, les m&eacute;dias ont sans aucun doute contribu&eacute; &agrave; lib&eacute;raliser une  imagerie sexuellement explicite, et &agrave; r&eacute;orienter les valeurs morales. La technologie par satellite, les voyages internationaux et une rupture des infrastructures de soutien font que ces images sont souvent re&ccedil;ues dans un contexte sans appui, ou m&ecirc;me dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; laquelle elles n'&eacute;taient pas sp&eacute;cifiquement destin&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Les adolescents repr&eacute;sentent un fort pourcentage des t&eacute;l&eacute;spectateurs et l'attitude de certains m&eacute;dias &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'adolescence - ce que l'on appelle le &quot;syndrome de Beavis et Butthead&quot; qui montre les adolescents comme des individus sans valeur et facilement exploitables - peut contribuer &agrave; l'image que les jeunes se font d'eux-m&ecirc;mes et de leur place dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Egalement du c&ocirc;t&eacute; n&eacute;gatif, de nombreux journalistes bien intentionn&eacute;s enqu&ecirc;tant sur l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales ont publi&eacute; des informations qui ont aid&eacute; les exploiteurs - noms de rues, situations de villages, images facilement identifiables de plages, etc. Souvent, &eacute;galement, la tentation de diffuser ou d'imprimer des images sensationnelles a elle-m&ecirc;me fr&ocirc;l&eacute; la pornographie et donc l'exploitation, et a donn&eacute; lieu &agrave; des critiques du &quot;voyeurisme de la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision&quot;. Dans quelques cas, les journalistes ont sans le vouloir alt&eacute;r&eacute; les preuves en payant pour obtenir des reportages, permettant aux criminels d'&eacute;chapper &agrave; une condamnation gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un vice de forme.<BR>

<P>Mais le r&ocirc;le de la presse et des m&eacute;dias peut &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre immens&eacute;ment positif. Les journalistes ont acc&egrave;s &agrave; des informations g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement difficiles &agrave; obtenir pour d'autres personnes. Ils ont travaill&eacute; main dans la main avec les organisations non gouvernementales et la police pour trouver les exploiteurs et les lieux d'exploitation et les rendre publics, puis ils ont rapport&eacute; les arrestations et les condamnations, contribuant &agrave; un effet de dissuasion.<BR>

<P>En outre, la presse et les m&eacute;dias peuvent aider notablement les activit&eacute;s de plaidoyer, soulignant les valeurs morales positives et les droits de l'homme. Ils peuvent soutenir les valeurs familiales positives et informer les parents dont les enfants sont &agrave; risque. Ils aident les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes &agrave; adopter des principes &eacute;thiques dans leur comportement et &agrave; identifier les facteurs de risque ou les situations dans lesquelles ils peuvent &ecirc;tre en danger. Ils sont les &eacute;ducateurs les plus influents.<BR>

<P>Fait le plus important, la presse et les m&eacute;dias ont reconnu qu'ils jouaient un r&ocirc;le important dans le domaine global de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales, et participent activement &agrave; un d&eacute;bat pour examiner leur action et s'engager envers les principes &eacute;thiques justifiant leur plaidoyer.

<P><H2>Le tourisme sexuel <BR>
</H2><BR>
Le tourisme sexuel est un secteur d&eacute;velopp&eacute; de l'industrie de l'exploitation, avec sa propre panoplie de mat&eacute;riel promotionnel allant de brochures luxueuses &agrave; des clubs organis&eacute;s en passant par la disponibilit&eacute; d'informations sur les &quot;circuits&quot; sur Internet. Cette technologie interactive met l'information et les conseils &agrave; la disposition des clients et leur permet de pr&eacute;parer leurs vacances &agrave; l'avance selon leurs besoins.<BR>

<P>Les industries d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es de tourisme sexuel ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tudi&eacute;es aux Philippines, au Cambodge et en Tha&iuml;lande. Plus r&eacute;cemment, les voyages organis&eacute;s de ce type depuis l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord vers le Br&eacute;sil et la R&eacute;publique dominicaine ont augment&eacute;. Au Sri Lanka, on affirme que dans certaines r&eacute;gions, plusieurs milliers de gar&ccedil;ons sont disponibles pour des pratiques sexuelles avec des touristes masculins. Il est probable que le tourisme sexuel augmente dans les pays d'Europe de l'Est. De plus, la plupart des touristes &agrave; la recherche de sexe voyagent actuellement s&eacute;par&eacute;ment ou en couple dans des vols ordinaires. Dans le pass&eacute;, les voyages organis&eacute;s &eacute;taient faciles &agrave; identifier et &agrave; condamner, ce qui fait que les organisateurs de ce type de tourisme font aujourd'hui voyager leurs clients plus discr&egrave;tement.<BR>

<P>Depuis 1990, l'ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) &eacute;tudie et lutte contre le tourisme sexuel en Asie et, depuis peu, &eacute;galement ailleurs dans le monde. L'ECPAT est parvenu &agrave; promouvoir la coop&eacute;ration gouvernementale transnationale, la l&eacute;gislation extra-territoriale qui permet aux gouvernements de poursuivre leurs ressortissants pour des crimes commis dans d'autres pays et &agrave; attirer l'attention du public sur l'arrestation, la d&eacute;tention et la condamnation de p&eacute;dophiles qui pratiquent le tourisme sexuel.<BR>

<P>L'ECPAT a &eacute;galement r&eacute;ussi &agrave; attirer l'attention des autorit&eacute;s touristiques mondiales, des agents de voyages, des &eacute;diteurs de guides de voyages et des promoteurs de voyages organis&eacute;s et les a incit&eacute;s &agrave; travailler activement contre le tourisme sexuel.

<P><H2>Les routes du trafic</H2><BR>
En 1987, un rapport du Conseil de l'Europe a identifi&eacute; cinq r&eacute;seaux internationaux de traite d'enfants en Europe:<BR>
	.	De l'Am&eacute;rique latine vers l'Europe et le Moyen-Orient<BR>
.	De l'Asie du Sud-Est vers l'Europe du Nord et le Moyen-Orient<BR>
.	un march&eacute; r&eacute;gional europ&eacute;en<BR>
.	un march&eacute; r&eacute;gional arabe<BR>
.	des exportations de fillettes originaires d'Afrique de l'Ouest.<BR>

<P>En Europe de l'Est aujourd'hui, le trafic se d&eacute;roule g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement d'est en ouest. Des filles de Russie, d'Ukraine et de Russie blanche sont transport&eacute;es en nombres importants vers la Pologne, la Hongrie, les Etats baltes, ou poursuivent le voyage &agrave; destination <BR>
.	des capitales occidentales, rejointes par des filles des pays voisins<BR>
.	Des chercheurs ont &eacute;galement identifi&eacute; un trafic de prostitu&eacute;es roumaines vers l'Italie, Chypre et la Turquie.<BR>

<P>Il y a &eacute;galement plusieurs routes bien d&eacute;finies en Asie du Sud-Est:<BR>
.	Du Myanmar (Birmanie) vers la Tha&iuml;lande<BR>
.	De Chine m&eacute;ridionale vers la Tha&iuml;lande via le Myanmar<BR>
.	Du Cambodge et du Vietnam vers la Tha&iuml;lande<BR>
.	A l'int&eacute;rieur de la Tha&iuml;lande et d'autres pays o&ugrave; la prostitution des enfants est fr&eacute;quente<BR>
.	Vers la Chine, la Malaisie, Singapour, le Japon et les Etats-Unis<BR>
.	De Tha&iuml;lande et des Philippines, ainsi que de pays o&ugrave; cela est moins connu, vers l'Australie, la Nouvelle-Z&eacute;lande et Ta&iuml;wan<BR>
.	Du N&eacute;pal et du Bangladesh vers l'Inde<BR>

<P>Les routes les plus lucratives de traite d'enfants vont d'Asie du Sud-Est vers le Japon et Hawaii via Hong Kong. La trafic d'enfants d'Asie du Sud (d'Inde et du Pakistan) vers le Moyen-Orient est &eacute;galement tr&egrave;s r&eacute;pandu.<BR>

<P>Il y a sans aucun doute d'autres r&eacute;seaux.

<P><H2>Faire cesser l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants<BR>
</H2><BR>
La contre-offensive livr&eacute;e &agrave; l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales s'exerce &agrave; de nombreux niveaux diff&eacute;rents. Les organisations non gouvernementales et les institutions des Nations Unies participent depuis quelques ann&eacute;es &agrave; la recherche et la surveillance, identifiant les enfants &agrave; risque et d&eacute;j&agrave; exploit&eacute;s, d&eacute;masquant et traduisant en justice les exploiteurs lorsque c'est possible. Les ONG ont &eacute;galement jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le d&eacute;cisif pour encourager les gouvernements &agrave; adopter une l&eacute;gislation extra-territoriale, et elles ont collabor&eacute; avec les organisations de tourisme pour mobiliser leur aide afin de combattre le tourisme sexuel exploitant les enfants.<BR>

<P>La coalition d'ONG ECPAT a publi&eacute; beaucoup d'&eacute;tudes, dans de nombreuses langues, et a mobilis&eacute; la presse et les m&eacute;dias pour sensibiliser l'opinion &agrave; des niveaux sans pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent. C'est gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une initiative de l'ECPAT que l'id&eacute;e du premier Congr&egrave;s mondial contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;e et que le Gouvernement su&eacute;dois a propos&eacute; de l'accueillir &agrave; Stockholm en ao&ucirc;t 1996.<BR>

<P>Le travail de r&eacute;&eacute;ducation et de r&eacute;insertion des enfants est complexe. Certaines communaut&eacute;s acceptent difficilement les enfants qui reviennent et ce sont les ONG qui doivent aider &agrave; int&eacute;grer ces enfants dans de nouvelles communaut&eacute;s. Les ONG &eacute;tablissent &eacute;galement des centres pour ceux qui peuvent rentrer et dispensent une formation professionnelle pour donner aux enfants un moyen de gagner leur vie, des services d'appui et autres. Plus d'un millier d'ONG travaillent avec les enfants des rues. D'autres s'occupent pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment des enfants s&eacute;ropositifs et d'autres domaines des soins de sant&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Les institutions des Nations Unies travaillent de concert avec les ONG, par exemple au Cambodge, sur des projets pour surveiller et diminuer la traite d'enfants. Plus sp&eacute;cifiquement, l'UNICEF et les ONG travaillent conjointement sur des programmes de pr&eacute;vention &agrave; long terme et dans le domaine de la formulation des politiques, du plaidoyer et de la r&eacute;glementation. La priorit&eacute; du HCR inclut l'&eacute;ducation des filles, l'&eacute;ducation des enfants des rues, les services mobiles de sant&eacute;, la d&eacute;finition des politiques et la formation aux droits de l'enfant, la communication et le plaidoyer. L'UNICEF soutient &eacute;galement des programmes et met l'accent sur les mesures pr&eacute;ventives.<BR>

<P>De plus, les institutions des Nations Unies et les ONG s'emploient activement &agrave; encourager et contribuer &agrave; la formation des juristes, des organismes charg&eacute;s de faire respecter la loi et d'autres institutions dans les domaines o&ugrave; se produit l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales, par exemple dans les op&eacute;rations transfrontali&egrave;res.

<P><H2>Le Congr&egrave;s mondial</H2><BR>
Le Congr&egrave;s mondial contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales qui se d&eacute;roula &agrave; Stockholm, Su&egrave;de, du 27 au 31 ao&ucirc;t 1996, s'inscrit dans un processus plus large de protection des droits de l'enfant. Il s'est centr&eacute; sur trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales: la prostitution d'enfants, la traite et la vente d'enfants &agrave; des fins sexuelles, et la pornographie enfantine.<BR>

<P>Le principal objectif du Congr&egrave;s fut d'attirer l'attention internationale sur les probl&egrave;mes de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales et de promouvoir la mise au point de politiques nationales et de programmes pour lutter contre toutes les formes d'exploitation dans les contextes sp&eacute;cifiques o&ugrave; elles se produisent. A cette fin, le Congr&egrave;s a examin&eacute; et adopt&eacute; une D&eacute;claration et un Programme d'action.<BR>

<P>Le Congr&egrave;s fournit une tribune ouverte de discussion par le biais d'ateliers et la pr&eacute;sentation d'&eacute;tudes de cas, dans lesquels tous les segments de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; ont pu &eacute;changer des exp&eacute;riences. Il d&eacute;finit les dimensions du probl&egrave;me, &eacute;tudia ses causes profondes et les formes sp&eacute;cifiques de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales dans diff&eacute;rents pays et r&eacute;gions.<BR>

<P>L'objectif le plus important fut n&eacute;anmoins de jeter les bases d'une action nationale en sensibilisant l'opinion, en forgeant des coalitions et des partenariats nationaux avec les gouvernements, les ONG, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et les organisations internationales. Le Congr&egrave;s ne fut qu'une &eacute;tape de ce processus important.<BR>

<P>Si le Congr&egrave;s se d&eacute;roula cette ann&eacute;e, c'est qu'il ne fait aucun doute que certains aspects de l'exploitation sexuelle d' enfants s'&eacute;tendent. La propagation du VIH/SIDA et la mondialisation ont conduit &agrave; une recrudescence de l'exploitation. De plus, la communaut&eacute; internationale a pris conscience du probl&egrave;me et l'indignation qu'il suscite a grandi. Ce Congr&egrave;s fut la premi&egrave;re tentative internationale de coordination de la coop&eacute;ration internationale sur des questions transnationales et de rassemblement des acteurs internationaux.

Cualesquiera que sean las causas subyacentes, los agentes implicados o las cuestiones asociadas, la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial es siempre definida fundamentalmente de la misma forma: <I>explotaci&oacute;n del ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a con fines sexuales para la obtenci&oacute;n de un beneficio financiero o material</I>. De acuerdo con la definici&oacute;n de la <B>Convenci&oacute;n sobre los Derechos del Ni&ntilde;o</B>, se entiende por ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a toda persona menor de 18 a&ntilde;os salvo que en virtud de la ley de cada pa&iacute;s haya alcanzado antes la mayor&iacute;a de edad. La explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os es una forma extremadamente peligrosa de trabajo infantil, un abuso de poder y una forma de dominaci&oacute;n sobre los ni&ntilde;os.<BR>

<P>Asimismo, aunque el fen&oacute;meno del &quot;turismo sexual&quot;<BR>
-representado principalmente por hombres que viajan a otros pa&iacute;ses para tener relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os- est&aacute; bien documentado, la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os es una cuesti&oacute;n predominantemente local donde tanto los clientes como los agentes pertenecen a la comunidad local.<BR>

<P>La naturaleza concreta de la explotaci&oacute;n difiere de un pa&iacute;s a otro. En <B>Asia</B>, por ejemplo, la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os adopta frecuentemente la forma de una utilizaci&oacute;n por parte de personas locales de los servicios de prostitutos o prostitutas  infantiles, o del denominado &quot;turismo sexual&quot;. Algunos ni&ntilde;os  son vendidos dentro del comercio sexual por las familias o los amigos en algunos casos con pleno conocimiento, en otros bajo la err&oacute;nea creencia de que los ni&ntilde;os se convertir&aacute;n en sirvientes dom&eacute;sticos o bien ganar&aacute;n dinero para la familia. En ocasiones, los ni&ntilde;os son secuestrados, transportados a trav&eacute;s de las fronteras o de las &aacute;reas rurales a las urbanas, y desplazados de un lugar a otro hasta convertirse efectivamente en &quot;desaparecidos&quot;.<BR>

<P>En <B>Am&eacute;rica del Sur</B>, la informaci&oacute;n procede principalmente de las personas que trabajan con ni&ntilde;os se que han visto forzados a ganarse la vida en la calle y que en &uacute;ltimo extremo pueden haber optado o haber sido coaccionados a participar en el comercio sexual. Habida cuenta de su precaria situaci&oacute;n, estos ni&ntilde;os est&aacute;n a merced de los alcahuetes y otros delincuentes que los explotan para su propio beneficio a cambio de&quot;protecci&oacute;n&quot;, que en realidad encubre abusos y violencia y frecuentemente drogodependencia. Sin embargo, en ocasiones se inician en el comercio sexual &quot;voluntariamente&quot;, para buscar una mayor ganancia con la venta de servicios sexuales de la que podr&iacute;an obtener mediante otras formas de trabajo callejero, con objeto de financiar su adicci&oacute;n a los estupefacientes, de comprar bienes de consumo que de otro modo estar&iacute;an fuera de su alcance, o simplemente para poder comer.<BR>

<P>En <B>Europa</B>, los ni&ntilde;os son objeto de tr&aacute;fico a trav&eacute;s de las fronteras de la Europa continental desde los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s pobres del Este hacia los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s ricos donde el mercado de ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as est&aacute; alimentado por c&iacute;rculos organizados de ped&oacute;filos y por servicios de informaci&oacute;n de alta tecnolog&iacute;a. Tambi&eacute;n se ha producido un incremento en la prostituci&oacute;n infantil promovida por el consumo, donde un consumismo descontrolado y la presi&oacute;n de la publicidad y las expectativas han impulsado a los ni&ntilde;os al comercio sexual para comprar bienes de consumo de alto costo o estupefacientes. Este fen&oacute;meno tambi&eacute;n existe en pa&iacute;ses industrializados como el <B>Reino Unido</B>, <B>Canad&aacute;</B>, los <B>Estados Unidos</B> y <B>Australia</B>.<BR>

<P>En <B>&Aacute;frica</B>, la informaci&oacute;n disponible indica que el empleo de los ni&ntilde;os como sirvientes dom&eacute;sticos incluye a menudo la explotaci&oacute;n sexual. Tambi&eacute;n existen indicios de que los ni&ntilde;os son empleados en hoteles, restaurantes y burdeles, donde son objeto de explotaci&oacute;n sexual. Asimismo, hay pruebas de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os -particularmente de las ni&ntilde;as- en los campos de refugiados, donde la reuni&oacute;n de un gran n&uacute;mero de hombres solteros en un espacio cerrado fomenta la demanda de relaciones sexuales, y la explotaci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os de los campos por hombres de las comunidades circundante. El mismo fen&oacute;meno se produce en el reclutamiento de ni&ntilde;os -en este caso a menudo varones- en las fuerzas armadas, no s&oacute;lo como combatientes sino para prestar servicios a los soldados adultos. En muchas partes de &Aacute;frica, los gobiernos contin&uacute;an negando la existencia del problema.<BR>

<P>En <B>Oriente Medio</B>, algunos gobiernos tambi&eacute;n niegan que el problema exista. Sin embargo, el reclutamiento de ni&ntilde;os para ayuda dom&eacute;stica es com&uacute;n y, como sucede en &Aacute;frica, a menudo comprende la utilizaci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os con fines sexuales. Adem&aacute;s, el matrimonio precoz se considera como un medio adecuado para &quot;legitimar&quot; las relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os  y fomentar as&iacute; la demanda. En tales situaciones, se produceinvariablemente un intercambio de dinero o bienes. Se considera que la pr&aacute;ctica de la poligamia refuerza el bajo estatuto de las mujeres y de las ni&ntilde;as y conduce a la negaci&oacute;n de su dignidad y sus derechos, haci&eacute;ndolas m&aacute;s vulnerables a la explotaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Este cuadro general de la gama y modalidades de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os en todo el mundo s&oacute;lo esboza la complejidad del problema. Adem&aacute;s, la naturaleza encubierta de la actividad dificulta la   obtenci&oacute;n de datos precisos, y la no infrecuente implicaci&oacute;n de las autoridades locales y los agentes de la ley supone que a menudo aquellos que deber&iacute;an identificar e informar sobre la incidencia de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual est&aacute;n en realidad ocultando los hechos.<BR>

<P>No obstante, est&aacute; fuera de duda que los ni&ntilde;os est&aacute;n siendo objeto de comercio sexual en todo el mundo. Se estima que cada a&ntilde;o un mill&oacute;n de ni&ntilde;os son utilizados para estos fines, explotados por personas o por las circunstancias.<BR>

<P><H2>Alcance del problema</H2><BR>
Habida cuenta de la naturaleza criminal de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os, es dif&iacute;cil reunir datos precisos. Sin embargo, se sabe que el comercio sexual alcanza una cifra de miles de millones de d&oacute;lares, y que cada a&ntilde;o cerca de un mill&oacute;n de ni&ntilde;os son utilizados en este tr&aacute;fico. Las investigaciones realizadas indican que la edad media de los ni&ntilde;os involucrados est&aacute; decreciendo. La mayor parte de ellos son ni&ntilde;os pobres entre la edad de 13 y 18 a&ntilde;os, aunque existen indicios de que ni&ntilde;os muy j&oacute;venes, incluso beb&eacute;s, est&aacute;n atrapados en este terrible comercio. Estos ni&ntilde;os proceden de todas las partes del mundo.<BR>

<P>El Consejo de Europa comenz&oacute; a reunir datos a finales de los a&ntilde;os 1980 y, en un informe presentado al Consejo en 1988, se estim&oacute; que s&oacute;lo en Par&iacute;s unos 5000 ni&ntilde;os y 3000 ni&ntilde;as trabajaban en las calles, aunque esta estimaci&oacute;n fue cuestionada posteriormente. La organizaci&oacute;n no gubernamental Defence of the Child International ha estimado que 1000 ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as trabajaban como prostitutas en los Pa&iacute;ses Bajos. Un estudio publicado en 1996 destaca el alarmante crecimiento de la prostituci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os rusos, polacos, rumanos, h&uacute;ngaros y checos.<BR>

<P>En Asia, los datos son m&aacute;s completos debido al trabajo de diversos grupos que act&uacute;an contra la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os, los cuales han desplegado su actividad durante un per&iacute;odo m&aacute;s prolongado y han sido capaces de trazar un cuadro m&aacute;s preciso. En 1991, un estudio realizado por India Today situ&oacute; el n&uacute;mero de ni&ntilde;os prostituidos en la India entre 400.000 y 500.000. Las estimaciones sobre la industria sexual infantil en Tailandia var&iacute;a entre 80.000 y 800.000 ni&ntilde;os. La &uacute;ltima cifra procede del Centro para la Protecci&oacute;n de los Derechos del Ni&ntilde;o, que ha realizado trabajos de campo durante 18 a&ntilde;os. En Indochina, despu&eacute;s de un decenio de restricciones de la mayor parte de formas de prostituci&oacute;n bajo los reg&iacute;menes comunistas, Viet Nam y Camboya tienen graves problemas de prostituci&oacute;n y comercio sexual infantil. En Sri Lanka, se sabe que la industria del sexo ha llegado a alcanzar una cifra de alrededor de 20.000 ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as. El problema de las ni&ntilde;as que son raptadas en Nepal y transportadas a trav&eacute;s de la frontera hasta la India es particularmente agudo.Una encuesta reciente realizada en la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana estim&oacute; que hab&iacute;a unos 25.400 menores involucrados en la prostituci&oacute;n. En junio de 1994, un estudio relativo a Colombia calcul&oacute; que s&oacute;lo en la capital Bogot&aacute; 3.000 menores trabajaban como prostitutos. En muchas otras partes de Am&eacute;rica Central y del Sur, incluido Brasil, el problema de los ni&ntilde;os de la calle que se prostituyen est&aacute; ampliamente documentado.   <BR>

<P>Los datos sobre &Aacute;frica son escasos pero muchas de las condiciones relacionadas con la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os son comunes all&iacute;: pobreza, desintegraci&oacute;n familiar, guerras en Mozambique, Sud&aacute;n, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia y Angola en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os. Tales conflictos son devastadores para los mecanismos sociales normales, separan a las familias, exponen a las mujeres y a los ni&ntilde;os a abusos extensos y sistem&aacute;ticos y, en especial, dejan a los ni&ntilde;os aislados y a merced de la explotaci&oacute;n .<BR>

<P>Algunos de estos factores: desigualdades econ&oacute;micas disfunciones familiares, aislamiento, carencia de estructuras de apoyo, abusos y ruptura de los valores morales tambi&eacute;n subyacen en gran parte de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os  de los pa&iacute;ses desarrollados. El abuso del consumo de estupefacientes tambi&eacute;n desempe&ntilde;a un papel importante, ya que los ni&ntilde;os y sus explotadores tratan de ganar dinero para sostener su adicci&oacute;n a los estupefacientes mediante el comercio sexual. Como resultado de ello, es conocida la existencia de un n&uacute;mero creciente de ni&ntilde;os explotados sexualmente en las calles de Nueva York, Londres, Par&iacute;s y Sydney.

<P><H2>Factores contribuyentes</H2><BR>
Las causas de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os son diversas. Aunque resulta f&aacute;cil culpabilizar a los sindicatos del crimen, limitar los explotadores a los alcahuetes y pervertidos, menospreciar a los propios ni&ntilde;os como promiscuos o sexualmente irresponsables, en realidad ning&uacute;n sector social est&aacute; fuera de responsabilidad por la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os.<BR>

<P>Las causas subyacentes comprenden: la injusticia econ&oacute;mica y las disparidades resultantes entre ricos y pobres, la migraci&oacute;n y la urbanizaci&oacute;n a gran escala, y la desintegraci&oacute;n familiar. Estas causas incluyen valores culturales hist&oacute;ricos y permanentes que son discriminatorios contra las ni&ntilde;as y las mujeres, el aflujo de bienes y valores materialistas, perpetrada por los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n, y el consiguiente deterioro de los sistemas de apoyo culturales y comunitarios tradicionales.<BR>

<P>La ignorancia tambi&eacute;n desempe&ntilde;a un papel en la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. La educaci&oacute;n de los progenitores sobre el destino que puede deparar a sus hijos su venta en el mercado de trabajo, de la servidumbre y del sexo, reducir&iacute;a el n&uacute;mero de progenitores que se plantear&iacute;an este tipo de comercio. En ciertas partes del mundo, como Nepal, algunos grupos comunitarios locales est&aacute;n trabajando con los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n para mostrar a los progenitores lo que puede ocurrir cuando entregan a sus hijos a un agente que les promete dinero y una &quot;vida mejor&quot;.<BR>

<P>Uno de los factores principales es el consumismo. La compulsi&oacute;n a poseer, comprar, alquilar -alimentada por la publicidad, las revistas y los medios de ocio- estimula a aquellos que no aprecian a sus hijos ni respetan sus derechos y est&aacute;n dispuestos a comerciar con ellos a cambio de otros bienes m&aacute;s valorados. En algunas partes del mundo los propios ni&ntilde;os, enfrentados a la competencia de sus compa&ntilde;eros de grupo y al deseo de &quot;estar a su altura&quot;, venden sus cuerpos a cambio de dinero para comprar bienes de consumo que de otro modo ser&iacute;an inasequibles para ellos. Estos ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as est&aacute;n explotados por las circunstancias, por una sociedad que les dice constantemente que la posesi&oacute;n es m&aacute;s importante que la dignidad.<BR>

<P>El t&eacute;rmino &quot;contacto&quot; se refiere a lo que sucede cuando una comunidad se ve sujeta a valores y conductas diferentes de las propias, durante un per&iacute;odo prolongado. Algunos consideran que este fue el caso de ciertas partes de Asia, por ejemplo, donde comunidades como las de Filipinas recibieron a numerosos contingentes de ej&eacute;rcitos extranjeros o de las Naciones Unidas durante largo tiempo. Adem&aacute;s de la amenaza causada a menudo por el estacionamiento de grandes contingentes de hombres sin sus familias en un medio dif&iacute;cil y extra&ntilde;o, tal flujo de for&aacute;neos puede introducir en una sociedad una serie de valores, h&aacute;bitos y demandas no necesariamente conocidas o entendidas. Por otra parte, pueden convertir algunas pr&aacute;cticas sexuales de la sociedad de acogida, consideradas excepcionales o inaceptables, en algo menos inusual y por tanto m&aacute;s permisible.<BR>

<P>De esta forma, los abusos realizados por for&aacute;neos se desarrollan a veces a partir de una oferta local ya existente. Viet Nam ser&iacute;a un ejemplo. En este sentido se ha indicado que la sociedad vietnamita, tras a&ntilde;os de &quot;ocupaci&oacute;n&quot; por un ej&eacute;rcito extranjero, no s&oacute;lo estaba m&aacute;s dispuesta a aceptar actitudes liberales respecto a las relaciones sexuales sino que tambi&eacute;n hab&iacute;a heredado un comercio sexual relativamente desarrollado que &uacute;nicamente sobrevivi&oacute; despu&eacute;s del abandono de las tropas extranjeras mediante el incremento de la demanda local. Un factor vinculante es el contacto con algunos mitos originarios de otros pa&iacute;ses. Existe una creencia ampliamente compartida en Asia, basada en un mito chino, de que la relaci&oacute;n sexual con una persona virgen promueve los negocios y el poder. Como la virginidad es asociada a la juventud, el &quot;mito del contacto&quot; est&aacute; subyacente a menudo en la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. Este tipo de contacto es tambi&eacute;n com&uacute;n en &Aacute;frica.

<P><H2>El explotador sexual</H2><BR>
Las personas que tienen relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os pueden variar desde aquellos que eligen esta actividad, a aquellos que les es indiferente y aquellos que no son conscientes. El primero y m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de distinguir es el grupo de los ped&oacute;filos, que en realidad son una minor&iacute;a.<BR>

<P>La pedofilia es una condici&oacute;n por la cual los adultos prefieren tener relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as prep&uacute;beres. La conducta ped&oacute;fila se rige por patrones bastante definidos: los ped&oacute;filos procuran estar en situaciones donde puedan establecer contactos regulares con los ni&ntilde;os. Sus relaciones con los adultos son dif&iacute;ciles pero alegan tener una relaci&oacute;n &quot;cari&ntilde;osa&quot; con los ni&ntilde;os, y a menudo <BR>
sugieren que pagan al ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a con el que tienen relaciones sexuales para ayudar financieramente a su familia, o para iniciar al ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a en las relaciones sexuales con una persona cari&ntilde;osa. Los ped&oacute;filos obtienen regularmente materiales pornogr&aacute;ficos relacionados con ni&ntilde;os y son &quot;coleccionistas&quot; de fotos, v&iacute;deos y otros recordatorios de los ni&ntilde;os con los que tienen contactos con el fin de &quot;congelar&quot; la edad del ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a y volver a revisarlos una y otra vez.<BR>

<P>Hay tambi&eacute;n personas a quienes no les importa que su compa&ntilde;ero sexual sea o no un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a. La globalizaci&oacute;n de los flujos financieros ha incrementado la demanda de relaciones sexuales comerciales, y muchos explotadores son hombres locales, usuarios regulares del comercio de la prostituci&oacute;n, que no distinguen en base a criterios de edad. En algunos casos, la demanda de ni&ntilde;os para relaciones sexuales est&aacute; basada en la creencia de que es menos probable que hayan tenido m&uacute;ltiples relaciones sexuales, y por tanto son menos propensos a transmitir infecciones. En otras circunstancias existen mitos que sostienen que tener relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os puede curar enfermedades, rejuvenecer o incluso mejorar los negocios.<BR>

<P>Algunas personas tienen relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os sin cuestionarse su edad. Pueden ser personas que, en circunstancias &quot;normales&quot;, no elegir&iacute;an tener relaciones sexuales con un menor pero que por una serie de razones lo hacen. Entre estas razones se encuentran: la libertad de unas vacaciones en un lugar ex&oacute;tico extranjero, encontrarse bebido o bajo el efecto de estupefacientes, ignorar o menospreciar la probabilidad de que su pareja sexual sea menor de edad. Tal ignorancia es inexcusable.

<P><H2>Pornograf&iacute;a</H2><BR>
La pornograf&iacute;a infantil es la &quot;reproducci&oacute;n sexualmente expl&iacute;cita de la imagen de un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a&quot;. Se trata, en s&iacute; misma, de una forma de explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. Estimular, forzar o enga&ntilde;ar a los ni&ntilde;os (a menudo mediante el uso de estupefacientes) a posar en fotograf&iacute;as, o participar en v&iacute;deos pornogr&aacute;ficos, es ultrajante y supone un menosprecio de la dignidad y autoestima de los ni&ntilde;os. Esto significa que el cuerpo de un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a carece de valor y les demuestra que su cuerpo est&aacute; a la venta. Por consiguiente, puede ser a menudo un primer paso en el camino a la prostituci&oacute;n o una parte de la prostituci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Con frecuencia, la pornograf&iacute;a infantil implica tambi&eacute;n, coerci&oacute;n y violencia. Estas acciones no s&oacute;lo forman parte a veces del &quot;gui&oacute;n&quot; de un v&iacute;deo o de una foto sino que son infligidas regularmente sobre el ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a para asegurar su sumisi&oacute;n y cooperaci&oacute;n. Algunos explotadores satisfacen sus fantas&iacute;as sexuales mediante la producci&oacute;n de pornograf&iacute;a infantil, o interviniendo como &quot;actores&quot; en el rodaje. Algunos de los actores de la pornograf&iacute;a infantil son explotadores que encuentran placer en la producci&oacute;n de estos materiales. <BR>

<P>La pornograf&iacute;a infantil es tambi&eacute;n, una vez producida, un medio de alimentaci&oacute;n de la demanda de relaciones sexuales infantiles. Las im&aacute;genes de ni&ntilde;os realizando actos sexuales o posando en posturas obscenas, -ya sea en v&iacute;deos o diapositivas- son utilizadas para atraer e incrementar la demanda. Los avances tecnol&oacute;gicos han permitido que la pornograf&iacute;a infantil sea m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de producir, m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de controlar y m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de distribuir. En particular, la disponibilidad de c&aacute;maras de v&iacute;deo y de equipos de edici&oacute;n y reproducci&oacute;n han convertido al &quot;v&iacute;deo dom&eacute;stico&quot; en algo cada vez m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil y barato. La aparici&oacute;n de los gr&aacute;ficos computarizados y de su transmisi&oacute;n global v&iacute;a Internet significa que las im&aacute;genes pueden ser transmitidas a escala mundial y &quot;visualizadas&quot; en el propio hogar.<BR>

<P>Las investigaciones m&aacute;s significativas sobre la pornograf&iacute;a infantil comenzaron a mediados de los a&ntilde;os 1980, y un informe realizado en 1987 se&ntilde;al&oacute; que Europa era la fuente principal de las pel&iacute;culas y fotograf&iacute;as pornogr&aacute;ficas. Seg&uacute;n la INTERPOL, Alemania es uno de los principales productores, los Pa&iacute;ses Bajos y el Reino Unido son grandes centros distribuidores y los Estados Unidos el mercado m&aacute;s amplio, con una cifra de negocios anual de 1.000 millones de d&oacute;lares en 1980. La nueva legislaci&oacute;n aprobada en los a&ntilde;os 1980 ha contribuido a desplazar recientemente la mayor parte de la industria a Asia suroriental.<BR>

<P>Tales leyes han contribuido en parte a la ilegalizaci&oacute;n de la pornograf&iacute;a pero se est&aacute;n convirtiendo en normas obsoletas en aquellos pa&iacute;ses donde los avances tecnol&oacute;gicos han permitido a los productores de pornograf&iacute;a crear im&aacute;genes utilizando modelos de &quot;ni&ntilde;os&quot;, generados por medios inform&aacute;ticos. Como resultado de ello la legislaci&oacute;n protectora de la ni&ntilde;ez no siempre tiene en cuenta situaciones donde se utilizan im&aacute;genes generadas por computador, en lugar de un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a real.

<P><H2>Familia</H2><BR>
Las familias son los primeros cuidadores, educadores y protectores de la ni&ntilde;ez y sus derechos. Los valores familiares son esenciales para la percepci&oacute;n que el ni&ntilde;o tiene de s&iacute; mismo y del mundo que le rodea. Cuando, por cualquier raz&oacute;n, la familia no puede cumplir estas obligaciones y la confianza depositada en ella, empieza a quebrarse la primera l&iacute;nea de defensa del ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a contra un mundo incomprensible e inseguro.<BR>

<P>Los investigadores han comprobado a escala mundial una fuerte correlaci&oacute;n entre los abusos familiares sobre los ni&ntilde;os, especialmente sobre las ni&ntilde;as, y la incitaci&oacute;n a participar en el comercio sexual. La madre, en particular, juega un papel crucial en las decisiones vitales de su hija. Las extensas pruebas de la participaci&oacute;n de la familia en la explotaci&oacute;n sexual directa de los ni&ntilde;os es un hecho inquietante pero quiz&aacute;s no resulta sorprendente, dadas las pesadas cargas y las graves inequidades y dificultades  econ&oacute;micas en que viven muchas familias. Portadoras de la pobreza y la desesperanza, y de valores heredados y recientes que consideran a los ni&ntilde;os como una propiedad y por ende como una fuente de sost&eacute;n econ&oacute;mico, las familias transmiten estos valores y sus consecuencias a sus hijos.<BR>

<P>De hecho, muy a menudo, los progenitores que venden a sus hijos en el comercio sexual lo hacen sin pleno conocimiento. Les dicen, y se lo creen, que sus hijos van a realizar servicios dom&eacute;sticos o cualquier otra forma de trabajo o van a casarse. Muchos de ellos ignoran el destino final de sus hijos &quot;trabajadores&quot;. Sin embargo, algunos progenitores venden a sus hijos en el comercio sexual plenamente conscientes de lo que estos van a hacer, aunque no siempre conocen las consecuencias potenciales de tal actividad. Se ha informado que, en algunas partes de Asia, las familias que tradicionalmente deseaban tener hijos varones para que trabajaran para la familia ahora esperan tener ni&ntilde;as para vender, ya que sus posibles ingresos potenciales son mayores.<BR>

<P>A menudo se cita a la pobreza como la causa subyacente de la venta de ni&ntilde;os para trabajar, pero es importante resaltar que no todas las familias pobres venden a sus hijos.  <BR>

<P>Lo que impulsa a una familia pobre a ganar dinero mediante la venta de un hijo es lo que se ha llamado &quot;la pobreza m&aacute;s la falta de opciones&quot;. Con frecuencia, esto supone que la familia pobre tiene que hacer frente al desempleo, la emigraci&oacute;n forzosa, la estigmatizaci&oacute;n por la comunidad, la dependencia de estupefacientes o las crecientes expectativas por el contacto con el consumismo.<BR>

<P>Algunas veces el ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a son vendidos en el comercio sexual por progenitores que han realizado abusos sexuales o de otro tipo a sus propios hijos. El ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a es considerado entonces como &quot;disponible&quot; para el comercio sexual y capaz de ganar dinero para la familia. El pago de dinero a los progenitores sit&uacute;a al ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a en una situaci&oacute;n de &quot;esclavitud deudora&quot; en la cual estos se ven forzados a mantener relaciones sexuales comerciales para devolver la deuda de la familia al explotador.<BR>

<P>Otro factor a considerar es la reacci&oacute;n de la familia cuando un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a que ha trabajado en el comercio sexual puede escapar y volver a casa (a veces solos, a veces ayudado por organizaciones que trabajan para liberar a los ni&ntilde;os de la explotaci&oacute;n). En algunos casos, la familia no puede -o no podr&aacute;- hacer frente al estigma de tener un &quot;antiguo prostituto o prostituta&quot; en la familia y rechaza al ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a. Existe entonces un gran riesgo de que el ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a vuelva a la prostituci&oacute;n, o sea forzado a hacerlo. El ciclo comienza de nuevo.<BR>

<P>Existen tambi&eacute;n indicaciones de que hermanos mayores u otros miembros femeninos de la familia participan de alg&uacute;n modo en el comercio de la prostituci&oacute;n para evitar que los hermanos menores sean arrastrados a estas pr&aacute;cticas.

<P><H2>Los ni&ntilde;os como mercanc&iacute;a</H2><BR>
La explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os tiene muchas de las caracter&iacute;sticas de un sector industrial organizado: desde los peque&ntilde;os negocios a las grandes empresas, con cuentas bancarias, campa&ntilde;as de publicidad y atractivos folletos. Existen mercaderes que utilizan t&eacute;cnicas de promoci&oacute;n para vender el &quot;producto&quot;, jerarqu&iacute;as de beneficiarios (siempre con los ni&ntilde;os en el puesto m&aacute;s bajo de la escala) y planificadores estrat&eacute;gicos que trabajan para proteger y promover un &quot;buen negocio&quot;. Esta &quot;industria&quot; es un abuso flagrante de los ni&ntilde;os, que implica fraude, secuestro, esclavitud, contrabando, pasaportes falsos, soborno y corrupci&oacute;n a diversos niveles .<BR>

<P>En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os se ha incrementado la demanda de ni&ntilde;os para el comercio sexual. Entre las razones de este auge est&aacute;n el incremento del ingreso y la capacidad de compra que han situado a los ni&ntilde;os como &quot;bienes&quot; asequibles para muchas personas. Algunas falsas concepciones sobre la inmunidad de los ni&ntilde;os a las infecciones -comprendido el VIH/SIDA-, la proliferaci&oacute;n de servicios de ocio como se&ntilde;uelo de diversi&oacute;n, y el creciente consumismo de las sociedades recientemente industrializadas ha creado un ambiente en el que los ni&ntilde;os aparecen devaluados y reducidos al nivel de mercanc&iacute;as de consumo, disponibles para la venta y el abuso.<BR>

<P>El inter&eacute;s de los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n en la pornograf&iacute;a y la prostituci&oacute;n infantil puede alimentar la demanda de modo inintencionado, y la facilidad de acceso a la informaci&oacute;n contribuye tanto a abrir nuevas rutas para la oferta como a incrementar la demanda.<BR>

<P>Los mismos factores causales influyen tanto sobre la demanda como sobre la oferta. Sin embargo, lo que desempe&ntilde;a un papel particularmente importante por el lado de la demanda es la codicia humana. Estos factores econ&oacute;micos y sociol&oacute;gicos  proporcionan la oferta de ni&ntilde;os para la venta y perpet&uacute;an las oportunidades para los intermediarios -alcahuetes, propietarios de burdeles, madames u otros traficantes cuyo &uacute;nico fin es hacer dinero con el comercio sexual de los ni&ntilde;os- que cierran la brecha entre la oferta y la demanda, asegurando la oferta y alimentando la demanda.

<P><H2>Efectos</H2><BR>
El impacto de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual sobre los ni&ntilde;os es enorme, pues supone una p&eacute;rdida de su infancia, su dignidad y a menudo de su futuro. Estos son costos no cuantificables pero algunas consecuencias de la explotaci&oacute;n son m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente medibles.<BR>

<P>El m&aacute;s obvio de estos efectos se proyecta sobre la salud del ni&ntilde;o. El VIH/SIDA es a la vez causa y consecuencia de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os.<BR>

<P>Los indicios disponibles muestran que en algunas partes del mundo, los ni&ntilde;os son elegidos para tener relaciones sexuales por la falsa creencia de que &eacute;stas son m&aacute;s &quot;seguras&quot;. Se piensa, que tener relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os protege al cliente contra el VIH/SIDA porque es m&aacute;s probable que est&eacute;n &quot;sanos&quot; y que hayan tenido menos parejas sexuales.<BR>

<P>La verdad es precisamente lo contrario. Debido a su vulnerabilidad y debilidad los ni&ntilde;os prostituidos son forzados a menudo a tener relaciones con m&aacute;s clientes de los que podr&iacute;a aceptar un adulto, y tienen generalmente menos poder para pedir a un cliente que utilice un preservativo. Adem&aacute;s, los ni&ntilde;os son f&iacute;sicamente m&aacute;s vulnerables a la infecci&oacute;n, no s&oacute;lo porque pueden tener lesiones internas m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente -y son tratados a menudo con violencia por sus clientes-, sino tambi&eacute;n porque sus j&oacute;venes membranas son m&aacute;s porosas.<BR>

<P>La ni&ntilde;a totalmente virgen es percibida por muchos clientes como la &quot;apuesta m&aacute;s segura&quot;. La cirug&iacute;a pl&aacute;stica es una pr&aacute;ctica com&uacute;n para vender a ni&ntilde;os explotados sexualmente como si fueran v&iacute;rgenes aunque en realidad han tenido m&uacute;ltiples relaciones sexuales con numerosos clientes.<BR>

<P>En realidad muchos ni&ntilde;os forzados al comercio sexual est&aacute;n siendo infectados por el VIH. Los ni&ntilde;os rescatados de burdeles de algunos pa&iacute;ses de Asia suroriental son sometidos inmediatamente a pruebas del VIH/SIDA. Tasas de un 50% de casos positivos son normales, con niveles de hasta un 90% de seropositivos en algunos casos. Esto no solamente es en si mismo una sentencia de muerte, sino que tambi&eacute;n significa que el resto de la vida del ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a afectados puede suponer una p&eacute;rdida de la familia y de la comunidad, de la dignidad y de las oportunidades. Los ni&ntilde;os con VIH-positivo se enfrentan a la discriminaci&oacute;n y al rechazo social.<BR>

<P>Existen tambi&eacute;n otras graves repercusiones f&iacute;sicas y psicol&oacute;gicas relacionadas con la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os.<BR>

<P>Los ni&ntilde;os son despose&iacute;dos de su infancia y del esparcimiento durante los a&ntilde;os formativos. Esta privaci&oacute;n deja marcas que pueden tardar a&ntilde;os en desaparecer. Los ni&ntilde;os pierden la confianza en los dem&aacute;s, particularmente en los adultos, y se quedan a merced de otros tipos de explotaci&oacute;n. Asimismo, es probable que se conviertan a su vez en explotadores. Pierden la autoestima y la dignidad y pueden desarrollar toda una gama de s&iacute;ntomas de tensiones postraum&aacute;ticas tales como la depresi&oacute;n, la agresi&oacute;n y la violencia, perdida de autocontrol e inclinaci&oacute;n a la automutilaci&oacute;n. Frecuentemente, sus vidas terminan en suicidio.<BR>

<P>Hay tambi&eacute;n efectos f&iacute;sicos de larga duraci&oacute;n. Los ni&ntilde;os no s&oacute;lo se encuentran atrapados en el ciclo de explotaci&oacute;n sexual, sufriendo abusos f&iacute;sicos, golpes, quemaduras, torturas y privaci&oacute;n de alimentos, aire, luz y libertad de movimientos, sino que tambi&eacute;n se ven expuestos a infecciones renales, c&aacute;ncer cervical, embarazos precoces y continuados, y enfermedades de transmisi&oacute;n sexual.<BR>

<P>Numerosos estudios han mostrado altos niveles de consumo de estupefacientes de los ni&ntilde;os envueltos en la prostituci&oacute;n. Los estupefacientes son utilizados a menudo para mantener a los ni&ntilde;os sometidos a la prostituci&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n pueden ser consumidos como medicamentos autoprescritos para paliar el sufrimiento del hambre y la desesperanza.

<P><H2>Protecci&oacute;n legal</H2><BR>
La mayor&iacute;a de los servicios de polic&iacute;a y de cumplimiento de la ley de todo el mundo est&aacute;n trabajando para combatir la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. A nivel internacional, la INTERPOL, por ejemplo, tiene un Grupo permanente de trabajo sobre los delitos contra los menores, que incluye representantes de organizaciones no gubernamentales contra la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os, los cuales han desarrollado una gran actividad en la promoci&oacute;n de la legislaci&oacute;n extraterritorial y en la identificaci&oacute;n y condena de delincuentes .<BR>

<P>A nivel nacional, la mayor parte de los pa&iacute;ses disponen de legislaci&oacute;n que considera como delito el abuso sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. Asimismo, 188 pa&iacute;ses (hasta el 1 de mayo de 1996) han firmado o ratificado la Convenci&oacute;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos del Ni&ntilde;o y han promulgado leyes para cumplir sus compromisos derivados de la firma de esta importante Convenci&oacute;n. Existen tambi&eacute;n numerosas y diversas leyes nacionales que prohiben o regulan las relaciones sexuales, la prostituci&oacute;n, la pornograf&iacute;a, el secuestro, la esclavitud y el abuso de los menores de edad, una gama completa de actos criminales, que de hecho ocurren en el medio donde tiene lugar la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os.<BR>

<P>En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os, se ha producido tambi&eacute;n una creciente conciencia de la naturaleza trasnacional de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. Los materiales pornogr&aacute;ficos y los propios ni&ntilde;os cruzan las fronteras nacionales. Los explotadores se desplazan para establecer sus redes. Los clientes viajan para comprar servicios en lugares for&aacute;neos. Por consiguiente, la cooperaci&oacute;n intergubernamental es absolutamente vital, no s&oacute;lo para diagnosticar el problema sino tambi&eacute;n para controlarlo policialmente, castigando duramente a los culpables y difundiendo las condenas ejemplares.<BR>

<P>Varios pa&iacute;ses han promulgado legislaci&oacute;n de car&aacute;cter territorial que, con la cooperaci&oacute;n de otros gobiernos, les ha permitido investigar delitos fuera de sus fronteras jurisdiccionales y/o poner a sus nacionales frente a la justicia cuando vuelven a su pa&iacute;s. De este modo se ha evitado la protecci&oacute;n de los extranjeros detenidos por delitos relacionados con el comercio sexual de los ni&ntilde;os que mediante sobornos pod&iacute;an obtener la libertad y escapar a su pa&iacute;s de origen.<BR>

<P>Ir&oacute;nicamente, a menudo las leyes existentes castigan m&aacute;s a los ni&ntilde;os que a sus explotadores. Por ejemplo, en Inglaterra y Gales entre 1989 y 1993, se dictaron 1500 condenas contra ni&ntilde;os por delitos relacionados con la prostituci&oacute;n. Otras leyes obligan a los ni&ntilde;os que han sido objeto de comercio sexual a ser deportados al lugar desde donde fueron vendidos en primer lugar.<BR>

<P>Tambi&eacute;n se ha podido documentar con toda claridad que los ni&ntilde;os encontrados en burdeles, salas de masaje, calles y otros lugares donde son explotados sexualmente con fines comerciales son a menudo encerrados en celdas con adultos que abusan de ellos. En algunos pa&iacute;ses occidentales, los rostros de los ni&ntilde;os implicados aparecen en los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n y son tratados como delincuentes, mientras que los de los explotadores adultos son ocultados para proteger su identidad. <BR>
Pero promulgar leyes no es lo mismo que aplicarlas. Es realmente dif&iacute;cil lograr una aplicaci&oacute;n efectiva de las leyes contra una actividad encubierta. Resulta a&uacute;n m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil cuando, como sucede en algunos casos bien documentados, los encargados locales de hacer cumplir la ley est&aacute;n ellos mismos implicados en la corrupci&oacute;n y obtienen un beneficio de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. A menudo, las leyes son despreciadas, por ejemplo, ante las presiones para promover el turismo de un pa&iacute;s y las autoridades cierran los ojos hacia una actividad que por otra parte proporciona ingresos. Pero las leyes deben ser aplicadas. Son la protecci&oacute;n final de los ni&ntilde;os y hasta ahora no se ha hecho lo suficiente para promulgar leyes realmente eficaces o para aplicarlas cuando ya est&aacute;n en vigor.

<P><H2>Rescate y reintegraci&oacute;n</H2><BR>
Qu&eacute; sucede cuando los ni&ntilde;os son rescatados de la prostituci&oacute;n? A menudo nada, lo cual es parte del problema. Las ONG que trabajan en este campo realizan misiones de rescate para liberar a los ni&ntilde;os de la esclavitud de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial, pero los servicios de apoyo no est&aacute;n todav&iacute;a desarrollados para hacer frente a las necesidades abrumadoras de los ni&ntilde;os rescatados. Estas necesidades comprenden servicios de salud, entre ellos apoyo psicol&oacute;gico y atenci&oacute;n postraum&aacute;tica, para hacer frente a las dificultades -quiz&aacute; incluso la imposibilidad- de reintegraci&oacute;n en sus comunidades, y al estigma y la carencia de comprensi&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os explotados sexualmente.<BR>

<P>En primer lugar, los ni&ntilde;os rescatados de la prostituci&oacute;n deben recobrar, cuando sea posible, la buena salud. Han sido f&iacute;sica y mentalmente maltratados y su salud mental y f&iacute;sica debe restablecerse. Algunas veces el da&ntilde;o f&iacute;sico no puede ser enteramente eliminado: los ni&ntilde;os que son VIH-positivo, por ejemplo, o que se han convertido en inf&eacute;rtiles por las infecciones de enfermedades de transmisi&oacute;n sexual, continuar&aacute;n viviendo con los efectos de su explotaci&oacute;n sexual. El logro de una buena salud mental mediante asesoramiento adecuado es uno de los objetivos espec&iacute;ficos de la reintegraci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os que han sido explotados sexualmente.<BR>

<P>La rehabilitaci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n pretende ayudar a los supervivientes de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial para reducir su vulnerabilidad en el futuro. Los ni&ntilde;os reciben capacitaci&oacute;n en una serie de conocimientos que les permitir&aacute;n ganarse la vida y sostenerse. Pueden tener la oportunidad de vivir en un alojamiento espec&iacute;ficamente dise&ntilde;ado para ellos con el fin de que puedan acceder a la capacitaci&oacute;n y asesoramiento necesarios.<BR>

<P>Sin embargo, quiz&aacute; el paso m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil en el camino de la rehabilitaci&oacute;n es la restauraci&oacute;n de los lazos familiares y amistosos, de la vida dom&eacute;stica y de la autoestima dentro de la sociedad. En muchos casos, los ni&ntilde;os que han sido explotados en la prostituci&oacute;n no son aceptados cuando vuelven al seno de la familia o de la comunidad por el estigma asociado al trabajo que se han visto forzados a realizar. <BR>

<P>Esto es particularmente cierto si los ni&ntilde;os son VIH-positivo. En tales casos, la cuesti&oacute;n de la confidencialidad del estado de un ni&ntilde;o infectado de VIH complica a&uacute;n m&aacute;s la situaci&oacute;n. En estas circunstancias debe encontrarse un &quot;nuevo&quot; hogar para prevenir que el ni&ntilde;o vuelva a caer en las garras de los explotadores.<BR>

<P>La vulnerabilidad de los ni&ntilde;os que han sido explotados sexualmente es grande, y por ello es vital que, una vez rescatados, no est&aacute;n situados en una posici&oacute;n que suponga una vulnerabilidad similar o mayor bien sea porque carecen de apoyo familiar y comunitario, medios de vida, o tienen un estatuto ilegal, mala salud o cualquier forma de dependencia. <BR>

<P>Muchas ONG y agencias internacionales se ocupan de este abanico de cuestiones a fin de proporcionar apoyo para el rescate de los ni&ntilde;os sometidos a explotaci&oacute;n sexual, construir un futuro mejor para ellos y evitar as&iacute; que vuelvan a ser explotados o que se conviertan a su vez en explotadores.

<P><H2>Tecnolog&iacute;a y medios de comunicaci&oacute;n</H2><BR>
Los grandes avances tecnol&oacute;gicos han permitido que la pornograf&iacute;a infantil -uno de los factores principales en la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os- sea m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil y m&aacute;s barata de producir, m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de detectar y m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de distribuir. Toda una serie de aparatos electr&oacute;nicos de uso dom&eacute;stico como c&aacute;maras y sistemas de reproducci&oacute;n y edici&oacute;n de v&iacute;deos y gr&aacute;ficos generados por computador, han desplazado a la industria pornogr&aacute;fica infantil a los propios hogares      -donde es m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de controlar para la polic&iacute;a- la cual ha llegado a convertirse en un negocio multimillonario en d&oacute;lares.<BR>

<P>El acceso a Internet ha abierto nuevos canales de informaci&oacute;n para aquellos que buscan relaciones sexuales con ni&ntilde;os. La naturaleza interactiva de la tecnolog&iacute;a de Internet supone que la informaci&oacute;n puede ser compartida en tiempo real y las &quot;peticiones especiales&quot; pueden ser atendidas por los proveedores de ni&ntilde;os prostituidos. Las im&aacute;genes pornogr&aacute;ficas y los v&iacute;deo clips pueden ser introducidos y visualizados en la red de forma igualmente an&oacute;nima. Por el momento, la &uacute;nica intervenci&oacute;n disponible para los defensores de la ley parece ser la v&iacute;a de los proveedores de servicios, que pueden rehusar la venta de espacio a cualquiera que se conozca que va a proporcionar materiales sexuales infantiles.<BR>

<P>M&aacute;s all&aacute; de la tecnolog&iacute;a, los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n juegan un importante papel en el &aacute;mbito de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os, tanto en un sentido positivo como negativo.<BR>

<P>En el lado negativo los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n han contribuido indudablemente a la liberalizaci&oacute;n de im&aacute;genes sexualmente expl&iacute;citas, y al cambio de valores morales. La tecnolog&iacute;a de los sat&eacute;lites, los viajes internacionales y la quiebra de las infraestructuras comunitarias de apoyo suponen que tales im&aacute;genes son recibidas a menudo en un marco vulnerable, o incluso en toda una sociedad para la cual no estaban espec&iacute;ficamente destinadas.<BR>

<P>Muchos televidentes son adolescentes, y la actitud de algunos medios hacia ellos -que los menosprecia y los muestra como f&aacute;cilmente explotables- puede contribuir a fomentar una imagen devaluada de los j&oacute;venes y de su lugar en la sociedad.<BR>

<P>Asimismo, en el lado negativo, muchos bien intencionados reporteros que investigan la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os suministran informaci&oacute;n que ayuda a veces a los propios explotadores: nombre de las calles, localizaciones de pueblos, im&aacute;genes f&aacute;cilmente identificables de playas y otros datos significativos. A menudo, la tentaci&oacute;n de emitir o imprimir im&aacute;genes sensacionalistas ha lindado con la pornograf&iacute;a y por ende con la explotaci&oacute;n y ha levantado cr&iacute;ticas sobre el &quot;se&ntilde;uelo de la televisi&oacute;n&quot;. En algunos casos, los periodistas han contribuido inconscientemente a corromper las pruebas al pagar por la informaci&oacute;n y las im&aacute;genes, permitiendo as&iacute; que los delincuentes puedan escapar a la condena escud&aacute;ndose en cuestiones t&eacute;cnico-procesales.<BR>

<P>Pero el papel de los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n puede ser enormemente positivo. Los periodistas tienen acceso a informaciones que a otras personas les resulta ordinariamente muy dif&iacute;cil de obtener. De este modo, han trabajado junto con organizaciones no gubernamentales y con la polic&iacute;a para localizar y descubrir a los explotadores y los lugares de explotaci&oacute;n, y han informado sobre las detenciones y condenas, contribuyendo as&iacute; a la disuasi&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n pueden contribuir tambi&eacute;n de modo destacado a abogar por la protecci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os, subrayando los valores morales positivos y los derechos humanos. Pueden apoyar los valores positivos de la familia e informar a los progenitores cuando sus hijos est&aacute;n en riesgo. Pueden ayudar a los propios ni&ntilde;os marcando referentes morales sobre su conducta e identificando factores o situaciones de riesgo en los que pueden estar en peligro. Asimismo, los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n son uno de los m&aacute;s poderosos agentes educadores.<BR>

<P>Pero lo m&aacute;s importante de todo es que los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n han reconocido que son unos actores importantes en el &aacute;rea de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os, y por ello est&aacute;n envueltos en un activo debate para examinar su   papel y para establecer compromisos en favor de pautas &eacute;ticas que regulen su comportamiento.

<P><H2>Los ni&ntilde;os y el turismo sexual</H2><BR>
El turismo sexualmente orientado es una rama desarrollada de la industria de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual, con su propia parafernalia de materiales promocionales, desde folletos rutilantes a clubes organizados y al acceso a &quot;tours&quot; informativos en la red de Internet. Esta tecnolog&iacute;a interactiva permite obtener informaci&oacute;n y consejos a los clientes y preparar sus demandas de vacaciones con antelaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Se han documentado industrias desarrolladas de turismo sexual en Filipinas, Camboya y Tailandia. M&aacute;s recientemente se ha producido un incremento de tours sexuales desde Norteam&eacute;rica hacia Brasil y la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana. Asimismo, se ha informado que en algunas &aacute;reas de Sri Lanka varios miles de ni&ntilde;os ejercen la prostituci&oacute;n con turistas masculinos. Es muy probable que el turismo sexual se est&eacute; incrementando en los pa&iacute;ses de la Europa del Este. En la actualidad, la mayor parte de los turistas sexuales viajan individualmente o en parejas en vuelos regulares. Anteriormente, los tours sexuales eran f&aacute;ciles de identificar y de condenar, por esto, los organizadores del turismo sexual env&iacute;an ahora a sus clientes de forma menos aparente.<BR>

<P>Desde 1990, la organizaci&oacute;n ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) ha estado vigilando y actuando contra el turismo sexual en Asia y m&aacute;s recientemente en otros lugares. ECPAT ha logrado &eacute;xitos en la promoci&oacute;n de la cooperaci&oacute;n gubernamental trasnacional, en la legislaci&oacute;n extraterritorial que permite a los gobiernos poner a los presuntos delincuentes nacionales ante sus tribunales por delitos cometidos en otros pa&iacute;ses y atraer la atenci&oacute;n p&uacute;blica hacia el arresto, detenci&oacute;n y condena de los ped&oacute;filos implicados en el turismo sexual.<BR>

<P>ECPAT ha logrado promover el inter&eacute;s y el compromiso de las autoridades tur&iacute;sticas mundiales, las agencias de viaje, los editores de gu&iacute;as de vacaciones y los promotores de turismo en una acci&oacute;n conjunta contra el turismo sexual.

<P><H2>Rutas del tr&aacute;fico sexual</H2><BR>
Un informe de 1987 del Consejo de Europa identific&oacute; cinco redes de tr&aacute;fico internacional hacia Europa para la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de ni&ntilde;os:<BR>

<P>	.	De Am&eacute;rica Latina hacia Europa y Oriente Medio<BR>

<P>	.	Un mercado regional Europeo<BR>

<P>	.	Un mercado regional &Aacute;rabe<BR>

<P>	.	Exportaciones de ni&ntilde;as desde &Aacute;frica occidental<BR>

<P>
<P>En Europa oriental el tr&aacute;fico se mueve en general de este a oeste. Ni&ntilde;as procedentes de <BR>
	.	Rusia, Ucrania, Belar&uacute;s son transportadas en n&uacute;mero 		significativo hacia Polonia, Hungr&iacute;a, los Estados 		B&aacute;lticos, o hacia <BR>
	.	las capitales de Europa occidental, a las que se 		unen otras ni&ntilde;as de los pa&iacute;ses fronterizos.<BR>
	.	Los investigadores han identificado tambi&eacute;n un 		tr&aacute;fico de prostitutas rumanas hacia Italia, Chipre 		y Turqu&iacute;a.<BR>

<P>
<P>Existen tambi&eacute;n varias rutas bien definidas en Asia suroriental:<BR>
	.	De Myanmar (Birmania) hacia Tailandia<BR>
	.	De China meridional hacia Tailandia v&iacute;a Myanmar<BR>
	.	De Camboya y Viet Nam hacia Tailandia<BR>
	.	Rutas internas dentro de Tailandia y otros pa&iacute;ses 		donde la prostituci&oacute;n infantil es com&uacute;n<BR>
	.	Hacia China, Malasia, Singapur, Jap&oacute;n y los EE.UU 	.	De Tailandia y las Filipinas as&iacute; como desde otros 		pa&iacute;ses menos bien documentados, hacia Australia, 		Nueva Zelandia y Taiwan <BR>
	.	Desde Nepal y Bangladesh hacia la India<BR>

<P>
<P>Las rutas de tr&aacute;fico infantil m&aacute;s lucrativas son las de Asia suroriental hacia Jap&oacute;n y Hawai v&iacute;a Hong Kong. Asimismo, el tr&aacute;fico de ni&ntilde;os procedentes de Asia meridional (desde la India y Pakist&aacute;n) hacia Oriente Medio es bastante extenso.<BR>

<P>Indudablemente tambi&eacute;n existen otras rutas.

<P><H2>Contraofensiva</H2><BR>
La contraofensiva contra la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os se est&aacute; desarrollando a muchos niveles diferentes. Las organizaciones no gubernamentales y las agencias de las Naciones Unidas han desplegado acciones de investigaci&oacute;n y vigilancia durante varios a&ntilde;os, identificando ni&ntilde;os en riesgo y  envueltos en la explotaci&oacute;n, e identificando explotadores y poni&eacute;ndolos ante la justicia cuando ha sido posible. Las ONG han jugado un papel instrumental en la estimulaci&oacute;n de los gobiernos para la promulgaci&oacute;n de leyes extraterritoriales, y han trabajado con las organizaciones tur&iacute;sticas para movilizar su ayuda contra el turismo sexual infantil.<BR>

<P>La coalici&oacute;n de organizaciones no gubernamentales ECPAT ha publicado una extensa informaci&oacute;n, en muchas lenguas y ha movilizado a los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n logrando aumentar la conciencia p&uacute;blica hasta niveles sin precedentes. Gracias a la iniciativa de ECPAT ha sido posible proponer el primer Congreso Mundial contra la Explotaci&oacute;n Sexual Comercial de los Ni&ntilde;os y que el Gobierno sueco se haya ofrecido como anfitri&oacute;n para celebrarlo en Estocolmo en agosto de 1996.<BR>

<P>El trabajo de recuperaci&oacute;n y reintegraci&oacute;n es complejo. Algunas comunidades encuentran dif&iacute;cil de aceptar la vuelta de los ni&ntilde;os prostituidos y queda entonces en manos de las ONG la ayuda para integrar estos ni&ntilde;os en nuevas comunidades. Las ONG tambi&eacute;n han establecido centros de acogida y ofrecen formaci&oacute;n profesional para brindar a los ni&ntilde;os medios de ganarse la vida, asesoramiento y otros servicios. M&aacute;s de un millar de ONG trabaja con los ni&ntilde;os de la calle. Otras trabajan espec&iacute;ficamente con los ni&ntilde;os seropositivos del VIH y en diversas &aacute;reas de atenci&oacute;n de la salud.<BR>

<P>Las agencias de las Naciones Unidas trabajan junto a las ONG, por ejemplo en Camboya, en proyectos para vigilar y mitigar el tr&aacute;fico de ni&ntilde;os. El UNICEF y las ONG trabajan de forma conjunta espec&iacute;ficamente, en programas de prevenci&oacute;n a largo plazo, en las &aacute;reas de formulaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas, y en la promoci&oacute;n de medidas de protecci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os. Los objetivos prioritarios del UNICEF comprenden la educaci&oacute;n de las ni&ntilde;as, la educaci&oacute;n de los ni&ntilde;os de la calle, la extensi&oacute;n de la atenci&oacute;n de salud, el desarrollo de pol&iacute;ticas y formaci&oacute;n en materia de derechos del ni&ntilde;o, y en actividades de comunicaci&oacute;n y promoci&oacute;n. El UNICEF apoya tambi&eacute;n programas y focaliza sus acciones en medidas preventivas.<BR>

<P>Las agencias de las Naciones Unidas y las ONG tambi&eacute;n est&aacute;n activamente involucradas en la promoci&oacute;n de actividades de formaci&oacute;n de profesionales jur&iacute;dicos, polic&iacute;as y otros servicios encargados del cumplimiento de la ley, en aquellas &aacute;reas donde se desarrolla la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os, como, por ejemplo, en las operaciones de tr&aacute;fico fronterizo.

<P><H2>El Congreso Mundial</H2><BR>
El Congreso Mundial contra la Explotaci&oacute;n Sexual Comercial de los Ni&ntilde;os, celebrado en Estocolmo, Suecia, del 27 al 31 de agosto de 1996, fue parte de un proceso m&aacute;s amplio de protecci&oacute;n de los derechos del ni&ntilde;o. El programa del Congreso se centra en tres elementos relacionados con la explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os: prostituci&oacute;n infantil, tr&aacute;fico y venta de ni&ntilde;os con prop&oacute;sitos sexuales y pornograf&iacute;a infantil.<BR>

<P>El objetivo b&aacute;sico del Congreso fue atraer la atenci&oacute;n internacional hacia los problemas de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os y promover el desarrollo de pol&iacute;ticas y programas nacionales para combatir todas las formas de este tipo de explotaci&oacute;n en el contexto espec&iacute;fico en que tienen lugar. Con este fin, el Congreso considera la adopci&oacute;n de una Declaraci&oacute;n y un Programa de Acci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>El Congreso proporciona un foro abierto para el debate mediante talleres y la presentaci&oacute;n de estudios de casos, en los que todos los sectores sociales podr&aacute;n intercambiar experiencias: el alcance del problema, las causas subyacentes y las formas espec&iacute;ficas de explotaci&oacute;n sexual comercial de los ni&ntilde;os en diferentes pa&iacute;ses y regiones.<BR>

<P>Pero el objetivo prioritario fue sentar las bases para la acci&oacute;n a nivel nacional, mediante el incremento de la atenci&oacute;n y el inter&eacute;s hacia este problema a trav&eacute;s de la promoci&oacute;n de asociaciones y coaliciones nacionales entre los gobiernos, las ONG, la sociedad civil y las organizaciones internacionales. El Congreso fue s&oacute;lo un paso en este importante proceso.<BR>

<P>La raz&oacute;n de que el Congreso se celebre ahora es debida a la creciente manifestaci&oacute;n de algunos aspectos de la explotaci&oacute;n sexual de los ni&ntilde;os. La extensi&oacute;n del VIH/SIDA y el proceso general de globalizaci&oacute;n han conducido a un aumento de la explotaci&oacute;n. Adem&aacute;s, la comunidad internacional es cada vez m&aacute;s consciente del problema y el nivel de atrocidad ha aumentado. El Congreso supone el primer intento a escala mundial de coordinar la cooperaci&oacute;n internacional en cuestiones trasnacionales y en reunir a los principales actores internacionales interesados.<BR>

1,879 people, including 718 government representatives from 122 countries, 105 delegates of UN and other inter-governmental organisations, 471 non-governmental organisation representatives, 47 youth/co-sponsor delegates and 538 members of the world's press, met in Stockholm, Sweden, 27 - 31 August 1996 at the first World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.<BR>
<BR>
In the words of the General Rapporteur, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, &quot;there can be no more delusions&quot; -- no-one can deny that the problem of children being sold for sex exists, here and now, in almost every country in the world.<BR>

<P>A Declaration and Agenda for Action (see &quot;Declaration&quot;) were unanimously adopted and strategic alliances formed to fight against those who sell and buy children for sex.  Updates of documents at this site are in progress.<BR>

<P><B>I.	INTRODUCTION</B><BR>

<P>In the brothels of Manila and Nairobi on the streets of Rio and New York, in the bars of Amsterdam and Bangkok, in buses, railway stations, hotel rooms in all parts of the world, millions of children are at risk of commercial sexual exploitation or already caught in the mega-dollar sex industry. <BR>

<P>Children sacrificed to the abuse of power by unthinking and unscrupulous adults; children subjected to violence and serious health hazards; their right to education and all other rights denied; their childhood itself and all aspects of their development undermined;  their life prospects severely curtailed. These are the tragic and ugly manifestations of neglect and failure of societies, communities and governments to deal with the widespread problem of children trapped in the sex trade.<BR>

<P>The educational system is societys instrument to equip children with adequate and appropriate skills and knowledge to fulfill their potential and meet lifes responsibilities. Education is a vehicle for transmitting to the next generation, the values, attitudes, beliefs, behaviours and norms considered important by a society; it is also a tool for social transformation. Failure in educational systems feature prominently in perpetuating the practice of commercial sexual exploitation of children; effective education, therefore, must be an important element in its elimination. What are the possibilities and limits of education in combating the sexual exploitation of children? What can be done to enhance its positive role? These are the questions addressed in this paper.<BR>

<P><B>II.	EDUCATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE</B><BR>

<P>The commercial sexual exploitation of children is a complex and multi-faceted problem that  includes economic, social, cultural and political determinants.  Poverty caused by economic disparities and the absence of opportunities for families and young people are major villains in the drama. Social and cultural values and norms of behaviour sometimes foster the indifference toward, even acquiescence of grievous assaults on children. Many legal systems and their enforcement mechanisms fail to deter injustice or protect children from criminal acts committed against them. Systems of governance often deny a voice to the very sectors of society who need most to be heard -- those affected by exploitation and inequality. Education, itself affected by the interplay of social forces, must therefore, become an instrument of change with a major role in preventing, reducing, and eventually eliminating this practice.<BR>

<P>It has been convincingly argued that organized schooling in formal or nonformal programmes constitute a tiny fraction of human learning. The major bulk of education and certainly the most enduring part happens through interaction with ones social and physical environment. This learning through life has been described as<I> informal</I> learning in contrast to organized learning through <I>forma</I>l and <I>nonformal</I> educational programmes.		Coombs, P.H., and Ahmed, M., <I>Attacking Rural Poverty: How  Nonformal Education Can Help,</I> World Bank and Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974.<BR>

<P>Education in its widest sense happens by circumstance or by design. Children learn more from how they are treated than from what they are taught, and that learning can foster or impede a childs healthy development. Education is the creation and building of values and attitudes, skills, beliefs, and behaviours. Childrens understanding of themselves and their world is shaped by relationships with important adults and peers in their lives, through role models, observation and instruction.<BR>

<P>Children internalize the lessons they are taught at home, in school, on television and radio, in churches and mosques --as well as on the street, in railway and bus stations, bars and brothels. And what are the lessons that children caught in commercial sex are learning? That adults are not trustworthy; that children, especially girls are viewed primarily as property, valued for their short-term economic gain; that decision-making is the privilege of those who have power; and that money, status and possessions are often worth more than dignity, self-respect and even sometimes life, itself.<BR>

<P>Who are the teachers of those victimized by commercial sexual exploitation? These children learn most directly from the abuse of sex exploiters themselves, the customers, the traffickers, pimps, brothel owners and all those who buy and sell, earn money from or pay to have sex with children.  But these perpetrators could not exist without the explicit or implicit complicity of society at large -- and of  those adults responsible for the nurturing, protection, and development of children -- families, teachers, health professionals and other service providers, law enforcement officials, religious and community leaders, the media, policy makers and the public at large.<BR>

<P>The challenge for education is two-fold.<I> First,</I> how can the educational system, working in synergy with other social institutions, become a proactive force for social change? The aim of this collaboration is to ensure a change in attitude and practice by all social institutions and systems that will engender protection, respect and promotion of the humanity, dignity and rights of children. <I>Second, </I>how can the educational system counteract the negative impact and reinforce the empowering and enabling lessons of informal learning? Formal or nonformal educational programmes are not sufficient as they stand, even for those children who are already attending school. <BR>

<P>Education is not a panacea, nor will educational measures alone suffice to combat the depredation of children in the sex trade. At the same time, no effort to address the problem will be workable or sustainable  without them. This paper will show that the educational system can and should contribute far more to the solution than it has done to date.<BR>

<P>There is something grossly wrong when children and adolescents, instead of attending school and other educational institutions, instead of being nurtured in an environment of care and affection, are deprived of their right to education and forced to live under the shadow of threat, violence and humiliation.  Education, in partnership with other instruments or with society, must be used to redress this wrong.<BR>

<P><B> III.	A FRAMEWORK OF EDUCATIONAL ACTION TO COMBAT THE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN </B><BR>

<P>Education, at its best, is an empowering tool for children, enabling them to develop the necessary confidence, self-esteem, capacity for reasoning and social skills to protect their rights and dignity and to become productive, fully participating adult members of society. Successful education can also enable adults whose role is to nurture, care for and educate children to understand and act upon their continuing and changing responsibility in shaping the development of children. And when designed and carried out purposefully, education can create and build the commitment of society as a whole to respect the rights and dignity of its children.<BR>

<P> <B>1.	The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)</B><BR>

<P>Any educational approach to commercial sexual exploitation should be based firmly on the letter and the spirit of the Convention. An expression of international consensus on the norms and standards of behaviour of societies towards their children, the Convention spells out obligations of society and the state regarding all children.  Its ratification by 187 states to-date signals a global commitment to recognize and protect all rights for all children.  This near universal acceptance represents a unique opportunity for aggressive advocacy and awareness-raising on behalf of children. As the first step to change, awareness raising  needs to be accompanied by the design and development of mechanisms that create the possibilities for families and children to find and choose better opportunities.<BR>

<P>The Convention is a relevant framework for educational action: It underscores the links between commercial sexual exploitation and various violations of rights; it establishes fundamental principles and guidelines for thinking about and acting on the fulfillment of rights; and the rights of participation by children in decisions affecting their lives has particular relevance to education.<BR>

<P>The Convention also presents a framework for action, guiding us to strategies that combine the rights of children to be protected from with their rights to be provided with. For the Convention recognizes that all children are not equally vulnerable to violation of rights and that special measures are required for the protection and fulfillment of the rights of those children in especially difficult circumstances. Most rights of children in commercial sexual exploitation are being breached, the right to education among them. Could enabling these children to exercise their right to education facilitate their access to other rights?<BR>

<P>Yes--if educational strategies recognize the principle of indivisibility--that no single article or group of articles can be viewed in isolation from the others; they must all be viewed together.  Education needs to be accompanied by complementary measures, i.e. legislation, new policies, health programmes, alternative economic opportunities and the commitment to a change in values in attitudes.<BR>

<P>Yes--if the best interests of the child is the central principle for devising strategies in accordance with the rights and obligations of parents, teachers, legal guardians and all relevant legislative and administrative measures.<BR>

<P>Yes--if children, depending on their developmental stage, are active participants in the decision making process about measures that affect their well-being. The principle of participation, expressed in Article 12 of the Convention, adds a new dimension to the adult worlds interaction with children. Only if the adults in a childs life pay full respect to her/his judgements and views considering age and degree of maturity, can the child become a real participating member of society. In the educational process, then, young people must be seen as resources rather than victims; their resilience, strength and opinions respected and relied on.<BR>

<P><B> 2.	An International Commitment</B><BR>

<P>The <I>World Conference on Education for All </I>held in Jomtien, Thailand in 1990, the world community pledged to take the necessary steps to achieve primary education for all children by the end of the decade. Jomtien also articulated an expanded vision of universal basic education that went beyond access and enrolment to the quality and relevance of learning as a tool for empowerment. The Jomtien goals have become a  benchmark for subsequent international expressions of social development goals; notably those of the World Summit for Children (1990), the International Conference on Population and Development (1994), the World Summit for Social Development (1995) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (1995).<BR>

<P>Commercial sexual exploitation of children is only now being placed on the global agenda, and  forging a link with education, for prevention and recovery, is a new endeavor. The World Congress in Stockholm represents an awakening and a commitment to raise awareness and take action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. At the heart of this commitment lies education aimed at changing attitudes and behaviours that will move society irrevocably in the direction of eliminating this disabling practice. <BR>

<P><B> 3.	Educational Objectives</B><BR>

<P>Given the role of education in promoting social change, what should be its priorities and purposes in relation to combating the commercial sexual exploitation of children? They can be seen from two interlinked perspectives 1) developing the main objectives for designing and implementing educational programmes; and 2) identifying the major categories of learners who must be reached.<BR>

<P>To<B> </B>prevent or at least reduce the risk of children falling prey to commercial sex by ensuring their access to and participation in education;<BR>
To promote and respect the rights of children though relevant content and methods in educational programmes;<BR>
To enable children through specially designed educational measures and the process of recovery to become reintegrated into their families and communities when appropriate.<BR>
To enhance the skills, understanding and knowledge of relevant and responsible adults regarding the circumstances of children involved in commercial sex and of those who are vulnerable; and<BR>
To support awareness-raising, advocacy and social mobilization among the public at large about the scope, nature and impact of commercial sexual exploitation of children and the need for action.<BR>

<P><B> 4.	Categories of  Learners</B><BR>

<P>Children of school age, whether out-of-school, in-school, or currently in the sex trade (and more likely to be out-of-school). The design of programmes should take into account the many relevant differences in needs and behaviours, ages and stages of development; differences between boys and girls; children in rural, urban and varying cultural environments; children who have been coerced and those who have entered the sex industry without physical coercion;<BR>

<P>Specific groups of adults and institutions whose role is the nurturing and protection and education of children. This includes families and service providers (teachers, health professionals, law enforcement officials, legislators, NGOs, etc.)<BR>

<P>The public at large--citizens, policy makers and opinion leaders, with a focus on the tourist and travel industry, and  including those who influence the public such as the media, religious, community, and mass organizations such as trade unions and organizations of youth and women.<BR>

<P>The challenge in defining categories of learners is to remain focused on those who most need and can most benefit from educational programmes, without losing sight of the interlinking of populations and objectives in developing coherent, comprehensive and holistic strategies. For example, the reintgration of children into families and communities may necessitate the education of many groups--children, families, teachers, health professionals, religious and community leaders, policy makers and whole communities.<BR>

<P><B> IV.	EDUCATION STRATEGIES AND MEASURES</B><BR>

<P>Commercial sexual exploitation of children affects primarily adolescents, a population that usually falls between the cracks of public policies. It is intimately related to the most sensitive and taboo subjects of sexuality, domestic violence, and adolescent pregnancy, which have, until recently, remained private, or family matters and not the business of governments, the international community, or educational programmes.<BR>

<P>In its detrimental impact on a child s development, commercial sexual exploitation also has much in common with other especially difficult circumstances and forms of exploitation, such as child labour, organized violence, incest and sexual abuse within the home. All children exposed to such circumstances require special measures which protect them from the damaging consequences, remedy the harm inflicted, offer better opportunities, and provide children and families with the skills to take advantage of those opportunities.<BR>

<P>Developing successful educational strategies to combat the practice requires a process of systematic learning, which includes identifying what is known and where the gaps are, and looking at what has worked, and not worked and why.<BR>

<P><I>Article 29 of the CRC...the education of the child shall be directed to the development of: her/his personality, talents, and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; respect for the childs parents, his or her own culture identity, language and values; and the preparation of the child for responsible life in a free society, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes and friendship among all peoples..</I>.<BR>
The conceptual framework of educational objectives, learner populations, and guiding principles for action provide the foundation for developing strategies and programmes to help combat the sexual exploitation of children. To reach all children --those in danger of or are already subjected to the gross violation of rights, two overall approaches are necessary:<BR>

<P>mainstreaming of measures within general educational programmes for all children;<BR>
specially-targeted programmes for those who are poorly-served or unreachable by mainstream efforts.<BR>

<P>Expansion of educational access and participation for all children including those potentially or actually victims of sexual exploitation and  steps to enhance the quality and relevance of educational content are clearly mainstream measures. Programmes specifically designed for children entrapped in a situation of exploitation are obviously special measures outside the mainstream.<BR>

<P>There is also a need for cross-sectoral collaboration, using many educational methods and measures from awareness raising to training, that will involve families, teachers, providers of social services, and other relevant adults in the educational process. Educational strategies for advocacy and social mobilization are needed to support measures to combat sexual exploitation of children. These different strategies are described below.<BR>

<P><B> 1.	Expanding Access and Participation</B><BR>

<P>Children in school are less likely to be exploited than children not in school, although sometimes school children are involved in the sex trade to earn the cash needed for school fees, books and uniforms and transportation. On the whole, participation in primary and secondary education is a means of reducing the vulnerability of children to exploitation and thus a critical part of prevention.<BR>

<P><B>Article 28 of CRC...States Parties recognise the right of the child to education...shall...a) make primary education compulsory and available free to all; b) encourage the development of different forms of secondary education, including general and vocational education, make them available and accessible to every child...</B><BR>
At least 130 million children today do not have access to primary education. Another 100 million do not complete a full cycle. Education beyond the primary level is not generally a part of the universal basic education plan in developing countries, although a majority of the children involved in commercial sex are of secondary school age. According to a UNESCO estimate, close to 300 million adolescents beyond the primary school stage are out of school.		UNESCO, World Education Report, Paris, 1995 Two-thirds of those are girls and a large majority belong to the poor and disempowered sectors of society including ethnic and cultural minorities -- those most vulnerable to exploitation of all forms.<BR>

<P><B> 1.1.	Closing the Gender Gap</B><BR>

<P>The persistent gender gap in education both in quantitative and qualitative terms, undoubtedly is linked to the fact that girls comprise the majority of children at risk of and involved in commercial sex. Despite the growing worldwide effort to improve  access to education for girls, drop-out rates remain high in many countries and the inequality in attitudes and treatment in the classroom continues. The safety and security of girls and their protection from sexual molestation in school and on their way to school itself is an issue in many countries. The development of a conducive learning environment that ensures retention and completion of girl learners in an educational system, that will enhance their life aspirations, and raise their performance expectations and actual achievement, remains a major problem and a necessary objective.  <BR>

<P>A collaborative effort between teachers and administrators in the educational system and the community at large including parents, governments administrators, and leaders of the civil society is needed to remove the cultural, economic and social barriers both within and outside the classroom to girls full participation in education.  To this end, UNICEF has embarked on a major initiative with governments, other agencies and international NGOs. <BR>

<P>Ensuring participation of adolescents, especially girls, in education remains an unfinished job. Experience has shown that diversified and flexible approaches within an overall unified system are needed to reach the population groups deprived of education. Especially innovative programmes are needed for girls and other disenfranchised groups. One approach which addresses holistically girls of secondary school age and mostly ethnic minorities is the grassroots programme, run by Daughters Education Programme (DEP) in Northern Thailand.<BR>

<P><B>Prevention through educational opportunities for rural girls of secondary-school age</B><BR>
Based on a study which revealed that 60% to 70% of village girls in Chiang Rai Province ended up in prostitution after leaving school, DEP was created to prevent girls from being forced into the sex industry. Working in more than 50 hill tribe and lowland villages of northern Thailand, Daughters Education Programme (DEP) meets weekly with key community leaders such as monks and school teachers to determine the families in danger of succumbing to a sale. Together, the NGO and the family explore  viable alternatives.  Among DEPs  projects, is an educational sponsorship scheme that allows girls to complete at least 3 years of secondary school and to leave the programme with the education and self-esteem necessary to gain employment, cope with adult life and contribute to the community. When necessary, the programme covers the cost of all school fees, uniforms, equipment, activities and transport. <BR>

<P>In addition, DEP organizes study tour programmes to urban slums and red light districts, enabling the girls to see for themselves what has happened to so many who have gone before. DEP also networks with over 59 other NGOs to offer specific help, from agricultural assistance, to loans, skill training or relief of some kind.<BR>
<B> 2.	Enhancing Relevance and Quality of Learning Content and Methods</B><BR>

<P>The Jomtien Declaration on Education for All and Articles 28 and 29 of the CRC have defined universal education in terms of enrolment in educational programmes, the acquisition of basic competencies and learning achievements, and preparation for responsible life in a free society. Particularly important in the context of preventing and combating sexual exploitation of children is the emphasis on life skills and learning about rights in the content and methodology of educational programmes. It is widely recognized that a broad range of life skills -- problem- solving, judgement, negotiation, concentration and persistence, self-confidence, trust in oneself and in others, and identification with ones own culture accompanied by respect for the culture of others -- is critical to furthering a childs development and to fostering her/his well-being. <BR>

<P>However, many educational systems struggling to ensure mere access for all children consider it a luxury to aim for anything beyond a basic curriculum. The <I>basic</I> usually turns out in practice to be the acquisition of a body of factual information based on rote memorization. The information itself is often irrelevant to the life of the child. Yet, it has been demonstrated that development of life skills and learning for realizing ones potential are possible at low cost when these are taken as specific objectives.<BR>

<P>The Convention on the Rights of the Child is generally seen as an advocacy tool for expansion of educational opportunities for children, but its full meaning for the content and methods of education has not received sufficient attention.  Knowing about the rights, understanding the Conventions principles and spirit, and practicing and exercising the rights in the classroom and in the educational system should become an integral feature of the educational process. This includes direct use of the provisions of the Convention such as rights-based standards of discipline, non-discrimination in the classroom, reviewing and enriching the syllabus, and ensuring a voice and genuine participation of children in their own learning.<BR>

<P><B>Childrens participation in the classroom</B><BR>
A rural non-formal basic education programme in Senegal offers a comprehensive curriculum in local languages, integrating literacy and numeracy with functional knowledge and skills. Sponsored by a partnership among government, UNICEF, CIDA, and TOSTAN, a local NGO, the project is rooted in the premise that holistic development, consciousness raising, participatory and active learning, learning of local languages and respect for indigenous culture are essential for full participation in society.<BR>

<P> In UNICEFs Education for Development programme designed for industrialized and developing countries, children learn skills that empower and prepare them to be proactive agents of change in their current and future society, as children and adults. Through a problem solving and participatory process, children learn to understand global concepts in relation to their own lives. They  learn about the power of perception and image making in the guise of objective truth by analysing media messages; they practice conflict resolution and social justice and examine their own values and attitudes; through simulations and interactive games, they experience the injustice that results from unequal distribution of resources.<BR>

<P>In the Escuela Nueva rural schools in Colombia the active role of students in peer teaching, organizing learning activities, planning and managing various aspects of the school affairs jointly with the principal and teachers is an essential feature of the successful model for improving students achievement.  <BR>
Of the 43 countries which have submitted national reports on implementation of the CRC to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, 13 have built the Convention into the educational curricula or school courses. El Salvador, Portugal, and Sri Lanka, for instance, have included materials on the rights of the child in their primary and secondary education programmes. In 1991, Denmark launched a campaign to convey the principles of the Convention to the public and materials on child rights were distributed to students from the first to the tenth grades. Chile set up in 1994 an institution called the Defender of School Children to deal with childrens complaints against school authorities.		<I>Progress of Nations</I>, 1996, The Convention: Actions So Far, p.40.  Student participation in management of classrooms, student activities, disciplinary system, and overall management of the institution is practiced in educational programmes guided by a progressive and democratic vision of education. <BR>

<P><B> 3.	Reaching Outside the Schoolroom into the Community  </B><BR>

<P><B><I>Quality of learning</I></B><BR>

<P><B><I>Every person - child youth and adult - shall be able to benefit from educational opportunities designed to meet (his or her) basic learning needs. These needs comprise both essential learning tools (such as literacy, numeracy and problem solving) and the basic learning content (such as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes) required by human beings to be able to survive, to develop their intellectual capacities, to live and work in dignity, to improve the quality of their lives, to make informed decisions, and to continue learning. The scope of basic learning needs and how they should be met varies with individual countries and culture, and inevitably changes with the passage of time</I></B><B>.</B><BR>
<B>Article 1, World Declaration on Education for All</B><BR>
While improving access to and quality of education can be a preventive leverage, there is also a great need for schools to address commercial sexual exploitation more directly as it affects the lives of children. The strong resistance of families, teachers and administrators in some places combined with the fact that the majority of children endangered by commercial sexual exploitation are beyond primary school age, makes school outreach-when possible  - even more urgent. Reaching into communities, schools can become effective as a safe and supportive environment in which children and families can explore the sensitive and often taboo subjects of sexuality, HIV/AIDS, unwanted teenage pregnancies, drugs, as well as the development of self and mutual respect and parenting skills for both boys and girls. The urgent need for sexuality and reproductive health education has been expressed by many NGOs and other activists in developing countries; they are also frustrated by the strong resistance to its incorporation in some curricula or extra-curricula school programmes. In South Africa, where sexuality education is required by law, it is often blocked by headmasters, teachers, administrator and families.		Participants discussion at the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Consultation in preparation for the World Congress, Pretoria, S.A., 17-19 April, 1996.	<BR>

<P>Collaborative initiatives between UNICEF, governments and NGOs have resulted in the development of a range of school-based interventions for youth health and development. These initiatives are an effort to raise awareness about the physical, psychosocial and economic needs of youth, a crucial segment of the population that is often ignored or pushed aside out of fear or a sense of helplessness by adults. In addition to providing specific health information and skills, these programmes attempts to help young people learn about the realities of sex, including the associated pleasures, dangers and responsibilities, and how to handle their emotional needs and responses to competing peer and family<I> </I>pressures.	6	School-based Interventions for Youth Health and Development: Report of the Fourth Technical Support Group Meeting; UNICEF, Health Promotion Unit.<BR>

<P>The HIV/AIDS crisis has motivated a plethora of programmes in many countries that are the kinds of school-based, non-academic educational programmes directly applicable to the issue of commercial sexual exploitation of children and excellent models with which to address this issue. These include school health clubs, health and family life education, life skills education.<BR>

<P><B>An after-school programme that tackles sensitive issues</B><BR>
SHAPE (Swaziland HIV/AIDS Population Education) is a new NGO, jointly funded by WHO and CARE International and supported by the Ministry of Health in response to the alarming spread of HIV/AIDS and the number of teenage pregnancies that could no longer be ignored.  The development of Anti-AIDS Clubs in 26 schools in Manzini-Mbabane corridor  (Swazilands two major cities) has opened the door to a broader discussion of the many  sensitive issues related to sexuality, including the development of life skills - i.e. negotiation and assertiveness for girls, teenage attitudes towards sexuality, understanding the difference between committed or monogamous relationships and promiscuity and weighing the various circumstances and  options from use of condoms to abstinence. Winning the support of teachers to this  innovation was a major challenge and a critical part of the educational process.<BR>
<B> 4.	Targeted Programmes for Children Outside the Reach of School Programmes, Including  those Currently Engaged in Commercial Sex</B><BR>

<P>Children who work and/or live on the street often include those who are being sexually exploited and unlikely to participate in regular school programmes. These children have either dropped out of school or have never been enrolled. Their age and circumstances make it unlikely that they would fit in with other school children or that the school programme would respond to their particular social, cultural, emotional and learning needs.<BR>

<P>Children involved in the sex trade are often in a coercive situation and cannot leave without legal, psychological and social support. Others who may not be under physical coercion, but see no other options in life also need a great deal of help and encouragement to seek out and strive for other alternatives. Those who have left the sex trade on their own or with help from government social services, non-governmental organizations, or friends and relatives, continue to need support, empathy and assistance to be re-integrated into society and find new meaning and purpose in life.<BR>

<P><B>Building self-esteem.</B><I> </I><BR>
Krousar Thmey (New Families) is a Cambodian NGO that runs three child protection centers. They all focus on building self-esteem through respect for culture, developing indigenous dance and dram which the children create and perform at local and national events. Community integration is at the forefront of the NGOs philosophy and practice as some of children are former  prostitutes and are neither isolated nor publicly identified.  Doors are kept open to encourage unselfconscious interaction between children in the center and children in the community. When possible the NGO works with families whose children  have been involved in commercial sex, helping to eliminate stigma and rejection, and to support reintegration.<BR>
Targeted and specially-designed programmes for these children need to be more than educational in the traditional sense. Because of their entrapment in an illicit and vicious situation, these children have fallen out of the support system of family, community and society they are expected and entitled to enjoy. To help them, replacement of the lost social support system has to be reconstructed. Educational programmes, therefore, have to combine the essential elements of conventional basic education such as literacy and numeracy with other forms of social support such as psychological counseling and rebuilding of self-esteem, shelter, health and maternity service, child care and legal advice and protection. Such programmes also need to be complemented or followed by training in occupational skills and advice.<BR>

<P>With increased concern about the vulnerability and exploitation of children, programmes have been started in many parts of the world mostly by NGOs and other voluntary organizations. The common features of these programmes provide valuable guides for strategies to help children victimized by commercial sex. They are:<BR>

<P>multi-purpose and multi-disciplinary in nature combining traditional educational components with relevant support services;<BR>
initiated and managed by non-governmental organizations including religious and community organizations whose flexibility, creativity and sensitive approach can lend a comparative advantage to the voluntary sector;<BR>

<P>small-scale, tailored to the needs of specific groups in particular circumstances, while following certain common approaches and principles;<BR>

<P>focused in the educational content on urgent and practical concerns such as issues of sexuality, teenage pregnancy, drugs, violence, and response to peer, family  and other social pressures;<BR>

<P>dealing with the realities of life; the educational programme has to be cognizant of the harsh realities and painful experiences that the children have lived through; life skills rather than accumulation of facts are especially at premium;<BR>

<P>concerned with income-earning skills and opportunities; poverty and absence of economic opportunities for the children and their families that drove the children into vulnerability and exploitation in the first place have to be addressed by offering them new options;<BR>

<P>concerned with creating a supportive environment for and working with families to change their own situations in ways that benefit children; one of the main conclusions of a 1994 Latin American Seminar was the need to work with the families, especially in others, as well as girls who are or have been engaged in commercial sex.		&quot;Lessons Learned in Assisting Sexually-Exploited Adolescent Women and Girls: A Latin American Regional Seminar; 22-25 February 1994; Child hope Regional Office for South America and the International Catholic Child Bureau - Secretariat for Latin America.<BR>

<P><B>An indirect approach often works best </B><BR>
Sponsored by the international NGO, Child hope, and Rio State University, an adolescent health clinic works  with  out-of-school street youth from Brazilian favelas. Educators have discovered that direct HIV/AIDS prevention is the least  successful aspect of the training.   More effective is the segment that focuses on facilitating self-respect for young women and sensitizing young men to the notion that they have no rights over a female or her body.<BR>

<P><B>Drawing on resilience and proven strengths </B><BR>
Working urban young women on HIV/AIDS prevention of  staff at Casa de Passgem, an NGO based in Recife, Brazil, faced the girls feelings of powerlessness and fatalism regarding their ability to prevent disease by relying on known survival skills and strengths. Showing the girls slides of contaminated water to prove that viruses, though invisible, do exist, the staff persuaded them that if they had the resourcefulness to protect themselves by eluding police, they could protect themselves from a tiny virus.<BR>

<P><B>Learning to revalue their bodies</B><BR>
Casa de Passagem also uses dance and drama to help young women gain positive connection to their bodies.  Despite extensive sexual experience, many exploited adolescent girls lack the basic knowledge about their own bodies and make  little effort to protect themselves. Other programmes encourage girls to draw their own bodies or use mirrors to promote self-reflection and respect.<BR>
<B> </B><BR>

<P><B>5.	Education for Relevant Adults</B><BR>

<P>Adults with a role in the nurturing, protecting and participation in the healthy development of children have a special responsibility. For they are the direct teachers and role models of children, in the home, in the classroom and in the larger world, including the police station and courtroom where so many children in commercial sex wind up. For adults to accept their ongoing responsibility towards the developing child, to become proactive partners and social change agents they need first to understand the harmful impact of commercial sexual exploitation on children and society and to become aware of their own contributing attitudes and behaviours.<BR>

<P><B>5.1	Families</B><BR>

<P><B>Helping families, helping children</B><BR>
In 1992 the Swiss-based NGO, Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Association (AFXB) initiated  a follow-up programme for 95 adolescents rescued from Thai brothels and repatriated to Myanmar. Initially, the programme involved job training assistance and education based on dreams, capacities, health and existing realities. It has now extended to family members of these girls as part of re-integration programme that reaches siblings, cousins, and other relatives and grown to 150 people and a 3-year training programme in which skills training helps to establish or improve small business in local communities<BR>
Educational efforts need to be directed toward helping families understand the link between economic burdens and values, to understand the impact of their behaviour on their children and to assist them in changing their own situations. For this they need access to credit, alternative means of earning income, and the skills and knowledge to use these opportunities to protect and benefit themselves and their children.<BR>
 <BR>
<B>5.2	Teachers </B><BR>

<P><B>Empowering teachers to empower children</B><BR>
In India, a component of the major national UPE initiative, the Teacher Empowerment Project gives teachers decision making powers and creative input in the classroom and encourages them help design and run their training seminars. This strong participation focus builds teachers self-confidence and lifts their status in the eyes of the community. It moves them from the periphery into the very centre of the education process. These schools have become child friendly because teachers are using participative student-centered pedagogy and children are involved in song and dance, creating materials, and helping to decorate and maintain classrooms. Parents, villages and supervisors are now helpers of the teacher and not adversaries who blame them for not doing their job or being unmotivated. <BR>
Teachers are often powerful influences in childrens lives. At the same time, they can mirror unthinking social attitudes and behaviours and even the most dedicated and committed are often powerless in a system that holds them in low regard. For most work under enormous stress, are poorly paid, lack the support, respect or understanding they are expected to give to children. Even in education reform efforts, teacher education has been largely neglected and only small percentages of financial support have been devoted to pre- or in-service teacher education.		This statement and the following insert come from: Stacki, S., Pigozzi, M., Empowering Female Teachers as an Interactive Dialectic Process: Examples from South Asia, Convergence, Vol., XXVIII, No 3, 1995.  World Bank research on successful reform programmes demonstrated that such training was one of the three most critical interventions. <BR>

<P> <B>5.3	Service Providers</B><BR>

<P>Initiatives in public health clinics are sometimes reported to be reluctant to serve street children, although resistance is reportedly often greater among support staff and nurses.		 Lessons Learned...A Latin American Regional Seminar, ibid. In addition, many social workers, NGOs and others who provide services to children in difficult circumstances, find their effectiveness impeded by their own frustrations, judgements and powerlessness in the face of difficult and resistant behaviours and attitudes of street girls, in particular those who are or have been in prostitution. They may engage in attempts to reform young men and women involved in commercial sex, or get them to change their ways without listening, understanding, helping them to develop life and vocational skills that enable them to make their own decisions about whether or not to change their behaviour. As a result, many youth services are underutilized because some providers have judgmental attitudes, especially with regard to reproductive services.	 Sexual and Reproductive Health Promotion, Report of the Final Technical Support Group Meeting, UNICEF, 12-15 June, 1995, Lusaka Zambia.<BR>

<P>Because the appropriate place of these professionals is at the forefront of enlightened, supportive and non-judgmental behaviour and of social mobilization and advocacy, it is particularly important that they become social actors in support of childrens rights beginning with their own behaviour. <BR>

<P>Training workshops that raise awareness of service providers about their own attitudes can lead to the development of user-friendly and accessible educational services with outreach to the hard-to-reach, reluctant populations of the young. Agencies whose programmes include income generation and vocational skills development need themselves to be trained about the relevancy and appropriateness of their training.<BR>

<P><B> 5.4	Law Enforcement Officials</B><BR>

<P>Of special concern is the direct and indirect complicity of police and other officials of the legal system with a special responsibility for creating and enforcing laws that protect children and respect their rights.  Police and courtroom personnel from judges to prosecutors need to learn that treating children as offenders and/or adults is not only contrary to the CRC and many national laws, but counterproductive.  <BR>

<P>They need the skills and tools of specially-trained personnel to create a supportive, child-friendly environment in police stations, courtrooms or at borders where trafficked children may find themselves isolated and in danger. Police could (and should) play a pivotal educational and supportive role in prevention, protection and rehabilitation. As role models, they can also help children learn their rights  and find ways to leave prostitution. In some countries, for example, Peru, NGOs and others are developing programmes for police training in child rights; in Nepal, police units are working in tandem with the NGO Maiti, UNESCO and UNICEF in a multi-dimensional programme which offers education and support to deter families from selling their children to traffickers.<BR>
<B> </B><BR>
<B>6.	Education of the Public and Social Mobilization</B><BR>

<P>A measure of accountability lies with all sectors of society for the existence and continuation of commercial sexual exploitation of children. In addition to those mentioned in the previous section, this includes religious and community leaders who may view adolescents as immoral or uncontrollable, travel and tourist personnel who do not think about the ramifications of having sex with children,  policy makers and legislators who believe that making pronouncements and passing laws are the limit of their responsibility; the public who sees the problem as somebody elses. <BR>

<P><B>Using the power of media to persuade policy makers</B><BR>
The work of the Ghana Family Planning Association (FPA) in its Campaign against AIDS was seriously hampered by a government ban on promotion or even discussion in the mass media about condoms.  The NGO initiated a campaign to persuade the government to change its policy, using the arguments that HIV/AIDS was a major threat to the country, that there was no cure or vaccine and that health promotion was the only way to slow its spread.<I> The FPA wanted to show that advertising in the mass media led to increased condom sales and its ban led people to believe that condoms were unsafe.</I><BR>

<P>The FPA produced a video which included an interview with a young Ghanaian woman with AIDS. A high-level government supporter of the Campaign arranged for the video to be shown at a cabinet meeting and to the Head of State. Shortly thereafter, the government issued a statement supporting the campaign, making special funds available, and asking everyone to get involved.<BR>
Education of the public, primarily through the media has been used successfully in many areas of social action, worldwide -- in family planning, anti-smoking campaigns, use of condoms, hotlines for battered women, breast-feeding campaigns. It can also be used to prevent and help the process of recovery and reintegration for children endangered by commercial sexual exploitation.  Education as social mobilization involves wide use of and partnership with a wide range of the communication media to learn about the magnititude and impact of the problem and to propagate messages -- as television entertainment dramatizing the plight and rescue of a young girl sold into the sex industry; as radio or print messages warning of trafficking techniques in rural villages; as articles in travel or airline  magazines; as informational brochures or pamphlets in hotel lobbies and rooms warning of the illegality of sex with a child.<BR>

<P>Education for social mobilization begins with an assessment -- who do we want to reach? How do we want to reach them? What is the appropriate and desired message? And what is the best medium for the audience? It must take into account the relationship between the communication capacity and the responsiveness of the social environment.<BR>
<B> Education for Social Mobilization</B><BR>
<B>Who Should Be Reached?</B><BR>
Policy-makers, legislators, parliamentarians, tourists, business travelers, tourist agencies, airline and hotel personnel, police, religious and community leaders, teachers, professionals, service providers, and children.<BR>
<B>What Social Attitudes must Change?</B><BR>
that children, especially girls, are property and economic commodities; <BR>
that children are to blame for their own circumstances;<BR>
that sex with a very young girl cures or prevents AIDS, rejuvenates old men, brings riches, etc.;<BR>
indifference, ignorance and/or denial of the problem and its consequences;<BR>
shame about or fear of adolescent sexuality;<BR>
frustration or disgust at a childs unresponsive disobedient out of control behaviour<BR>
<B>What Behaviours and Actions Are Desired?</B><BR>
creation of a  supportive social environment and services such as hotlines, rescue or counseling center;<BR>
creation of a demand for improved access to and quality of education;<BR>
creation of family and community groups to act as watchdogs against traffickers;<BR>
creation of family or community support for children in the sex industry to return to their homes;<BR>
support for parents at risk of selling their children;<BR>
consistency between public words and private deeds;<BR>
pressure policy-makers and legislators to make a serious commitment to implementing the CRC.<BR>
<B>What Attitudes Are Desired?</B><BR>
sex with a child is unacceptable;<BR>
children are not for sale;<BR>
all children are human beings whose rights deserve to be respected;<BR>
girls have the same value as boys;<BR>
sexual exploitation causes serious, often permanent, physical and psychological damage;<BR>
a child who has been in the sex industry should not be stigmatised, but deserves love, support and respect.<BR>

<P><B>V.	FROM STRATEGIES TO ACTION: THE NEXT STEPS</B><BR>

<P><B> 1.	Action at the Country Level</B><BR>

<P>The strategies described in this paper need to be adapted into a coherent package in a country setting. The specific mix of priorities, objectives and activities will vary depending on the particular dimensions of the national problem. Assessment of the needs and magnitude of the problem has to be based on a diagnostic analysis of the situation, preferably as a collaborative effort		A recent paper by UNICEF on policies and strategies related to the protection of children has endorsed the two-prong mutually-supportive approaches of mainstreaming and targeted activities. This strategy calls for partnerships to extend relevant and quality education to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children, as well as combining education with  other essential social services. among all principal actors in the country on issues of childrens well-being. Other critical measures include the following:<BR>

<P> <B>1.1.	Building Partnerships</B><BR>

<P>Neither the NGOs which are often the activists in respect to commercial sexual exploitation of children, nor the government alone can solve the problems. A partnership must be developed to tackle the range of preventive and remedial efforts among government authorities at different levels, national and international NGOs, research and training institutions, community groups, communications media, business and external donors.<BR>

<P><B>1.2.	Creating a Network of Non-Governmental Organizations</B><BR>

<P>Frontline work with children in the sex trade or those at risk is being carried out by NGOs and community-based organizations, many of which are very small. Such organizations are often created by caring individuals who receive initial support from charitable, religious or welfare bodies. Combined efforts will have a larger impact and greater sustainability than any individual effort; coalitions need to be supported and recognised as a permanent and important feature of a national programme for combating the problem. To achieve these ends, it is necessary for the NGOs to work together to pool skills, enhance capacities, and, in particular, to interact with government and municipal authorities.<BR>

<P><B> 1.3.	Giving Children a Voice</B><BR>

<P>Apart from the general right of children to participate in decisions that affect them, programmes are more likely to succeed, when children and youth are allowed to articulate their own views and concerns regarding their difficult circumstances.  This may mean encouraging cultural activities such as theatre, singing festivals, and exhibitions by youth groups and institutions.  Opportunities for advocating their own cause by children and youth have to be built into all programmes and in such initiatives as Mayors as Defenders of Children.<BR>

<P><B> 1.4.	Research</B><BR>

<P>Research, and the development of research tools should be an essential part of action aimed at  protecting exploited and vulnerable children. Not enough is known about the extent and nature of the problem in different social, cultural, economic and political settings. Childrens downward progression from circumstances that place them at risk into involvement in an exploitative situation  is not often understood.  Research institutes, statistical bureau and NGOs are important partners in action-oriented and participatory research, which can fill the gap in knowledge  -- essential for designing effective programmes and evaluating them.<BR>

<P><B> 2.	Global Advocacy  </B><BR>

<P>It is undeniable that in the context of chauvinistic defensiveness and denial on the sensitive subject of children in commercial sex, international expos&eacute;, debate and advocacy have helped to influence public policy and change attitudes. These international and regional efforts have to continue, especially in re-orienting mainstream educational systems and developing creative programmes with a targeted approach. However, all advocacy must be conducted in such a way that children are not harmed by sensationalism or insensitive exposure. Thoughtless messages that imply connections between abusive and exploitative circumstances and particular ethnic or cultural groups may reinforce negative stereotypes about members of those minority groups, adding to their stigmatization and exclusion.<BR>

<P><B>2.1.	Promoting National and Local Capacity-Building and Empowerment</B><BR>

<P>External organizations cannot by themselves make a significant difference for exploited or vulnerable children in a country; nor it is their role to solve national problems. The appropriate and important contribution of external organizations including external donors, inter-governmental bodies and external NGOs is to support catalytic and strategic actions to promote and strengthen national policies, priorities and programmes through collaboration with appropriate national partners and counterparts. The main thrust of collaboration would be to enhance the skills and capacities of the indigenous organizations so that the policies and programmes in a country become increasingly self-reliant and sustainable.<BR>

<P><B>2.2.	A Coordinated Approach at the National Level</B><BR>

<P>It is especially important that external organizations follow a coordinated approach in developing and carrying out their assistance activities. It is neither expected nor desirable, that all international cooperation fit into the  straitjacket of a particular national policy or plan, especially when workable solutions are yet to be found. Diversity and creativity are strengths in tackling such intractable and complex issues as the sexual exploitation of children. At the same time, international assistance needs to recognize the primacy of indigenous responsibility and aim at developing national capacities to prevent the dissipation of scarce national resources in too-divergent or conflicting programmes. External organizations need to engage in dialogue with national authorities, recognizing, understanding and supporting their priorities and objectives both in mainstream and targeted educational efforts for children at special risk.<BR>
 <BR>
<B>VI.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>If the worldwide alert sounded by the Congress is to be heeded, the educational strategies and measures outlined above have to be transformed into action. The value of independent efforts by governments, local and international NGOs, UN and multi-lateral agencies, donors and the media  cannot be underestimated; they have raised consciousness, aroused the conscience and begun to chart the direction for concerted action. But so far, together, they have only nibbled at different parts of the problem. If the commercial sexual exploitation of children is ever to be eliminated, or even reduced, education must be a true force for change. To do this, it must reach across school and community and include children and adults;  it must be based firmly on the CRC, which obliges States Parties and civil society to respect and safeguard  the rights of all children.  And it must embrace the fundamental principles of self worth, participation, respect for others and self sufficiency. <BR>

<P>But education does not work in isolation.  Only a global commitment of partnership, purpose, and a sense of urgency by all sectors and all levels of society will make a dent in this forbidding obstacle to childrens dignity and development.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<P><B>1.	INTRODUCTION</B><BR>

<P>To understand the health and psychosocial implications of the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) requires an appreciation of the varying patterns of causality, circumstance and consequences in different countries and cultures.  There are no single nor simple models or frameworks that fully explain or describe the varying patterns or consequences of CSEC.  The behavioural patterns of causality in one setting, such as substance abuse, in another setting may be an instrument of entrapment and/or control - as in trafficking, and in another setting it may be perceived by the child victim as a means of escape and relief from suffering.  In the developing world macro social and economic factor, such as poverty and social marginalization appear to be important background factors, while the more individual characteristics of the child and family affect resiliency or vulnerability.  While poverty may be a contributing factor in the CSEC in some circumstances in the more industrialized countries, individual characteristics, the functional capacity of the family, and its experience maybe a more significant contributor to the occurrence of CSEC.  Poverty of relationships, values and behaviours within families and communities may interfere with the childs ability to establish positive family and other social attachments that are among the essential elements of resiliency.<B>1.	Grotberg E, A guide to promoting resilience in children: strengthening the human spirit, Early Childhood Development: Practice and Reflections. Number 8 Bernard van Leer Foundation, The Hague, 1995.</B>    <BR>

<P>The examination of the scope and nature of the health aspects of the commercial sexual exploitation of children has been placed in the context of the WHO definition of health, as well as two interlinked principles included in the Organizations Constitution, namely that: <BR>

<P>health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease... <BR>
		healthy development of the child is of basic importance; the ability to live harmoniously in a changing total environment is essential to such development... (and) <BR>
		governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures...&quot;.           Preamble of the Constitution of the World Health Organization.<BR>

<P>	These principles reflect <I>inter-alia </I>the somatic, psychosocial and psychosexual maturation needs of children and adolescents.  The health aspects of the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) needs to be examined in terms of: <BR>

<P>	<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>the impediments to the normal phases of reproductive maturation, including the closely related aspects of  psychological, social and cognitive development of the child and adolescent;<BR>
		the resultant patterns of biomedical, psychological and social pathology and dysfunctioning; and, <BR>
		the health and other social costs of the underlying and direct causes of CSEC to the individual and the community.  <BR>

<P>Few doubt, although direct scientific data are very limited, that the sexual exploitation of children results in serious, often life-long, even life threatening, consequences for the physical, psychological and social health and development of the child.  These children become social outcasts.  Their future fertility and psychological capacity to establish healthy relationships and their own families is seriously compromised.  At a community level the commercial sexual exploitation of children represents an erosion of human values and rights that threatens the health of society.<BR>

<P>Despite the paucity of direct evidence, the indirect evidence of the health consequences of the CSEC is compelling.  The evidence draws upon the increasing understanding of such emerging public health issues as sexual abuse in children; the phenomenon of street children; substance abuse by children and within families; and, domestic and extra-familial violence. The evidence will be presented in terms of several models and topologies of the health, growth and psychosocial development of children and adolescents, and an examination of the associated patterns of family dysfunction, and the well established understanding of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases.  There are the direct health effects of CSEC and there are the effects of the associated and contributing factors such as child abuse and neglect, sexual abuse and substance abuse.  Inter-generational health and social effects must also be taken into account based on the well documented risk of inter-generational &quot;transmission&quot; of physical and sexual abuse pathologies to the children of its victims. <BR>

<P>The issue of the health aspects of CSEC must also be seen both in terms of the biological, psychological and social capacity of the individual to engage in sexual activity, variations in the legal age of consent and of marriage in different countries and the definition of a child according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).  <BR>

<P><B>II.  METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	A Developmental Approach In Understanding The Vulnerability Of Children And To Define The Needs For Action </B><BR>

<P>The concept of vulnerability of children has been a <I>sine quo non </I>of policies, programmes and advocacy efforts of community, national and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations and agencies that address the needs of children.  What is not always appreciated is that vulnerability is a function of the biophysiological, cognitive, behavioural and social changes that are the defining features of the growth and maturation of infancy, childhood and adolescence. Developmental health encompasses all these dimensions, and is attained when the child is provided with an enabling environment for its development, i.e., sufficient nourishment, care and protection, including age appropriate psychosocial and cognitive stimulation.  The interaction of these elements with the genetically preprogrammed endowment of the child will result in the healthy transition from one stage or phase of development to the next stage.   While the potential for a childs development may be disadvantaged even before birth the human organism has built into it a high level of redundancy and resilience - if supported - to compensate for such difficulties.<BR>

<P>Thus, four principles are essential in the understanding of human development.  These are:<BR>

<P>		development is a stepwise process;<BR>
		the elements of the maturational process develop in parallel and interactively;<BR>
		experiences in each stage affect how the individual will pass through succeeding stages; and,<BR>
		development is multifaceted, with the physiological, affective and cognitive elements determining and explaining observable behaviour.<BR>

<P>A combination of models or frameworks are useful in understanding the impact of CSEC on the health and development of children.  These include the framework of the biophysiological development of the reproductive system and organs, as well as several developmental health models which can be broadly used in examining the health consequences of CSEC.  Among the latter would be adaptations of Erikson's human development model<B>2.	Erikson EH.  </B><B><I>The Life Cycle Completed. </I></B><B>W.W.Norton &amp; Co., New York, 1982.)</B> and the moral developmental model of Kohlberg.<B>3.Kohlberg L and Lickona T, (1986) The Stages of Ethical Development: From Childhood through Old Age. Harper, San Francisco.</B>  (Table 1)  A behavioural model, the Modified Social Stress Model, which has been developed by the WHO Programme of Substance Abuse(PSA)<B>4.WHO, Programme on Substance Abuse: A one-way street? Report on phase I of the street children project, WHO/PSA/93.7, World Health Organization, 1993, Geneva.</B> based on the work of Rhodes and Jason<B>5.Rhodes J, Jason L, (1988) </B><B><I>Preventing Substance Abuse Among Children and Adolescents. </I></B><B>New York, Pergamon Press.</B> as applied to drug use among children and adolescents, may also be useful in understanding the factors increasing vulnerability to and those strengthening resiliency against the CSEC.  Most of these developmental models include three developmental stages, often with substages.  In general they accommodate the developmental stages of infancy and pre-school (or play age), school age and adolescents. <BR>

<P><B>1.1.</B>  <B>Pre-school or Play Age</B><BR>

<P>The toddler and pre-school years are the key period for the child's development of self-awareness and a satisfying sense of self.  (A summary of some of the characteristics of child development from infancy to school age are shown in Table 2.)   While children of this age have little understanding of the workings of the human body, this period does serve as a period when gender identity and behaviour begin to be established.  The childs external physical appearance prompts parents and other significant adults to respond to the child with rearing behaviour that reinforces and shapes the child's sex-role behaviour and gender identity.  The child identifies with and follows the model of behaviour of the parent of the same sex.  Learning at this stage includes what to expect and how to respond to members of the opposite sex. By five years of age, the child has established his/her gender identity.  The toddler/pre-school age is also the stage of early moral development.  Children at this stage tend to judge themselves or others as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; on the basis of the effects of a given action without taking into account the intent of the persons involved.  It becomes very apparent that these stages of development may be adversely affected in circumstances of sexual abuse and through the practices of paedophilia.<BR>

<P> <B>1.2</B>  <B>School Age</B><BR>

<P>The development of the school age child is characterized by a slower rate of growth, greater coordination and motor development and a qualitative shift in cognitive development - particularly among those attending school.  It is a period of considerable growth in thinking, imagination, and language - essential ingredients in understanding and relating to a wider world.  Moral judgement and behaviour develop with increased social and cognitive sophistication, with a tendency to accept and follow a system of rules that regulate personal behaviour. There is a greater sense of cooperation among peers and within the family, and the locus of control, i.e., the perceived source of reinforcement for behaviour, is established.  The child with an internal locus of control believes that events are caused by self, while the child with an external locus of control believes that events are caused by others or fate.  Children at this age are particularly vulnerable to exploiters who appear to be sympathetic authority figures. <BR>

<P><B>1.3</B>  <B>Adolescence</B><BR>

<P>The biological changes of adolescence are somatic and hormonal, with marked individual variation in the timing and tempo of changes.  During the period of adolescence the child experiences a growth spurt that affects both height and weight, which is closely linked to sexual maturation.  Endocrinological changes govern the physiological changes which take place over a period of 1.5 to 6 years - with an average of 4 years.  The physiological capacity of conception precedes the capacity to bear and care for an infant.  There is a great deal of variation in the age of onset of puberty between children, and populations, the latter largely a function of differences in the nutritional status of children in different communities. The onset of menses is occurring at an earlier age.  From 1860 to 1960 the age of menarche declined from 16.5 years to 12.2 in industrialized countries, largely as the nutritional status of girls has improved.  <BR>

<P>The completion of bone growth - both height and pelvic size and shape does not approximate adult status until two years after the onset of menses.  The adolescent girl is thus capable of conception, but unlikely to deliver safely.  In northern Nigeria pregnant adolescents under the age of 17 have a one in twenty chance of dying during pregnancy or childbirth.  Those who survive have a high risk of serious, life long complications.<B>6.

British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. 92 Supplement No. 5  </B><BR>

<P>The hormonal changes during adolescence confirm the gender identity and prepare the person for reproduction and parenthood.  While the biological fact of puberty is unchanged from society to society, albeit its timing influenced by the health and nutritional status of the individual, the tasks and experiences of adolescents are particularly a function of the cultural structuring of adolescence as a period for the preparation for adulthood. While there has been a marked decline in the age of menarche there is little evidence that this is accompanied by a comparable marked shift in the cognitive, psychological and emotional capacity of children.  The lack of synchrony in physical and emotional maturity will often put increased pressures on the adolescent who physically matures at a relatively younger age than his or her peers.  Later maturation is generally associated with better affective adjustment.   It must also be recognized that the adolescence follows childhood, retaining many child like characteristics, and only gradually achieving social and emotional maturity.  The individual experiences physical changes and maturation, brain growth and cognitive development, and self perceptions. <BR>

<P>There are both physical and mental health consequences that are associated with the physiological changes in hormonal and histological changes associated with the rapid physiologic changes of reproductive maturation and appearance of secondary sexual characteristics.   During childhood and the transition to adulthood, the reproductive system of girls is particularly vulnerable to infection.  The cells and secretions of the physiologically immature reproductive tract are much less able than in adults to resist invasion and damage by sexually transmitted microorganisms.<B>7.	Moscicki A-B, Winkler B,  Irwin CE,Jr, Schacter j, Differences in biologic maturation, sexual behaviour, and sexually transmitted disease between adolescents with and without cervical intra epithelial neoplasia, Journal of Pediatrics, 115(3)487-493, 1989.</B>  The cervical epithelium goes through a process of transformation.  The physiologic immaturity is characterized by particular cellular characteristics of columnar and metaplastic cells.  These cells provide a poor barrier to invasion by a number of microorganisms, including those associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and its consequences of infertility and ectopic pregnancy and those associated with cervical cancer, namely<I> C. Trachomatis </I>and human papilloma virus (HPV), two of the most common sexually transmitted diseases globally.  The risks of these infections is associated with the proportion of the surface the ectocervix covered by these cells, the younger the age of sexual debut and the multiplicity of sexual partners.  Under these circumstances, a latter onset of menarche but an earlier onset of sexual activity greatly increases the immediate and long term consequences of the STDs in these young women.  Because the presence of other STDs will also increase the likelihood of HIV infecting an individual, adolescent girls who have a later onset of menarche, but early onset of sexual activity will be at even greater increased risk of AIDS as well.  Repeated <I> C. Trachomatis</I> which causes erosion of the normal cervical barriers, further increases the hazards of HPV infection and its subsequent risks of cervical carcinoma.7<BR>

<P>Throughout adolescence self-esteem appears to be affected by their competence in certain valued domains - physical attractiveness, peer acceptance, and perceived support from peers, family or others.  Identity is critical during adolescence.  It reflects the formation of a stable, coherent picture of oneself that includes an integration of one's past and present experiences and a sense of where one is headed in the future.  The process according to Erikson involves a series of selective narrowing of choices in the realms sexual, occupational and social roles and a progressive commitment to the choices one makes.     <BR>

<P>For the adolescent these developmental phases can be spoken of in terms of the need to attain or resolve a number of developmental tasks, <I>inter-alia:</I><BR>

<P>	&quot;--	adaptation to the physiological and anatomical changes associated with puberty and the integration  of a mature sexuality into a personal model of behaviour;<BR>
	 --	the progressive resolution of earlier forms of attachment to parents and family, and the development through peer relationships of an enhanced capacity for interpersonal intimacy; <BR>
	 --	the establishment of an individual identity incorporating a sexual identity and adaptive social roles; ...&quot;<B>8.	WHO, Young peoples health - a challenge for society, Report of a WHO Study Group on Young People and Health for All by the Year 2000&quot;, Technical Report Series 731, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1986.</B><BR>

<P>In meeting the health and development needs of adolescents it is important to recognize the interrelationship between the physiologic and psychosocial changes.  Mood changes in adolescents are correlated with the hormonal changes that they are experiencing.  <BR>

<P><B>1.4	Developmental vulnerability and children as victims </B><BR>

<P>Many individual and groups of children face major obstacles or destructive psychological or social circumstances that impede the attainment of the necessary developmental task or distort the development process essential to become a healthy, fully functioning adult.  As in the case of the CSEC, the problems of children in other difficult circumstances are only seen in their social and economic context and not the context of their needs and vulnerability in attaining developmental health.  Such children should be seen as being potential victims because of their vulnerability at a particular stage of psychosocial and/or cognitive development <U>and</U> their psychological, social, cultural and economic environment.  Only recently are health professionals beginning to examine risk taking behaviours as a public health issue which, in the past, have been crises focused rather than developmentally oriented.  For example, criminal and juvenile justice systems, as well as political authorities, see juvenile delinquency in terms of social and economic deprivation or the consequences of dysfunctional families.  Yet Widom, Finkelhor and others suggest that a prime cause of delinquency may be the developmental stage of childhood victimization.<B>9.

<P>Athey and Ahearn<B>11.	Athey JL, Ahearn FL,Jr, The mental health of refugee children: An overview. , p 3-19 in Ahearn FL Jr, Athey JL, editors </B><B><I>Refugee Children: Theory, Research and Services</I></B><B>, (1991) Johns Hopkins Univ Press, Baltimore, MD.</B> in discussing refugee children make an observation that is equally applicabe to CSEC. Children may be exposed to sociocultural risk in which the environment of the child is lacking in the basic social and psychological necessities for life.  Thus, risks can be related either to direct threats or insults to the child or to improvishment, the absence of opportunities for development<B>12.Garbarino, J., </B><B><I>Children and Families in the Social Environment. </I></B><B>(1982</B><B><I>) </I></B><B>New York, Aldine.</B>   However, developmental risk is a statistical, epidemiological concept referring to increased risk of psychiatric morbidity, dysfunctional behaviour patterns (such as suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, or delinquency), or incompetence in love, work or play.  But risk is not destiny, and children can and do overcome adversity.11<BR>

<P>Sexual abuse of children and the CSEC serve to illustrate the developmental aspects of risk which vary with age.  The stage of sexual maturation is a determining factor in the nature of the targeting of child victims by the perpetrators.   On the one hand pedophiles seek less mature children as their victims, whereas sexual violence is more likely in the physically mature, but not necessarily psychologically or socially mature child.  Aside from intra familial sexual abuse, sexual violence to boys, as in instance involving girls, may be circumstantial, such as when children are institutionalized for care by child welfare or juvenile justice services in the absence of sufficient supervisory and monitoring systems.    <BR>

<P>The capacity for self-protection is also affected by the stage of development and maturation.  The more extreme example of the developmental impact on victimization is seen among those individuals who have physical or intellectual limitations.  They are unable to protect themselves and are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse, and in some instances commercial sexual exploitation.  Another group that would seem to be particularly vulnerable to both sexual abuse and exploitation would be girls who become physically mature at a young age but are socially and psychologically immature.<BR>

<P>As Finkelhor points out, the developmental stages of a child interact with the characteristics of the environment they inhabit, affecting the risk of victimization.  Children have limited autonomy over their own environments, and as they acquire greater control, &quot;their risk of victimization appears to be less a matter of compulsory circumstances than of personal choices&quot;.  He further notes that a &quot;variety of developmental processes seem to affect these choices, including the formation of personal identities, acquisition of self/esteem, evolution of a personal style in interpersonal relationships, history of academic performance, and prior experience of violence and abuse&quot;   <BR>

<P>Based on this formulation, one can identify circumstances in which children are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation.  For example, children whose developmental progress has been incomplete, yet sufficient for the child to continue striving for the accomplishment of developmental tasks, such as at the stages of pre-school and school age when there is a desire to please and a respect for authority.  These children may be particularly vulnerable to pedophiles who initially appear to be supporting and caring.  A second group that have been known to be seriously exploited sexually, and perhaps are among the most vulnerable, are children who are placed in residential or foster care because of domestic violence and/or abuse, or the parent(s) was unable to cope with or provide adequate care and protection of the child.  The care facilities for such children attract potential pedophiles and organized sexually exploiting groups, particularly as there is often inadequate monitoring and supervision of such services nor is there sufficient screening or standards in selection of staff.   In such settings, as in domestic abuse, and because of the developmental stage, the child is both threatened and made to feel guilty by the perpetrator. That guilt later becomes shame and the child is reluctant to discuss the abuse.  Furthermore, they may perceive that their failure to speak out at the time made them accomplices.<B>13.	Roger Dobson, Our gulag, </B><B><I>Independent on Sunday,</I></B><B> 9 June 1996, p. 17.</B><BR>

<P>In discussing the developmental vulnerability of children special note must be made of children and adolescents exploited through sex rings and pornography. (see section 4.4)<BR>

<P><B>2.	Estimates Of The Extent and Inferring An Understanding Of The Circumstance Of CSEC In The Absence of Epidemiological Studies</B><BR>

<P>Because CSEC represents an illegal or clandestine practice there has been a paucity of information on its health and developmental implications in the scientific literature.  Only recently has there been a critical effort at assessing the methodologies for measuring the magnitude of the problem beyond the reporting that takes place within the criminal and juvenile justice systems.  No reliable methods exist for the direct measurement of the magnitude of child prostitution, let alone the general area of CSEC.  News reports quote wide ranging estimates of the numbers of children affected, rarely with any reference to the methods used to derive these estimates.  Over ten years ago, in a report commissioned by UNICEF, the weight of evidence was derived from either well documented case reports noted in the press, to judicial authorities or by advocacy groups, and population estimates with little in the way of documentation, apart from quotations from authoritative sources.<B>14.	Hermann KJ, An International Strategy for Intervention into the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (Non-published document of a study commissioned by UNICEF), August 1985.</B> <BR>

<P>Any effort to make an estimate of CSEC will have to be based on estimates of some indirect indicators which, at least within a given country and culture, are reasonably replicable and can be monitored over a period of time.  Such an approach would allow for the use of the indicator as a measure for determining the impact of intervention programmes to reduce the magnitude of the problem.  One such approach was described several years ago in Thailand.<B>15.	Guest P, Guesstimating the unestimateable: The number of child prostitutes in Thailand. in Child Prostitution in Thailand: A documentary Analysis and Estimation of the Number of Child Prostitutes, ed. Orathai Ard-am and Chanya Sethaput, Institute for Population and Social Research, Mahidol University</B> It involved applying known characteristics associated with child prostitution to derive an estimate of the population at risk of becoming child prostitutes based on the census data of 1990.  At that time, the risk group was composed of migrant children, living in an urban setting, living apart from their family and not attending school.  With nearly 4 million girls 11 - 17 years of age, only 1.7 percent have all four characteristics of high risk.  Although not all of these girls can be considered as child prostitutes, girls having a lesser combination of characteristics could still be child  prostitute. Another methodology was used by the Children's Rights Protection Center which based its estimates on the total population of commercial sex workers (CSW) and then estimating the proportion of the CSWs who were children.15  These methods provided a wide range of estimates of child prostitution in Thailand. <BR>

<P>As a result of the lack of epidemiological data it is necessary to derive an understanding of the health and psychosocial aspects of CSEC from an analysis by analogy, drawing upon the scientific literature and studies of:<BR>

<P>- intra-familial sexual abuse of children, which is noted to occur in both developed<B>16.Finkelhor D, The international epidemiology of child sexual abuse,</B><B><I> Child Abuse  &amp; Neglect</I></B><B>. 18</B>(5), 409-417, 1994. and developing countries.<B>17.McClelland A, Polume H, Sexual abuse of Children presenting to the Children's outpatient department of Port Moresby General Hospital, Papua New Guinea Medical Journal 33</B>:203-206, 1990.<B>,18.Eldermire D, Sexual abuse of children in Kingston and St Andrew, Jamaica. West Indian Medical Journal 74: 65-67, 1988.</B>  <BR>

<P>- the consequences of early sexual activity of adolescents, including sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, abortion and unwanted births; <BR>

<P>- clinical and epidemiological data on sexually transmitted diseases and their consequences;<BR>

<P>- substance abuse among children and adolescents; and,<BR>

<P>	- street children.<BR>

<P><B>III.	Definitions of the commercial sexual exploitation of children</B><BR>

<P>Commercial sexual exploitation of children is the use of a child for sexual purposes in exchange for cash or in-kind favours between customer, intermediary or agent and others who profit from the trade in children for these purposes.<BR>

<P>The three forms of CSEC that the Congress will address have been defined by the United Nations as follows:<BR>

<P>Child prostitution:<BR>

<P>&quot;Child prostitution is the act of engaging or offering the services of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person&quot;.          Document A/50/456, PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN: Sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, <U>Note by the Secretary-General,</U> 20 September 1995, p.5.<BR>

<P>Trafficking and sale of children across borders and within countries for sexual purposes:<BR>

<P>The 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery defines the sale of children as &quot;the transfer of a child from one party to another for whatever purposes in exchange for financial or other reward compensation.&quot;  Sexual trafficking is the profitable business of transporting children for commercial sexual purposes.  It can be across borders or within countries, across State lines, from city to city, or from rural to urban centre.<BR>

<P>An international conference on traffic in persons noted that &quot;force&quot;, whether actually committed, threatened, or implicit in the abuse of authority or deception, was an important feature, though not a defining characteristic of trafficking.<B>19.</B><B><I>Combatting Traffic in Persons.</I></B><B> Conclusions of the Conference on Traffic in Persons, 15-19 November 1994, Utrecht and Maastricht, Netherlands institute in Human Rights, Utrecht, 1995</B> <BR>

<P>Child Pornography:<BR>

<P>Child pornography is any visual or audio material which uses children in a sexual context. It consists of &quot;the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual conduct, real or simulated, or the lewd exhibition of the genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user, and involves the production, distribution and/or use of such material&quot;.          <I>ibid</I>, page 6. <BR>

<P>The issue of CSEC is compounded by the varying definitions of childhood and adolescence, and their application in different cultural, social, religious and legal contexts in different countries. From the health and human development perspective it is important to distinguish sexual exploitation that occurs before, during or after puberty. <BR>

<P>Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that, &quot;For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&quot;.  Since marriage confers on the individual the age of majority, the articles of the Convention are no longer applicable to such an individual.   <BR>

<P>While Article 5 recognizes the responsibilities of parents and care givers in providing guidance and direction to the child, it acknowledges that such guidance is exercised in the context of the evolving capacities of the child.          	&quot;States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention.&quot;  Such a distinction is particularly relevant in addressing the issues of CSEC because adolescence, for convenience and inclusiveness defined by WHO as being from the age of 10 through 19, represents the developmental stage between childhood and adulthood.  It is characterized as a period of uneven and non-synchronous transition &quot;characterized by biological development from the onset of puberty to full sexual and reproductive maturity; psychological development from the cognitive and emotional patterns of childhood to adulthood; and, the emergence from the childhood state of total socioeconomic dependence to one of relative independence.&quot;8  The discordance of the age at which adolescents attain maturity has implication for their vulnerability to sexual exploitation, particularly with menarche in girls occurring at a younger age, and the age of marriage increasing.  The earlier biological maturation, i.e., more mature appearance, of a young female adolescent may lead people to have social expectations of her that she may be neither capable nor ready to fulfil.  Ennew<B>20.Ennew J, The sexual exploitation of children, Polity Press, Cambridge, 1986.</B> notes that although the age of consent for heterosexual acts in England was set at 16 in 1885 after the pressure of child prostitution scandals, yet the legal age of marriage in England was not changed from 12 years to 16 years until 1929.  In the realm of sexuality, different interpretations of evolving capacity is reflected in the variation in the legal age of consent in those countries that have such legislation.  In both heterosexual and homosexual relationships the age of consent, may fall within the age definition of a child within the Convention.  <BR>

<P>Both from the perspective of child marriage and any form of sexual activities involving children, by combining the biomedical and developmental definitions of sexual competence it is possible to define the circumstances that will result in ill health, impaired or damaged emotional, social and moral development of children resulting from inappropriate sexual activity.  It is this framework that will provide the basis for discussing the health aspects of CSEC.  <BR>

<P><B>IV.	ILLUSTRATIVE SCENARIOS OF THE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN</B><BR>

<P>A general understanding and reasonable mapping of the major pathways and circumstances characterizing CSEC is important in order to:<BR>

<P>		 develop policies and programmes to prevent the CSEC, <BR>
		humanely and effectively care for its victims, and <BR>

<P>		to create a viable, satisfying future for its victims by facilitating their reintegration into the community.  <BR>

<P>For policy and programme development purposes it may not be necessary to obtain a precise epidemiological description of the problem.  Through reasonable estimate procedures, adapting techniques used, for example, to estimate street children, substance abuse and other clandestine behaviours, gross estimates and ranges of the extent of the different patterns of CSEC may be possible.  It is important to have at least some semi-quantitative feeling of the patterns and pathways into CSEC through the use of a mixture of epidemiological, anthropological, behavioural and social science, and modeling methodologies and techniques.  Such a &quot;mapping&quot; and characterization exercise is useful if scarce resources are to be wisely allocated, and policies and programmes are to be  appropriately directed at the overall problem, its antecedents and its health consequences.  <BR>

<P>The interrelationship of the different forms of CSEC was recognized over ten years ago by Hermann11 who noted that children who are involved in the production of pornographic materials are usually involved in prostitution, are frequently moved within and between nations for this victimization, are exploited to meet the pathological needs of pedophiles.  His report, in large part derived from case studies, news accounts or police reports, documented the different forms in which the CSEC is expressed in both developed and developing countries.<BR>

<P>The following scenarios are presented as examples of the different patterns and pathways by which children become victims of commercial sexual exploitation.  The presentation of these scenarios does not imply that one scenario is more significant or tends to characterize CSEC more than another.  Great care should be taken to avoid generalizations that may be too wide for the available limited information.  For example, although childhood sexual abuse may not be an uncommon event among commercial sex workers, it is also not uncommon in population based studies, with 10 and 15 percent of adults in many developed countries having claimed to have been sexually abused as children.<B>21.	Feldman, W., Feldman, E., Goodman, J.T., McGrath, P.J., Plese, R.P., Corsini, L., Bennett, S., Is childhood sexual abuse increasing in prevalence? An analysis of the evidence, </B><B><I>Pediatrics,</I></B><B> 88:</B>29-33, 1991  In one sense the scenarios reflect the variation in the availability of information.  Other scenarios may exist, or existing scenarios may be far more wide spread than is reflected in the scientific literature or the media.  The pathways and expression of the CSEC remain undocumented and unmentioned in numbers of communities.  Too often unseen is translated to absence and no need for action.  Nor should lack of documentation be used as an excuse for excessive zealotry in the application of inadequately validated methods for documenting the problem on a clinical of community basis.  Many of the antecedents of CSEC probably exist in most countries to a greater or lesser extent, although the form and level of CSEC of expression will be highly variable.<BR>

<P><B>1.</B>	<B>Street children, substance abuse and sexual exploitation</B><BR>

<P>The street child has been defined as &quot;any girl or boy ...for whom the street (in the widest sense of the word, including unoccupied dwellings, wasteland, etc) has become his or her abode and/or source of livelihood; and who is inadequately protected, supervised, or directed by responsible adults.&quot;<B>22.	Lusk MW, Street children programs in Latin America. J Social Soc Welfare. 16:</B>55-77, 1989.   The Modified Social Stress Model which was developed by the WHO Programme of Substance Abuse4 and based on the work of Rhodes and Jason5 model of risk for drug use may in part be applicable, and in part adaptable to understanding and identifying priorities for action to eliminate the commercial sexual exploitation of children.    In the PSA model stress (or distress), normalization of drug use and drug effect increase the risk of drug use.  Elements that decrease the risk of drug use are the presence of strong attachments, coping strategies and resources.   In the same way that the model may explain why not all street children become substance abusers, it might also be applicable to explaining why only a portion of street children end up being sexually exploited for commercial purposes.   <BR>

<P>The stress factors cited by Rhodes and Jason5 are unfortunately all too common in the lives of large numbers or children and adolescents.  These include: major life events, such as parental death or abandonment, natural or man-made disasters; everyday problems such as conflicts over finding shelter, clothing and food; enduring life strains as related to poverty, life transitions and the developmental changes of adolescence.    In situations of hopelessness the only perceived models of success may be those of criminality or through commercial sex work.  Among those who can be considered most vulnerable are the adolescent who is suddenly thrust into a world of adult responsibility, by choice or misfortune, and who has not had sufficient time to gradually complete the developmental tasks of adolescence.  Countering the effects of stress are the factors of attachment - if positive - such as with family, school and peer group, and coping strategies and skills.  The role of attachment, for example, is illustrated in the street child literature which describes a phenomenon in which girls from large families enter the world of the street child somewhat later than boys.  This is often attributed to the girl assuming a protective, caring role for the younger children in an abusive or stressed household, until such time as the younger child is in a position to fend for itself. <BR>

<P><B>1.1.	Street Children And Runaways In Developed Countries</B><BR>

<P>The scientific literature from developed countries shows a strong association of street children with intra-familial violence, substance abuse and sexual abuse.  These children are characterized as &quot;runaways, walk aways or throw aways&quot;.  Often the perpetrators of violent and abuse behaviour is a male member of the family, himself a substance abuser.  The maternal figure in the household is often a victim as well, frequently characterized as being weak and ineffective in her caring functions.  The intrafamilial environment is characterized as lacking security and affection.  The child's response is to seek and meet these needs in the &quot;society and family&quot; of street children and to treat his or her own wounds in substance abuse ranging from alcohol, glue or other chemical sniffing and the range of narcotics.  <BR>
 <BR>
While prostitution has not been a particularly common consequence of childhood sexual abuse, among prostitutes studied in some developed countries, childhood sexual abuse was common.<B>23.	Silbert MH, The Effects on Juveniles of Being Used for Pornography and Prostitution, in Zillmann D and Bryant J, (editors) Pornography: Research Advances and Policy Considerations, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ, 1989.</B>  Widom, in a matched cohort of children who had been abused or neglected, found that there was a 27 fold increase in the odds sexually abused child being arrested for prostitution in later life, although the overall rate of such an arrest among the sexually abused children was only 3.3%.<B>24.Widom CS, Victims of Childhood Sexual Abuse - Later Criminal Consequences, National Institute of Justice, Research in Brief, March 1995.</B>  Widom and Seng conclude that sexual and other forms of abuse <I>per se</I> do not lead to prostitution, but that it leads to runaway behaviour which is more directly associated with prostitution. 24, <B>25.Seng MJ, Child sexual abuse and adolescent prostitution: A comparative analysis. Adolescence. 24:665-675, 1989.</B>  In one review of research in the field, between 11 and 23 percent of runaway children became involved in prostitution, which in turn also made them more vulnerable to rape and pornography.  It is also reported that most of the children under 16 years of age recruited for pornography in the U.S. are runaways.<B>27.Pierce RL, Child Pornography: A Hidden Dimension of Child Abuse, Child Abuse and Neglect. 8(4):483-493, 1984.</B><BR>

<P>The relevance of the sexual abuse literature as a source of analysis and understanding of the health and developmental consequences of and approaches to addressing the CSEC has been underlined by the in depth studies by Silbert on the effects on juveniles of being used for prostitution and pornography.<B>28.	Silbert MH, Sexual Assault of Prostitutes, A detailed report of a National Institute of Mental Health Grant #ROI MH 32782-01 in three volumes, National Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape, NIMH, 1982 (publications of specific aspects of this research have been published in the social science and medical literature.).</B>  She studied 200 women street prostitutes from four cities in the United States. Seventy-eight percent of the women started prostitution as juveniles and 61% were sexually abused as children or juveniles.  At least in an North American setting, her observations challenge some of the causal assumptions that have focused on macro social and economic deprevation, but failed to take into account psychosocial, intrafamilial relationships and resiliency (or lack thereof).   The majority of juvenile prostitutes described family structures that had the outward appearance of stability.  For example, over three-fourths described a religious upbringing, with regular church attendence. However within the dynamics of the family the situation was quite different.  Common features included excessive drinking and violence directed by the father at the mother.  Over 60% of the subjects were beaten while growing up, and a similar proportion were sexually abused, usually by father figures - with half the victims blaming themselves for the abuse.  A sense of isolation, and serious attempts of suicide frequently followed such abuse. 	The backgrounds of the male juveniles engaged in prostitution is similar to the females in Silberts studies.<BR>

<P>Silbert notes that while a number of juveniles were recruited for prostitution by pimps and other prostitutes, many reported that they were recruited by middle-aged women, <I>nurturing in style and appearence</I>[emphasis added].  Silber terms these womenhouse-mother, noting that they would take the girls to cafeterian, provide them with a meal and listen sympathetically to their stories.  These women would slowly encourage the girls into prostitution by a continuous process of nurturing, concern and an offer to care for all their needs.<BR>

<P>While the purpose of the Silbert studies was not explicitly focused on pornography, she noted in the analysis that there was a strong relationship between violent pornography and sexual abuse.  She noted that of the 193 cases of rape studied, the women/girls spontaneously commented that the rapist alluded to pornographic material.  Pornographic material was also noted to be widely used by the adults in sex rings to show, teach or induce the children into the sexual activity or pornographic modeling.<B>29.	Burgess AW, Hartman CR, McCausland MP, Powers P, Response patterns in Children and adolescents exploited through sex rings and pornography, American J Psychiatry, 141(5):656-662, 1984.</B> Silbert describes the use of such material being used for sexual arousal before intrafamilial sexual abuse of children.  Nearly 40% of the women prostitutes spontaneously reported that sexually explicit photographs had been taken of them when they were children for commercial purposes.28  <BR>

<B>1.2	Street Children In Developing Countries</B><BR>

<P>In addition to family breakdown, physical and sexual abuse, other factors are important contributors to the phenomenon of street children in the developing world.  These include severe poverty, armed conflict, famine, natural and man-made disasters, migration and urbanization with severe overcrowding and acculturation.  <BR>

<P>A variety of methods have been used for estimating the prevalence of street children.  A National Joint Project on Street Children in the Philippines<B>30.	Banaag CG, Street Children and Substance abuse: The Philippine experience, report prepared for the Meeting of Interested Parties of the WHO Programme on Substance Abuse, World Health Organization, January 1993.</B> estimated the number of street children at between 1 and 3 percent of the children in the 10 major cities in the country.  Poverty, while an underlying factor in the phenomenon of street children in many settings, cannot be considered as a sufficient explanation of the phenomenon. A number of studies support the hypothesis that weak or disorganized family structures is a key factor in the problem.  One report from Honduras among the children served by a health, education and social services programme, <I>Proyecto Alternativos</I>, contrasts the family circumstances and behavioural patterns of two groups of street children, those who are <I>in</I> and those who are <I>of</I> the street - the former being characterized as market children, the latter as street children, and both of which are associated with poverty.<B>31.Wright JD, Kaminsky D, Wittig M, Health and social conditions of street children in Honduras, Amer J Dis Child, 147</B>(3):279283, 1993.  Substance abuse, criminality, sexual activity and prostitution are common events among these children.(Table 3)<BR>

<P>The proportion of street children engaging in overt prostitution may vary markedly from setting to setting.  Sexual activity begins at an early age among street children, many of whom turn to prostitution as a means of survival.  With their needs for affection and a sense of security, these children are easy prey for pimps, purveyors of pornography or traffickers.   The initial pattern of sexual exploitation of street children is more likely to be one of an exchange of sexual services for protection and support within the community of street children. Initiation into sexual activity occurs at a young age - with a mean age around 11 years for girls, but not infrequently as a result of coercion according to a study of street children in Brazil.<B>32.	Raffaelli M, Campos R, et al, Sexual Practices and Attitudes of Street Youth in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Social Science and Medicine 37 (5), 661-670, 1993.</B>   In the same study, not only does the incidence of sexual activity among street children increase with age, but the nature of that activity is also a function of their changing developmental and survival needs.  At a younger age sex with peers was both more common than with adults and described in terms of pleasure, protection or behavioural control by the peer group.  Sexual activity with adults by girls and same-sex partners by boys increased in incidence with age and was in exchange for money, material objects or leisure resources.  <BR>

<P>In the Honduras setting one in five street children engaged in prostitution, whereas in studies among street children in Mwanza, Tanzania, 5 % of the girls were described as earning income through informal sex work, although only one case was engaged in prostitution.  Nine of 122 street children, at a minimum had acquired an STD in the year previous to the study.  However, virtually all the girls in the latter setting were drawn into relationships in which they were exploited sexually. <BR>

<P>Street children of both sexes are at increased risk of HIV infection. In the studies from Brazil risk behaviour included nearly half of the children having sex while using alcohol or drugs, 20 percent of the girls and over 15 percent of the boys engaging in sex for money, high levels of previous STDs and low and inconsistent use of condoms.32  <BR>

<P>AIDS is not only a hazard among street children engaging in prostitution, but increasingly at least in some areas of Africa, an important factor in becoming a street child.  In the Tanzanian studies nearly 30% of the children cited being an orphan or abandoned because of AIDS as one of their reasons for being on the street, often when extended families did not accept them or failed to provided adequate care after the death of a parent.33  <BR>

<P><B>2.</B>	<B>Early Age Of Marriage And Other Traditional Practices In Traditional Society Subject To Rapid Change And Urbanization</B><BR>

<P>In most traditional societies sexual activity of girls is normally initiated within marriage, albeit in many before or soon after the onset of menses - at times as young as 10 or 11 years of age.  In an adolescent clinic population in Ethiopia, premenarche sexual initiation was noted to occur in 40% of the girls.<B>34.	Duncan ME, Tibaux G, et al, Teenage obstetric and gynaecological problems in an African city,  Central African Journal of Medicine, 40(9):234-244, 1994.</B>  The hazards of sexual activity and child bearing before biological and social maturation have been well documented.  In some settings, particularly when the man engages in sexual activity with other women, including prostitutes, outside of the marriage, the girls in such marriages have an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases on two counts: the increased likelihood of acquiring such infections from their husbands; and their vulnerability to the consequences of such infections due to the relative lack of resistance of the immature reproductive tract.  Data from several countries in Africa, for example have shown higher levels of infertility the earlier the age of onset of sexual activity.  Marital discord is also more common with a younger age of marriage, and both circumstances are associated with child prostitution, often as a consequence of the child-wife running away and having no other means than prostitution for supporting herself. <BR>

<P>Studies in Ethiopia34 have shown that 42 % of prostitutes as compared to 9% of those still married to their first husbands had been married before the age of 13.  Furthermore, nearly 70% of the women engaged in prostitution were sexually active before menarche compared half that number among a control group.   Noting that half of all prostitutes were married for less than 5 years, a large number began prostitution as children.<B>35.	Duncan ME, Tibaux G, et al, A socioeconomic, clinical and serological study in an African city of prostitutes and women still married to their first husband, </B><B><I>Soc Sci Med</I></B><B> 39</B>(3), 323-333, 1994.  Despite very high rates of child marriage, particularly in rural areas, the first coitus was at the time of or after marriage.  In a study of the social-cultural background of early child marriage in Ethiopia, Dagne notes four major factors that have historically and continue to sustain the tradition, namely the urgency to utilize the immediate capacity of parents to establish a family for their children; ...to enlarge kinship relations for protection and economic security; ... to conform to the norms of age old compelling tradition; .... patriarchal subordination of women placing high value on virginity.<B>36.Dagne HG, Socio-cultural background of early marriage in Ethiopia, An unpublished document on Research on Traditional Practices for the Inter-African committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, Geneva (undated)</B>  In other countries in primary infertility is a significant reason for divorce and an underlying factor in prostitution.<B>37.Belsey MA, The epidemiology of infertility with particular reference to Africa.  Bulletin World Health Org, 54:  319-34l, 1976.</B><BR>

<P>In some countries aspects of child prostitution have their roots in historical social and religious traditions.  In India adolescent girls may be wedded to the temple goddess and spend their lives as <I>devadasis -</I> &quot;god's servant&quot;.  Priests and other men sleep with the <I>devadasi </I>to appease the goddess's desires.  Young <I>devadasis</I> are highly regarded by some as deities, and then discarded when they grow old.  One estimate suggests that 5,000 to 10,000 girls a year may be condemned to a life of sexual servitude  and subsequently into prostitution.<B>38.	Dr. L.S. Gilada, as quoted in Shelly Ngo with Sanjay Sojwal, Sleeping with the Goddess, World Vision, February-March 1995, pp 3-7.</B>   A similar practice, referred to as the <I>Deuki</I> system, is found in regions of Nepal.  The Nepalese authorities note that a girl becomes a <I>Deuki</I> when she is brought from a poor family to be offered to the gods...she cannot marry and often engages in prostitution for economic support.  Their children, known as <I>Devis,</I> are accepted in the society, but find it difficult to get married because of a traditional belief that some disaster will strike the husbands family.<B>39.Committee on the Rights of the Child, consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 44 of the Convention - NEPAL, CRC/C/3/Add.34, 10 May 1995.</B>  In part based on these traditions and an awareness of other traditions in which poor families sent their daughters to be prostitutes for Kathmandus ruling elite, traffickers have found it easy to lure large numbers girls to brothels in India, even with the collusion of their parents who see the wealth that these daughters bring back.  <BR>

<P>The practice of families placating gods by giving virginal daughters to traditional priests is not limited to Asia.  Among the Ewe people of west Africa, a virgin daughter may be given to the shrine of the war god to atone for an ancestral crime.  These girls, known as fetish slaves or female Trokosi serve life sentences at the shrines of traditional West African war gods.  They are condemned to a lifetime of hard labour, sexual servitude and perpetual childbearing at the service of the village priest...  At some shrines when the woman dies, the family is expected to replace her with another female virgin... Fetish slavery is still common in the rural east (of Ghana, as well as areas of Togo and Benin), affecting an estimated 10,000 women and girls... <B>40.

<P>
<P><B>3</B>.  <B>Poverty And The Exploitation Of Children</B><BR>

<P>In many areas of the world, increasing rural poverty, limited educational opportunities, lack of work and a pattern of bonded labour draw children into the labour market.  The pathways of poverty to child prostitution are many and varied, affected to a large extent to cultural traditions of submission authority and powerlessness .   Kaime-Atterhog et al describe a number of factors contributing to the sexual exploitation of children through prostitution in Thailand.<B>41.	Kaime-Atterhog W, Ard-Am O, Sethaput C, Child Prostitution in Thailand: A documentary assessment, in Ard-Am O, Sethaput C ed. Child Prostitution in Thailand: A Documentary Analysis and Estimation of the Number of Child Prostitutes, pp 37-71, Institute for Population and social Research, Mahidol University, Bangkok.</B>  Selling children into prostitution had had an historical precedent in Thailand during the era of slavery when slaves, mistresses and concubines could be traded as goods and children, and could be used as collateral for loans.  The complexity of relationships and responses by the children themselves is illustrated by the observation that, having entered prostitution against their will, many of the children nonetheless felt that they had fulfilled their obligations for the care and protection given them by their parents in raising them - thus gaining merit according to Buddhist principles.  Despite the risks of disease and physical abuse, girls who had been sold into prostitution returned home with honour because they had brought money, goods and security to their families.   <BR>

<P>At times poverty, the aspirations of parents for their children and the naivete of the parents conspires to push children, particularly girls into highly exploitative and abusive situations with the CSEC being the end result.   Research on the patterns of child labour in Kenya by Onyanga and her colleagues documented a scenario in which girls from rural areas have been sent by their families to relatives or others in urban areas in order to attend school in exchange for some domestic service on the part of the child.  A large number of these girls are grossly exploited and not infrequently subject to physical and sexual abuse.  If they become pregnant they are turned out of the household, often unable to return to their families, and ending up by surviving on the street, through prostitution or both.  <BR>

<P>There are many other ways in which children are drawn into CSEC: deception in offering families job opportunities for their children; bonded labour where children may be physically and sexually exploited and abused; and, even child sponsorship organizations have been used for the CSEC.  In the latter instance, Hermann14 cites confidential reports of the use of well-known charitable organizations by pedophiles to gain access to and to sexually abuse their foster child.  <BR>

<P><B>4.  Sex Rings And Pornography</B>     	For a more detailed discussion of the issues of child pornography see <I>Child Pornography: An International Perspective,</I> Submitted by ECPAT for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, Stockholm, Sweden, 27-31 August 1996.<BR>

<P>While newspaper, magazines and the electronic media provide episodic and anecdotal accounts of sex rings and pornography14 only in the last decade has there been a systematic collection and analysis of the scope and impact of this form of sexual exploitation of children and adolescents.  Burgess and her colleagues29 have characterized this type of adult-child sexual involvement and undertaken a follow-up of victims initially identified by law enforcement agents.  They define sex rings according to the number and use to which they put children in such groups.  A solo ring involves one adult who is sexually involved with a small group of children.  There is neither transfer of children nor are photographs provided to other adults.  On the other end of the spectrum they describe the syndicatedring which involves several adults in a well structured organization which engages in the recruitment of additional children, often younger siblings of those already involved, the production of pornography, the delivery of direct sexual services, and the establishment of an extensive network of customers.  A transitional form exists which may involve more than one adult but without the structure of the syndicated ring.29   <BR>

<P>The adult perpetrators of sex rings prey on the developmental needs and vulnerability of young children who seek to be praised and gain recognition by pleasing others, and tend to  respect authority and obligations.(see Table 1) Entrance into a sex ring introduces children to an elaborate socialization process that not only binds them to the ring but locks them into patterns of learned behavior.  The maintenance of children in the ring is through a distortion of a belief system that convinces the child the activities are normal... The leader uses a peer network that forces a pattern of adaptation ...the adult acts benevolently and pits the group members against one another... The modeling activities of the adult, who poses, teaches and acts as mentor, further strengthen the group cohesion by appealing to the childs needs for attention, approval and affection.  The use of alcohol and drugs, together with promises of extra money for the photographs, plays a key role in enticing the child.  Thus, the child is bound by seemingly good forces as well as fearful, negative ones.29   In the studies reported by Burgess et al the adults were legitimate in the lives of the children, and included a neighbor, a school bus driver, a coach, a scout leader, a grandfather, a teacher and an apartment manager.<BR>

<P><B>IV.  SPECIFIC HEALTH EFFECTS Of CSEC </B><BR>

<P>The health aspects of commercial sexual exploitation of children should be seen both in terms of the clinical-pathological effects on the individuals as well as the psychosocial and psychosexual effects and its impact on public health and social development.  The analysis would also need to take into account the interrelationship of CSEC with substance abuse, the phenomenon of street children and violence to children.  Unfortunately, only limited information is available, leaving the picture of the health consequences of CSEC incomplete, and probably highly variable according to the different pathways and circumstances.<BR>

<P>The  health effects of the CSEC arise as a consequence of either the direct effects of sexual experiences or the circumstances that have led to the child's sexual exploitation.  The effects relate to the consequences of infection, physical violence and/or sexual abuse, the toxic effects of substance abuse, pregnancy and the psychosocial impact of the experience according the to vulnerability and subsequent expression of psychological, emotional or mental development of the individual.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Health Effects Of Causal Or Co-factors Arising In The &quot;Pathways To CSEC&quot; And/Or Which Become Behavioural Outcomes </B><BR>

<P>Other than the obvious consequences of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, the health consequences of the CSEC among street children is in large part a function of their street child status and/or the antecedents of being on the street.  Street children - whether being sexually exploited or not -often suffer from a variety of infectious diseases as a result of the unsanitary conditions of their environment, drinking water, food and eating arrangements and being unable to maintain their personal hygiene.  Skin infections may be common, and infected wounds or other injuries not uncommon.  They suffer from scabies and lice and are frequently malnourished, and stunted in growth. Among the street children of Mwanza in Tanzania, violence or neglect at home was cited among nearly 90% of the children as a reason for living on the street.33   Street life adds to the hazards of physical injury and wounds among these children, as well as sexual attacks by adults and older children.  <BR>

<P>Substance abuse, whether as a primary entry point, as part of the behavioural pattern of street children or as a component of the CSEC <I>per se, </I>has very specific associated health consequences depending on the substances being abused, the route of administration and in the instance of intravenous substance abuse, cleanliness and sharing of needles.  Intoxication increases the hazards of overdose, accidents, injuries, violence, rape, and unsafe sex.  Some of the abusing substances, particularly solvents and other volatile organic compounds produce liver, kidney or brain damage that can be permanent and life threatening.  Needle sharing has been well documented as a risk for hepatitis, HIV infection and other blood borne infections.   <BR>

<P>Violence whether physical and/or sexual, and coming from many different sources, creates an aura of fear and insecurity.  Whether originating in the family and as a causal factor in being a street child, or whether used as an expression of power and an instrument control by police or peers, violence in its many forms and health consequences, is part of the abusive environment of the street child. Violence, including psychological abuse, sometimes coupled with the use of toxic substances, alcohol or psychotropic drugs, also serves as an instrument of control of sexually exploited children and in trafficking of children.  <BR>

<P>Sexual abuse of children can be seen as both a pathway to commercial sexual exploitation and as an example of the possible health and developmental impact of the CSEC.  To understand the impact of sexual abuse, and possibly CSEC, it is necessary to go beyond the usual approach in classifying sexual abuse in terms of intra familial or extra familial, and whether or not force and penetration took place.(see section 5.2.4)<BR>
	<BR>
<B>2.  Direct health and developmental consequences of CSEC </B><BR>

<P><B>2.1</B>.  <B>Infections Other Than HIV/AIDS</B><BR>

<P>Sexually transmitted infections are the most common direct medical consequences of child prostitution, with HIV/AIDS the most serious of these infections, both for the child and public health.  At present at least a dozen different microorganisms have been identified as being sexually transmitted and capable of producing disease in either sexual partner, the fetus or the newborn infant.  The effects may either be immediately apparent or delayed and not manifest until years later.  In the instance of infertility the effects are not apparent until failure of a conception in a planned pregnancy.  From both the clinical and epidemiological perspective, one of the major problems in getting both health authorities and the public to take seriously the problem of sexually transmitted diseases is that in most instances initial infection is either asymptomatic or simply associated with annoying but not worrying local symptoms.   <BR>

<P>The immediate and long-term consequences of STDs span the clinical spectrum from localized genital tract infection, pelvic inflammatory disease(PID), ectopic pregnancy and infertility in the woman; genital tract, urethral stricture and infertility in the man; and, ophthalmia neonatorum, sepsis and meningo-encephalitis in the infant born of an infected mother.  For those able to reintegrate into their communities and expecting to have a normal family life, infertility may be associated with a high level of social stress, marital instability and divorce.37<BR>
 <BR>
 Although rarely death-threatening, PID is one of the serious consequences of STDs.  The definitive community-based study on the clinical and epidemiological pattern of PID has been conducted over a 17 year period in Sweden.<B>42.	Westrom L, Incidence, prevalence, and trends of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and its consequences in industrialized countries, American Journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. 1980 Dec 1; 138(7 Pt 2): 880-92 </B>   Throughout the entire study period, the incidence of first episodes of PID was highest in the teen-age group, thereafter decreasing with age.  The risk of acquiring salpingitis in sexually active 15-year-old girls was calculated to be 1:8, and in girls aged 16 years, 1:10.  The incidence then rapidly declined, and in women aged 24 years the risk was estimated to be 1:80.  A correlation between early sexual debut and promiscuous sexual relations might explain the very high salpingitis incidence in the sexually active teen-age girls, although the biological immaturity of the younger adolescents cervix may also contribute to the increased rates in the younger group.  Similar associations of early onset of sexual activity with infertility have been shown in studies from other countries.<BR>

<P>Infertility is a common consequence of STDs, and is both a consequence of prostitution as well as a factor forcing women into prostitution.  Even in settings with well developed, appropriately used diagnostic and therapeutic services for STDs, non-gonococcal salpingitis, despite early and prolonged therapy, is associated a rate of tubal occlusion of over 15%.  Following gonococcal infection in such settings the rate is 5.5%.<B>43.	Svensson L, Mardh PA, Westrom L, Infertility after acute salpingitis with special reference to Chlamydia trachomatis, Fertil-Steril. 1983 Sep; 40(3): 322-9 </B>  The risk of infertility following a single episode of salpingitis is increased five fold over the risk in women who have never had salpingitis<B>44.Mason PR,  Katzenstein DA, Chimbira TH, Mtimavalye L, (1989) Vaginal flora of women admitted to hospital with signs of sepsis following normal delivery, cesarean section or abortion. The Puerperal Sepsis Study Group, Central African Journal of Medicine. 35(3): 344-51</B>.  In the African setting where many women are defined in terms of their capacity to bear children, divorce is a common consequence of childlessness and &quot;one child sterility&quot;,<B>45.Verhagen AR Gemert W. Social and epidemiological determinants of gonorrhoea in an East African country, Br J Vener Dis, 48,</B> 277- , 1972  , 37 with women bearing its burden, even in instances when male infertility may be the cause.  Such women - including those married as children, divorced from their husbands and unable to return to their family of origin, frequently turn to prostitution as a means of survival.   Those married as children are particularly vulnerable on biological grounds, particularly in settings with the dual standards of virginity for the women, and where the urethral discharge of an STD in the man is considered confirmation of his coming of age.  <BR>

<P>Post-partum and post-abortion sepsis, in addition to being common causes of maternal mortality are associated with high rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and place high demands on the health services.<B>46.	Muir DG,  Belsey MA, Pelvic inflammatory disease and its consequences in the developing world.  Amer J of Obstet Gynec, l38</B> (part 2):  9l3-928, 1980.  The frequency with which these infections occur are a function of the standards of maternal care, the extent to which women become aware of and seek care for such infections and the adequacy of the therapy provided.  The problem is particularly acute among adolescent women who terminate an unwanted pregnancy, especially by unsafe, unskilled  abortion procedures.<BR>

<P><B>2.2.  HIV/AIDS</B><BR>

<P>Whether child prostitutes provide sexual services in an &quot;organized&quot; system or as a consequence of &quot;street child survival&quot;, they are probably at much greater risk of acquiring HIV infection than older individuals in similar circumstances.<B>47.	Sugerman ST, Hergenroeder AC, Chacko MR, Parcel GS, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and Adolescents: Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of runaway and homeless youths, American Journal Diseases of Childhood, 145 (4):431-436, 1991.</B>  First, they are less likely to have been reached with accurate information on the risks and consequences of HIV infection.  They are also less likely than older individuals to have access to information on and the means to prevent infection - including condoms, in large part due to their social marginalization.  Even if they had such access, their powerlessness -whether due to their exploited position, social or economic circumstances or position of psychological dependency - and lack of skills to negotiate safe sexual practices would nullify the usefulness of the information. <BR>

<P>Fear of AIDS has also been seen to be a factor in procurers and traffickers recruiting younger children into the system of commercial sexual exploitation on the assumption that they are less likely to be infected with HIV.  There are also anecdotal accounts in eastern and southern Africa of an increase in the sugar daddy phenomenon, with older men establishing younger school girls as their mistresses on the assumption that they are more likely to be HIV negative.  Unfortunately for all concerned the reverse is as likely to be true.  There is already a higher risk of infection in the young adolescent with an immature reproductive tract.  Furthermore, due to her age and power relationships, she is less able to negotiate safe sexual practices, once again raising her chances of HIV infection.  There is another dimension of the relationship of HIV/AIDS and the CSEC which can be characterized in terms of social economic causality.  The risk of children becoming infected with HIV may arise from the devastating social and economic consequences of AIDS wiping out or totally incapacitating the adult members of the family, forcing, as in the instance of street children into CSE situations as a means of self and family survival.  <BR>

<P>
<P><B>2.3.  Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases And Their Consequences</B><BR>

<P>Besides HIV infection the other three most significant viral sexually transmitted diseases are human papilloma virus (HPV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and hepatitis B virus.  HPV in its acute form causes genital warts, it may cause laryngeal papillomatosis in the infant born of an infected mother, and in its chronic form is among the causes of genital tract cancer.  In some settings it is the most common STD among adolescents and is strongly associated with early age of onset of sexual activity and multiplicity of partners.7, <B>48.	Economos K, Perez-Veridiano N, et al, Abnormal cervical cytology in adolescents.  A 15-year study, J Reproductive Medicine, 39(12):973-976, 1994. </B>  HSV-2 in its acute form causes genital ulcers, increases the risk of prematurity and may result in disseminated disease in the newborn, and, in its chronic form, is thought to be another of the microorganism associated with cervical cancer.  <BR>

<P>HBV will cause an acute hepatitis which is particularly fulminant among pregnant women in some parts of the world, and a significant cause of maternal mortality in some countries.   HBV is even more likely than the other sexually transmitted viral infections to infect the newborn who is likely to become a chronic carrier.  In its chronic form it produces chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancer of the liver.  While there is no specific documentation in the recent medical literature, one would expect higher risks of morbidity and mortality from HBV infection in individual with an already damaged liver, as from abuse through inhalation of organic substances. <BR>

<P><B>2.4.	Psychosocial And Developmental Consequences</B><BR>

<P>Aside from the obvious consequences of sexually transmitted infections, psychological problems are the most widely discussed manifestations of the health effects of CSEC, or its antecedents.  Few systematic or reasonably controlled studies exist on the psychological consequences of the commercial sexual exploitation of children.  There is a well-developed scientific literature on the immediate and long-term consequences of sexual abuse which has been reviewed and analyzed by Kendell-Tackett et al<B>49.	Kendall-Tackett KA, Williams LM, Finkelhor D, Impact of Sexual Abuse on Children: A Review and Synthesis of Recent Empirical Studies, Psychological bulletin, 113(1):164-180, 1993</B>, but most of the remaining reports on the psychosocial consequences of CSEC have been limited to small series of case reports with no comparisons of unaffected children from the same or similar circumstances.  Furthermore, the extent, depth and permanency of psychosocial damage is likely to be greatly influenced by the pathway that has led the child to a situation of commercial sexual exploitation, the manner in which the child is maintained in those circumstances and the degree to which the child is cut off from family and circumstances that would allow for the childs normal development.  <BR>

<P>The underlying assumption in the CSEC is that children in such circumstances are objects not individual human beings, and that sex serves as a commodity.  Insofar as the child is a late victim of CSEC, some aspects of the childs developmental tasks may have been achieved to a greater or lesser extent.  To the extent that CSEC is the end stage of psychopathology within a dysfunctional family, the depth, nature and likely duration of damage to the child is that much greater.   <BR>

<P>Post-traumatic stress disorder, as an acute response,  is among the psychosocial consequences of child sexual abuse, violence and pornography, and may be found in other instances of the CSEC.  It is defined as a psychological response to an event threatening death or injury that entails: 1) a sense of re-experiencing the trauma and the intrusion of memories or feelings; 2) a pattern of avoidance, a numbing of responsiveness, or reduced involvement in the external world; and 3) a persistent state of physiological arousal, reflected by such problems as difficulty sleeping, startle responses, and angry outbursts.  The suitability of PTSD model to fully reflect the impact of CSEC can be questioned in relation to the degree to which force, violence or the perceived threat thereof enters into the sequences leading up to or maintaining the child in situations of CSEC.  <BR>

<P>Finkelhor10, in describing the developmental aspects of the victimization of children, distinguishes two types of effects, namely those that are explicitly developmental because they result in a disturbance of the developmental process, and those that are specific to the trauma experience, but without developmental implications.  He refers to the latter as localized effects, many of which have the attributes of PTSD.  The former effects can be characterized in terms of  impairment of attachment, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships; and, failure to acquire competence in peer relations, adoption of highly sexualized or highly aggressive behaviour or the us of drugs, dissociation, self-injury, or other dysfunctional ways of dealing with anxiety.  The interference with the developmental process may impair both current and future developmental tasks.<BR>

<P>In examining the impact on child sexual abuse Finkelhor and Browne<B>50.	Finkelhor D, Browne A, the traumatic impact of child sexual abuse: A conceptualization. American J Orthopsychiatry, 55(4):530-541, 1985.</B> undertook an extensive review of the published literature and analyzed the outcomes in terms of four trauma-causing factors: traumatic sexualization; betrayal; powerlessness; and, stigmatization. They noted that many of the trauma-causing dynamics are present in other traumatic circumstances, the conjunction of these four dynamics in one set of circumstances is what makes the trauma of sexual abuse unique.  Some of their observations appear relevant to the CSEC and are summarized in terms of the characterization of the trauma-causing dynamics, factors modifying the effects and the short and long-term consequences (Table 4, adapted from Finkelhor and Browne).  By using this framework, and to the extent that the same trauma-causing dynamics are present in the CSEC, it is possible to obtain a better overview of the short-term and long-term health and developmental effects of the CSEC. <BR>

<P>Long-term follow-up of sexual abuse victims has indicated that the psychopathological consequences vary according to the developmental stage at the time of victimization. (Table 5)  Among preschoolers the most common symptoms associated with sexual abuse are anxiety, nightmares, general PTSD, internalizing and externalizing disorders and inappropriate sexual behaviour. For school-age children the common symptoms included fear, neurotic and general mental illness, aggression school problems, hyperactivity and regressive behaviour.  Adolescents experience depression, withdrawal, suicidal or self-injurious behaviours, somatic complaints, illegal acts, running away and substance abuse. Changes in symptomatology are noted over time.  In one study 65 % of preschool age children improved over one year.  However, a number of studies also suggest that as many as 10 - 24 % show a deterioration over time.  	<BR>

<P>The role of pornography and sexual violence and abuse has been widely debated, and not infrequently caught up in a broader social and political debate.  There have been a wide range of methodologies applied in an attempt to prove or disprove the relationship.  In many of the published studies the scope of the analysis lacks sufficient precision to test the hypothesis relating sexual violence and pornography or when a statistical correlation is established there is sometimes an uncritical assumption of causality.  By the nature of the subject matter methodological rigour may not always be possible, and well controlled experimental studies entail assumption that may not be borne out in reality.  <BR>

<P>The health and behavioural science literature from developed countries notes that the sexual experience of children portrayed in pornography is accompanied by a sense of betrayal, guilt, feelings of worthlessness and rage.  A number of studies indicate that sexually exploited children are at high risk of becoming sexual exploiters of children as adults.25   Children involved in sex rings show a variety of somatic and psychosocial symptoms during the exploitation, at the time of disclosure and in the posttraumatic stages.  Somatic complaints include urinary infections, headaches and stomach aches.  Behavioural problems at the time of exploitation include difficulty in school, acting-out behaviours and sudden changes in behaviour.    At the time of disclosure children display signs of post-traumatic stress, including re-experiencing the traumatic events, diminished responsiveness to the environment.  <BR>

<P>Burgess et al29, in their analysis of the consequences of sex rings and pornography provide another useful framework with broad implications for the immediate and long-term needs of children who are sexually exploited, whether or not for commercial purposes. She and her colleagues characterized the response of 62 children two years after the sex rings in which they were involved were reported to the criminal justice system in the U.S.    They characterized the responses in terms of the ability of the child to relate to participation in the rings activities; belief patterns - statements by the child about sexual involvement with the adult; symptoms of distress; and, bio-psychosocial performance - health and adjustment to school or work and to family, classmates, peers and authority figures<I>.</I>  Based on the childs responses in each of these areas, the investigators categorized the children according to one of four groups: <I>integration of the event;</I> <I>avoidance of the event</I>; <I>repetition of symptoms; or, identification with the exploiter</I>.29, <B>51.	Burgess AW, Hartman CR, McCausland MP, Powers P, Impact of Child Pornography and Sex Rings on Child Victims and Their Families. In Burgess AW (editor) Child Pornography and Sex Rings, Lexington Books/ D.C. Heath and Co., Lexington, Mass. 1984.</B>  <BR>

<P>Equal numbers of the children were characterized as falling into one of the four groups.  Factors associated with the characterization are noted in Table 6.  In the integration of the event the child has mastered the anxiety about the exploitation and believes the adult was not only wrong but was responsible for initiating the behaviour. These children were future oriented, and had reestablished friendships with a new peer groups.  They showed evidence of making age-appropriate adjustments with peers, family and school.  The event remained sealed off, consciously or unconsciously in those characterized as avoiding the events.  The child is afraid of the offender, and so long as he or she is not under stress, is able to manage life as if nothing happened.  The child does not have a sense of right and wrong, and in situations of stress depression and self-destructive behaviours appear.  Relations in the family remain strained, school difficulties occur and persist, and minor antisocial behaviour appears.  The child is very present oriented.   In those characterized as showing signs of repetition of symptoms, with acute posttraumatic stress disorder becoming chronic, the childs role and anxiety over being powerless are increased - the child being unable to master or control that anxiety.   The child feels guilty and blames himself or herself.  The family relationships are considered unstable, peer relationships are not reestablished, nor is the child successful in socializing with children of the same age but instead relates to younger children.  The child continues sexually explicit behaviours, or may be repeatedly victimized.  The child is described as being past oriented and may be hopeless about the future.  In child that identifies with the exploiter assimilates his or her anxiety through impersonating the aggressor.  The child exploits others and adopts an antisocial position toward peers, school and family.   This child minimizes the exploitation and pornography, maintains emotional, social and economic ties with the offender, and use of drugs and alcohol continues and increases.  The childs belief system has shifted to support antisocial behaviour, often serious and violent. <BR>

<P>	Silbert reported that involvement with pornography was among the most difficult experiences for children and juveniles to cope with.  These children experienced a long-term deep humiliation, with feelings of unworthiness and dirtiness pervading all images of themselves.   The problems became compounded over time, partly out of an inability to disclose the exploitation or to resolve it in any healthy fashion.  As juveniles and adults, they have an overwhelming sense of being out of control in their lives, even despite long and intense supportive care.  Silbert describes the situation as being one of psychological paralysis arising from extended and repeated situations which lead to  learned helplessness.<BR>

<P>Some of the observations on the mental health of street children may also fill some of the gap in the knowledge of the mental health impact of the CSEC.  In the Tanzanian studies previously cited, many of the street children show some of the signs of PTSD.  They wet themselves at night, wake up screaming, exhibit signs of mental breakdown and draw pictures that depict tremendous pain and confusion.28  	<BR>

<P><B>2.5.	Intergenerational Effects</B><BR>

<P>The intergenerational health and human development effects of CSEC may be physiological, psychological or a function of the social context of the sexual exploitation or its precursors.   Whether pregnancy is intended or not, if continued to term, the effect on the newborn are very much a function of the life styles and circumstances before and during pregnancy and at the time of delivery.  One would expect a high rate of prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight among the infants of girls caught up in commercial sexual exploitation, in large part due to the poor nutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, high levels of smoking and alcohol use, as well as the specific effects of psychotropic drugs and other substance abuse patterns.  Substance abusing girls, particularly those using alcohol or solvent sniffing, have a very high risk of giving birth to children with congenital defects that damage the growth, psychosocial and cognitive development of their infants.  The majority of such infants are born premature, exhibit postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly and developmental delays in infancy and childhood; they have a high risk of perinatal mortality.<B>52.	Pearson MA, Hoyme HE, Seaver LH, Rimsza ME, Toluene Embryopathy: Delineation of the Phenotype and Comparison with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Pediatrics, 93 (2):211-215, 1994.</B>  High levels of alcohol use during pregnancy greatly increases the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome which is associated with impaired motor and cognitive development and attention span defects which affects the childs learning capacity and performance in school. <BR>

<P>Although no precise data are available on the outcome of pregnancy among sexually exploited girls, because of the well documented high rates of STDs and their effect on inducing premature onset of labour, one would expect a high rate of prematurity among such births.  These infants would be expected to have higher rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity because of the expected poor health of the girls, their very young and the likelihood that births to such girls would not be well attended, thus subjecting the infants to higher rates of birth trauma and other complications.   Aside from the specific toxic effects of substance abuse, since smoking may also be common and intense among some populations of children being sexually exploited, the infants are likely to suffer from intrauterine growth retardation, clinically manifested as being small for the gestational age of the newborn.  These children, while not suffering excessively high rates of neonatal mortality, are likely to bear the impact of an inadequate intrauterine environment in terms of learning capacity and learning disorders, attention span difficulties and other neurological sequelae.  These morbidities are all the more likely if the infants are not provided a strong caring and stimulating environment for meeting their developmental needs.  Infants born of girls who are substance abuse may go into withdrawal symptoms, suffer seizures and possibly die.<BR>
  <BR>
The psychological state of the mother will greatly affect the survival and development of the infant born into such circumstances.  Dependent in part on the degree of control that the child-mother has, the experience of pregnancy and bearing a child may be translated into one of two forms:  the girls self-esteem may be enhanced - which if reinforced with the support and transfer of caring skills, may offer one avenue of rehabilitation, or her lack of self-esteem and self-loathing may be reinforced, leading to post-partum depression, neglect or abuse of the infant, and/or further self-destructive behaviour by the girl.   In the latter circumstances, unless decisive action is taken to ensure a consistent and supportive caring environment for the infant, it will start life with a lack of attachment and a legacy of mistrust, doubt, compensated either by aggressive behaviour or withdrawal - a poor candidate for later care and schooling.  <BR>
  <BR>
Those children who have been caught up in the web of CSEC as a consequence of physical, emotional or sexual abuse, particularly when they come from substance abusing dysfunctional families, are unlikely to have suitable adult models of parenting and caring to draw upon in their own roles as mothers.  Under these conditions they will be at great risk of perpetuating the behavioural cycle of physical, emotional or sexual abuse to their off-spring. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>3.	Public health consequences of SCEC: the special circumstances of HIV/AIDS and STDs</B><BR>

<P>As has been the case of STDs and despite a long period of denial by many governments and cultures, the advent of HIV/AIDS has catapulted a range of social health and behavioural issues to the forefront of the global public health agenda.   No longer is it possible for STDs to be dismissed as signs of the rites of passage of young men.  Nor is it any longer possible to ignore commercial sexual exploitation, particularly of children.  While there are no precise quantitative figures on the extent to which the CSEC contributes to the spread of HIV/AIDS, it is not unreasonable to speculate that CSEC is significant and an important public health problem in the context of AIDS.  This assessment is based on our knowledge of the patterns of child trafficking - including cross-border, the role of commercial sex workers in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the timing and initiation of children into commercial sexual exploitation through various pathways, and the enormous rate at which the epidemic has swept different areas of the world.  <BR>

<P>There are two dimensions to the public health aspects of the CSEC.  The most obvious and immediate is the possible role of CSEC in the spread of HIV/AIDS.  While there is no clear evidence, the involvement of children in the commercial sex work could possibly increase the rate of transmission of HIV - first because of their increased biological vulnerability to STDs, and second, because of the lack of power in negotiating safe sexual behaviour.  It is also reasonable to hypothesize that wherever trafficking of commercial sex workers takes place the spread of HIV transmission from one local to another is also facilitated.  Trafficking in such children within country and between countries would probably be quite high.  Furthermore, when such children burn out, whether due to AIDS or other infectious, nutritional or psychological causes, they may be sent or shipped back to their places of origin, or left to fend for themselves.  In such circumstances they may be more vulnerable to further sexual violence.    In addition, not wishing to become pregnant, and unable to negotiate safe sexual behaviour, the child sex worker may resort to contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine device (IUD) or the oral contraceptive pills, that do not depend on the partners behaviour. The IUD increases the risk of acquiring STDs by causing erosion of the cervical mucosa and providing a means for ascending infection.  PID is one of the major and frequent complications of IUD use among those with a multiplicity of sexual partners.  The oral contractive pill is associated with increased rates of cervical ectropion which exposes the transformation zone and endocervical epithelium to bacterial and viral agents. It is thought that this might explain the increasing rates of cervical cancer, and could contribute to HIV transmission. <BR>

<P>	Having been girls or young adolescents at the time of initiation into CSEC, even if these children are aware that they have treatable conditions other than HIV, they are likely to have less knowledge, confidence and negotiating skills in seeking and obtaining medical care, thus increasing their risks of progression of such conditions and the acquisition of HIV, if they are not already infected.  They are less likely, unless they have established some form of information and support networks, to draw upon the resources of other programmes such as training and education, housing, etc.   <BR>

<P><B>VI.	EXPERIENCES IN HEALTH CARE AND REHABILITATION OF VICTIMS OF CSEC, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THEIR HEALTH AND PHYCHOSOCIAL DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS</B><BR>

<P>There are few published reports on specific health care and rehabilitation of victims of CSEC.  Much of what is known in the field has been drawn by analogy from HIV/AIDS control work among commercial sex workers, street children and the principles of community development work among the networks of nongovernmental organizations.   Despite the lack of specific experience there are a number of principles that appear to work reasonably well for a variety of circumstances.  These include ensuring the involvement - and preferably the sense of ownership - of the beneficiaries of programmes in setting the priorities, approaches and content of programmes, and in the managing and evaluation of such programmes.  Health may or may not be their first priority.  More often than not the first choice of these children will be in terms of personal security and skills for immediate daily living and personal appearance.  While they may seek care for painful conditions and symptomatic illness, once care is provided other immediate needs are likely to take precedence.  A major principle in such programmes is flexibility.  In the literature on street children, and by implication, including some victims of the CSEC, there has been an extensive discussion of the merits of open versus protected residential facilities.  The rational for the latter has been to protect the child from those who have sexually exploited him or her.  On the other hand, the price paid for protected residential facilities is the confidence building of choice to stay or choice to leave.  Many in the field have expressed the view that the process of choice is such an important part of the rehabilitation process, that it is worth the risks except under the most extreme situations of threatened violence.    <BR>

<P>On the whole the health system and health workers are ill-prepared to address the health and psychosocial needs of victims of CSEC.  Most health services and care providers are somatic disease oriented, and, except for those who have been seriously engaged in the efforts to prevent, treat and care for those with HIV/AIDS, they are very uncomfortable dealing with any issues related to human sexuality in any form.  Health workers, being inadequately trained in human sexuality and all of its health and psychosocial dimensions, carry their own biases and judgements when dealing with such problems.  Furthermore, public services for health care are rarely designed to take the needs for dignity and confidentiality into account in health care practice.  The organization of health care, particularly in large urban centres, removes the continuity of care provided by the consistent and sympathetic laying on of hands, so important in reinforcing the childs sense of human worth.  <BR>

<P><B>1.  Existing Judicial And Social Response To CSEC</B><BR>

<P>The mapping of the social and judicial responses to CSEC is an essential component in establishing policies and programmes to address the health and child development consequences and in preventing further damage to the health and development of its victims and to protect their rights.  Such a mapping exercise of pathways must include an examination of the systems to deal with the victims of CSEC not only from the perspective of protecting their rights, but by adapting their processes and procedures so as to take into account the developmental and health needs of the child at different ages and stages, where possible facilitating that development, but above all, doing no further harm.  It is the parallel adage of the Oath of Hypocrites, physician, do no harm. <BR>

<P><B>VII.	An agenda for action of the health and developmental needs: Filling the gaps for policy and programme development and implementation </B><BR>

<P>The lack of direct and specific information on the health and human development implications should not be an obstacle to effective action.   However, action without evaluation is a waste of human resources and energy, depriving others of the lessons learned and denying community, national and international solidarity essential to mobilize all relevant disciplines and parties with those most effected.  There is a great deal of analytic work that could be done on existing analogous data to refine the hypothesis and provide guidance on programme development and design that could then be subject to evaluation/operational research.  Much of the existing information remains inaccessible to other interested parties and groups.  And those currently providing care and services frequently do not have access to methodological developments that would facilitate the analysis and understanding of their own experiences and data.  Similarly, there are a number of participatory methods that have been developed for other aspects of health development that could be adapted and applied to CSEC.<BR>

<P>One of the major challenges is to build action coalitions involving affected children, community groups, academic institutions and governmental bodies which cut across the spectrum of disciplines such as health, education, child and social welfare, the judiciary and the private sector.   The broad issues should define what are the needs? and what works?  Among the issues that might be addressed are: <BR>

<P>what simple methods exist and can be readily adapted to defining the needs of CSEC in different settings and circumstances? <BR>

<P>		what kind of counselling, care and support services are appropriate to meet the needs of these children in their different settings?<BR>

<P>		how can existing services be adapted, improved or otherwise modified to better meet the needs of such children?  What alternative forms of care and organization of care might be more effective and efficient?  <BR>

<P>		how suitable to the needs of these children are the existing health care structures and facilities? <BR>
	<BR>
		what are the most effective participatory modalities to ensure the confidence and sense of ownership of programmes by those most affected? <BR>

<P>		can effective preventive programmes be developed in collaboration with families, community institutions and other bodies in the areas from which children are drawn for CSE?<BR>

<P>The commercial sexual exploitation of children represents one of the most important challenges to modern and developing society.  Just as HIV/AIDS is now understood to be a societal priority that goes beyond the traditional bounds of medical care and public health, the commercial sexual exploitation of children must similarly be understood.  CSEC is an issue of health care and  it is a concern for public health.   But above all it is about fundamental and universal human values and individuals with faces, names and aspirations. In one sense, the issue of the CSEC has become a lightening rod for the seriousness with which governments, representing well over 95% of the worlds children, take and will give effect to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It is also a test of the degree to which such governments trust and share responsibility for action with their own people.  The last thirty years of health care development in support of women, children, families and communities has taught us that all sustainable programmes derive from negotiated processes among equal partners.<BR>

<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B><BR>

<P>In adopting a succession of treaties throughout the twentieth Century, the international community has demonstrated long-standing concern about sexual exploitation and connected issues such as trafficking and certain aspects of slavery, in general or with specific reference to children. These instruments have been drawn up in various contexts - human rights, humanitarian law, refugee law, labour standards, etc. - and have also instigated the development of a number of regional treaties tackling the issues involved.<BR>

<P>Examination of this body of international law shows that it has concentrated more especially on protection from exploitation in prostitution as opposed to exploitative use in pornography, a field in which clear definitions - and hence a clear basis for consensus and cooperation - are  lacking.<BR>

<P>The degree of adherence to these international treaties ranges widely. However, the most significant instrument for efforts in this sphere - the Convention on the Rights of the Child - has achieved almost universal ratification. Furthermore, no State Party has notified a reservation on article 34, the main provision concerned. Implementation of this Convention is facilitated by the existence of the other instruments which indicate the scope covered and, in addition, often give guidance as to the interpretation of the relevant provisions.<BR>

<P>These texts have variously generated and been inspired by measures taken at national level, whether of a legislative, administrative or other nature. In both industrialised and developing countries, preoccupation over the growing incidence of sexual exploitation of children and the increasingly international character of several of its manifestations has triggered a spate of new legislation during the Nineties in particular. This paper discusses national measures taken in the areas of child prostitution, trafficking, pornography, sex tourism, extra-territorial legislation and problems relating to child witnesses and the rights of the accused.<BR>

<P>Whilst gaps in legislation still exist, law enforcement now poses the major challenge. This and the prevention aspect, including forms of punishment and deterrence, are addressed in the paper, as are the goals of international cooperation in this regard.<BR>

<P>It is recommended, inter alia, that governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the basis for reviewing and monitoring legislative provisions and law enforcement. The paper also suggests the establishment of an intersectoral task-force and a monitoring system (e.g. Ombudsperson)  in every country as necessary elements of a coherent effort to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>PART I: THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK</B><BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Introduction</B><BR>

<P>International concern over phenomena more or less closely associated with sexual exploitation -slavery, forced labour, trafficking, financial gains from the prostitution of others, obscene publications, etc. - has been reflected in a relatively large number of treaties drawn up since the beginning of this century, within the framework of the global development of international human rights law.<BR>

<P>The following were the main treaties adopted prior to the founding of the United Nations (excluding International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions - see 2 below):<BR>

<P>1904 International Agreement for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (amended by Protocol of 3 December 1948)<BR>

<P>1910 International Convention for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (amended by Protocol of 3 December 1948)<BR>

<P>1919 Convention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea)<BR>

<P>1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children (amended by Protocol of 20 October 1947)<BR>

<P>1923 Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of, and Traffic in, Obscene Publications (amended by Protocol of 12 November 1947)<BR>

<P>1926 Slavery Convention (amended by Protocol of 23 October 1953)<BR>

<P>1933 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age (amended by Protocol of 20 October 1947)<BR>

<P>Those amended by protocols were taken on board by the United Nations; the 1919 convention has lapsed.<BR>

<P>The following sections focus more especially on binding texts, but also cover selected components of &quot;soft law&quot; dealing explicitly or implicitly with the subject. These sections are: (1) United Nations texts that are currently in force or valid, (2) ILO instruments, (3) refugee law, (4) humanitarian law, (5) international texts in preparation, (6) regional treaties which contain provisions relevant to the protection of children from commercial sexual exploitation, and (7) extracts from comments by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Section 8 is a short commentary.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>1. 	UNITED NATIONS TREATIES IN FORCE</B><BR>

<P><B>1.1.	1923 Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of, and Traffic in, Obscene Publications (amended by Protocol of 12 November 1947)</B><BR>

<P>This Convention<B> </B>as amended had been ratified by 53 countries as at 31 December 1994. The ratification rate in recent years has, however, been extremely low: the most recent ratification apart from the succession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 dates back to 1983 (Cuba). Only one other country (Solomon Islands, 1981) ratified during the Eighties, and only three countries ratified during the Seventies (Fiji in 1971, Zambia in 1974 and Lesotho in 1975).<BR>

<P>Interestingly, two countries that had been States Parties since 1949 subsequently notified denunciation: Denmark in 1967 (no motive recorded) and the Netherlands in 1985 which motivated the decision by saying that the provisions of the Dutch Criminal Code had been amended to concern only production, possession or trade relating to &quot;the portrayal of - or any medium of information which portrays - sexual activity involving persons under the age of 16 (i.e. child pornography)&quot; or the sending of any pornographic materials &quot;unsolicited through the mail or to supply, offer or show them to children&quot;.<BR>

<P>The treaty indeed covers all forms of pornography, notably making it a punishable offence in States Parties &quot;[for purposes of or by way of trade or for distribution or public exhibition to make or produce or have in possession obscene writings, drawings, prints, paintings, printed matter, pictures, posters, emblems, photographs, cinematograph films or any other obscene objects&quot;. Also punishable are export, import, conveyance, advertising and taking part in a business concerned with any such &quot;obscene matters or things&quot;.<BR>

<P>Offenders are in principle to be brought to trial in the State Party &quot;in whose territories the offence, or any of the constitutive elements of the offence, was committed&quot; but, when the laws of the country so permit, they may alternatively (not additionally)  be prosecuted in the State Party of which they are nationals &quot;if they are found in its territories, even if the constitutive elements of the offence were committed outside such territories&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>1.2. 	1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others</B><BR>

<P>This Convention had been ratified by 70 countries as at 31 December 1994. It was designed to consolidate the above-mentioned treaties of 1904, 1910, 1921 and 1933 which were in force at the time it was adopted and which thereby became obsolete. Essentially, it obliges States Parties to punish any person who, &quot;to gratify the passions of another, [procures, entices or leads away another person for purposes of prostitution&quot; or &quot;exploits the prostitution of another person&quot;, even with the latter's consent. Also punishable is the running of a brothel and renting accommodation for the purpose of the prostitution of others. Under the treaty, such offences are to be regarded as extraditable or, in States where extradition is not permitted, nationals who have returned to their own State after the commission <BR>

<P>abroad of any such offence are to be prosecuted in and punished by the courts of their own State. The Convention then sets out procedures for combating international traffic in persons (especially women and children) for the purpose of prostitution.<BR>

<P><B>1.3.	1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery</B><BR>

<P>This Convention had been ratified by 114 countries as of 31 December 1994. It was designed to complement, not to replace, the 1926 Slavery Convention. For the purposes of this paper, the most pertinent provision of this treaty is Article 1, which obliges States Parties to &quot;take all practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of&quot;, <I>inter alia,</I> &quot;[any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age of 18 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person, whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labour&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>1.4.	1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</B><BR>

<P>This Convention, in force since 1981, had been ratified by 131 countries as of 30 June 1994. Article 6 directs States Parties to &quot;take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>1.5.	1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child</B><BR>

<P>This Convention (CRC) had been ratified by 187 countries as of 15 April 1996. It defines a child as &quot;every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&quot;. It contains several provisions relevant to the issues under consideration.<BR>

<P>Article 19 stipulates that &quot;States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from [...] maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child&quot;.<BR>

<P>Under Article 32, &quot;States Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from [...] performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or [...] to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development&quot;. A minimum age or ages for employment are to be set (cf. ILO Convention 138 , under 2.2. below) and States are bound to &quot;[provide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement of the present article.&quot;<BR>

<P>Article 34 provides that &quot;States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse&quot; and to &quot;take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent: (a) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity; (b) the exploitative use of children in prostitution or any other unlawful sexual practices; &copy; the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.&quot; It is worth noting that this, the key provision in the Convention relating to commercial sexual exploitation, has not been the subject of a reservation by any of the States Parties.<BR>

<P>Similarly, Article 35 obliges States Parties to take &quot;all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.&quot;<BR>

<P>Finally, Article 39 requires States Parties to &quot;take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of... any form of ... exploitation... in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>2.	ILO INSTRUMENTS</B><BR>

<P>The conclusions of the <I>United Nations International Seminar on the ways and means of achieving the elimination of the exploitation of child labour in all parts of the world</I> (28 October-8 November 1985) include the following reference: &quot;the exploitation of child labour takes many forms, and certain types of exploitation, for example child prostitution [...], are particularly abhorrent&quot;. Thus, the interpretation is clearly that child prostitution at least is considered, at the international level, to be a form of exploitative child labour. Whilst ILO treaties were not drawn up with the phenomenon of sexual exploitation in mind - no more than they were drafted as a means of combating the participation of children in armed conflict -certain ILO standards can nonetheless be deemed of relevance in these regards.<BR>

<P><B>2.1. 	ILO Conventions 29 (Forced labour, 1930) and 105 (Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957)</B><BR>

<P>ILO Conventions 29 and 105 were explicitly referred to in an amendment proposed by Nigeria to the chapter on &quot;implementation of existing instruments&quot; of the revised French proposal for an optional protocol on the subject at hand (see E.2. below). Whilst they do not seem to be of significant direct value as a legal tool for combating commercial sexual exploitation of children on the threshold of the third millennium, Convention 29 (ratified by 136 countries as at 1 June 1995) at least lends weight to the thesis that any form of forced or compulsory labour undertaken by children has long been the target of prohibition. This Convention sets out a number of conditions under which forced or compulsory labour may be exacted - such as compulsory military service, normal civic obligations, as a consequence of conviction in a court of law, emergency situations, etc. - but in so doing it anyway restricts such labour to &quot;able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years...&quot; (Art. 11).<BR>

<P><B>2.2.	ILO Convention 138 (Minimum Age, 1973) and Recommendation 146 (Minimum Age, 1973)</B><BR>

<P>ILO Convention 138, currently the flagship treaty on child labour, is reflected, and implicitly referred to, in CRC Article 32 (see 1.5. above). However, it suffers from a relatively poor ratification record: just 46 countries as at 1 June 1995. The thrust of the Convention is the regulation of admission to employment in &quot;branches of economic activity or... undertakings&quot; listed in its Art. 5, para. 3. Not unnaturally, these are all sectors of formal and recognised enterprise, and the treaty deals with neither self-employment or &quot;non-lucrative&quot; work. As a result, it has no direct application in the field of commercial sexual exploitation. It does serve, however, as a further indication of the international community's attitude towards activities that jeopardise the health and development of children. Also, presuming that applicants for admission to employment take that step of their own free will, the fact that the treaty requires that a 16-year-old be denied access to employment reserved for those over 18 is a further demonstration of the irrelevance of consent as a factor in determining exploitation.<BR>

<P>The Minimum Age Recommendation of 1973 supplements Convention 138 by giving more precise policy guidelines for optimal implementation of the treaty at national level.<BR>

<P><B>3.	REFUGEE LAW</B><BR>

<P><B>3.1.	1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees</B><BR>

<P>The number of States Parties to one or both instruments was 130 as at 20 October 1995. Whilst the instruments contain no special provision on protection from sexual exploitation, Article 24 of the 1951 Convention is potentially relevant to the present paper in that it reaffirms obligations regarding child labour, stating that &quot;[the Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment as is accorded to nationals in respect of (...) minimum age of employment (...) and the work of young persons...&quot;.<BR>

<P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has a general supervisory function under Art. 35 of the 1951 Convention in addition to its mandate to provide international protection to refugees contained in the Statute of the Office.<BR>

<P><B>3.2.	Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme: Conclusion No. 47 (XXXVIII) of 1987 on Refugee Children</B><BR>

<P>Although not, of course, binding law, this Conclusion is of interest in that it specifies UNHCR's concern about sexual exploitation of children, condemning &quot;the exposure of refugee children to physical violence and other violations of their basic rights, including through sexual abuse, trade in children [...]&quot; and calling for &quot;national and international action to prevent such violations and assist the victims&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>4.	INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW</B><BR>

<P>Humanitarian law determines what acts are lawful in the course of an armed conflict. The applicable rules depend on whether the conflict is considered international (e.g. an inter-State conflict) or non-international (e.g. a civil war).<BR>

<P><B><I>International armed conflicts</I></B><BR>

<P><B>4.1.	Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land Annexed to the 1907 Hague Convention IV</B> (&quot;The Hague Regulations&quot;)<BR>

<P>All prisoners of war, including children, &quot;must be humanely treated&quot; (article 2). Rape or sexual abuse of the inhabitants of a territory under occupation is prohibited under Article 46: &quot;Family honor and rights [...] must be respected.&quot; As affirmed in the judgement of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, the Hague Regulations represent customary international law and as such are binding on all States whether or not they have adhered to the Convention itself. <BR>

<P><B>4.2.	1949 Geneva Convention III Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</B> (&quot;The 1949 POW Convention&quot;)<BR>

<P>The 1949 POW Convention developed protection afforded by the 1929 Geneva Convention on POWs based on the experiences of the Second World War. A POW includes all members of the armed forces; the civilians accompanying those forces, and civilians spontaneously taking up arms to resist an invader. Article 14 of the Convention provides that &quot;Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour. Women shall be treated with all the regard due to their sex...&quot;. Under Article 52, except for volunteers, no prisoner of war may be employed in labour which is of an unhealthy or dangerous nature. The Convention had been ratified by 186 countries as at 24 April 1996. <BR>

<P><B>4.3.	1949 Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War</B><BR>

<P>The 1949 Geneva Convention IV was the first international agreement addressing exclusively the treatment of civilians in armed conflict, although there had been certain provisions to protect civilians included in the Hague Regulations of 1907. It is mainly confined to the protection of civilians in occupied territory or in internment and its provisions have been extensively supplemented by Additional Protocol I of 1977. Article 27 of Geneva Convention IV states: &quot;Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights... Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.&quot;<BR>

<P>Furthermore, under Article 51, an Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to work unless they are over 18 years of age. Children are considered protected persons if they are civilians in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals. Nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected persons nor are nationals of a neutral state or co-belligerent State as long as normal diplomatic representation exists in the State in whose hands they are. <BR>

<P>The Convention had been ratified by 186 countries as at 24 April 1996, and many of its provisions represent customary international law.<BR>

<P><B>4.4.	Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I)</B><BR>

<P>Under article 75, all children who are in the power of a Party to the conflict and who do not benefit from more favourable treatment under the Conventions of the Protocol shall be treated humanely in all circumstances. Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault are prohibited. Article 77 provides that &quot;[children shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against any form of indecent assault.&quot;<BR>

<P>This Protocol had been ratified by 143 countries as at 24 April 1996 and many of its provisions represent customary international law.<BR>

<P><B><I>Non-international armed conflicts</I></B><BR>

<P><B>4.5.	Article 3 Common to the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949</B> (&quot;Common Article 3&quot;)<BR>

<P>In an internal armed conflict, each party to the conflict is obliged to treat humanely all persons taking no active part in hostilities. Outrages upon their personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment are prohibited as are violence to life and person. The International Court of Justice affirmed in the Nicaragua case that Common Article 3 represents customary international law. <BR>

<P><B>4.6.	Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)</B><BR>

<P>Under the fundamental guarantees in Article 4, all persons not taking a direct part in hostilities or who have ceased to take part in hostilities are entitled to respect for their person and honour and must be protected from &quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault&quot; and &quot;slavery and the slave trade in all their forms&quot;. The threshold for applicability of Protocol II is often deemed to be higher than for Common Article 3. This Protocol had been ratified by 135 countries as at 24 April 1996.<BR>

<P><B><I>Enforcement</I></B><BR>

<P>In <I>international </I>armed conflicts, rape and sexual abuse of protected persons as far as they involve &quot;wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health&quot; constitute grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. States Parties are obliged to prosecute, or extradite for prosecution, anyone suspected of committing grave breaches. In relation to all other breaches of the Conventions and Protocols including in <I>internal </I>armed conflicts, governments are obliged to &quot;take measures necessary for the suppression&quot; of these breaches. <BR>

<P>
<P><B>5.	INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS IN PREPARATION</B><BR>

<P><B>5.1.	Revised 1961 (Hague) Convention on the Protection</B> <B>of Children</B><BR>

<P>The second reading of the draft revised text of this private international law treaty was effected in September 1995. The final revision should be ready for approval at the Diplomatic Conference scheduled for October 1996. This instrument will deal with the attribution of jurisdiction, the determination of applicable law, and the establishment of a system of international cooperation to provide protection for children who are not in their &quot;country of habitual residence&quot;. In particular, and in somewhat simplified form, it will mean that a child in need of protective measures while outside that country - such as in the case of a child taken abroad for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation - may<I> </I>benefit from appropriate measures at the initiative of the authorities of the country where he or she is present, whether or not the authorities of the country of habitual residence request this and whether or not he or she is a national of either country concerned.<BR>

<P><B>5.2.	Proposed Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child</B><BR>

<P>By its resolution of 8 March 1995, the Commission on Human Rights decided that &quot;the open-ended inter-sessional working group of the Commission [...] for the elaboration of guidelines on a possible optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, shall elaborate [...] a draft optional protocol&quot; on these issues. Proposed drafts already exist, but it is currently difficult to estimate the likely time-scale for the formulation and approval of a final text. The protocol will almost certainly deal only with national obligations within the framework of international cooperation to implement relevant rights in the Convention; it will not comprise substantive standard-setting.<BR>

<P><B>6.	REGIONAL TREATIES</B><BR>

<P><B>6.1.	1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</B><BR>

<P>The treaty entered into force in 1986, and as of 1 January 1996, had been ratified by 50 States. Article 5 prohibits &quot;all forms of exploitation and degradation&quot;, including in particular slavery and the slave trade.<BR>

<P>In addition, Article 18.2 obliges States Parties to &quot;ensure the elimination of every discrimination against women and... the protection of the rights of the woman and the child as stipulated in international declarations and conventions.&quot; The implication here is that States that are also parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child would be obliged to implement the provisions of CRC Article 34 as part of their obligations under the Charter.<BR>

<P><B>6.2.	1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child</B><BR>

<P>The Charter, having been ratified to date by only six Member States of the OAU, has not yet entered into force (15 ratifications are required for this). It contains provisions on exploitation of child labour, sexual exploitation and sale and trafficking. They are essentially<BR>
similar in effect to their counterparts in the CRC, but contain a number of additional facets.<BR>

<P>The Charter's Article XV (Child labour) specifies that the provision &quot;covers both the formal and informal sectors of employment&quot; and makes explicit rather than implicit reference to &quot;the International Labour Organisation's instruments relating to children&quot; as a consideration in establishing &quot;minimum ages for admission to <I>every</I> employment&quot; (our italics).<BR>

<P>Article XXVII of the Charter, in addition to requiring States Parties to &quot;protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse&quot;, obliges them to &quot;take measures to prevent: (a) the inducement, coercion or encouragement of a child to engage in any sexual activity; (b) the use of children in prostitution or other sexual practices; &copy; the use of children in pornographic activities, performances and materials&quot;. In comparison with the counterpart provision in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, therefore, the Charter adds &quot;encouragement&quot; under sub-paragraph (a), removes the qualification of &quot;unlawful&quot; sexual activity or practices in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), adds pornographic &quot;activities&quot; in sub-paragraph (c), and removes the word &quot;exploitative&quot; before &quot;use&quot; in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), presuming that any &quot;use&quot; of the child will in itself be exploitative. In principle, therefore, and subject to interpretation, the Charter provides for protection from a somewhat wider range of acts than does the Convention.<BR>

<P>Finally, Article XXIX specifies that States are to combat sale and trafficking &quot;by any person including parents or legal guardians of the child&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>6.3.	1969 American Convention on Human Rights</B><BR>

<P>This Convention entered into force in 1978, and as at 1 January 1996 had been ratified by 25 States. Article 5 stipulates that &quot;[every person has the right to have his physical, mental and moral integrity respected.&quot; Article 6 specifies that &quot;[no one shall be subject to slavery or to involuntary servitude, which are prohibited in all their forms, as are the slave trade and traffic in women.&quot; The Convention further provides (Article 19) that &quot;every minor child has the right to the measures of protection required by his condition as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the state.&quot;<BR>

<P>In the 1988 Protocol to this Convention (not in force by January 1996), all work which &quot;jeopardizes health, safety or morals&quot; is prohibited for persons under 18 years of age.<BR>

<P><B>6.4.	1994 Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors</B><BR>

<P>This treaty was adopted at the Fifth Inter-American Specialised Conference on Private International Law convened by the Organization of American States (OAS). It is designed to regulate civil and penal aspects of the international traffic in minors through international cooperation. It covers &quot;any human being below the age of eighteen&quot; who is the victim of &quot;abduction, removal or retention, or attempted abduction, removal or retention [...] for unlawful purposes or by unlawful means&quot;. The term &quot;unlawful purposes&quot; is then defined to include &quot;prostitution, sexual exploitation, servitude...&quot;. It is as yet too early to foresee the impact of this treaty whose ratification will necessarily be limited to OAS members.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>6.5.	1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</B><BR>

<P>This Convention was the first regional agreement on human rights to be adopted after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has been in force since 1953. It had been ratified by 31 countries as at 1 January 1996. Its main relevant provision is Article 4 which declares that &quot;[no-one shall be held in slavery or servitude&quot; and &quot;no-one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>6.6.	1961 European Social Charter</B><BR>

<P>The Charter, covering the development and protection of social and economic rights, is a complementary instrument to the European Convention on Human Rights. It came into force in 1965, and had been ratified by 20 countries as at 24 April 1996. <BR>

<P>States Parties to the Charter accept as the aim of their policies the attainment of conditions in which certain rights and principles may be effectively realised. These include (Part I, 7): &quot;Children and young persons have the right to special protection against the physical and moral hazards to which they are exposed.&quot; States further undertake to be bound by certain obligations, including (Part II, Art. 7[10]): &quot;To ensure special protection against physical and moral dangers to which children and young persons are exposed, and particularly against those resulting... from their work.&quot;<BR>

<P><B>6.7.	1991 Recommendation No. R(91)11 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States of the Council of Europe</B><BR>

<P>This Recommendation, made under Article 15(b) of the Statute of the Council of Europe, is worth highlighting because it emanates from an organ of the Council which specifically addresses &quot;Sexual Exploitation, Pornography and Prostitution of, and Trafficking in, Children and Young Adults&quot;. It urges Member States to review legislation and practice with a view to implementing a comprehensive programme of measures to combat the sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P><B>7.	COMMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD</B><BR>

<P>As its contribution to the Open-ended Working Group of the 52nd Session of the Commission on Human Rights concerning the question of the drafting of an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (cf. 5.2. above), the Committee on the Rights of the Child submitted a paper from which the following elements are extracted:<BR>

<P>&quot;[The importance of [the issues of child prostitution and child pornography and the sale of children for these purposes] as well as the need to draw urgent attention and encourage concerted action to prevent and combat them, are illustrated by the attention paid to them in the course of the dialogue held with States parties on the implementation of the Convention, as well as the decision of the Committee to devote, in 1993, its second thematic debate to the topic 'economic exploitation of children'.<BR>

<P>&quot;But it is important to stress that the Convention has not only identified such situations in an autonomous manner, it has further set up a holistic approach for the consideration of the human rights of children. In the light of such an approach, all rights are recognised as inherent to the human dignity of the child, and the implementation of one right will only be effective when taking into consideration the implementation of, and respect for, all the other rights of the child. In a word, the Convention reaffirms the indivisibility and interdependence of human rights.<BR>

<P>&quot;The protection of the child from all forms of exploitation, including from sale, prostitution or pornography should therefore not be seen simply in isolation but in the broader context of the realisation of children's rights and taking in due consideration the international obligations arising from the Convention.<BR>

<P>&quot;These [obligations] show the decisive importance attached by the Convention, as a human rights instrument, to the national process of implementation of children's rights. It further stresses the special responsibility of States in this regard. These realities were in fact also emphasised by the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights, which called on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans.<BR>

<P>&quot;[The reporting system established by the Convention is an essential tool for States parties to ensure a periodic assessment and evaluation of progress achieved in its implementation. It further allows for the improvement of the situation of children and the prevention of violation of their fundamental rights. At the same time, the dialogue held between States and the Committee on the Rights of the Child plays an important catalytic role in this regard, allowing for the formulation of specific suggestions and recommendations to States parties, identifying priority areas for action and encouraging programmes of technical assistance or advice in cooperation with United Nations and other competent bodies.<BR>

<P>&quot;[Through the activities of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and of its Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, important and comprehensive strategies have been envisaged to ensure the implementation of the different existing legal instruments and to give guidance in relation to specific areas where action should be undertaken, such as legal reform, information, education, social assistance, reintegration and international cooperation. Special reference should be made in this regard to the two programmes of action adopted by the Commission on Human Rights for the Prevention of the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and for the Elimination of Child Labour. Presently under preparation is a new Programme of Action on the Prevention of Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others.<BR>

<P>&quot;The progress achieved in the implementation of these programmes of action is periodically evaluated both by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and the Commission on Human Rights. The Commission further considers the important activities of thematic Rapporteurs, as the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women or the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography who has adopted important recommendations on ways to address the areas covered by her mandate.<BR>

<P>&quot;It is also interesting to note that the issues of sale and trafficking in children, child prostitution and child pornography deserve a special attention within the United Nations system-wide action. Mention could be made in this regard to ILO [...] or to the activities developed by UNICEF in the framework of the implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children.<BR>

<P>&quot;At the same time, in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice, important steps have also been taken. In fact, the Ninth Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held last year [1995] in Cairo, called on States to adopt necessary measures aiming at the prevention, protection and rehabilitation of children victims of any form of violence, including sexual violence and sexual exploitation. It further invited the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider drafting an international convention on the illicit traffic in children which may embody the necessary elements to effectively combat this form of transnational organised crime.<BR>

<P>&quot;The Commission soon ensured a follow-up to this invitation and at its fourth session requested the Secretary-General to initiate the process of requesting views of Member States on the elaboration of such an international convention [...]. An important standard-setting activity is therefore already under way within the United Nations system in this area.<BR>

<P>&quot;It is interesting to note that the Commission further decided to request the Secretary-General to organise a meeting of an expert group on the prevention of the sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes within the context of international travel (sex tourism).&quot;<BR>

<P><B>8.	COMMENTARY</B><BR>

<P>The review of the main international instruments covering commercial sexual exploitation of children reveals that, whilst State obligations to combat the phenomenon are relatively clear, it may be useful to make a certain number of comments and clarifications.<BR>

<P>a)	Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the provision central to the present discussion, firstly provides for protection from &quot;unlawful&quot; sexual activity; in so doing, it deliberately leaves each State to enact legislation determining what kinds of activity are to be outlawed and, where appropriate, until what age. The absence of the word &quot;exploitation&quot; in sub-paragraph (a) of this article reflects the fact that the focus in this case is more especially &quot;abuse&quot;, and in this context the age of consent is clearly of major significance. It would mean that, in a country where age of consent is 16 years, a girl of 17 who is induced (though presumably not &quot;coerced&quot;, to the extent that this involves obtaining consent by force or manipulation) into sexual intercourse will not be the subject of protection under this article, whereas a girl of 15 will be. In other words, this provision derogates, by implication, from the overall definition of a &quot;child&quot; for the purposes of this Convention. Sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), on the other hand, are dealing explicitly with &quot;exploitative use&quot;. If we recall  the 1949 Convention which provides for protection against <I>exploitation </I>through prostitution <I>regardless of whether or not consent has been given</I>, and the 1956 Supplementary Convention which sets a flat age of 18 years, it seems clear that in the cases of these two sub-paragraphs, the general definition of the child holds and the question of consent is of no relevance in determining whether or not exploitation has taken place and whether or not the child concerned is covered by these provisions.<BR>

<P>b)	International law provides no definition of the term &quot;pornography&quot; (the same applies to &quot;prostitution&quot; but the meaning of this term is more generally accepted and is more amenable to the application of objective and factual criteria and verification).<BR>

<P>c)	Pornography has not received the level of attention that international legislators have accorded to protection from prostitution. The amended 1923 Convention covers all obscene or pornographic materials but has been virtually dormant for the past two decades at least. Current national legislation, practice and attitudes towards adult pornography in many countries mean that it is unlikely to receive significant additional support in the foreseeable future. It is in fact surprising that more countries have not followed the example of the Netherlands and denounced it. The explanation perhaps lies in the <I>de facto</I> lack of reference that is made to obligations under the treaty and/or the development of a more restrictive view of what constitutes &quot;obscenity&quot; and could therefore be deemed to be covered by the treaty. Thus, the international legal framework provides only a crude basis for taking initiatives to combat the distribution of child pornography, whether in the form of publications or via new technology.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>PART  II: NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES</B><BR>

<P>
<P><B>Introduction</B><BR>

<P>The international norms which emerge from the Conventions and other international instruments described in Part I of this paper establish the obligations under international law on States parties in relation to the protection of children from commercial sexual exploitation. These obligations then have to be translated into national legislation and into the enforcement mechanisms in each country. Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC), for example, as has been pointed out in Part I, provides for protection from unlawful sexual activity, leaving it to each State to enact legislation determining what kinds of activity are to be outlawed.<BR>

<P>Part II of this paper examines specific national legislative and procedural provisions by which some countries have sought to protect children. Such provisions do not exist in a vacuum, but depend for their efficacy on the capacity and will of the executive and of the law enforcement personnel in each jurisdiction to implement them. This Part will therefore also point to problems of enforcement and some solutions. Finally, commercial sexual exploitation of children is part of a complex web of factors. A major part takes place on the national scene. Increasingly it is flourishing in the context of tourism and trans-border activities. It calls for multidisciplinary solutions and cooperation between agencies at the national and international levels. The nature and effectiveness of such cooperation is, therefore, an important issue of concern and discussion in this paper and for follow-up on the national level of the work at the World Congress.<BR>

<P><B>1.	NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE AND PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS</B><BR>

<P>Domestic legislation protective of children may be found in a wide variety of instruments, such as provisions for health care, social welfare, housing, obscenity laws, guardianship and custody. The CRC now provides, for the first time, a comprehensive set of international legal norms for the protection and well-being of children. Ratifying States may have to initiate new legislation or revise existing legislation to achieve these norms and comply with their obligations. It would appear that the Convention has encouraged States to examine their protective provisions in a more comprehensive manner than before, but their responses towards enforcement of its provisions will inevitably depend on the maturity of their existing domestic provisions vis-&agrave;-vis child care, their own stage of economic development, and the cultural and economic criteria which inform their approach to the care of the nations children.<BR>

<P><B>1.1.	Offences Involving Children</B><BR>

<P>In the Philippines, Republic Act 7610, which came into force in 1992, specifically addresses the Special Protection of Children against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination including Child Prostitution and other Sexual Abuse (Art.III), Child Trafficking (Art.IV) and Obscene Publications and Indecent Shows (Art.V). The Act also requires the formulation, by the Departments of Justice and of Social Welfare and Development, of a comprehensive programme to protect children against commercial sexual exploitation. Regulations under the Act provide for the reporting and investigation of child abuse cases, and for measures to prevent the trafficking of children. What is highly significant about this legislation is that it was originally prepared by a non-governmental group consisting of child protection experts and activists. Through their grass-roots experience, they were able to address the specific problems of Filipino children in the overall context of the governments obligations under the CRC. The Philippine government, having requested non-governmental assistance, and having enacted the legislation, achieved as a result concrete legislative provisions and a national policy for the protection of children against commercial sexual exploitation.<BR>

<P>On the other hand, Brazils Law No. 8069 of 13 July 1990 entitled Statute of the Child and Adolescent, which is intended to provide for the full protection of the child and adolescent, has no specific provisions for addressing the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Rather the Act is like a Charter for children, outlining fundamental rights and duties, with policies for enforcement and guidelines for their implementation. It is a matter for the individual State governments to translate the charter into regulations at local State level.<BR>

<P>In Sri Lanka, ratification of the CRC engendered the formulation of a policy document in 1992 on the rights of children, intended to lead to comprehensive legislation protective of children. A Technical Committee, appointed to consider legislation directed at child abuse, identified certain areas for reform. However, rather than suggesting a separate Act dealing with sexual offences against children, the Committee recommended amendments to the existing Penal Code and to the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, the age of consent was raised from 12 to 16 years, new offences of sexual exploitation of children and of trafficking as well as new offences relating to the use of children in pornography were created. Significantly, here again, the Technical Committee had included non-governmental representatives who had been actively engaged in combatting the sexual exploitation of children in Sri Lanka. Through the amendments to the Penal Code, their concerns have been legislatively addressed in a pragmatic and comprehensive manner.<BR>

<P>In Thailand, the approach to protective legislation has also involved amendments to the Penal Code. There has been a firm governmental commitment since 1993 to eliminate child sexual exploitation. Amendments to the Code at that time provided serious penalties for those who engaged in the sexual abuse of children and updated the laws on pornography. New amendments this year (1996) will mean that while prostitution <I>per se</I> will no longer be a crime in Thailand, soliciting and publicising for the purposes of prostitution will be punishable. Engaging in prostitution with a person under the age of 18 will be punishable if the act takes place in a place of prostitution. However, if the act takes place elsewhere, the age of consent is 15. Boy children continue to lack adequate protection in that rape and unlawful sexual intercourse cannot be committed against male children, by virtue of a judicial interpretation of the provisions of the Code. <BR>

<P>
<P><B>1.2.	Pornography</B><BR>

<P>The relevance of pornography to the protection of children against commercial sexual exploitaton is not always recognised in legislation despite the specific injunction of Act.34(c) of the CRC that States must take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. New technologies being used for the production and transmission of pornography have been so rapid in development, and sometimes so difficult to penetrate, that the law has not been able to keep up with them. The experience of police officers in this area has led the Standing Working Party on Offences Against Minors of INTERPOL (the SWP) to recommend (1995/96) that member countries enact legislation which would make it an offence to produce, distribute or possess child pornography in its present and potential future forms. In January 1995 the Netherlands government passed legislation, amending the Penal Code (Art.240b), and making it an offence to distribute, make, import or possess pornographic material depicting children manifestly under the age of 16; transfer or possession of such material on a data carrier is included in the offence. In July 1994 the Austrian parliament passed an amendment (section 207a) to the Penal Code to outlaw the trade in child pornography and sanction even the possession of such material. Possession of child pornography is also an offence in Canada, in Germany and in the United States. In 1994 the US Penal Code was amended to allow federal authorities to prosecute persons involved in the production overseas of child pornography, if that pornography is intended for importation into the United States. In many countries, however, the penalties for offences relating to child pornography are not severe and do not reflect the fact that such pornography is a manifestation of the sexual exploitation of a minor.<BR>

<P><B>1.3.	Reporting</B><BR>

<P>An issue for national legislatures concerned with child sexual abuse, whether commercial or otherwise, is that of reporting. The Philippine Regulations under Republic Act 7610 encourage the reporting of cases of sexual abuse, and impose mandatory reporting provisions on hospitals, doctors, nurses, teachers and law enforcement officials. In some countries there is a reluctance to impose mandatory reporting duties; experience in the United States showed that a high percentage of cases reported on foot of an imposed duty were unfounded. The SWP, however, has urged the implementation of legislation which would require individuals and specifically professionals and others having the care, custody or control of children to report suspected abuse to the relevant investigative authorities.<BR>

<P><B>1.4.	Extraterritorial Legislation</B><BR>

<P>While domestic legislation on child commercial sexual exploitation is normally directed to the protection of the States own children against abuse by nationals, this type of abuse has international aspects. Sexual exploitation resulting from tourism and foreign visitors, trafficking of young people across borders to supply brothels in other countries, abductions from one country to another, abuses of intercountry adoption, and even the transfer of pornography via computer networks or simply across borders are all issues which involve other jurisdictions. Responses within national legislatures are varied, depending on how the specific problems affect each jurisdiction. Several countries from which large numbers of tourists are believed to travel to exploit children abroad have responded by introducing legislation to give their domestic courts extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of offences committed against children abroad. In New Zealand, the Crimes Amendment Act which came into force in April 1995 makes it an offence for a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident to engage in conduct outside of New Zealand with a child under the age of 16 if such conduct would be an offence in New Zealand. Australias Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act of 1994 specifies (in section 50BA) that a person must not, while outside Australia, engage in sexual intercourse with a person who is under 16. In March 1996 an Australian was convicted under the new legislation of offences committed against children in the Philippines. Extraterritorial jurisdiction for offences committed against children abroad became law in Belgium (April 1995), in France (February 1994) and in Germany (September 1993), all by amendments to each countrys Penal Code. The Australian Act and the French and German amendments enable prosecutions to be taken against nationals of those countries even if the crime alleged is not a crime in the jurisdiction in which it was committed; thus, there is no double criminality requirement - the national legislative provisions will protect foreign children.<BR>

<P>The Penal Codes in the Scandinavian countries already enabled citizens of those countries to be prosecuted at home for crimes committed abroad, without specifying the crimes in detail. Under such provisions, three men were convicted in August 1990 in Norway for sexual abuse of boys in the Philippines and in Thailand, and a Swedish national was convicted in Stockholm in June 1995 for offences committed in Thailand.<BR>

<P>The Penal Code in Japan has extraterritorial effect in relation to certain crimes including sexual crimes with violence against children under the age of 13 or persons unable to resist such an attack.<BR>

<P><B>1.5.	Sex Tourism Legislation</B><BR>

<P>Tourism for the purposes of sex with minors has been dealt with by legislative changes in several countries. In the United States, the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act criminalises domestic or foreign travel with intent to engage in sexual acts with a juvenile. The 1994 Australian legislation creates the offence of benefitting from or encouraging such travel; the 1995 New Zealand legislation makes similar provisions.<BR>

<P>A different approach is offered in the United Kingdom where a Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Bill was referred in February 1996 by Parliament to a Standing Committee for consideration. The proposed legislation would make it an offence to conspire with or to incite a person to commit certain sexual offences abroad.<BR>

<P><B>1.6.	Trafficking or Sale of Children</B><BR>

<P>The issue of child trafficking has been addressed in the Philippines in Republic Act 7610 (Art.IV) by provisions which control foreign travel by children and the adoption of children in return for a consideration, as well as any acts of trading and dealing with children for money. In Thailand, proposed amendments to the Penal Code will penalise guardians who sell children in their care. Selling, buying, transporting of persons under the age of 18 years for the purposes of unlawful sexual gratification will be criminalised by an update to an Act of 1928 (the Trafficking of Women and Girls Act), even if the young person has consented. A feature of the new provisions is that the trafficked person is recognised as a victim and not as an offender. In Sri Lanka, recent amendments to the Penal Code create the offence of trafficking in section 360c in terms very similar to those of the Philippine legislation.<BR>

<P>In the industrialised countries, the issue of trafficking is addressed often in the context of immigration. Intercountry adoptions, intercountry marriages, entry of foreign workers, all may involve trafficking. The Council of Europe has suggested Recommendation R(91)11 of the Committee of Ministers that the activities of artistic, marriage and adoption agencies be supervised, that travel abroad by children be the subject of surveillance by immigration authorities and that young victims of trafficking be assisted and protected. In recent changes to Belgiums Penal Code (April 1995), the traffic in human beings was criminalised. The European Union has responded to the problem of trafficking by expanding the mandate of its Drug Unit (March 1995) to enable that unit to monitor traffic in human beings. The SWP has made several relevant recommendations designed to protect children from being trafficked. These include a recommendation that member countries impose greater supervision and control on intercountry adoptions, and that a data base be established with records of persons and organisations who have been found to be involved in the traffic of children. Reflecting the Council of Europe Recommendation, the SWP also recommends increased surveillance by immigration authorities and assistance to the victims of trafficking.<BR>

<P><B>1.7.	Procedures and the Child Witness</B><BR>

<P>It is generally accepted that there is considerable difficulty in prosecuting cases with an international dimension. Differences in language, legal systems, procedural requirements, and the expense of bringing witnesses from abroad are some of the problems. In the context of legislating to protect children against sexual exploitation by nationals abroad, these difficulties have been relied upon by the British government in refusing to accept a Bill which would give UK courts extraterritorial jurisdiction for offences committed against children abroad. On the other hand, certain governments have adopted creative responses to the difficulties, such as the Australian government. The Australian courts are empowered under the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 to take evidence by video link, and can even administer oaths and affirmations by video link.<BR>

<P>Procedural difficulties are endemic in any case involving sexual exploitation of a child, and not only those with an international dimension. The Children in Trouble: Expert Group Meeting Under the auspices of the UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch in November 1994 in Vienna addressed some of the issues, and particularly in Part V of its report, dealing with the Exploitation of Children, urged that sanctions for sexual exploitation of children be applied against the adults rather than the child victims, and that sexually exploited children be given access to the mechanisms of justice, such as legal aid, safe housing and support services. In Canada, reforms in the criminal law have recognised that children can be just as credible and reliable witnesses as adults; the special needs of child victims/witnesses have also been accommodated in the criminal justice system. Delays in getting a case to trial, the lack of family or institutional support, the age of the child and his or her lack of education may all conspire to undermine the quality of a childs evidence. The provision of a guardian <I>ad litem</I> for a child witness could ease the burden on the child and protect his or her interests. In the Philippines, under the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse cases, a guardian <I>ad litem</I> must be appointed by the court as soon as a complaint of child abuse has been filed. <BR>

<P>Some interesting changes are envisaged in the Thai Criminal Procedure Code which would ease the burden on the child of giving evidence. The proposed changes include the video-taping of a childs statement to police officers and the use of that video as evidence in court. Cross-examination  of the child on the contents of the video will only be allowed through a psychiatrist. Provision is also proposed for pre-trial depositions by victims who may be vulnerable to delays in the proceedings, such as street children. Once the deposition has been taken, and the alleged offender has had an opportunity to confront the witness, the deposition can be used in court. The problems of undue influence on the child and of detaining the child until the trial may thus be avoided.<BR>

<P>The Evidence Act in New Zealand was amended in 1989 to provide some flexibility to judges in the taking of evidence in child sex abuse cases. The judge can take the advice of relevant qualified persons as to the effect on the child of giving evidence, and can direct the admission of video-tape evidence, or the giving of evidence by closed-circuit television. Other jurisdictions have similar provisions; it appears to be generally accepted that child witnesses need to be protected from the trauma of court proceedings and of confronting their abuser. Where the abused child is a street child or a trafficked child, the proof of his or her age can be a problem. The Australian Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Act 1994 makes provision for alternative methods of proving the age of a person under the age of 16, such as by appearance or from medical opinion.<BR>

<P><B>1.8.	Rights of the Accused</B><BR>

<P>There are difficulties in reconciling the rights of the accused with the rights of the child to protection. In relation to bail, for example, it has been seen that child exploiters arrested in a foreign jurisdiction are very likely to jump bail; yet to refuse them bail would be to infringe their basic right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. Either the offence has to be categorised as serious enough to automatically deprive the accused of bail, or the prosecution has to oppose bail on the grounds that the accused is foreign and therefore very likely to leave the jurisdiction. In relation to proof of an offence, and given the difficulty of actually finding a criminal in the very act of abusing a child, there appears to be merit in shifting the burden of proof when the protection of a child is at issue, and in so framing the laws that the onus is on the accused to justify his being in the company of a child who is not a relative. Thus in the Philippines, under the provisions of Republic Act 7610, merely to be found alone with a child who is not a relative inside a hotel or vehicle or other place constitutes an attempt to commit prostitution, and an offence under Article III, section 6. Under section 5(a), the mere verbal offer of a child for the purposes of prostitution constitutes the offence of sexual abuse. <BR>

<P>
<P><B>2.	ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENTION ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL</B><BR>

<P>Legislation and procedural measures are not enough in themselves to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation. The laws must be enforced. The principal agencies for their enforcement will be the police and immigration officials, and the prosecution and judicial authorities. How effectively these authorities function will depend not only on the resources made available to them, but also on the extent to which the society in which they carry out their duties regards the protection of children as important. Why is it, for example, that many child exploiters will travel to another country and feel themselves immune from prosecution for acts which they would be afraid to commit in their own jurisdictions? Why is it that in some societies there is a high level of tolerance of adults securing sexual gratification from children? Why is it that in some countries the police seem not even to know that there are laws against sexual exploitation of children, or do not know what those laws say? In some countries, children are available to be exploited by foreigners because they are already abused on a massive scale by their own nationals. If society does not place a high value on the nations children and demand that the law is enforced in their interests, then public officials will not be effective.<BR>

<P>There follow a number of suggestions arising from the experiences in various countries of enforcing the law to protect children from sexual exploitation which point to ways in which enforcement could be improved.<BR>

<P><B>2.1.	Central Authority</B><BR>

<P>In the Philippines there is an inter-agency Task Force against Child Abuse under the Department of Justice with responsibility for the prosecution of child abuse cases. As a result, there have been a number of successful prosecutions, and this has in turn increased public confidence in the office and has increased the level of reporting. In Thailand, a Child Rights Protection Division has been established within the office of the Attorney General to monitor child sexual abuse cases.<BR>

<P><B>2.2.	Special Child Care Units in the Police Force</B><BR>

<P>In the United Kingdom, a special Paedophile Unit at New Scotland Yard tracks down offenders against children. It has a mandate to be proactive for the protection of children, and therefore has a considerable amount of flexibility in finding ways to prevent abuse, rather than only reacting to actual complaints. Unfortunately, it is the only unit for the entire country.<BR>

<P>In this context, it can be noted that the Beijing Rules UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. General Assembly Resolution 40/33 of 29 November 1985. recommend specialisation within national police forces of police officers who frequently or exclusively deal with juveniles, and that the Economic and Social Council requested the Secretary General of the United Nations (Res.1989/66) in May 1989 to ensure effective programme interlinkages within the United Nations system between juvenile justice, within the framework of the Beijing Rules, and situations of social risk, especially.....child abuse, child sale and trafficking, child prostitution and street children. <BR>

<P><B>2.3.	Status, Training and Resources of Police Authorities</B><BR>

<P>In many countries the laws cannot be effectively enforced because the police forces are corrupt. The reasons for this may be partly to do with a society which places a low value on respect for the law, but they are also to do with poor pay, poor working conditions and promotional structures which are not based on merit or ability. In Sri Lanka, the emphasis by the government on economic development through tourism is said to have made the police reluctant to implement the laws against child abusers in case this would have a negative impact on  the countrys economy and thus weaken their chances of promotion. In the Philippines, child abusers have escaped from police custody in circumstances which indicate that bribery of police officials had occurred. There are many such reports about many countries. Sexual offences against children must be treated as serious crimes, and police officers must be recognised and rewarded for detection of such crimes in the same manner as they would be for the detection of any other serious crimes.<BR>

<P>Adequate training of police and prosecuting officers is essential for the handling of child sexual abuse cases. Some industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand have given overseas aid to developing countries in the form of training for police officers. <BR>

<P>Finally, the police must be adequately resourced in terms of manpower, equipment and back-up services to enable them to do their job properly. They will not be encouraged to rescue children from brothels if they have nowhere to bring them or no means to return them to their families; they cannot track down exploiters unless they have adequate means of transport and communication.<BR>

<P><B>2.4.	Missing Children Registries</B><BR>

<P>Missing children may not always be identified as the possible victims of sexual exploitation. The role of the police forces has been to find such children and restore them to their families. However, it is now being recognised that such children may have been running away from abuse or exploitation, and that they should not be returned without some investigation of the reasons for their disappearance. The SWP has recommended the establishment of specialised centres in every country where such children may be de-briefed and cared for before the question of return to their families is settled. The SWP has also recommended that children missing for more than 6 months should be made the subject of international Missing Persons Notices at INTERPOL headquarters.<BR>

<P><B>2.5.	Customs Surveillance</B><BR>

<P>The valuable role which the Customs Services can provide in detecting and preventing child exploitation is gaining recognition. In cases in which the customs services have worked with the police in following up on a seizure of illegally imported pornographic material, important finds have been made, even leading to the cracking of whole paedophile networks. In New Zealand, a Customs Child Pornography Project was established in 1992. The work of the Project involves the interception of child pornography or other child exploiter-related intelligence in the process of normal customs surveillance, and then followng up on those interceptions in cooperation with the police. The US Customs Service has a Child Pornography and Protection Unit which has been operating effectively for many years. The Paedophile Unit in the UK police force works in close coperation with the customs authorities.<BR>

<P><B>2.6.	Telephone Help Lines </B><BR>

<P>Telephone Help Lines for children are increasingly recognised as a valuable way in which children can seek help against sexual abuse and exploitation. The SWP has recommended that all member countries institute such Help Lines.<BR>

<P><B>2.7.	Interdisciplinary Approach to Law Enforcement</B><BR>

<P>It is not unusual for several government agencies to become involved with an exploited or abused child. Police, social welfare, education and health authorities may all have a responsibility, and liaison between them would occur. In Britain, liaison between such bodies is mandatory. What is not the norm, however, is cooperation between official bodies and NGOs. Thailand is experimenting with such cooperation through its Child Rights Division in the Attorney Generals office, which has developed a network that includes non-governmental representatives. In Canada, provincial/territorial governments, police and non-governmental organisations have been working on improving the sharing of information between the authorities and NGOs in relation to child sexual abuse. (This was particularly aimed at enabling NGOs, and other employers who hire people to care for children, to screen out known sex offenders.)<BR>

<P>Experience has shown that state authorities have neither the resources nor the time to monitor situations in which there may be sexual exploitation of children. While they should in no way replace the national law enforcement authorities, child-care NGOs are uniquely capable not only of caring for abused children, but also of detecting abuse and of gathering evidence on which an offence may be successfully prosecuted. Several successful prosecutions in the Philippines and in Thailand have been based on evidence gathered or detected by NGOs. Unfortunately, in most cases, the financial resources of NGOs caring for sexually abused and exploited children are woefully inadequate.<BR>

<P>The UN Expert Group Meeting developed a series of recommendations to combat the use of children for criminal activities and the exploitation of children which went beyond law enforcement. Among these recommendations are suggestions for engaging the mass media in awareness-raising activities, the development of educational programmes and multi-disciplinary training programmes, the development of community watch programmes, and the engagement of the tourist industry and the business sector in protecting the rights of children. In Australia and New Zealand, the tourist industry has participated in the distribution of information leaflets which warn travellers that sexual exploitation of children abroad is a serious offence. <BR>

<P><B>3.	PUNISHMENT AND DETERRENCE</B><BR>

<P>The penalties for child sexual abuse and exploitation are quite severe in most countries. In cases involving extraterritorial jurisdiction there is a question of whether the crimes should be classified as minor, thereby making them more susceptible to being successfully prosecuted, or as serious, thereby making them more susceptible to the imposition of a heavy penalty. In France, in February 1994, extraterritorial jurisdiction was extended to the offence of engaging in sexual conduct with a person under the age of 15 by an amendment to the French Penal Code; it is the only offence which can be tried as a misdemeanour under Frances extraterritorial jurisdiction. As a misdemeanour, successful prosecution is likely to be easier than for an act classified as a serious offence. <BR>

<P>On the other hand, there is a risk that offences against foreign children will be seen as less serious than the same offences committed against nationals if the penalties are less severe for a crime committed abroad. In Norway, three men convicted in 1990 of offences committed against foreign children received custodial sentences; the Supreme Court of Norway rejected a defence argument that the punishment should be less severe than it would be for crimes against Norwegian children. In Sweden in 1995, a man received a custodial sentence of 3 months and had to pay compensation to the foreign child he had abused; it has been suggested in relation to that case that the penalty would have been greater if the abused child had been Swedish. In the same year, in Thailand, a British Guyana citizen was sentenced to a total of 50 years in prison for offences committed against 5 Thai boys. <BR>

<P>The degree of injury to the child would normally be a consideration for any court which prepares to sentence a convicted offender. But does a court have to be actually presented with evidence of physical or psychological injury - a requirement with which it would be difficult to comply if the child is a foreigner? Should there instead be a judicial presumption that all sexual exploitation of a child is damaging to the child? If the abuse has resulted in a child being infected with the HIV or AIDS virus, should this be an additional aggravating circumstance justifying increased penalties? The payment of financial compensation to a child victim has the positive advantage of permitting the child a fresh start in life, particularly if the child has been driven by poverty into prostitution.<BR>

<P>There is a serious problem of recidivism particularly in relation to offenders who could be classified as paedophiles (i.e. persons for whom children are the preferred sexual partner). When discussing penalties for such offenders, the question arises as to whether penalties on them should continue after the service of their sentence and/or the payment of their fines. The SWP has recommended that countries consider whether persons who have been convicted of sexual offences against minors should be subjected to registration and restriction of their activities if the latter place them in contact with children. It is a matter of concern that paedophile abusers will often insert themselves in employment or social situations which allow them to have access to children.  In Canada, amendments to the Criminal Code (section 161) in August 1993 enable a court to impose a prohibition order on a convicted sex offender which will prohibit him from attending places where children congregate, or from seeking employment which involves being in a position of trust or authority towards children.<BR>

<P>Indeed, paedophiles have even been known to establish their own child care organisations as a front for their unlawful activities. It is therefore important that institutions which care for children should themselves require to be registered and supervised by a competent authority. Furthermore, it has been suggested that persons applying for positions of employment in institutions which are responsible for the care of children should be required to produce a clean police record as part of their job application. Volunteers for work with child-care agencies in developing countries should be required to produce references which can be checked with domestic agencies in their countries of origin. <BR>

<P><B>4.	ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENTION THROUGH INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION</B><BR>

<P>Given the international dimensions of sexual exploitation of children in todays world, cooperation between governmental law enforcement agencies and cooperation through the inter-governmental police agency INTERPOL, is vitally important. Such cooperation should develop simplified procedures so that the problems of language and differing legal systems can be minimised.<BR>

<P><B>4.1.	Information Sharing via INTERPOL and Bilateral Contacts</B><BR>

<P>INTERPOL already maintains a database of criminals, and the SWP has recommended increased and improved sharing of information for the database in respect of individuals and organisations involved in the traffic of children, child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P>The extent to which extraterritorial legislation is being extended to cover sexual offences against children committed in another country has been detailed above. Its effective application  requires cooperation between prosecuting authorities in relation to the gathering and presentation of evidence.<BR>

<P>Bilateral contacts between police forces and customs authorities have already proved effective in identifying paedophile networks with worldwide connections.<BR>

<P><B>4.2.	Mutual Assistance Treaties</B><BR>

<P>Mutual assistance treaties are a vehicle for more formal methods of communication. By reducing into the form of a written agreement the rules which will be observed for such things as the taking of statements from witnesses, the provision of records and other evidence, the service of documents etc., the evidential quality of the material is assured, and the delays inherent in diplomatic channels of communication are avoided. The UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch has drafted a Model Treaty on Mutual Assistance which was adopted by the General Asembly in December 1990 GA 45/117  and is available as a resource to all states. National laws can also provide unilaterally for the conditions under which mutual assistance will be extended to other states in criminal matters. Thai Law BE2535 entitled The Act on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters sets out the conditions under which assistance may be extended to requesting states, even without a treaty.<BR>

<P><B>4.3.	Extradition</B><BR>

<P>Extradition is another vehicle for international cooperation in criminal matters. Some countries would prefer to extradite a child exploiter back to the country in which the offence was committed. It is generally believed that a treaty is necessary betwen two countries before a national of one can be extradited to the other. However, this is not the case for many European states which have national laws determining the conditions under which nationals will be extradited to face charges in another State. A Model Treaty on Extradition, again drafted by the UN Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch and also adopted by the General Assembly in December 1990 GA 45/116, is available as a resource to all States. In Germany, extradition to States with which there is no bilateral extradition treaty is streamlined by the use of agreements which require only a fraction of the input necessary in the negotiation of a treaty. For each individual case it is then only necessary to refer to the terms of the agreed arrangements.<BR>

<P><B>4.4.	Police Liaison Officers</B><BR>

<P>A cooperative method of preventing or assisting in the detection of crimes of sexual exploitation of children is the placement by States of Police Liaison Officers in countries to which their nationals travel in large numbers. Liaison officers have been used in the fight against drug trafficking for some time, and there is a strong demand from the non-governmental sector that such officers be placed for the purposes of combatting child sexual exploitation. There is a view that officers placed to combat child sexual exploitation must be specialised for that field of enquiry, and should not be also combatting the drugs trade or other serious crime. The UK National Crime Intelligence Service (NCIS) has suggested that Crime Liaison Officers be placed in certain countries, available for all criminal investigations. The SWP has, however, recommended the posting of specialised officers. <BR>

<P><B>4.5.	Development Aid</B><BR>

<P>International cooperation via development aid to promote child protection has also already been mentioned. Such assistance, if used for training, can have long-term effects on the capacity and understanding of law enforcement officials in combatting sexual crimes against children.<BR>

<P><B>5.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>It must be realised that the legal environment reflects the political environment, and that unless a State and its society give priority to the protection of children, the laws will not protect them. The will to protect children must first be there.<BR>

<P>This Paper has attempted to identify the legal norms which have set the standards to be observed, and to look in a general way at the responses from national legislatures, also taking into account the enforcement and implementation mechanisms which are available.<BR>

<P>It is hoped that States, in formulating their own national plans, will be able to draw on the experiences outlined in this paper and find solutions in the interests of their own and the worlds children.<BR>

<P><B>In order to foster the most effective implementation of the CRC in this sphere, the following proposals are made:</B><BR>

<P>It is suggested that the reporting obligations in Article 44 of the CRC be used by States, not just to fulfill their legal obligations under the Convention, but as an opportunity for a thorough analysis and review of their national legislative provisions for the protection of children. This work should be done with the active participation of non-governmental organisations who are involved in the care of children, as well as with those departments of state which have responsibilities affecting children, and those that ensure compliance with international treaty obligations. Through such an interdisciplinary review, legislative gaps in child protection could be identified. A national plan could then be prepared to address in a comprehensive way, through legislation, the needs of children in each State. <BR>

<P>Secondly, it is suggested that a Task Group, again including NGOs as well as law enforcement personnel and child care authorities, be established in each State to identify or propose effective mechanisms within the jurisdiction to monitor and combat sexual exploitation of children. Monitoring of children at risk, care of abused children, evidence-gathering against child abusers, protection of child witnesses - all these are tasks for which mechanisms must be devised to respond to local problems and local needs. <BR>

<P>Finally, it is suggested that in each State, an Ombudsman for children, or an institution or body fulfilling similar functions, be appointed with responsibility not only to receive and deal with complaints from children, but also to advise the government on problems affecting children in general within the jurisdiction and to recommend solutions.<BR>

<P>These are some ways by which a practical start could be made in securing better implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<BR>

<P><H2>Prime time for children: media, ethics and reporting of commercial sexual exploitation of children</H2><BR>

<H4><B>This paper was prepared as a working document for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children  by Aidan White and Kate Holman, International Federation of Journalists, for UNICEF</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Introduction</B><BR>

<P><I>Children aren't considered &quot;hot topics&quot; for the media,  not unless children figure in</I><BR>
<I>a scandalous or heart-rending story or in some shocking data or statistics.</I><BR>

<P>This conclusion by media and child experts in the United States holds as true today<BR>
as ever. If child abuse and exploitation have figured prominently in the mainstream<BR>
media in recent years, it has invariably been in the context of horrifying evidence from<BR>
court proceedings, or better still, the involvement of some well-known (adult) public<BR>
figure. American researchers have found that although children under 10 made up<BR>
almost 20% of the US population, they represented only one in every 60 characters<BR>
on prime time TV. Children's voices are not heard - especially not by the rest of the<BR>
community. But then<I> the world of television is not like the real world. Its demography</I><BR>
<I>reflects its purposes: to produce audiences for advertisers. Looking at it through the</I><BR>
<I>prism of age reveals a population curve that, unlike the real world, but much like the</I><BR>
<I>curve of consumer spending, bulges in the middle years of life. That makes children</I><BR>
<I>and the elderly relatively neglected.</I><BR>

<P>   This analysis of the impact of the free-market is one aspect of prevailing<BR>
currents of control of media and information sources. Another is the tendency of some<BR>
governments and state authorities to manipulate information, usually through tight state<BR>
controls of broadcasting media, to meet political imperatives which often do not reflect<BR>
the considered needs and rights of abused sections of the population.  <BR>

<P>   It is in this context that media coverage of the commercial sexual exploitation<BR>
of children, like the other aspects of children's lives, takes place. The media industry<BR>
is either a commercial undertaking which exists to produce profit, never more so than<BR>
today with the growth in media outlets, achieved through new technology, bringing<BR>
ruthless competition for limited markets, or it may be subject to political and state<BR>
controls. In either case, journalists and media workers struggle to maintain a<BR>
professional centre of gravity. In reality, it is futile for them to ignore the economic<BR>
and political conditions in which they work.<BR>

<P>   Yet media are, unarguably, a major influence on cultural development<BR>
throughout the world; with a responsibility, many believe, particularly in sectors like<BR>
public broadcasting, to inform and to educate. The challenge facing media<BR>
professionals, whether they own newspapers or broadcast media or whether they are<BR>
employed to gather, edit and disseminate information, is to define rules and<BR>
regulations by which they work and to articulate principles of performance which are<BR>
transparent and can be tested in a public manner. <BR>

<P>   But how? The question, as this paper tries to consider, requires serious<BR>
examination of the way media work, of how existing principles of accountability<BR>
apply, and how media must be freed from reins of political and economic control<BR>
which limit professionalism and undermine ethical standards.  <BR>
   The medias role in the evolution of  commercial sexual exploitation is<BR>
complex. On the one hand, they tell the stories of abused and abuser, through news<BR>
reports, photographs, documentaries, and drama. But on the other, they can<BR>
themselves become the exploiter, for instance by creating sexually provocative images<BR>
of children in news or advertising, or, at worst, as the vehicle for child pornography,<BR>
or sources of information for paedophile networks and sexual tourism. <BR>

<P>   Furthermore, the way the media portray children has a profound impact on<BR>
society's attitude to children and childhood, which also affects the way adults behave.<BR>
Even the images children themselves see, especially of sex and violence, influence<BR>
their expectation of their role in life.<BR>

<P>   This paper does not seek to provide easy answers to complex and difficult<BR>
issues nor to ethical dilemmas. But there are standards to be set and guidelines which<BR>
media can adopt themselves in addressing the need for a public information policy<BR>
which provides people with extensive, reliable and ethical reportage about the way<BR>
children are treated in society. Some suggestions are made in this direction throughout<BR>
this report and in its conclusions.<BR>

<P>   Finally, although there is much that can be improved in media performance, the<BR>
conclusions are not only intended to make media more accountable and journalists<BR>
more responsive to systems of complaint and public scrutiny. It is also a question of<BR>
encouraging debate within media about the portrayal of children and their exploitation.<BR>
This is an issue which defines the good health of a just and decent society and is,<BR>
therefore, a matter of profound professional concern for all who work in media. <BR>

<P><B>1. Media, Children and International Law</B><BR>
The international legislative and regulatory framework relevant to the role of media<BR>
and the  commercial sexual exploitation of children is ample, but not specific. These<BR>
clauses do not constitute an exhaustive list, but offer some important pointers on the<BR>
role and responsibility of journalists, and the media in general. For example:<BR>

<P>   <B>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</B> (1989) enshrines<BR>
childrens right to freedom of expression (Article 13); to protection of privacy and<BR>
against attacks on his/her<I> honour and reputation</I> (Article 16); and also calls on the<BR>
mass media <I>to disseminate information and material of social and cultural benefit to</I><BR>
<I>the child </I>(Article 17). Articles 34 and 36 commit governments to protecting children<BR>
from all forms of exploitation, including pornography.<BR>

<P>   <B>The European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights</B> (1996) also<BR>
emphasises children's right to express their own views in decisions affecting them, and<BR>
calls on national bodies to provide information on childrens rights to the media.<BR>

<P>   <B>The Council of Europe Recommendation 1286 on a European Strategy for</B><BR>
<B>Children</B> (1996) introduces the call for a change in the way children are viewed in<BR>
society. The media should <I>promote children's right to a healthy and balanced</I><BR>
<I>development </I>, and all professionals who come into contact with children should have<BR>
special training on children's rights (Article 8). <BR>

<P><I>   The publicising of children's rights is a first step to increase public awareness</I><BR>
<I>and promote change in the traditional view of the child</I>, declared the Council of<BR>
Europes Parliamentary Assembly. It highlighted the negative effects of the media<BR>
on children, and  wanted to see more controls over new information and<BR>
communications technologies.<BR>

<P>   <B>The Council of Europe's Recommendation No.R (91)11, concerning Sexual</B><BR>
<B>Exploitation, Pornography and Prostitution of, and trafficking in, Children and</B><BR>
<B>Young Adults</B>, is an important one. It highlights the medias role in reporting this<BR>
issue by inviting them <I>to contribute to a general awareness of the subject and to adopt</I><BR>
<I>appropriate rules of conduct</I>. It also warns against the abuse of childrens images and<BR>
voices in an erotic context. On the matter of law, it judges that while the public should<BR>
be informed about the conviction of child pornographers, the identity of victims and<BR>
alleged offenders should be protected. And it demands an end to publicity for sex<BR>
tourism.<BR>

<P><B>   The Council of Europe Recommendation No.R (85)11 on the Position of the</B><BR>
<B>Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure</B> draws attention to the<BR>
interests of the victim, and the need to protect him/her<I> from any publicity which will</I><BR>
<I>unduly affect his (sic) private life or dignity</I>. And<B> Recommendations No.R (92) 19</B><BR>
<B>and No.R (89) 7</B> focus, inter alia,  on the use of new information technologies for the<BR>
distribution of pornography.<BR>

<P>   European Union legislation also refers to the issue in its 1989 <B>Television</B><BR>
<B>without Frontiers</B> Directive, (Article 22) which bans programmes which might<BR>
<I>seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular</I><BR>
<I>those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence.</I>  Yet it provides a get-out for<BR>
broadcasters who select broadcast times or use technical measures to ensure that<BR>
minors would not normally have access to the programmes. <BR>

<P><B>2. Raising Awareness or Sensationalising: A Two-Edged Media Knife</B><BR>
The important role which media can play in raising public awareness of the abuse of<BR>
children and in combatting all forms of criminal and sexual exploitation is well<BR>
understood. But the issue is not as clear cut as many would like; media coverage can<BR>
shine the spotlight on those directly responsible, but the victims all too often are also<BR>
caught in the glare of publicity.<BR>

<P>   In the report of the Council of Europe's Committee on Crime Problems, the<BR>
experts emphasised <I>the responsibility of the media and their potential contribution to</I><BR>
<I>any policy aimed at preventing the sexual exploitation of children and young adults.</I><BR>
<I>The term media denotes here any means of expression transmitting a message for</I><BR>
<I>individuals or groups. In its broad sense therefore, the term covers means used for</I><BR>
<I>conveying information, such as the printed press, books, radio, television, videograms</I><BR>
<I>and advertisements; it also includes the 'producers' who use such media (publishing</I><BR>
<I>firms, radio and television companies and advertising agencies etc).</I><BR>

<P>   The Committee of experts warned:<BR>
   <I>Often the mass media function as a two-edged knife in this area of concern. The</I><BR>
<I>   unravelling of sensational sex and crime cases involving children and young</I><BR>
<I>   adults tends to overemphasise the issue and to blur the picture. Sometimes,</I><BR>
<I>   though, it is the media which help to uncover cases of sexual exploitation and</I><BR>
<I>   to raise awareness of the problem. </I><BR>
<I>   But it is also the media that generally infiltrate the public with liberal and</I><BR>
<I>   tolerant attitudes towards child pornography and prostitution or provide the</I><BR>
<I>   ways and means (for example advertisements) by which this sex gratification</I><BR>
<I>   may be achieved. Therefore, their co-operation and their orientation towards</I><BR>
<I>   safeguarding the rights and the dignity of children and young adults is</I><BR>
<I>   extremely important.</I><BR>

<P>   In February 1996, the<B><I> Guardian</I></B> newspaper printed a two-page article by the<BR>
award-winning reporter Maggie O'Kane. It described the life, and death, of girl<BR>
prostitutes on the streets of Bradford, in England. It was a sensitive, perhaps overly-<BR>
emotive, yet gripping piece of writing; accompanied by a useful set of proposals for<BR>
supporting the 'street kids'. Next to it, was a sizeable photograph of an anonymous<BR>
13-year-old prostitute, with her shirt open to her waist.<BR>

<P>   This was the angle which alarmed Eva Aurland, Youth Coordinator of the<BR>
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which has launched a major<BR>
campaign against child labour. She condemns the picture as sensationalist and<BR>
unnecessary. Her view is shared by Rachel O'Brien of the Children's Society in the<BR>
UK, which helped with O'Kane's investigation. Child abuse victims in homes would<BR>
not be photographed, their identity would be protected, she argues. Yet once on the<BR>
streets, although they are -- in the law's eyes -- suffering assault every day, they are<BR>
'fair game'.<BR>

<P>   It cannot be denied that the media play a crucial role in bringing the horrors of<BR>
child exploitation into the public arena, and can be extremely influential. American<BR>
research reveals that 72% of the public obtained knowledge of child abuse from<BR>
newspapers, 56% from radio and TV. In 1992, a Swiss journalist arranged a child<BR>
sex-tour through a travel agent. He wrote such a devastating account of the agent's<BR>
operation, that the subsequent public outcry forced the agent out of business.  At the<BR>
same time, media coverage of prosecutions under laws against sex tourism, now in<BR>
operation in at least 12 countries, also helps to warn off men who might be tempted<BR>
by the idea. <BR>

<P>   There can be dangers in saturating the public with too much exposure of the<BR>
issue, thereby creating acceptance and indifference. Many observers have warned of<BR>
the public's &quot;famine fatigue&quot; when exposed to persistent, harrowing images in<BR>
television coverage of recent disasters in Africa. The same problem may arise if<BR>
coverage of children remains singular in its focus on the plight of the victim or the<BR>
salacious nature of the offences involved. <BR>

<P>Media researcher Nancy Signorielli sees two sides to sensationalism:<BR>
   <I>Although child advocates may argue that sensational coverage distorts and</I><BR>
<I>   exploits a serious problem - perhaps doing more harm than good -</I><BR>
<I>   sensationalism solves several editorial problems; that is, it can be the response</I><BR>
<I>   of reporters and editors trying to fulfil the responsibility to cover serious social</I><BR>
<I>   issues, while continuing to turn a profit. Sensationalism permits an important</I><BR>
<I>   but unpleasant topic to be covered in such a way that it still captures the</I><BR>
<I>   readers' attention - and sells magazines.</I><BR>

<P>   Eva Aurland would like to see the media place more emphasis on the role of<BR>
the police, politicians, and other authorities in protecting the children, rather than the<BR>
children themselves. Her colleague at the ICFTU Elsa Ramos agrees, urging more<BR>
analysis of the social causes: the pimps, the drug culture, the parents in poverty who<BR>
are proud to have sold their daughters for a sum which will enable them to support<BR>
the rest of the family. <I>'Media should not be so shy about putting the blame on the</I><BR>
<I>individuals responsible for the exploitation, and the governments who condone it,</I><BR>
she says. For example, newspapers which uncovered the activities of a Bolivian lawyer<BR>
who, they alleged,  paid kidnappers US$40 for a boy whom he sold to a Belgian<BR>
couple for US$10,000. <BR>

<P>   But media organisations must invest more time and effort into investigating such<BR>
stories, if they want to avoid falling foul of defamation laws. It is  easier to interview<BR>
the children, who are hardly likely to sue. In a time of down-sizing and falling<BR>
editorial expenditure on training and investigative journalism generally, the outlook<BR>
for more in-depth media coverage is bleak.<BR>

<P>   Nevertheless, media need to broaden the scope of reportage. The story of child<BR>
sexual exploitation in general and its commercial aspects in particular is not being told<BR>
in full. To examine how this can change requires a look at the professional freedoms<BR>
which journalists require to work effectively, a summary of the principles or<BR>
guidelines journalists and programme-makers should follow, and the pressures -- legal,<BR>
financial, or cultural -- which are standing in the way.<BR>

<P><B>3.Setting Standards For Media</B><BR>
The work of journalists, broadcasters, and media organisations is regulated at four<BR>
different levels:<BR>

<P>1. <B>Codes of Conduct</B>: Most journalists usually have their own professional code<BR>
   of ethics, formulated by trade unions or professional associations. Usually a<BR>
   form of self-regulation;<BR>
2.<B> Guidelines</B>: Media organisations themselves, especially in the public service<BR>
   broadcasting sector, may draw up guidelines for professional conduct. Usually<BR>
   a form of self-regulation;<BR>
3. <B>Structures for Regulation</B>: certain regulatory bodies, such as press councils,<BR>
   may be established each with different powers and responsibilities and which<BR>
   may, or may not, have the force of law to support them;<BR>
4.<B> Legislation</B>: the law may be used to underpin notions of professional journalism<BR>
   and the systems set out above. The law may also support structures for<BR>
   licensing journalists and regulations providing penalties for breach of ethical<BR>
   conduct.<BR>

<P>   Legislation circumscribing the media and commercial sexual exploitation of<BR>
children includes laws for the protection of children, such as the withholding of<BR>
information identifying children in court cases, in care, or as victims; laws to protect<BR>
children from moral corruption; laws restricting pornography; and general laws on<BR>
freedom of expression. <BR>

<P>   The Canadian Criminal Code, for instance, makes it an offence to publish<BR>
anything that depicts a child performing a sexual act or assuming a sexually suggestive<BR>
pose while in a state of undress. In Norwegian law, on the other hand, there is no<BR>
general protection of public morals, except for a ban on pornographic material.<BR>

<P>   With regard to codes of professional conduct, we have found no journalists'<BR>
organisation which offers a specific code of good practice for covering the commercial<BR>
sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P>   It must be said that although journalists are conscious of a values-related system<BR>
in which news and information is reported, many of them are ignorant of the form and<BR>
exact content of the codes of conduct to which they work. There are no clearly<BR>
established international standards, although the<B> IFJ's International Code of</B><BR>
<B>Principles on the Conduct of Journalism</B>, agreed in 1954 and now under review,<BR>
contains the key elements of a journalist's ethical responsibility. Any code will reflect<BR>
standards of journalism according to understood values within society. It will also deal<BR>
with questions of enforcement and disclosure, often accepting that openness enhances<BR>
accountability, credibility and, ultimately, freedom.<BR>

<P>   Inevitably, the role of codes of ethics in journalism, which begin with sweeping<BR>
generalities, becomes important when resolving the ethical dilemmas which will arise<BR>
in particular cases of reporting. In the area of reporting on children and commercial<BR>
sexual exploitation, there are four closely-allied ethical dilemmas surrounding<BR>
professional conduct and investigation of the subject: <BR>

<P>           Confidentiality  of sources;<BR>
           Undercover journalism and use of subterfuge to obtain<BR>
            information;<BR>
          Co-operating with, and making information available to law<BR>
            enforcement agencies; and intervening in events under<BR>
            observation;<BR>
           Identification of individuals.<BR>

<P><B>a) Confidentiality of Sources</B><BR>
   The right to safeguard the anonymity of sources of information is crucial to the<BR>
journalist's ability to investigate. In Sweden and other Nordic countries, this right is<BR>
enshrined in law. An Act passed in 1993 in France laid down that:<BR>

<P><I>   Any journalist who appears as a witness concerning information gathered by</I><BR>
<I>   him in the course of his journalistic activity is free not to disclose its source.</I><BR>

<P>   The law also controls searches of media premises, which must not obstruct<BR>
journalists in their work. However, in most countries journalists have to fight to<BR>
defend this right, often risking fines or imprisonment in the process. The Canadian<BR>
Broadcasting Corporation in its Journalistic Standards and Practices, for instance,<BR>
upholds the principle of freedom of information and considers the protection of a<BR>
journalist's sources to be an important element of this principle, but it reminds<BR>
journalists that 'protection of sources is not a legal right'. CBC says it will not advise<BR>
employees to defy a court order, but will provide legal counsel.<BR>

<P>   Lars Bruun, in his review of ethical codes, found that 42 journalists'<BR>
organisations around the world made mention of professional secrecy. For instance<BR>
the Nigerian Union of Journalists' Code of Conduct reads:<I> It is against the ethics of</I><BR>
<I>the profession to divulge information received in confidence, no matter what the</I><BR>
<I>consequences.</I><BR>

<P>   This principle was given backing in law in 1981, when the High Court of Lagos<BR>
State ruled that the Senate of the National Assembly had exceeded its authority in<BR>
summoning a journalist to disclose the confidential sources of an article. Often, the<BR>
court's decision as to whether a journalist may legally withhold the identity of sources<BR>
depends on the circumstances surrounding the case. In Japan, for instance, the<BR>
Sapporo District Court interpreted the Code of Civil Procedure as allowing journalists<BR>
to treat sources as 'an occupational secret', unless the information was required to<BR>
ensure a fair trial:<BR>

<P><I>   A journalist alleged that parents were complaining about child abuse in a local</I><BR>
<I>   nursery school. The owner of the school sued the journalist for erroneous and</I><BR>
<I>   defamatory reporting. Under questioning, the journalist refused to identify his</I><BR>
<I>   sources. The courts upheld his privilege on the ground that, when a fair trial</I><BR>
<I>   is not at issue, compelling disclosure of confidential sources would improperly</I><BR>
<I>   impair the reporter's pursuit of his profession.</I><BR>

<P>   Journalists recognise that betraying sources not only inhibits their own ability<BR>
to investigate; it also makes it more difficult for every journalist to work, and may<BR>
even put their lives at risk, as well as the safety of the informants. The exploitation<BR>
of children is such a sensitive issue that many abuses would never be revealed unless<BR>
the people who provide the information: children, prostitutes, carers, and many others,<BR>
could be confident that their anonymity would be preserved. Strengthening the<BR>
journalist's rights in this area should be an element in any strategy aimed at creating<BR>
the best professional conditions in which to examine the process of commercial sexual<BR>
exploitation of children. <BR>

<P><B>b) Undercover Journalism</B><BR>
Ethics codes are useful and they work most of the time. But sometimes genuine<BR>
conflicts arise between values, and ethical decision-making is required. This difficult<BR>
skill is like other skills of journalism: it takes training, time and effort to become good<BR>
at them. <BR>

<P>   The classic conflict of values comes when a journalist believes it is necessary<BR>
to abandon the rule of truth-telling, by telling lies or using subterfuge in order to<BR>
obtain or confirm information, especially about illegal activities. In her review of 28<BR>
codes of ethics in 26 European Countries, Tiina Laitila found that 86% made reference<BR>
to the use of fair means in information collection. However, the definition of 'fair'<BR>
is open to debate. Clause 5 of the Code of Conduct of the National Union of<BR>
Journalists (UK and Ireland) states :<BR>

<P><I>   A journalist shall obtain information, photographs and illustrations only by</I><BR>
<I>   straight-forward means. The use of other means can be justified only by over-</I><BR>
<I>   riding considerations of the public interest. </I><BR>

<P>   Deciding when the public interest becomes 'over-riding', and what 'other<BR>
means' are permissible, is left up to the conscience of the journalist, or often to the<BR>
employer. This clause affirms that journalists are entitled to exercise a personal<BR>
conscientious objection to the use of such means. <BR>

<P>   But the conditions in which &quot;other means&quot; apply need to be carefully<BR>
monitored. It must be borne in mind that the pressure of commercial competition, and<BR>
the consequent imperative to be first with sensational news, often contributes to a<BR>
climate in which subterfuge and 'cheque-book' journalism become standard practice,<BR>
not for reasons of public interest but primarily for reasons of circulation and<BR>
commercial advantage. <BR>

<P>   The challenge facing journalists and those who support high standards of<BR>
journalism is to create the conditions for sound professional judgement. Sometimes<BR>
decisions may coincide with commercial advantage;  often they will not.<BR>

<P>   Most ethical guides would acknowledge that it may be ethical to lie, but any<BR>
journalist who faces such a dilemma must be convinced of the relevance and weight<BR>
of the public interest, conscious of the harm it might do to credibility, and willing as<BR>
soon as possible to face a &quot;publicity test&quot; -- public scrutiny of the circumstances.<BR>
Journalists investigating the commercial sexual exploitation of children should<BR>
consider carefully whether it is justifiable to lie to, or deceive, either the exploiters,<BR>
or the victims, in order to uncover the facts. <BR>

<P>   In her analysis of honesty in investigative journalism, Jennifer Jackson calls<BR>
for an 'emotional' <I>allegiance to truthfulness</I>:  a hatred of lies.<BR>

<P>   <I>Yet our allegiance to truthfulness needs also to be in part  rational; it needs to</I><BR>
<I>   be reflective,  judicious. While it will not normally even occur to people of</I><BR>
<I>   honest disposition that the end they seek might justify telling a lie, such people</I><BR>
<I>   can recognise that in quite exceptional circumstances, the end they have in view</I><BR>
<I>   does justify their lying. They will, of course, reach such a decision reluctantly</I><BR>
<I>   and with caution...</I><BR>

<P>   Journalists can apply the  'publicity test' in advance of an investigation by<BR>
assessing whether the public would regard the deception as justified. But they should<BR>
also ask themselves whether there is no alternative route to the story, which does not<BR>
involve lying. <BR>

<P>   It is unlikely that the public would object to the subterfuge employed by Dutch<BR>
programme-maker Aart Zeeman who used a hidden camera in order to track down the<BR>
makers and vendors of child pornography in Amsterdam. Jackson herself concludes:<BR>

<P><I>   It may be suggested that investigative journalists who are prepared to lie to get</I><BR>
<I>   their stories (and the editors who print their stories) are hypocrites, lying in the</I><BR>
<I>   name of truth. Yet...lying in order to detect and expose lies is not necessarily</I><BR>
<I>   hypocritical; sometimes it may be morally necessary or permissible for a</I><BR>
<I>   journalist to lie, and then the journalist's lie will (when revealed) appear</I><BR>
<I>   justified even to those who are really honest, who genuinely care about</I><BR>
<I>   truthfulness.</I><BR>

<P>Nevertheless, an assumption that media are always licensed to deceive in order to get<BR>
a story, undermines the moral authority of journalistic ethics. In the context of the<BR>
commercial sexual exploitation of children there are important distinctions to be<BR>
drawn, particularly because it is not just the pimps and pornographers who are<BR>
involved, but the children themselves. <BR>

<P>   A researcher who interviewed children working the streets in British cities, for<BR>
a Channel 4 documentary <B><I>The Care Connection</I></B>, remembers:<I> 'For the first 10 or 20</I><BR>
<I>seconds they were very suspicious. But as soon as they realised we were not the police</I><BR>
<I>they immediately relaxed. They just opened up completely. They saw that we were</I><BR>
<I>not going to take anything from them - or give anything to them. And once they started</I><BR>
<I>talking they wouldn't stop. They came to trust us.'</I><BR>

<P>   But there <I>are</I> times when the media do take something from the children. Their<BR>
exploitation by media professionals in pursuit of a 'good story' or an award-winning<BR>
documentary can damage, even unintentionally, the dignity and self-esteem of<BR>
children.<BR>

<P>   There is an ethical line to be drawn between subterfuge required to uncover the<BR>
largely illegal activities of exploiters, and investigation of the children themselves.<BR>
This may not be easy, given that working 'undercover' generally means total secrecy.<BR>
But the fact that so many of the children are eager to find someone they can trust and<BR>
who will listen to them, underlines their vulnerability. Experience of deception will<BR>
further damage their self-esteem, and their relationship with others. <BR>

<P>   Journalists and media organisations need to apply the highest possible standards<BR>
of honesty and openness when dealing with exploited children. <BR>

<P>   In practical terms, this means a greater emphasis on ethical questions in<BR>
journalists' training, to encourage 'a more finely tuned moral sense' . This should<BR>
focus on concrete examples of specific dilemmas, including the coverage of children's<BR>
exploitation. It also requires a constructive and supportive debate within newsrooms<BR>
about these issues, as well as a greater awareness and sensitivity within the media<BR>
about public attitudes on child pornography and exploitation.<BR>

<P><B>c) Co-operation With The Authorities</B><BR>
Just as journalists are committed to &quot;truth-telling&quot; they are, as citizens, called upon<BR>
to respect notions of community. Should journalists work hand-in-hand with the<BR>
authorities and law enforcement officers in reporting on child exploitation? It is a<BR>
complicated question, on which little guidance is given by formal ethical codes. <BR>

<P>   Aart Zeeman's team followed the Amsterdam police for a year while making<BR>
their documentary. However, this can also be a dangerous strategy. In Taiwan, one<BR>
of the major television stations recently broadcast film of reporters accompanying<BR>
police on raids of bars and brothels. It included scenes of young men and women<BR>
being questioned, apparently without any special regard for minors, and with only<BR>
token efforts to avoid filming their faces. (It is important to recall that there is a<BR>
newspaper tradition behind most ethics codes and sometimes this does not address the<BR>
problems of broadcasters. Occasionally journalists involved in &quot;live&quot; coverage may<BR>
unthinkingly transmit material which causes harm. In such cases, the technology may<BR>
rob a television producer of the time for reflection which is vital to sound ethical<BR>
decision-making.)<BR>

<P>   It is vital that journalists do not become identified in the public mind with<BR>
security forces, for exactly the same reasons which apply to the protection of sources.<BR>
But does this mean that journalists who discover evidence of illegal trafficking or<BR>
exploitation of children, for example, should not pass it on to the authorities? <BR>

<P>   Again, this is not an unusual dilemma, but it is one of the most difficult to<BR>
resolve. Convincing arguments can usually be marshalled for and against almost every<BR>
case. It is a dilemma which depends upon the circumstances, and the conscience of<BR>
the individual journalist. Aart Zeeman believes the media should not behave as 'the<BR>
third or fourth arm of the police', and would not want to pass on data outside that<BR>
broadcast in the programme. His view is that anything which serves to link the media<BR>
more closely with law enforcers, in the minds of those supplying information will<BR>
make them more reluctant to talk to journalists in general. <BR>

<P>   However, other professionals we spoke to did not find the issue so clear cut.<BR>
The BBC's Chief Advisor on Editorial Policy James Boyle said the Corporation would<BR>
allow supplementary material to be taken away only if it were clearly in the public<BR>
interest, and that no danger to any member of staff would result. Brazilian journalist<BR>
Roberto Mader judged that he would pass on information only to help the girl<BR>
prostitutes he interviewed in Latin America. In general, media professionals agree that<BR>
criminal investigation itself is the job of the police and should be clearly separated<BR>
from the exercise of journalism. <BR>

<P>   But in countries suffering first-hand from the effects of sex tourism and<BR>
growing exploitation, it is perhaps natural that journalists' associations and media<BR>
themselves should feel justified in taking a more proactive role. The Vietnamese<BR>
Journalists' Association, for instance, states that the media do cooperate with<BR>
authorities such as police, drug agencies, and families, to prevent the commercial<BR>
sexual exploitation of children; and that some offenders have been brought to trial as<BR>
a result.<BR>

<P>   In Taiwan, in 1990, a child prostitute in the Huahsi Street red light area left a<BR>
note for passers-by appealing: 'please save me'. The <B><I>China Times Weekly</I></B> took up<BR>
her case, and pressured the Wanhua District police into searching for Lite Chen,<BR>
as she signed herself. At that time, says Cheryl Lai of the Association of Taiwan<BR>
Journalists, the authorities paid little attention to child prostitution. But because of the<BR>
media publicity, the police finally tracked down 14-year-old 'Little Chen', and she<BR>
was returned to school. This is one case where the police were forced to act by media<BR>
intervention.<BR>

<P>   This example raises the question of the role of media in taking up child<BR>
exploitation cases. Journalists see themselves as neutral observers, but there may be<BR>
times when the offences they see being committed are so appalling that they must<BR>
intervene. Again this is a question for individual conscience, bearing in mind all the<BR>
factors referred to above, but it may be a legitimate role for media to play in certain<BR>
circumstances. For instance, many journalists reporting the war in Bosnia have<BR>
witnessed atrocities, but only two of them have agreed to take part as witnesses in the<BR>
war crimes trials in the Hague: British journalists Martin Bell, and Ed Vulliamy. Bell<BR>
recognises that he would be a Serbian target if he returned to Bosnia as a reporter.<BR>
Both journalists accept that 'Many colleagues think that to have given evidence is bad<BR>
professional ethics.' <BR>

<P>   However, Vulliamy draws a distinction between 'objectivity' -- a journalist's<BR>
duty to report the facts -- and 'neutrality' :<BR>

<P>   <I>At a certain point, the perpetration of atrocity crosses a line, and breaches not</I><BR>
<I>   only international law but the bases of civilisation.</I><BR>

<P>Beyond this point, he argues, 'neutrality' becomes complicity. The same criteria can<BR>
very well be applied to child exploitation. The International Federation of Journalists<BR>
-<BR>
- although respecting the rights of conscience of individuals -- notes that by taking<BR>
sides, journalists not only endanger their own safety, they can put their colleagues at<BR>
risk.<BR>

<P><B>d) Identifying The Victims</B><BR>
If journalists have a duty to the truth in their reporting and to independence in their<BR>
work they also have a responsibility to minimise harm from their actions, particularly<BR>
to people who are themselves the victims of injustice and abuse.<BR>

<P>   The <I>Guardian</I>, which generally adheres to a high standard in its news coverage,<BR>
is not alone by any means in publishing photographs of child prostitutes, even under<BR>
arrest. This is particularly true of western media images of children in developing<BR>
countries, although the technique of obscuring part of the face is now sometimes used.<BR>
However, more often it is the adult -- the suspected abuser -- whose identity is hidden.<BR>
In Taiwan, however, there is now a law whereby the names and photographs of<BR>
convicted pimps and clients of underage prostitutes, and the hotel where the violation<BR>
occurred, &quot;should be published&quot; after conviction. <BR>

<P>   Interpol confirms that many countries have legislation protecting the identity of<BR>
children involved in court proceedings, children in care, or children who are subject<BR>
to abuse, but laws vary according to who they protect, and under what circumstances.<BR>
They generally apply to young people under the national age of majority. There is also<BR>
some controversy about how energetically they are enforced. The Council of Europe's<BR>
Committee of Experts emphasises this aspect:<BR>

<P><I>   The disclosure, during administrative and judicial proceedings, of information</I><BR>
<I>   which may serve to identify the victim, is a particularly important aspect of</I><BR>
<I>   secondary victimisation. The psychological consequences of such disclosure may</I><BR>
<I>   be particularly serious for the children and young adults concerned and are</I><BR>
<I>   liable to deter the parents or those responsible for the young person from</I><BR>
<I>   lodging a complaint.</I><BR>
<I>   ...The dissemination of such information by prosecuting authorities, courts or</I><BR>
<I>   administrative authorities may cause harm to the young victims of sexual</I><BR>
<I>   exploitation. The Committee strongly emphasises that cases must be handled</I><BR>
<I>   with due respect to the victim's privacy.</I><BR>

<P>Despite widespread international understanding of this question, in South East Asia,<BR>
a newspaper printed the names of two children who had given evidence in the<BR>
prosecution of a foreign paedophile. Child protection agencies believe legislation<BR>
should allow offenders to be prosecuted without children being required to testify<BR>
against them, to avoid any risk of identification or publicity. In Norway, a similar law<BR>
means women do not have to give evidence in cases of domestic violence. Otherwise,<BR>
there is a danger of what the BBC calls 'Jigsaw identification':<BR>

<P><I>   This happens when different news organisations give different facts associated</I><BR>
<I>   with the victim which can be pieced together.</I><BR>

<P>It advises staff:<BR>

<P>   <I>Take care not to give an address, any link with another person in the story, or</I><BR>
<I>   any link between the victim and the scene of the assault...One way or another,</I><BR>
<I>   we must not complete the jigsaw.</I><BR>

<P>   Victims in general cannot be sure that their identity will not be made public.<BR>
For instance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation guidelines recognise that:<BR>

<P>   <I>Broadcasting the identity of a crime victim most often only adds to the person's</I><BR>
<I>   grief, anguish and trauma.</I><BR>

<P>   The CBC tells staff not to broadcast the names of victims, especially of crimes<BR>
against the person, such as sexual assault. Yet alleged victims of assaults that have not<BR>
been proved in court are not offered the 'privilege of anonymity'.<BR>

<P>   Child prostitutes are often afforded even less protection than other young abuse<BR>
victims, creating an understandable reluctance to report their exploitation. This<BR>
perception that once children are working on the streets, in bars, taking drugs, or<BR>
otherwise participating in the world of adult vice, they forfeit the rights of innocent<BR>
children, is shared in  some quarters of the media as well as the law enforcement<BR>
agencies. <BR>

<P>   In a survey of five Taiwanese daily newspapers, Chi Hui-jung discovered a<BR>
general hostility to young prostitutes. Out of 133 news items about arrests for offences<BR>
involving underage prostitutes, 34.% used unsympathetic headlines, and 35% were<BR>
unsympathetic in content, using language such as<I> childish; selling herself, deflowered;</I><BR>
<I>doesnt study but sells her body</I>; and <I>slut</I>. She concluded that crime reporters do not<BR>
see the juveniles involved as minors, but use adult standards to judge and blame child<BR>
prostitutes, and rarely see them as victims. On the other hand, the same reporters are<BR>
very tolerant towards the clients. Only 4% of the headlines were negative about them,<BR>
and 91% did not mention them at all, in common with 71% of the reports. <BR>

<P>   Rachel O'Brien believes such figures reflect a lack of recognition around the<BR>
world that a crime is being perpetrated by an adult. It should never be the children<BR>
who are cautioned or condemned.<BR>

<P>   One interesting conclusion to emerge from the Taiwan study, highlighted by<BR>
Cheryl Lai, is that ethical standards vary widely between reporters covering different<BR>
beats:<BR>

<P>   <I>Most media reports on this issue originate in arrests and thus from the police,</I><BR>
<I>   and are filed by reporters on crime beats, who are generally less likely to</I><BR>
<I>   consider the interests of the children involved, or make serious efforts to protect</I><BR>
<I>   their identities. Journalists covering disadvantaged groups in society who are</I><BR>
<I>   generally sympathetic to the movement to abolish child prostitution, take greater</I><BR>
<I>   care in their reporting not to add to the harm already suffered by the children.</I><BR>

<P>Where children are not specifically protected by law, it is the journalist or editor who<BR>
must take the decision on whether to identify them. There are some who are even<BR>
prepared to flout the law for the sake of a sex sensational story. This is<BR>
particularly damaging in countries with strict contempt of court rules, where the media<BR>
revelation of unauthorised details in advance of a court hearing can lead to the case<BR>
collapsing. Even when children themselves are not named, details may be given which<BR>
endanger them. One  newspaper, for instance, which interviewed an 11-year-old boy,<BR>
boxed out his face in the photograph, but went on to name his sugar-daddy and the<BR>
streets he worked. He remained at the mercy of a dangerous, violent street culture<BR>
which has, in the end, as much to do with power and money as sex. <BR>

<P>   The issue of identity is at the heart of journalistic endeavour. It is in the nature<BR>
of journalism, from the first lesson in journalism school onwards, to provide facts,<BR>
including personal details about whoever is involved in a story. The decision to<BR>
suppress information has to be carefully considered, but the nature of commercial<BR>
sexual exploitation of children should always encourage a journalist to respect, above<BR>
all, the rights of the victim. Sometimes, this may not be easy. June Kane, UNICEF's<BR>
Media Coordinator for the World Congress, calls on documentary makers to think<BR>
twice before using footage of bar girls in Asia, for example, but will a producer<BR>
working on a programme about bar girls, be able to alert viewers to the real tragedy<BR>
of sex tourism, without picturing the girls at work, or telling individual children's<BR>
stories? <BR>

<P><B>4. Media Myths and Stereotypes</B><BR>
In the material provided for the World Congress there is a call to the media to avoid<BR>
exploiting and victimising the children in their coverage, and to depict them in a way<BR>
which maintains their dignity. It is a brave, but challenging call. To achieve this,<BR>
media professionals need to re-examine their old habits. <BR>

<P>   Peter Almond points out that a collection of myths 'contaminate' the<BR>
public's, and the media's, perception of children.<BR>

<P><I>   The media cling to these myths; they are familiar, convenient, easily adapted</I><BR>
<I>   to conventional formats of news and entertainment. In short, myth is easier to</I><BR>
<I>   report than the more subtle and complicated reality.</I><BR>

<P>   Such myths can lead journalists to mould exploited children into typecast roles<BR>
as sinners or victims. Families in developing countries, people living in poverty, or<BR>
victims of war and disaster lose their individuality and their humanity. Victims are<BR>
portrayed as helpless sufferers, unable to act, think, or speak for themselves. Whole<BR>
countries and communities become categorised under generalised headlines. <BR>

<P>   In Thailand, the portrayal of girls from the north of the country drifting into<BR>
prostitution has become so pervasive that a special project has been launched to protect<BR>
some of those at risk. Quoted in <B><I>The Nation</I></B>, one 13-year-old protests:<I> 'I get angry</I><BR>
<I>every time I hear people say that many northern girls are engaged in prostitution. I</I><BR>
<I>have not the slightest intention to become a prostitute'. </I><BR>

<P>   In 1995, Dr Magda Michielsens of the University of Nijmegen in the<BR>
Netherlands analysed the portrayal of victims, in the news output of seven TV<BR>
channels across Europe. She concluded that victims generally are given low status.<BR>
Victims of violence, disaster, and human rights abuses in developing countries, (she<BR>
collected examples from Africa), are much less likely to be identified as individuals<BR>
and offered the chance to speak, than those from Europe. This form  of racism <BR>
reinforces the sense of distance, of 'otherness', experienced by the European or<BR>
northern viewer. <BR>

<P>   In a survey of magazine coverage of child abuse in the United States, Nancy<BR>
Signorielli found that victims were rarely reported to react to their abuse. Womens<BR>
magazines covered the issue more frequently than news and business magazines, but<BR>
in a more sensational way. As a result, men were less exposed to the problem.<BR>
Gerbner also discovered that a high proportion of children on TV appeared as victims.<BR>

<P><I>   Disproportionate preoccupation with even sympathetically presented or</I><BR>
<I>   'accidental' victims in an under-represented population, relative to exhibiting</I><BR>
<I>   their own share of numbers and exercise of power, diminishes and degrades</I><BR>
<I>   that group.</I><BR>

<P>   Fierce commercial competition is one factor leading the media to exploit<BR>
victims, suggests Dr Michielsens. The exposure of emotions and sensationalisation of<BR>
events attract audiences and sell news. Cash-conscious media organisations apply<BR>
greater pressure on news teams for productivity. Journalists, therefore, sometimes take<BR>
the ill-considered, easy route to news-gathering, perpetuating -- whether consciously<BR>
or unconsciously -- the sorts of myth and stereotype identified by Peter Almond. In<BR>
this process individuals and groups are not treated with respect and their needs and<BR>
views are not properly appreciated.  Some media organisations are becoming aware<BR>
of the danger of dehumanising victims in far-away places. James Boyle says the BBC<BR>
now has clear rules, which apply even to dead bodies. 'Human beings have the same<BR>
dignity all over the world'. There are a range of approaches being developed, to avoid<BR>
stereotyping and victimising exploited children, while at the same time telling their<BR>
story accurately and vividly.<BR>

<P>   Roberto Mader felt that all the programmes he saw about children's exploitation<BR>
in Latin America and other southern countries, while strongly denouncing important<BR>
human rights abuses, left the impression that nothing could be done.<I>  'All you feel at</I><BR>
<I>the end of the programme is depressed. Now all my work is about trying to show, not</I><BR>
<I>that life in Brazil is wonderful -- we have our problems -- but I work in areas where</I><BR>
<I>I know there are people doing very positive things to change the reality in which they</I><BR>
<I>live. That is the most important thing: to show how people are getting empowered.'</I><BR>

<P>   In search of a 'strong movement' in the Brazilian cities, Mader settled on the<BR>
<B><I>Casa de Passegem</I></B>, a half-way house for girls escaping prostitution.<I> 'It was the only</I><BR>
<I>project I found where the girls were having a say about the running of the programme.</I><BR>
<I>That was very important. There's one interview where one of the girls says: 'These</I><BR>
<I>people used to make me feel so ugly, but now nobody needs to say I am beautiful,</I><BR>
<I>because I know I am'. The girls were shown in a very positive light. Everybody is</I><BR>
<I>tired of seeing the negative side'. </I><BR>

<P>   Tony Dowmunt, the producer of<B><I> Casa de Passegem</I></B>, says all the girls<BR>
interviewed were over the age of consent, and spoke about their past lives<I>. 'We</I><BR>
<I>wanted to show that it was possible to get off the streets'. </I>He believes the media<BR>
should investigate more of the racist and imperialist dynamics behind sex tourism,<BR>
which is<I> 'not just a few dirty old men going abroad'.</I><BR>

<P><I>   'In the 1980s, these issues were just starting to be aired. We are still in a</I><BR>
<I>backlash, where some of them are considered too difficult to deal with. It is very</I><BR>
<I>difficult to find thoughtful discussion about them. '</I><BR>

<P>   Roberto Mader believes language is another obstacle to the documentary<BR>
format. Subtitles are expensive, and often unpopular with audiences. Broadcasting<BR>
organisations tend to avoid them<I>. 'It's an excuse not to listen to people at all - you</I><BR>
<I>just have a voice-over soundbite. Yet people are amazed when they see ordinary</I><BR>
<I>people speaking'.</I><BR>

<P>   Aart Zeeman traced children back to Hungary, the Czech Republic and the<BR>
Philippines, but avoided identifying the former victims he interviewed.<I> 'I don't think</I><BR>
<I>it adds anything to show their faces, unless they are grown up now and choose to tell</I><BR>
<I>their story. Children don't understand the impact being on TV can have. I think you</I><BR>
<I>have to be very careful to protect the children -- the film might be shown in the</I><BR>
<I>countries where they are living and could easily get them into trouble'. </I><BR>

<P>   Altering the names of people and places is one obvious answer for newspaper<BR>
journalists. But for the documentary maker, the dilemma between using images which<BR>
will keep the audience's attention, and not endangering or victimising the children,<BR>
cannot be easily resolved. For <B><I>The Care Connection</I></B>, programme makers 'invented'<BR>
different ways of getting round the problem. Cameras were positioned at unusual<BR>
angles -- above interviewees' heads or by their ears -- or shots were cut away to focus<BR>
on the movements of their hands, which also registered the emotional impact of their<BR>
words. The technique of 'pixilating' -- blurring a small portion of the screen -- was<BR>
rejected.<BR>

<P><I>   'It's always associated with criminals, or somebody who deserves what they</I><BR>
<I>get'</I>, explained researcher Simon Cooper.<BR>

<P>   Other broadcasters have sought different, less controversial approaches to the<BR>
topic, such as a dramatisation, followed by a studio debate. Belgian director Gil<BR>
Verhaert proposed the fictional formula for a six-part series on <B><I>La femme, lenfant,</I></B><BR>
<B><I>et la prostitution</I></B>, in Africa, Asia and Europe.<I> 'We have a lot of information, but we</I><BR>
<I>cannot feature the real people because they are all either afraid of the Mafia, or are</I><BR>
<I>involved in court cases', he explained. 'Audiences are interested in dramatic events.</I><BR>
<I>But it does not have to be sensational. If you keep to the truth, it's more than dramatic</I><BR>
<I>enough.'</I><BR>

<P>   Many of the journalists reporting on commercial sexual exploitation of children<BR>
are committed to uncovering what they regard as a profound social evil<I>: 'We have a</I><BR>
<I>role to play in increasing awareness',  </I>says Aart Zeeman. <I>'It's such a disgusting</I><BR>
<I>thing'. </I><BR>

<P>   The work of such media professionals not only acts as a counter-weight to<BR>
media indifference and lack of awareness, it adds to the resources available to<BR>
campaigners. The material produced may be linked in with campaigns on the issue by<BR>
local NGOs, or destined for educational use -- as in the case of Gil Verhaerts<BR>
project.<BR>

<P>He hoped his work might be used in the Philippines among families who sell their own<BR>
children into prostitution. In Bangkok, a campaign has been launched to show parents<BR>
the horrors their daughters would face in the sex trade.  <BR>

<P><B>5. Freedom of Expression and The Challenge of Self-Regulation</B><BR>
Journalists tend to be wary of regulators. They have much evidence to support the<BR>
view that intervention in the affairs of journalism inevitably leads to forms of<BR>
censorship. However, it is a legitimate question whether media self-regulation is a<BR>
sufficient answer to public concern over standards of journalism in an age when the<BR>
changing media landscape, and particularly the growth of global media enterprises<BR>
appears, in theory at least, to put media beyond the range of national public<BR>
accountability.<BR>

<P>   Effective self-regulation, by which the errors of media professionals are dealt<BR>
with by their peers, may not be so convincing when media organisations appear to use<BR>
professional codes to support their particular interests, which in a commercial system<BR>
of mass communication by no means necessarily coincide with those of journalism or<BR>
the public interest. There has been in the past criticism that self-regulation has been<BR>
used to provide what might be called a 'social alibi' for the mass media industry, that<BR>
is to prevent society from taking more definite (legal) measures. <BR>

<P>   This argument goes to the heart of the uncomfortable balance of interests which<BR>
prevails in today's media -- that ethical standards are being sacrificed in defence of<BR>
commercial interests. One of the principle problems lies in the implementation and<BR>
enforcement of rules. Very often even regulatory bodies lack the power to enforce<BR>
sanctions which bite. In Canada in 1990, the CBC's Equity Task Force found that,<BR>
with regard to equitable employment and portrayal,<I> self-regulation and incentive</I><BR>
<I>measures have failed to accomplish desired and anticipated results</I>. <BR>

<P>   Some professional codes aspire to the very highest moral standards, as in Chile,<BR>

<P><I>   Journalism and journalists must be in the service of truth, social justice, human</I><BR>
   <I>rights and the ideals of the improvement of society and of peace among peoples.</I><BR>

<P>   And there is no doubt that many individuals, like those quoted above, are<BR>
committed to exposing and condemning sexual exploitation. Sadly, many more choose<BR>
to reflect the commercial or political interests of advertisers, proprietors, or political<BR>
parties. <BR>

<P><I>   This control seldom takes the form of direct intervention or censorship, but far</I><BR>
<I>   more often of self-censorship by the media professionals themselves - who may</I><BR>
<I>   not even be aware that they are exercising it.</I><BR>

<P>   In an Indiana University School of Journalism study in the 1980s, 88% of the<BR>
journalists questioned said they acquired their ethical values from the newsroom itself.<BR>
Aidan White identifies several extra factors which encourage &quot;the tendency towards<BR>
self-censorship and self-denial of social responsibility&quot; among media professionals,<BR>
including:<BR>

<P><I>   the growth of new technologies, which threaten to overwhelm existing</I><BR>
<I>   regulatory structures, or the unaccountable nature of transnational media</I><BR>
<I>   corporations which evade terrestrial control of media standards, or the</I><BR>
<I>   increasingly insecure working environment in which journalists work.</I><BR>

<P>   Journalists' unions who have tried to enforce their own ethical standards<BR>
through disciplinary proceedings, have found themselves in the tricky if not impossible<BR>
position of attacking individual workers they exist to support.<BR>

<P>   Despite all this, codes and guidelines still have a crucial role to play, in raising<BR>
awareness and providing a model of good practice. In Spain, in 1993, for example,<BR>
regional and national broadcasting organisations joined with the national and regional<BR>
Education Ministries in agreeing <B><I>Self-regulation Principles for Television Channels</I></B><BR>
<B><I>concerning the specific content of their programmes with regard to protecting</I></B><BR>
<B><I>children and young people</I></B>. The document recognises<I> 'the significant role which</I><BR>
<I>television plays in Spanish society and its influence on society, particularly children</I><BR>
<I>and young people</I>. Specific guidelines on reporting child abuse could be drawn up by<BR>
professional associations to accompany their general ethical codes, along the lines of<BR>
guidelines for reporting AIDS published by the NUJ (UK and Ireland).<BR>

<P>   In the final analysis, the support of media employers and regulators is crucial<BR>
to improving newsroom values as highlighted by Cheryl Lai: <I>Much of the biased or</I><BR>
<I>sensationalist coverage, especially headlines, is created by editors, and it will be</I><BR>
<I>difficult to gain improvements given Taiwan's patriarchal society unless high-level</I><BR>
<I>media editors and managers implement such a policy from the top down.</I><BR>

<P>   Attitudes to censorship and freedom of expression vary widely from country to<BR>
country and culture to culture. In all countries, broadcasting tends to be more highly<BR>
regulated than newspapers and magazines. The importance of the right to freedom of<BR>
expression cannot be under-estimated, yet it is not without boundaries. Both <B><I>the UN</I></B><BR>
<B><I>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</I></B> and the <B><I>European Convention for the</I></B><BR>
<B><I>Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms </I></B>draw attention to the<BR>
responsibilities accompanying this right, including respect for the rights or<BR>
reputations of others'.<BR>

<P>   The question of freedom of expression is relevant in particular to child<BR>
pornography. Can there be a distinction between pornography, and the justifiable<BR>
portrayal of 'childhood sexuality' in works of art? Amy Adler argues that the US<BR>
Supreme Court, in its anxiety to protect children, has thrown <I>out 'important speech-</I><BR>
<I>protective features of the law'</I>, including 'the traditional protection afforded to artistic<BR>
expression'. <BR>

<P>   But American lawyer Andrew Vachss, a specialist in child abuse cases, believes<BR>
that the controversy over art is a red herring thrown up by the paedophile community.<BR>

<P>   <I>The issue is not 'what is art?' but 'what is victimisation?' I can no more</I><BR>
<I>   accept a child pornographer saying he is a victim of censorship than I could a</I><BR>
<I>   mugger claiming his field of activity was performance art.</I><BR>

<P>   The issue of rights to freedom of expression cannot be ignored, but should be<BR>
turned around to focus first on the rights of the child to freedom from fear and<BR>
exploitation. As June Kane points out, <I>'Journalists should, as always, look at the</I><BR>
<I>facts, and have at their fingertips the medical  and other evidence to prove that the</I><BR>
<I>commercial sexual exploitation of children cannot be justified.</I><BR>

<P><B>6. Building Images of Children, Sex and Violence in the Media</B><BR>
There is increasing alarm in a number of countries that the way children are portrayed<BR>
by the media today may increase the risks they face. Controversy continues<BR>
internationally about how far children's behaviour is influenced by what they see on<BR>
television - particularly with regard to violence. <BR>

<P>   The loudest recent public controversy about the portrayal of children has<BR>
focused recently on the American film <B><I>Kids</I></B>, directed by Larry Clark. Some critics<BR>
condemned the film as voyeuristic, and expressed disbelief that the young actors,<BR>
mostly amateur, who enacted the film's brutal sexual encounters, were themselves<BR>
above the age of consent. The film raised worrying questions both about the<BR>
exploitation of increasingly youthful actors, and about the impact on young audiences<BR>
who might regard the characters as role-models. In some countries, the film was<BR>
barred to under-18s. The crucial question is whether adults themselves are encouraging<BR>
children to become prematurely sexually active, or to seem to be so. <BR>

<P>   This question is particularly relevant to pop music and modelling which are two<BR>
of the most influential industries among young people today. In fashion, it is the<BR>
woman-child' who now rules the catwalk. <BR>

<P><I>   Gianne Albertoni Vicente is 5ft 10in, with long blond hair, wide-apart eyes and</I><BR>
<I>   wonderful bones. Oh, and she's only 13.</I><BR>

<P>   The recent revelation that a 12-year-old schoolgirl had been signed up by an<BR>
adult modelling agency in the UK, with the approval of her parents, caused<BR>
widespread soul-searching in the media. Was it a harmless bit of fun, or the symptom<BR>
of a dangerous trend? The commentators disagreed, but most expressed alarm. Even<BR>
the girl's mother admitted that there was a 'sexual angle'; expanded upon by<BR>
psychologist Dorothy Rowe:<BR>

<P><I>   There is something intriguing about the young girl who is just discovering life</I><BR>
<I>   and is beginning to wonder what it's all about. It is the kind of titillation in</I><BR>
<I>   which a virginal girl intrigues a man. In areas of sexuality intended to intrigue,</I><BR>
<I>   it is especially dangerous because the child is being presented with issues that</I><BR>
<I>   they are not really ready to deal with, no matter how precocious they look.</I><BR>

<P>   British Member of Parliament Ann Winterton judged it to be a <I>'trend almost</I><BR>
<I>verging on the paedophilic</I>'. The fear must be that, the more grown-up women are<BR>
persuaded to aspire to having a childlike body, the more the distinction between adults<BR>
and children, also with respect to sexuality, will become blurred.<BR>

<P>   Then, in May, the watch-manufacturer Omega announced that it planned to<BR>
withdraw advertising from a major fashion magazine, <B><I>Vogue</I></B>, in protest at the use of<BR>
waif-like models. Within a couple of weeks, Omega had obtained more publicity - all<BR>
of it free and much of it highly complimentary - than a year's worth of advertising in<BR>
magazines. Ironically, the threat was withdrawn on the instructions of the chairman<BR>
Nicolas Hayek, ostensibly in the interest of press freedom. Omega's brand director<BR>
Giles Rees wrote to <B><I>Vogue</I></B>:<BR>

<P><I>   I would hope that the tremendous support and encouragement that we have</I><BR>
<I>   received from the media and particularly from the public would urge you to</I><BR>
<I>   consider addressing these issues with your editorial staff.</I><BR>

<P>   If it can be demonstrated to companies that they have something to gain in<BR>
terms of public approval and financial return from rejecting sexually exploitative<BR>
images, this might have a major impact.<BR>

<P>   The impact of public pressure on the media, on this issue as any other, should<BR>
not be underestimated. Parents and educators in France, for instance, have been urged<BR>
to react when TV stations show material lacking in respect for children, whether or<BR>
not it is intended for young viewers. In Australia, a national campaign to improve the<BR>
portrayal of women in the media included the distribution of information packs telling<BR>
audiences how to complain about what they heard or saw.<BR>

<P>   Jennifer Rowe, former editor of the <B><I>Australian Womens Weekly</I></B>, commented: <BR>

<P>   <I>In the end, all media are driven by their ratings or their readership, and if they</I><BR>
<I>   can see that they are losing that, by persisting in an attitude that is outmoded,</I><BR>
<I>   they will change. </I><BR>

<P>   The most fascinating aspect of the  model controversy is how it was handled<BR>
by the newspapers themselves. The girl's first appearance, according to Alexander<BR>
Chancellor, was on the front page of the <B><I>Daily Telegraph</I></B>. <BR>

<P>   <I>The next day she was taken up by the tabloids. She was pouting and</I><BR>
<I>   smouldering in the photographs in an alarmingly grown-up way. The tabloids</I><BR>
<I>   were thrilled of course, but also censorious.</I><BR>

<P>   Indeed, its professed outrage did not stop the<B><I> Daily Mail</I></B> from reprinting a full-<BR>
length picture of the girl in her 'smouldering' modelling pose, under the heading<BR>
'Who on earth would allow a child of 12 to pose like this?' It might have queried,<BR>
more relevantly, who on earth would publish a picture of her doing it. And as if to<BR>
reinforce the sexual message, the feature was placed next to a small beauty item giving<BR>
advice on how to achieve 'a perfect pout'. The morally self-righteous stance adopted<BR>
by some sections of the media is directly contradicted when it come to stories and<BR>
images that make money.<BR>

<P>   For the popular music industry, international TV channels like MTV, where<BR>
pop videos make up a large proportion of output, are a very significant means of<BR>
reaching young people and children - even those too young to attend concerts or buy<BR>
CDs. Professor Monique Remy analysed the images of young people in these videos.<BR>
She found:<BR>

<P><I>   ...stereotyped masculine and feminine images, sado-masochistic scenes, Asian</I><BR>
<I>   exoticism, fetishist female garments, women as bloodsuckers and trouble-</I><BR>
<I>   makers, both men and women grotesquely made-up, with an element of</I><BR>
<I>   androgyny. </I><BR>

<P>   Women appeared as child-like, asexual yet provocative, dangerous, yet also<BR>
victimised. In their analysis of 166 videos broadcast by MTV, WTBS and NBC in<BR>
1984, Barry Sherman and Joseph Dominick drew attention to the provocative style of<BR>
dress, and the portrayal of young women as either aggressors or victims.<BR>

<P>   The Council of Europe's experts also warned of the 'insidious' exploitation of<BR>
children's and young people's bodies in show business and the media, and the use of<BR>
children's pictures or voices to create an erotic atmosphere. <BR>

<P><I>   'Lolitas' (both male and female) seem to have come back into fashion in the</I><BR>
<I>   cinema and show business, appealing to the unwholesome taste of a certain</I><BR>
<I>   section of the public.</I><BR>

<P>   Certainly some media commentators have perceived this as evidence  of a<BR>
'widespread phenomenon.. ..of confusion over the boundary between adults and<BR>
children', in which parents have colluded in the sexual exploitation of their children.<BR>

<P>   <I>We inhabit a culture which makes a great deal of money out of the mass</I><BR>
<I>   premature sexualisation of children. Their music, their clothes, the TV and films</I><BR>
<I>   they watch and the teen magazines they read envelop them in a miasma of</I><BR>
<I>   sexuality ....Children who are glued to the set have been turned into voyeurs</I><BR>
<I>   at the peepshow of adult behaviour.... Popular culture presents to them as</I><BR>
<I>   normal a brutally crude, mechanistic world in which sexual gratification is</I><BR>
<I>   another commodity, available not just to adults but to them, along with the</I><BR>
<I>   clothes, CDs and cosmetics.</I><BR>

<P>   Little wonder then, the argument goes, that if the media consistently present<BR>
young and old audiences alike with  images of children  in a sexual context, some<BR>
adults will believe that children are ready and able to participate in sexual activity.<BR>

<P>   <I>Our society panics about an apparent epidemic of child sexual abuse. Does</I><BR>
<I>   it ever occur to anyone that maybe there is some connection with the</I><BR>
<I>   multinational business of precocious child sexuality? </I><BR>

<P>   Rachel O'Brien believes it is dangerous to view these developments as<BR>
'Armageddon'  - a catastrophic loss of innocence about which nothing can be done.<BR>
But she does perceive a widespread confusion about what childhood means, and points<BR>
out that the definition of childhood itself differs from community to community, and<BR>
age to age. Children are aware of their bodies, and <I>do</I> need to explore and learn about<BR>
sex. But this should be done gradually, in a tolerant, safe environment; through<BR>
natural contact with other children, and with the support of parents.<BR>

<P>   The problems, she says, arise from adults looking at young people in a certain<BR>
way: appropriating them for their own use.  They create exploitative and, in extreme<BR>
cases, paedophile images. The image of pre-pubescent children offering themselves<BR>
for sex allows adults to claim that they are responsible for the provocation.<I>  How do</I><BR>
<I>young people themselves consume these images? On the one hand, many children are</I><BR>
<I>denied sex education, while on the other there is a glorification of children in</I><BR>
<I>provocative poses. It seems that either we want our children to be totally innocent, or</I><BR>
<I>to be prostitutes. And the whole question of their rights as individuals gets left out.'</I><BR>

<P>   All this makes the notion of a 'youth oriented society' into a slogan of little<BR>
substance, concludes George Gerbner. The media are oriented towards 'markets and<BR>
power' rather than youth. Advertisers focus on consumers and potential consumers -<BR>
and we will look at advertising specifically later in this paper. But in television output<BR>
children have no power. They<I> 'take on the characteristics of a social minority with</I><BR>
<I>less than their share of attention, values, and resources, and consequently diminished</I><BR>
<I>life chances.'</I><BR>

<P>   The solution may be simple to see, but not so easy to achieve. That is, to give<BR>
a voice in the media to children themselves, to listen to their views and aspirations.<BR>
And to educate them to be knowledgeable and critical about how the media work.<BR>
International conventions and recommendations already emphasise the right of children<BR>
to have a say in decisions affecting them, and call for a change in the way children<BR>
are regarded .  The Draft Declaration from this Congress also emphasises that<BR>
children have a right to express their views on matters affecting their lives, and calls<BR>
for childrens participation in action (Article 6). Why should children not also have<BR>
more say in the media? Dr Ulla Bjrnerg proposes documentary programmes on<BR>
young peoples lives in different countries, with the aim of giving children aged from<BR>
7 to 18 - including poor and migrant children - an opportunity to air their opinions.<BR>

<P><B><I>   Washington Post</I></B> journalist Tom Wilkinson points out the importance to all<BR>
newspapers of 'sources'. Children are not regarded as sources because they are not<BR>
trusted to distinguish accurately between fact and fiction -- a belief that also applied<BR>
to children giving evidence in court until recently. New means of giving children<BR>
access to the media as sources should be investigated, perhaps through the mediation<BR>
of child help lines, with reassurance that information offered would be strictly<BR>
confidential. Wilkinson also makes the crucial point that:<BR>

<P><I>   child abuse does not fall squarely into a specific area of reporting. Is it part of</I><BR>
<I>   the police beat, medicine, sociology, or government? The Post doesn't have a</I><BR>
<I>   child abuse reporter per se, and I doubt that any major newspaper does.</I><BR>

<P>   We have already seen, in Taiwan, the difference in approach when the topic is<BR>
reported by journalists with a broader awareness of social issues. Maybe Wilkinson<BR>
has hit on the answer. Given the size of the constituency and its importance for the<BR>
future, should not news media have specialist 'children's correspondents', with a brief<BR>
covering all aspects of children's lives, and specific training to enable journalists to<BR>
express the child's point of view? Maybe this would do most to 'promote change in<BR>
the traditional view of the child'. In its report on implementation of the Council of<BR>
Europe Recommendation No.R (91)11, the British government suggests the sort of<BR>
training that would be appropriate for 'all professionals who come into contact with<BR>
children', including:<BR>

<P>   <I>self-awareness, children's sexual terminology, child growth and development,</I><BR>
<I>   child abuse, risk factors, the law, interviewing techniques, communication with</I><BR>
<I>   children, and video recording.</I><BR>

<P>   The British Home Office also decided to produce a 'good practice' video for<BR>
judges and lawyers. Governments or NGOs might consider making good practice<BR>
videos for editors and journalists. Another measure to assist journalists in covering<BR>
children's issues seriously and accurately would be for NGOs in each country to<BR>
compile a directory of reliable experts on different topics, which could be available<BR>
on every news desk.<BR>

<P>   International bodies have called for more information to be given to children<BR>
- both through the media and at school - about the dangers and risks of sexual<BR>
exploitation, and how to defend themselves. But children, from primary school<BR>
upwards,  also need media literacy training, to help them understand and decode the<BR>
messages they receive from both programmes and advertising, so as to become critical<BR>
and well-informed media consumers. In Canada, for instance, the organisation<BR>
Mediawatch and the Federation of Women's Teachers' Associations have developed<BR>
a curriculum for schools on stereotypes and gender issues.<BR>

<P><I>   Media education can play a crucial role in counteracting the impact of these</I><BR>
<I>   messages. Helping children to understand that media construct - as opposed to</I><BR>
<I>   reflect - reality; that they communicate implicit and explicit values; and that</I><BR>
<I>   they can influence the way we feel and think about ourselves and the world, are</I><BR>
<I>   vitally important lessons.</I><BR>

<P>In France, an initiative aimed at implementing the UN Convention, proposes<BR>
'associating adults and children to analyse and explain the programmes on television,<BR>
'the only medium generally accessible to children of all socio-cultural<BR>
backgrounds'.'<BR>

<P>The ultimate objective is best summarised by George Gerbner again, who calls for<BR>
media professionals to 'break the constraints that now bind them to markets that use<BR>
but have little use for children':<BR>

<P><I>   The need is for action towards creating a culture, and television system, that</I><BR>
<I>   can afford to address itself to the nation's future, its children....Citizens,</I><BR>
<I>   writers, actors and producers must work towards a system of popular</I><BR>
<I>   storytelling whose culture-power cannot devalue and hurt children any more. </I><BR>

<P><B>7. Advertising and the Impact of New Technologies</B><BR>
As this paper has already stressed, strongly commercial motives, primarily the need<BR>
to win audiences and advertisers, influence the content of mass media communication.<BR>
Advertising is also subject to a combination of legislation and self-regulation in the<BR>
way it appeals to children.  The Council of Europe experts noted that :<BR>

<P><I>   Advertisers, in particular, have recently begun to rely on the impact of juvenile</I><BR>
<I>   seduction, using it in the same way as 'conventional' erotic advertising. In so</I><BR>
<I>   doing, they may have the effect of encouraging those who wish to widen the</I><BR>
<I>   choice of sexual partners by means of overtly paedophile propaganda.</I><BR>

<P>   Some notorious cases have sent shock waves through the advertising world,<BR>
such as the Calvin Klein jeans advertisement, which President Clinton is said to have<BR>
personally intervened to have withdrawn.<BR>

<P>   In Europe, legislation focuses largely on banning pornography or protecting<BR>
children. In Denmark, radio and TV advertising must respect 'decency'. Far more<BR>
detailed are the self-regulatory codes, which tend to guarantee freedom of expression<BR>
while at the same time affirming the responsibilities of advertisers.<BR>

<P>   Henry Danthan, Executive Manager of the World Federation of Advertisers,<BR>
which represents national associations and multinational advertising companies, says<BR>
the concept of self-regulation is largely European and North American, with<BR>
mechanisms now existing in other countries such as Japan, Australia and South Africa.<BR>

<P>   He believes that an 'anti-advertising climate' is being fostered in some parts of<BR>
Europe because of a misguided moral panic about its influence on children. In other<BR>
countries, says Danthan, children's role in society is so different that it is not<BR>
perceived as a problem. <I>'It's a question which is less at the forefront of regulators'</I><BR>
<I>concerns than, for instance, tobacco or alcohol'.</I> Nevertheless, these days the<BR>
advertising industry is, without doubt, sensitive about allegations over its use of<BR>
children. A report on <B><I>Children and Television Commercials</I></B> commissioned by the<BR>
European Advertising Tripartite last year, condemned much research on children and<BR>
advertising as 'politically motivated'. It concluded that advertising actually had<BR>
positive effects on children, partly because it contained <I>'virtually no aggression and</I><BR>
<I>many examples of prosocial behaviour, breaking down stereotypes'.</I><BR>

<P>   The European Advertising Standards Alliance, which brings together the self-<BR>
regulatory bodies across Europe, carried out its own survey on the self-regulation<BR>
of advertising and children, and in particular the use of naked children in adverts. It<BR>
found that in nine of the 15 European Union countries, the screening of naked children<BR>
(including sexual organs) was permitted. In Austria, Germany, Ireland and the UK,<BR>
children had to be partially clothed. And in several of the other countries restrictions<BR>
relating to taste and decency, and the age of the child, applied. <BR>

<P>   The survey asked whether self-regulatory bodies had received any reaction from<BR>
viewers to the use of naked children. Only four: Ireland, France, Portugal and the<BR>
UK, reported any specific response, with viewers in the UK in particular complaining<BR>
that such images would be regarded by paedophiles as erotic titillation.<BR>

<P>   Henry Danthan believes advertisers now understand the need to adopt high<BR>
standards in advertising for and by children. Yet the fact remains that shock adverts,<BR>
like the Calvin Klein example, attract  massive extra publicity.<BR>

<P>   In the end, there are two other problems with the concept of self-regulation,<BR>
highlighted by Simon-Pierre De Coster, a legal advisor with the Belgian broadcaster<BR>
RTBF. The first is that mechanisms are only equipped to deal with  grave breaches<BR>
of regulations. But it is not the grave cases that are the main problem, he points out.<BR>
It is the accumulative effect of banal stereotypes that are used everyday without<BR>
sanction.<BR>

<P>   Secondly, advertising codes rely on notions such as 'good taste', 'bad<BR>
taste' and 'decency'. But how are these terms to be interpreted and implemented?<BR>
'What is the broadcaster to make of these texts? They should be defined somewhere'.<BR>
Both media workers and the public have a crucial role to play in indicating where the<BR>
bounds of acceptability are drawn, and consumer boycotts of products can have a<BR>
powerful effect: <I>The mere threat of such action is already effective insofar as a</I><BR>
<I>television station is very reluctant to risk seeing a source of advertising revenue</I><BR>
<I>diminish or disappear.</I><BR>

<P>   But while efforts continue to try to set standards in the existing world of media<BR>
technology, the development of new forms of communication such as the Internet has<BR>
opened up new opportunities for paedophiles and pornographers which have brought<BR>
international concern. Men exchange pornographic accounts of their exploits as sex<BR>
tourists, for example, supplying details of bars, brothels, and prices. <BR>

<P>   In 1995, Thailand's Tourist Authority tried to take action to delete graphic<BR>
details of sex venues and massage parlours from <B><I>Netscape: The World Sex Guide</I></B>.<BR>
The Internet contributor was identified as a 50-year-old American, Bruce Cassirer,<BR>
who had also written a 'travel guide' on where to find young prostitutes. Cassirer was<BR>
declared persona non grata by Thailand, and a warrant issued for his arrest. <BR>

<P>   Governments have now discovered that the major problem in controlling<BR>
material on the Internet, is that nobody controls it. In France, net providers went on<BR>
strike to obtain an assurance from the Ministry of Telecommunications that they were<BR>
not to blame for child pornography. The Association of French Internet Professionals<BR>
demanded a legal debate to establish who <I>was</I> responsible for the material. In the<BR>
United States free-speech campaigners have won in recent days an injunction against<BR>
official attempts control content on the Internet.<BR>

<P>   Whatever media strategies may emerge in the campaign for children's rights,<BR>
they will have to be linked to this rapidly-changing media environment, and one that<BR>
offers much less scope for control and regulation than before.   <BR>

<P>
<P><B>8. Conclusions and Recommendations</B><BR>
The International Federation of Journalists, in its proposed amendment to the Draft<BR>
Declaration of this Congress, called for action <B>to encourage media professionals to</B><BR>
<B>develop strategies which strengthen the role of media in providing information of the</B><BR>
<B>highest quality, reliability and ethical standards concerning all aspects of the</B><BR>
<B>commercial sexual exploitation of children</B>. The following recommendations are<BR>
designed to strengthen the key role of journalists in revealing instances of abuse, and<BR>
also in monitoring the performance of national and international bodies, both in<BR>
honouring their commitments and working to end the commercial sexual exploitation<BR>
of children.<BR>

<P>   There are some simple but practical points to bear in mind here. The media<BR>
can, without doubt, influence the decision-makers. But to do this effectively, media<BR>
professionals must choose how and when. For broadcasters, for example:<BR>

<P>   <I>Time is critical... First, the reporter needs enough air time to present the</I><BR>
<I>   subject properly. Second, the story must be broadcast at a time when the people</I><BR>
<I>   who ought to see it will see it. Finally, a sense of social timing is essential. Just</I><BR>
<I>   as some entertainment shows will sell one year and not the next, so too with</I><BR>
<I>   news stories; audiences are not static in their responsiveness to social issues.</I><BR>

<P>   Matters relating to children have traditionally featured more often in women's<BR>
magazines and programmes. If children's exploitation is to be given the priority it<BR>
demands, it must be highlighted in all media, particularly those which reach opinion<BR>
formers and people taking decisions. This is an issue which touches on the economy,<BR>
society, education, development, and the environment and it is one occasion when<BR>
editors must, as American journalist John Mack Carter admits,<I> 'strive to present</I><BR>
<I>material that not only captures the imagination but also prompts action'.</I><BR>

<P>      <BR>

<P>   <B>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ACTION</B><BR>

<P><B>1. Training for journalists</B><BR>
a) Ethical questions should have a higher profile in journalists' training,<BR>
   particularly with regard to standards of conduct in reporting issues like<BR>
   children's exploitation. <BR>

<P><B>2. Codes of Conduct and Self Regulation</B><BR>
a) While codes of conduct and guidelines appear not to be effective, they can be<BR>
   useful in demonstrating that something needs to be done. Such codes are<BR>
   weapons in the hands of journalists and campaigners who can use them to take<BR>
   up issues with editors, publishers and broadcasters.<BR>
b) Specific guidelines on reporting child abuse could be drawn up by professional<BR>
   associations to accompany their general ethical codes.<BR>
c) In preparing this report, the Confederation of ASEAN Journalists suggested that<BR>
   further study on this issue, by media professionals in the regions. Such further<BR>
   activity is highly recommended.<BR>

<P><B>3. Media organisations and Media Professionals </B><BR>
a) Journalists and programme-makers have a duty to increase public awareness of<BR>
   the dangers of the commercial sexual exploitation of children. However,<BR>
   reporting needs to be carried out with enormous care. <BR>
b) Journalists and programme-makers should adhere to the highest standards of<BR>
   professional conduct when confronted with dilemmas such as professional<BR>
   secrecy, the use of subterfuge, and the identification of victims, in the course<BR>
   of their duties.<BR>
c) They should avoid, or challenge, the myths and stereotypes which surround<BR>
   children, and particularly children from developing countries. For instance, the<BR>
   myth that parents in developing countries do not value their children; that girls<BR>
   are inferior to boys; that children are drawn into vice through their own fault;<BR>
   or that sex tourism alleviates poverty for the victim, or the host nation.<BR>
d) Media professionals should recognise that freedom of expression must go hand<BR>
   in hand with other fundamental human rights, including freedom from<BR>
   exploitation and intimidation. They should give careful consideration to the<BR>
   facts when weighing up the relative merits of the different claims, and not<BR>
   allow themselves to be swayed by commercial or political considerations.<BR>
e) Journalists should never publish details which help exploiters to find their<BR>
   victims, or which undermine the safety of child victims. Journalists should take<BR>
   particular care not to reveal information which could lead to the collapse of<BR>
   criminal proceedings against exploiters.<BR>
f) Journalists and programme-makers should look for innovative ways to respect<BR>
   the dignity of child victims, and avoid identifying them, while at the same time<BR>
   telling their stories in a compelling and newsworthy way. For instance, by<BR>
   consulting them on the content or showing ways in which they can escape from<BR>
   their situation.  They should try to focus attention not only on the victims of<BR>
   commercial sexual exploitation, but on the perpetrators and clients.<BR>

<P><B>4. The Need for Newsroom Debate</B><BR>
a) A constructive and supportive debate should be encouraged between media<BR>
   professionals, about how this issue should be investigated and reported.<BR>
b) Media organisations should consider appointing specialist 'children's<BR>
   correspondents', with responsibility for covering all aspects of children's lives.<BR>
   Specific training to help journalists to express children's points of view. This<BR>
   might include: child growth and development, child abuse, risk factors,<BR>
   children's sexual terminology, the law, interviewing techniques, communication<BR>
   with children, etc.<BR>
c) New means of giving children access to the media, as 'sources' or<BR>
   commentators, should be investigated. Children should know that information<BR>
   or opinions offered in confidence will be protected as such.<BR>

<P><B>5. The Role of Management</B><BR>
a) Media editors and managers should implement -- from the top down -- a policy<BR>
   which makes clear their opposition to biased and sensationalist coverage of the<BR>
   commercial sexual exploitation of children, and their support for high ethical<BR>
   standards among journalists and programme-makers. This could be done<BR>
   through the elaboration, in consultation with media professionals, of ethical<BR>
   guidelines on this and other issues, which should be seriously implemented and<BR>
   monitored.<BR>

<P><B>6. Governments and NGOs</B><BR>
a) Governments or NGOs should support efforts by media organisations and<BR>
   journalists' associations to raise awareness. In this regard, good practice videos<BR>
   for editors and journalists would be useful.<BR>
b) In particular, support should be given to national women's media associations,<BR>
   such as those existing in many African countries, which are taking up the issue<BR>
   of media coverage of violence and violations of the rights of children.<BR>
c) National NGOs should consider compiling a directory of reliable experts on<BR>
   commercial sexual exploitation of children, and related topics, to be distributed<BR>
   to media. Such information could also be accessible on computer data banks.<BR>

<P><B>7.  Children and the Community</B><BR>
a)  Children, from primary school upwards, should undergo media literacy<BR>
    training, to help them understand and decode the messages they receive from<BR>
    both programmes and advertising, so as to become critical and well-informed<BR>
    media consumers.<BR>
b)  The public should recognise and use their power, as audiences and consumers,<BR>
    to affect media policy, for instance through lobbying and consumer boycotts.<BR>

<P><H2>Child pornography: an international perspective</H2><BR>

<P>
<H4><B>This paper was prepared as a working document for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children by Margaret A Healy for ECPAT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B><BR>

<P>Child pornography is a problem of international proportion.  The global community has recognised that children are at risk from those who engage in the production, exhibition, distribution, and consumption of child pornography and that children can suffer serious negative effects as a result of pornographic exploitation.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (&quot;UNCRC&quot;), which has been ratified by an overwhelming majority of the nations of the world, identifies child pornography as a violation against children and requires that nations who are parties to the convention take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic materials.  Despite the notable efforts of many nations, child pornography remains a serious issue.<BR>

<P>Challenges to any study of international child pornography include:  1) the lack of any uniform definition of what child pornography entails;  2) lack of data regarding the production and distribution of child pornography in many parts of the world, particularly Africa and Latin America; and 3) shifting global patterns of production and consumption of child pornography.<BR>

<P>Furthermore, the development of home video equipment and computer technology has revolutionised the international production and distribution of child pornography.  Rapidly expanding international access to increasingly inexpensive technology has transformed child pornography into a sophisticated cottage industry.  Computer alteration of images and the potential for creating computer generated pornography pose formidable challenges for courts and law enforcement officials throughout the world.<BR>

<P>This paper begins by providing a definition of child pornography, examining the scope of the problem, and describing the characteristics of both victims and exploiters.  It presents a discussion of the uses of child pornography and of the effects that child pornography may have on both child victims and on potential and actual offenders.<BR>

<P>The paper also identifies some of the major centres of global production and consumption of child pornography and spends considerable time discussing the impact of computer technology on the production and distribution of material that sexually exploits children. The remainder of the paper is dedicated to a discussion of individual national strategies designed to counter both traditional and computer child pornography through regulatory measures.  While only a small number of countries can be surveyed due to space considerations, this paper assumes that child pornography is a pressing problem on local, national and international levels and that all nations have an important part to play in the solution.<BR>

<P><B>I.	DEFINITION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><BR>

<P>The question of what constitutes child pornography is extraordinarily complex.  Standards that are applied in each society or country are highly subjective and are contingent upon differing moral, cultural, sexual, social, and religious beliefs that do not readily translate into law.  Even if we confine ourselves to a legal definition of child pornography, the concept is elusive.  Legal definitions of both &quot;child&quot; and &quot;child pornography&quot; differ globally and may differ even among legal jurisdictions within the same country.<BR>

<P>The legal definition of a &quot;child&quot; varies among nations.  The UNCRC defines a child as a person under 18 years of age.  This definition, however, is far from being universally adopted.  For example, in all Australian States and Territories, child pornography legislation defines &quot;child&quot; as a person under 16 years of age.  In Canada (Penal Code Sec. 163), a minor, for purposes of child pornography, is a person under 18 years of age.  In various jurisdictions of the United States (U.S.), minors as young as 15 may legally consent to sexual activity with an adult.  However, that same adult could not create, distribute, or possess a visual record of that activity because federal child pornography statutes (18 U.S.C. 2252, 2256) define a minor as any person under that age of 18 years.<BR>

<P>Despite national differences, some international bodies have been able to arrive at common definitions of child pornography, most of which focus on visual, rather than written material. The Council of Europe defines child pornography as &quot;any audiovisual material which uses children in a sexual context.&quot;		Council of Europe, <U>Recommendation R(91)11 and Report of the European Committee on Crime Problems</U> (1993).<BR>
  International Criminal Police Organisation (&quot;INTERPOL&quot;) delegates define child pornography as &quot;the visual depiction of the sexual exploitation of a child, focussing on the child's sexual behaviour or genitals.&quot;		<U>Interpol Recommendations on Offences Against Minors</U>, INTERPOL 61st General Assembly (1995).<BR>

<P>For the purposes of this paper, recognizing that each country's legal definition of &quot;child&quot; may be different, the term &quot;child pornography&quot; will refer to a &quot;sexually explicit reproduction of a child's image.&quot;		Kenneth V. Lanning, <U>Child Molesters:  A Behavioural Analysis</U> 24 (1992).  Child pornography is to be distinguished from &quot;child erotica&quot; which is &quot;any material relating to children that serves a sexual purpose for a given individual.&quot;		<U>Id.</U> at 26.  Child erotica includes such items such as toys, games, children's clothing, sexual aids, manuals, drawings, catalogues, and non-pornographic photographs of children.  Child erotica is not illegal but is frequently used by prosecutors as corroborating evidence in cases against child molesters		Some experts distinguish &quot;sexual molester&quot; or &quot;abusers&quot; from &quot;sexual exploiters&quot; employing the term &quot;sexual exploitation&quot; to describe only commercial interactions or to distinguish extra-familial abuse from that which occurs within the family.  The terms &quot;child molester&quot; and &quot;child abuser&quot; will be used interchangeably in this paper to denote a significantly older person who engages in sexual activity with someone who is legally a child.  The term &quot;child exploiter&quot; will include those who sexually molest children as well as those who sexually exploit children through the production, distribution, and/or collection of child pornography. or child pornographers.<BR>

<P>The definition of child pornography, in some countries, is harm-based.  For example, U.S. law, which is characterised by an elaborate commitment to the protection of free speech, has addressed the issue of child pornography from the perspective of preventing harm to child victims rather than censoring expression.  Child pornography is criminalised in the United States because it represents &quot;the permanent record of the sexual abuse or exploitation of an actual child.&quot;		Lanning, <U>supra</U> note 3, at 24.  As stated previously, it may be legally permissible to engage in sexual activity with a 16 or 17 year old in some jurisdictions.  The filming of that encounter would be illegal under federal law but the depiction could not be considered a record of the abuse of a child.  The Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act (1993) promulgated in New Zealand makes similar reference to child pornography as a &quot;permanent recording of the exploitation of children or young persons for sexual purposes.&quot;  The approaching technological capacity to produce lifelike computer generated pornography will challenge such harm-based definitions of child pornography.<BR>

<P><B>II.	SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM</B><BR>

<P>Child pornography is an international phenomenon.  Most of the data that exists regarding the extent and nature of the problem has focussed on North America and Northern Europe--regions which have played a key role in the production, distribution and consumption of child pornography.		&quot;The U.S. market for child pornography is widely thought to be the most lucrative in the world.&quot;  <U>Child Pornography and Paedophilia: Report Made by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. Senate</U>, 99th Cong. 2d Sess. 34 (1986) [hereinafter U.S. Senate Report].  In developing countries, the reality of child pornography is dwarfed by the magnitude of other problems such as poverty, infant mortality, illiteracy, hunger, and disease and often there is little reliable data on the subject.  Nonetheless, the pornographic exploitation of minors is a phenomenon that exists throughout the world.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>1.	Identifying the Victims</B><BR>

<P>Girls and boys of all ages, including infants, are used to produce pornography around the world.  Estimates of the number of children worldwide involved in child pornography range from thousands to hundreds of thousands.  While impossible to obtain accurate data, a perusal of the child pornography readily available on the international market indicates that a significant number of children are being sexually exploited through this medium.<BR>

<P>As to the gender of the victims, Federal Bureau of Investigation (&quot;FBI&quot;) personnel estimate that over 50% of all child pornography seized in the United States depicts boys rather than girls.  Canadian Customs puts that figure at 75% for Canada.		The data regarding childhood sexual abuse in most countries, including the U.S. and Canada, does not reflect the same predominance of boy victims.  Virtually all studies have found higher sexual abuse rates for girls.  Ann Wolbert Burgess &amp; Christine A. Grant, <U>Children Traumatised in Sex Rings</U>, 4 (1988).  In contrast, in Japan, it is female minors that are predominantly exploited in pornographic material.  The gender of the child victims displayed via computer networks is constantly in flux and difficult to determine with any precision.<BR>

<P>In most countries, street children, poor children, juveniles from broken homes, and disabled minors are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and to being seduced or coerced into the production of pornographic material.  These children, however, are not the only victims. Sex exploiters frequently target neighbourhood children or those with whom they have contact through their vocation or avocations.  Additionally, pornographic activity is a common part of life for teen prostitutes.  Finally, in many countries, including developed nations, child victims may come from homes where their own parents use them to create child pornography or where their parents offer them to others for the same purpose.<BR>

<P>Sex rings, which involve the simultaneous sexual exploitation of more that one child but are not necessarily commercial, exist in many countries and frequently involve the use of children in the creation of pornographic material.  In the United States, they consist largely of loosely organised child abusers.  According to one 1989 study, 31 sex rings were identified by police in the United Kingdom over a two year period in a geographically defined population of 710,000.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Identifying the Exploiters</B><BR>

<P>Child exploiters and pornographers represent a cross-section of the larger community including highly esteemed members of the population.  Furthermore, they frequently seek occupations that bring them into habitual contact with children.  Producers (including photographers, publishers and creators of home videos), middlemen (including procurers and parents), distributors, (including advertisers and those who trade) as well as child pornography collectors, are included in the category of exploiters.<BR>

<P>Paedophiles constitute a significant sector of the offenders.  The American Psychiatric Association defines paedophilia as a disorder in which an adult's primary sexual attraction is to prepubescent children, generally age 13 and under.		American Psychiatric Association, <U>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders:  DSM-IV</U> 527-28 (1994).  Because this is a psychiatric diagnosis, and because it is impossible to fix pubescence at any exact age, law enforcement agents often employ a broader definition of paedophilia to include adults with a sexual preference for individuals legally considered children.		Lanning, supra note 3, at 2.  This paper employs the broader law enforcement definition with the understanding that the definition may include a large number of individuals with an attraction to pubescent teenagers--a condition which is not considered a psychiatric disorder in most countries.  Additionally, the broader definition does not concentrate attention on a sector which societies consider &quot;abnormal&quot; while ignoring a much larger segment of society that may participate in the production and consumption of pornography.<BR>

<P>Some paedophiles are attracted to children of the same sex, but the majority of paedophiles are heterosexual.  Additionally, it is important to note that not all paedophiles are child molesters and that many child molesters are not paedophiles--even under a broad definition. The term &quot;preferential child molester&quot; can be used to distinguish those paedophiles who act on their impulses and sexually abuse children from those who simply fantasize about sexual activity with children.<BR>

<P>Child pornography serves significant purposes for both paedophiles and child molesters. Preferential child molesters often possess large collections of child pornography that are meticulously catalogued and carefully guarded.  They, however, are not the only ones who produce or consume child pornography.  A much broader segment of the population is interested in pornography featuring pubescent children in their teens.  Additionally, with the emergence of the use of computers to traffic in child pornography, a new and growing segment of producers and consumers is being identified.  They are individuals who may not have a sexual preference for children, but who have seen the gamut of adult pornography and who are searching for more bizarre material.<BR>

<P><B>III.	GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><BR>

<P>The worldwide flow of pornography is difficult to describe with any precision but a brief examination of some of the major international production centres offers a sense of the global supply and demand.  In Asia, Japan is the most important centre for the commercial production of child pornography, producing a significant and increasing amount of &quot;teen pornography&quot; that depicts young Japanese girls in sexually explicit poses in teen magazines.		Peter Constantine, Japan's Sex Trade: A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures 184-88 (1993).  Japan also produces millions of erotic comics that are targeted at young students and readily available in vending machines in most Japanese cities.  Japanese child pornography reflects a special appeal for sex with Japanese girls who are often depicted in school uniforms.  Pornography involving pre-pubescent children is also available commercially in Tokyo.<BR>

<P>Japanese child pornography is distributed in Asia and worldwide.  U.S. law enforcement officials in California report seizing material depicting the exposed genitals of pre-pubescent Japanese children.  Canadian Customs reports that pornographic materials involving Japanese children are found in the possession of crew members of Japanese cruise ships. Japanese child pornography is also circulating on the Internet.  The Yakuza, Japanese organised crime, previously controlled the sex industry in Japan.  Some commentators report that tough Japanese anti-mob laws, however, have loosened the Yakuza's grip in recent years.		<U>Id.</U> at 13-14.<BR>

<P>The early 1970's marked the heyday of commercial production of child pornography in the Western world.  Denmark, Holland, and, to a lesser extent, Sweden, were the main centres of production in Europe.  Most of the children depicted were Caucasian.  Many who were featured in European child pornography magazines were photographed in the United States and the photos were published in magazines assembled abroad.  Some of the material produced in Europe during the 70's, however, included children from India and Mexico and one series included black children from Africa.		Telephone interview with R.P. (Toby) Tyler, Sheriff's Sergeant, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department (March 1996).  By the mid-70's, commercially distributed child pornography became widely available in the United States and Europe.<BR>

<P>The late 1970's and early 80's brought increased governmental regulation, first in the United States and later in Europe.  As a result, commercial distribution is no longer a major means of circulating such material.  The majority of child pornography disseminated internationally is, in fact, exchanged between paedophiles and child molesters without any commercial motive.  Furthermore, while there is evidence that organised crime is involved in adult pornography, the same is not generally true in regard to child pornography.		Pornography produced using underage models resembling adults (sometimes referred to a &quot;technical&quot; child pornography), however, accounts for a small portion of pornography controlled by organised crime.<BR>

<P>&quot;The overwhelming majority of child pornography seized in the United States has not been produced or distributed for profit ...  Instead, the cost must be measured in terms of the sexual exploitation of children represented by child pornography, and the sexual abuse of children to which child pornography is a central contributing factor.  It is not necessary to view child pornography as a hugely lucrative, organised crime-controlled underground in order to appreciate the scope of the damage to society caused by this reprehensible practice.&quot;		U.S. Senate Report, <U>supra</U> note 7, at 43.<BR>

<P>While it is true that the availability of commercial child pornography has declined, there are those who continue to profit from its production and distribution.  Commercial production and consumption still exists in both Europe and the United States, as well as in Japan. Additionally, &quot;amateur&quot; pornographic material is being produced in many countries including Mexico, the Philippines, and Brazil (often utilising street children) for importation into North America.		The distinction between &quot;amateur&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; child pornography is far from clear.  Once child pornography enters the public sphere, even if by trade or gift, it becomes available to anyone who chooses to use it for monetary gain.  Liz Kelly, et al., <U>Splintered Lives: Sexual Exploitation of Children in the Context of Children's Rights and Child Protection</U>, 16 (1995).<BR>

<P>A further source of child pornography distributed worldwide is that created by sex tourists who travel to other countries to have sex with minors.  Most of the child victims of sex tourism reside in the developing nations of the world.  In March 1996, a court in Thailand convicted a German national of child molestation and production of pornography for commercial purposes; he was involved in a child pornography ring which exploited Thai children.		Letter from the International Cooperation In Criminal Matters Division, Office of the Attorney General, Thailand (March 20, 1996).  Until approximately two years ago, a sizable portion of the pornography seized in Sweden and in the Netherlands was produced by sex tourists visiting Asia.  Some of that material has now been replaced by child pornography produced in Eastern Europe.		Telephone Interview with Helena Karl&eacute;n, Swedish Save the Children (March, 1996) Members of the military assigned to other countries have also played a role.  According to the U.S. Justice Department, military personnel stationed in Guam and the Philippines have been prosecuted for possession of child pornography.  Often the same personnel have participated in the production of the material.<BR>

<P>The development of new technology has made a tremendous impact on the international production and distribution of child pornography.  The first important leap in technology was the video camera.  Video cameras and camcorders are now less expensive and are relatively common in many homes in industrialised countries.  Because the recording media does not have to be commercially processed, and can be easily duplicated, individuals enjoy complete privacy.  As a result, amateur pornographic videos have become increasingly common.<BR>

<P>In the United Kingdom, detecting the possession and distribution of pornographic home videos featuring children continues to be an important priority of law enforcement officials. Likewise, most of the new child pornography currently seized by the U.S. Postal Service is still contained in homemade videos.  U.S. officials believe, however, that with the advent of advanced technology, it will be just a matter of time before this amateur materials will be available on the Internet.<BR>

<P><B>IV.	THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY</B><BR>

<P>Computer technology has transformed the production of child pornography into a sophisticated global cottage		The term is used here to denote that technology has facilitated the production and distribution of child pornography in the home. industry.  Anyone who has access to a computer and a modem potentially has access to commercial on-line services and to the Internet, a remarkable global network of nearly 30 million persons joined by computers.  Among many other things, such access means that it is possible both to send and receive pornography.  The Internet is becoming an increasingly significant factor in child sexual exploitation and the development of increasingly inexpensive personal computers and modems has given ascent to what is rapidly becoming the most important exchange medium for child pornography.<BR>

<P>A brief review of the new computer technology and its possibilities will offer an idea of the revolution that has occurred.<BR>

<P>Pictures can be scanned and video clips can be captured into a computer without any loss of quality either over time or when copies are made.  It is now possible to attach these images and video clips to e-mail text.  Non-colour digital cameras are available in the United States for US$99 and colour scanners (devices that can convert photographs, slides, negatives, and text into computer characters) for US$200.  A video capture device is available for US$129.  This device makes it possible to record images from a video camera or a VCR directly into the computer.  A new generation of &quot;Internet dedicated&quot; computers are being developed with a targeted price of US$500.<BR>

<P>
<P>Anonymity is available on the Internet.  A user can manufacture virtually any identity and route a message from Pennsylvania, through Australia, to Germany and then to Kansas where it would be impossible to determine the origination.  It is also possible to re-route e-mail and images through what are referred to as &quot;anonymous remailers.&quot; These take incoming messages and remove the source address, assign an anonymous identification code number with the remailer's address, and forward it to the final destination.  Responses to the anonymous messages are then similarly encoded and the responder likewise remains anonymous.  The most popular of these &quot;remailers&quot; among on-line paedophiles is located in Finland.<BR>

<P>The industry is experiencing a rapid development in cheap, user-friendly encryption software which is employed by child pornographers.  Decoding the files is often extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies.<BR>

<P>The Internet can be used to make contacts with other paedophiles and child molesters and is used to distribute home made and commercial child pornography around the world.  An individual may now trade and/or sell images of almost any kind from one end of the world to the other.<BR>

<P>Even if law enforcement officials discover the image, the ability to distribute it may not be impaired.  Once an image is introduced on the Internet, it can be downloaded by any number of users and can be reproduced repeatedly without any loss of quality.<BR>

<P>Advanced technology is making transmission increasingly faster.  High speed modems of 28,800 bits per second (&quot;BPS&quot;) are currently available but soon it will be possible to boost that capacity to 550,000 BPS via high speed modems using cable television wire.  This is significant because transmission and downloading of images can be time consuming and therefore costly.<BR>

<P>Computer bulletin boards can be set up exclusively to exchange information about sexual interest in minors or specifically to allow for running conversations by computer on such subjects.  Monitoring of such sex oriented bulletin boards has indicated that these boards receive thousands of calls.  In most countries, neither licences nor registration for bulletin boards is required.<BR>

<P>Letter writing by paedophiles, extensive in the past, is now being replaced by much more rapidly transmitted computer conversations.		Despite increasing use of computers by paedophiles, according to the U.S. Postal Service, pornographers still rely heavily on the mails to exchange video tapes and computer diskettes.<BR>

<P>Computers now come with built in microphones and speakers and will soon be routinely equipped with cameras.  Monitors also frequently come with built-in speakers and microphones.  This equipment will enhance the capacity for production and distribution of home videos.<BR>

<P>Images can now be altered by computer.  For example, it is not difficult to add objects to an image.  One can also delete objects or parts of a photo.  An individual may superimpose a child's face on an adult's body, erase pubic hair or facial hair, and reduce and minimise breasts so as to make adult images look like children.<BR>

<P>While it is still impossible to create entirely computer generated images that appear lifelike, it is, however, possible to insert digital images of a person into a video in which they have not appeared.  Technology will soon be able to facilitate the creation of lifelike child pornography without using any real children at all.<BR>

<P>Furthermore, on-line capability greatly increases the possibility of extended contact--up to hundreds of hours--with children, by child molesters or paedophiles.  Sex exploiters have easy access to children via computer--especially lonely or troubled teens--by tuning into chat sessions, such as Internet Relay Chat, and making contact with children.  The most commonly used technique for seducing the child into sexual activity is by capitalising on the child's natural need for attention, affection and approval.  According to the FBI and other law enforcement agents, a small but rising number of these computer relationships end up with actual contact and sexual activity with the teen.<BR>

<P>The problem of computer child pornography involves persons who have the time, the resources, the intelligence and perhaps a compulsion to acquire expertise in the technology. They are from every walk of life.  Children in many developed countries are some of the most sophisticated computer operators.  They have grown up with computers and have often far surpassed their parents in expertise.  These children already have fairly easy access to computer child pornography and are potentially accessible through the Internet and some commercial on-line services to those who wish to sexually exploit minors.  In addition, software programs which are designed to block children's access to questionable material are capable of being defeated by children who have acquired advanced computer skills.<BR>

<P>Computerised child pornography is of the highest concern in industrialised countries where computers have become commonplace in schools, in the workplace and in the home.  Access to computers, however, is increasing globally.  In Australia, according to a 1995 survey, only about 10% of Australian residences had the necessary computer and modem for obtaining child pornography on line.  Nonetheless, Australian law enforcement officials agree that as computers become more available and user-friendly and as the computer literate population steadily rises, the use of home computers to produce and distribute child pornography will increase.<BR>

<P><B>V.	USES OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><BR>

<P>Experts cite several reasons why individuals collect child pornography.		U.S. Senate Report, <U>supra</U> note 7, at 10-12.<BR>

<P>1.	Arousal and gratification:  Individuals use pornography to stimulate their sexual drive and to aid in sexual stimulation.  Some may only fantasise and others may use it as a prelude to actual sexual activity with minors.<BR>

<P>2.	Validation and justification of paedophile behaviour: The paedophile uses pornography to convince him/her self that their behaviour or obsession is not abnormal, but is shared by thousand of other sensitive, intelligent and caring people.<BR>

<P>3.	To lower a child's inhibitions:  Child abusers use pictures of other children having sex to assist in the seduction of a child and encourage reluctant children to freely participate.  Images are often used as a way to show a child what the offender wants the child victim to do.  Pornography may be used under the guise of &quot;sex education&quot; to create sexual arousal in the child.<BR>

<P>4.	Preservation of the child's youth:  Child pornography ensures that there will always be an image of the child at the age of sexual preference.<BR>

<P>5.	Blackmail:  Sexually explicit images are used to ensure the lifelong silence of the victimised child by threatening to show the pictures to parents, peers or others.  Child victims will not always report pictorial records--even if they report sexual abuse--because they may be ashamed of what happened to them as well as of their participation in the pornography.<BR>

<P>6.	A medium of exchange:  Child pornography is used as a means of establishing trust and camaraderie with other paedophiles and molesters and as proof of their good intentions when establishing contact with other exploiters.  It is a medium of communication with fellow exploiters in public and private sex markets.<BR>

<P>7.	Access:  Some exploiters exchange pornography to gain access to other markets and to other children.<BR>

<P>8.	Profit:  Although most do not sell child pornography, there are some paedophiles and child molesters who sell home-made videos and photos on a one-to-one basis.  Some child exploiters sell their self-produced materials to finance trips overseas to popular sex tourist destinations.<BR>

<P>
<P>Arguably then, child pornography does not merely involve the abuse of the individual child victim depicted, but rather can be used to perpetuate the sexual exploitation of other children who have not been pornographically exploited.  Furthermore, child pornography serves to desensitise society and to send a message that children are legitimate sex partners.<BR>

<P><B>VI.	THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND CHILD SEX ABUSE CRIMES</B><BR>

<P>Considerable controversy exists within the social and behavioural science community about the negative effects, if any, of child pornography upon the behaviour of potential or actual offenders.  The main reason for the debate is that it is virtually impossible to conduct research in the laboratory using standard scientific methods which yield statistically reliable results.  The constraints of ethical research, false reporting, interviewer distortion and a whole host of other problems contribute to the difficulty of acquiring scientific results.  Many researchers have come to the conclusion that there is no sound scientific basis for concluding that exposure to child pornography increases the likelihood of sexual abuse of children. Others have suggested that there is a consistent correlation between the use of pornography and sexual aggression.  Some social scientists interpret the research to indicate that the use of child pornography is a precursor to other sex crimes and that child pornography is fuel to feed the obsession of paedophilia;		<U>Child Pornography and Sexual Exploitation: European Forum for Child Welfare Position Statement</U>, 3 (Nov. 1993) [hereafter EFCW Position Statement] (citing studies that support this thesis). others conclude that it is a safety valve that prevents such crimes.		Kutchinsky, B., <U>The Effect of Easy Availability of Pornography on the Incidence of Sex Crimes: The Danish Experience</U>, Journal of Social Sciences, 29:3, 163-81 (1973); see Daniel Lee Carter, et al., <U>The Use of Pornography in the Criminal and Developmental Histories of Sexual Offenders</U>, Journal of Interpersonal Violence 207 (June 1987).<BR>

<P>Law enforcement agencies also have differing opinions.  In 1995, several Australian law enforcement agencies testified in hearings on organised paedophile activity that &quot;there was a significant likelihood that a person in possession of child pornography was also involved in sexually abusing children.&quot;		<U>Organised Criminal Paedophile Activity: A Report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority</U>, Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia 36 (Nov. 1995) [hereinafter Australian Parliament Report].  This view is not universally accepted, even in Australia.		<U>Id.</U>  It is well documented that paedophiles may possess extensive collections of child pornography. However, not all paedophiles who collect or view pornography sexually molest children and not all of those who collect child pornography can be characterised as paedophiles.<BR>

<P>What is clear, however, is that law enforcement agents have found that a significant number of arrested child molesters are in possession of child pornography.  One detective in the Los Angeles Police Department estimated that of 700 child molesters arrested over 10 years for extra-familial child sex crimes, more than half had child pornography in their possession and about 80% owned either child or adult pornography.  From 1986 to 1988, an organisation called Childwatch in England found that of the 27 child molesters convicted, 23% were using their child victims to make pornography and nearly all of the child molesters had child pornography in their possession.<BR>

<P>When discussing the relevance of child pornography to the sexual abuse of children, most experts note that it is important not to confuse the question of statistical line (i.e., whether some or many child sex offenders possess child pornography) with the separate issue of causality (i.e., whether possession of child pornography causes people to commit child-sex offenses).  While taking pains to acknowledge that there was no evidence of causality, however, a U.S. Senate Subcommittee investigating child pornography came to the conclusion that &quot;[child pornography plays a central role in child molestations by paedophiles, serving to justify their conduct, assist them in seducing their victims and provide a means to blackmail the children they have molested in order to prevent exposure.&quot;		U.S. Senate Report, <U>supra</U> note 7, at 44.<BR>

<P><B>VII.	EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY ON CHILDREN</B><BR>

<P>Many have argued that the distribution of obscene adult material is a victimless crime, that no one gets hurt and that what one does privately is his or her own business.  In the case of child pornography, however, where a real child is videotaped or photographed, there is always a victim.  The distribution of that depiction repeats the victimisation over and over again, long after the original misdeed took place.  Likewise, when the face of a child is superimposed on a sexually explicit photo, even though that child never participated in any sexual act, the distribution of the altered image arguably produces a similar effect.<BR>

<P>There are two ways in which children can potentially be harmed by child pornography--by being exposed to child pornography or by being filmed themselves.  Children who are exposed to pornography are in danger of being desensitised and seduced into believing that pornographic activity is &quot;normal&quot; for children.		EFCW Position Statement, <U>supra</U> note 22, at 3.  It can provide a kind of modelling that may adversely affect children's behaviour and result in learning experiences which connect sex to exploitation, force, or violence.		James Check, Teenage Training: The Effects of Pornography on Adolescent Males, in Laura Lederer and Richard Delgado, eds., The Price We Pay: The Case Against Racist Speech, Hate Propaganda and Pornography 89-91 (1995).<BR>

<P>The impact on the child victim who is exploited to produce pornography is often serious. Children can experience a myriad of symptoms including physical symptoms and illnesses, emotional withdrawal, anti-social behaviour, mood-swings, depression, fear and anxiety.  In a study of children involved in sex rings, all of whom were sexually abused, 54.8% of the children were used in the creation of pornography.  In these children, there was a significant relationship between involvement in pornography and a pattern of identification with the exploiter, along with deviant and symptomatic behaviour.		Ann Wolbert Burgess, et al., <U>Response Patterns in Children and Adolescents Exploited Through Sex Rings and Pornography</U>, American Journal of Psychiatry 141:5 (May 1984).<BR>

<P>Children who are sexually abused or exploited may be at high risk of becoming perpetrators or abusers themselves.		Note that there are those who reject the &quot;cycle of abuse&quot; theory because it is females who are more frequently sexually abused and yet males are responsible for the majority of child sexual abuse in most societies.  <U>See</U> Kelly, et al.., <U>supra</U> note 16, at 25-26.  Those who have been photographed may take drastic measures, for example, burning the house where the pictures are located or stealing back the record of their exploitation.  The media in some countries often confuses victims with perpetrators by publishing pictures of children who have been sexually exploited and blanking out the faces of offenders.  Those exploited children who enjoyed the attention or who were sexually stimulated carry special shame about their participation in pornography.  It must be emphasised that whether minors acquiesced to sexual exploitation, profited from it, or enjoyed it, they are always the victims of an unlawful and often destructive act.<BR>

<P><B>VIII.	THE REGULATION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B><BR>

<P>The easy availability of child pornography in the 70's led governments to respond by promulgating legislation that prohibited the production, sale and distribution of child pornography.  Most notably, the United States, in 1977, passed strict laws against child pornography with heavy penalties.  In 1980, both Denmark and Sweden put child pornography legislation into effect and the Netherlands followed in 1986.<BR>

<P>In 1984, the U.S. Department of State made diplomatic visits to the governments of Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark to enlist the assistance of these governments in eliminating child pornography.  In the same year, an NBC documentary, <U>The Silent Shame</U>, exposed international trade in pornography and was instrumental in pressuring governments to become stricter in their enforcement.  U.S. officials specifically credit this documentary with causing an immediate drop in foreign shipments during 1984.<BR>

<P>Since the mid-80's, according to law enforcement officials in the U.S. and Canada, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of new children depicted in commercially distributed pornography.		Much of the currently circulating material contains images reproduced from publications published in the 70's and early 80's.  UK law enforcement officials point out, however, that the mid-80's also marked the advent of the camcorder and a proportionate increase in the production of non-commercial amateur pornographic home videos involving new children.  However, commercial material recently seized in the United States contained images of new prepubescent children from Mexico and Brazil.  Some new commercial pornography material also involves underage teens.  A U.S. television programme, <U>Hard Copy</U>, televised a report in February 1996 on underage girls from the U.S. and Europe who are being photographed in Holland by a company that produces the erotic <U>Seventeen</U> magazine.  The girls, according to a pediatric specialist applying the <U>Tanner</U> scale,		The <U>Tanner</U> scale is a scale for identifying the stages of development in pubescent children. ranged in age from 13 to 18.<BR>

<P>Commercial production, while diminished, does however continue to exist and, as stated previously, is on the rise in Japan.  Furthermore, the production of amateur child pornographic home videos is becoming increasingly popular--even in the commercial market. A review of child pornography legislation promulgated by different countries around the globe reveals something of a trend towards an increasing commitment to the protection of children from pornographic exploitation.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Laws Regulating the Production, Distribution and Possession of Child Pornography</B><BR>

<P>The UNCRC provides a baseline international legal standard for the protection of children from sexual exploitation.  Article 34, among other articles which prohibit the degrading treatment of children, explicitly requires countries to take &quot;all appropriate national, bilateral, and multilateral measures to prevent ... the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity ... [and] the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.&quot;  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights' <U>Programme of Action for the Prevention of the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography</U> reinforces the UNCRC and international efforts to sanction those who exploit children for pornographic purposes.<BR>

<P><B>1.1.	Asia and the Pacific Rim</B><BR>

<P>Article 175 of the Japanese Penal Code forbids the printed portrayal of adult genitals, intercourse and pubic hair.  However, such representation of children's genitalia is not stringently regulated.  Furthermore, Japanese commercial producers have created ingenious ways to avoid prosecution or law enforcement intervention by creating sexually explicit materials which just barely avoid depiction of forbidden body parts.		Jack Seward, ed., Japanese Eroticism 6 (1993); Constantine, <U>supra</U> note 11, at 160-61.<BR>

<P>Several other Asian nations have recently adopted child pornography laws.  In 1995, Taiwan passed a law criminalising the production of paintings, video tapes, photographs, CD-ROMs, &quot;electronic signals&quot; and other products depicting indecent conduct or sexual interaction involving persons under 18 years of age.  The 1993 child protection law passed in the Philippines (Republic Act No. 7610) includes a provision which prohibits the employment or coercion of children under 18 years of age to perform in obscene exhibitions or indecent shows, whether live or video, or to model in obscene publication or pornographic materials. It also imposes sanctions on the sale or distribution of such materials.<BR>

<P>Sri Lanka (Penal Code Sec. 286A) passed similar legislation in 1995 which protects children up to 18 years of age.  In Cambodia, a draft proposal (Law on the Abolition of Child Trafficking and Prostitution, Art. 9 A I, ii, iii) for a law against child exploitation includes a provision which prohibits the production, possession, importation, exportation or advertisement of drawings, paintings, writings, photographs, or films which depict persons under 18 years of age in an indecent, obscene, or derogatory manner.  The draft law also contain a confiscatory provision (Art. 9B).<BR>

<P>In Australia, all States and Territories except New South Wales, have promulgated legislation which makes the mere possession of child pornography illegal.  Legislation already existed which makes possession for the purposes of distribution, sale, or exhibition against the law.  In 1995, the Australian Customs Service initiated a national intelligence project named <U>Amigo</U> enlisting the public in efforts to establish the nature and content of child pornography being trafficked in and out of Australia.		Australian Parliament Report, <U>supra</U> note 24, at 2-3, 38.<BR>

<P><B>1.2.	Europe</B><BR>

<P>Legal measures designed to deal with pornography vary considerably among European countries with no common approach to production, distribution, or possession of pornographic material.  In England and Wales, the law makes it a criminal offense to take, distribute, exhibit or possess even one &quot;indecent&quot; photograph of a child (Protection of Children Act 1978).  The law defines a child as a person under 16.  The determination of &quot;indecency&quot; is a matter for the court.  In the Netherlands, the manufacture, dissemination, transport and export of pornography involving children under 16 is illegal (Criminal Code, Art. 240b, Sec. 1).  In April 1995, the Code was amended to include stiffer sentences and to include sanctions for the mere possession of child pornography.  Norway's penal code was amended in 1992.  The section on child pornography applies directly to the introduction and possession of child pornography but not to the production of such.		Ellen Hamremoen, National Bureau of Crime Investigation (Nor.), <U>Contribution to Operational Case Feed-back</U> 3 (Nov. 1993).  In order to prosecute for production of child pornography, Norwegian prosecutors resort to other sections of the penal code relating to inducing minors to sexual behaviour and contributing to acts of indecency.  <U>Id.</U><BR>

<P>Section 207a of the Austrian Penal Code, passed in July 1994, imposes criminal sanctions for both commercial and amateur production and distribution of child pornography as well as for possession and/or acquisition of the same.  Germany also recently made possession of child pornography an offense under the German Penal Code.  France's Penal Code (Penal Code Art. 227-23) forbids fixing, recording, or transmitting the pornographic image of a minor and the distribution of that image.  None of the Eastern European countries, with the exception of Estonia (Penal Code Art. 200/3), however, have laws specifically directed at child pornography.<BR>

<P>Many European countries have very rigid mail secrecy laws and mail can be interfered with only under extraordinary circumstances.  Additionally, European postal authorities do not possess the police powers of U.S. postal inspectors.  Some countries have very strict penalties against sexual intercourse with a child, but very light sentences or fines for child pornography.  Furthermore, &quot;sting&quot; operations which are routine in the United States are not practiced in Europe.<BR>

<P><B>1.3.	North America</B><BR>

<P>The U.S. is widely considered to be a major consumer of child pornography but it has also been among the most aggressive in dealing with perpetrators through the passage and enforcement of strict child pornography laws.  These laws (18 U.S.C. 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2256) currently prohibit the production, receipt, distribution, possession, transportation, mailing and advertising of any &quot;visual depiction&quot; involving the use of a child under 18 years of age in sexually explicit conduct.  Sexually explicit conduct includes sexual acts as well as the &quot;lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.&quot;  A more recent law (18 U.S.C. 2258) makes it a felony for any person outside U.S. territory to produce or traffic in child pornography with the intent that the materials be imported into the United states--an extraterritorial application of U.S. law to non-U.S. citizens.<BR>

<P>Canada has a very comprehensive child pornography law.  Section 163 of the Penal Code makes it a crime to import, produce, print, or publish any child pornography which includes representations of children under 18 who are engaged in or who are depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity.  Furthermore, mere possession of child pornography is also now prohibited in Canada.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Regulation of Computer Pornography</B><BR>

<P>Since the advent of computer manipulated child pornography, several countries have passed legislation supporting an expanded definition of child pornography which includes &quot;simulated&quot; child pornography (where the person depicted is considered an adult by law but is obviously portraying a child) or &quot;pseudo&quot; child pornography which can be computer manipulated or computer generated pornography.  In the United Kingdom, the law explicitly prohibits &quot;pseudo-photographs&quot; which definition includes &quot;data stored on a computer disc or by other electronic means which is capable of conversion into a photograph&quot;.  (Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Sec. 7(8)(9)).  In Austria, the law prohibits not only real child pornography, but also material that suggests to an objective spectator that its production involved the sexual abuse of a child/minor.  Similar statutes in the Netherlands (Penal Code Sec. 240b) and in Canada (Penal Code Sec. 163) could be applied to computer generated pornography.  In the United States, however, the current federal child pornography statutes and most state statutes apply only to depictions of actual children and not &quot;pseudo&quot; or computer generated pornography.		The state of Virginia, however, has passed a statute which criminalises simulated child pornography in which &quot;a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being less than eighteen years of age in sexually explicit visual material is <U>prima facie</U> presumed to be less than eighteen years of age.&quot;  (Code of Virginia 18.2-374.1).  The same statute includes computer generated reproductions.  However, such &quot;pseudo&quot; child pornography may be prosecuted pursuant to federal obscenity statutes.  INTERPOL, in their October 1996 General Assembly, plans to adopt a resolution that will recommend all countries enact legislation that criminalises child pornography and that such legislation should include &quot;future forms of support such as computers and other virtual representations.&quot;<BR>

<P>Other countries have taken steps to regulate the transmission of sexually explicit material on the Internet.  Recently, a Munich prosecutor in Germany demanded that CompuServe block access to sexually explicit news groups on the Internet from its on-line service.  The government of Singapore has taken dramatic steps to regulate the Internet by demanding that all Internet servers be licensed by the government Singapore Broadcasting Authority.		<U>Singapore Sweeps Internet Clean</U>, Asia Times (Mar. 8, 1996).  This allows them to regulate not only pornography but all politically sensitive material.  Chinese officials have warned against Internet pornography and have recently visited Singapore to study their system of regulation.<BR>

<P>In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law in February 1996, makes it a felony to knowingly transmit &quot;obscene or indecent material&quot; over the Internet or on-line computer services if the material may be seen by children under 18. Immediately after the signing, civil liberty and free speech groups successfully sought a temporary restraining order to block its enforcement.  In Australia, three States have introduced bills to censor material on the Internet.  Because of the proliferation of inconsistent State and Territory laws, the Standing Committee of Attorneys General has agreed on the preparation of a draft bill suitable for a national scheme.  The passage of such legislation in many countries is controversial because it directly challenges the right to freedom of expression which is highly valued, particularly by the computer on-line community.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Legal Issues Raised by the Regulation of Computer Child Pornography</B><BR>

<P>Along with all the truly remarkable--even lifesaving--tasks which computers perform, the development of computers and the advent of on-line communication has introduced serious challenges into every area of the law.  Many questions have yet to be answered.  For example, in each nation across the globe, who is legally liable for material placed on a bulletin board system, an on-line service or on the Internet?  The individual who introduces the material into the system, the systems operator, the producer of the material, and/or the person who downloads it?  There are further questions.  In the case of pornography transmitted by computer, the origination of the image may be in a jurisdiction in one part of the world where the image is legal but it may travel to another where the image is patently illegal.  Should the global network be dominated by the strictest standard or the most tolerant?  Furthermore, should not consenting adults be able to engage in e-mail interactive chat sessions which describe &quot;objectionable&quot; materials since these same communications might not be criminalised it they were face to face, by regular post, or by telephone?<BR>

<P>The possibility of creating computer generated pornography has produced a myriad of additional legal issues that are difficult to resolve.  Civil libertarians argue that if computer generated pornography involves no real child victim, laws based on protecting children would no longer apply and regulation would be an unwarranted restriction of free speech. They argue that because there is no absolute scientific data that demonstrates a causal connection between the use of child pornography and the commission of crimes against children, there is no reason to restrict its transmission on the Internet.  They might also point out the difficulty of determining the &quot;age&quot; of a &quot;child&quot; depicted in a computer generated image.<BR>

<P>Child advocates voice the position that the harm of child pornography extends far beyond the individual victim.  They assert that children as a whole are the victims of computer generated pornography which displays child victims as sexual objects.  Many law enforcement officers argue that the harm reaches beyond the individual child when pornography is used to seduce other children.  They add that neglecting to prohibit computer generated child pornography could well re-establish the commercial trade--filling bookstores with computer generated images, de-sensitising society and fuelling demand for such material.  Additionally, if it becomes impossible to distinguish computer generated pornography from that which depicts an actual child, prosecution of &quot; genuine&quot; child pornography would become virtually impossible and child pornographers would be furnished with another avenue of defence.<BR>

<P><B>IX.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>Child pornography is a real and pressing problem that exists on local, national and international levels.  Directing educational campaigns and training towards parents, teachers, students, legislators, civil servants, child welfare agencies, the private sector and law enforcement personnel on a national level is an important step towards the solution.  These local efforts must be supported by global cooperation of an enormous magnitude.<BR>

<P>International exchange of information and training is vital.  The INTERPOL Standing Working Party on Offences Against Minors, initiated in 1992, is a good example of the kind of collaboration which is necessary.  Currently, the Standing Working Party includes law enforcement officials from 29 different countries who are actively collaborating in their efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of children.  &quot;Operation Starburst,&quot; the first major international operation against individuals using the Internet to trade child pornography, is a further illustration of international cooperation.  In 1995, this worldwide police operation resulted in the arrest of 15 offenders in Britain and a number of others in Hong Kong, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, Canada and the United States.		<U>Internet Is Spreading Child Porn</U>, Glasgow Herald, Nov. 21, 1995 at 7.<BR>

<P>Many members of the international community have not yet adopted legislation which is directed specifically at child pornography despite a global trend towards regulation.  All nations and international bodies, including funding agencies, must use their influence to encourage the promulgation of legislation that prohibits the production, exhibition, distribution and possession of child pornography.  In the 1980's, tough enforcement of child pornography laws in the United States and Northern Europe led to a conspicuous drop in the international distribution of child pornography.  Further progress can be made worldwide.<BR>

<P>When crafting national or local legislation, a delicate balance needs to be reached between a legitimate concern for the protection of freedom of expression and the equally legitimate and pressing concern for the protection of society's children.  Regulation of child pornography should not be used as an excuse to regulate free speech or information flow but rather regulation must be targeted at preventing the sexual exploitation of children who are among the most vulnerable members of society.  Lawmakers should be careful to draft and adopt laws which attract the broadest possible popular backing so that law enforcement agents will be supported in their efforts to enforce the law.<BR>

<P>Regulation of child pornography in the computer age presents special challenges that require considerable technical expertise.  Law enforcement officials around the world require technical training.  Governments must be willing to allocate funds for such training and the necessary equipment.  The establishment of an international resource organisation which would employ a team of specialists in the areas of investigation, law enforcement, behavioural science, prosecution, law and computer technology could be an invaluable resource for the global community.<BR>

<P>Finally, the protection of children must become a global priority and nations must commit their resources accordingly.  This protection includes a firm commitment to the detection and prevention of sex crimes against children and to the treatment of children who have been sexually exploited.  The World Congress has been called in order to promote such a goal and should provide a forum where countries affirm the norms for protection of children set forth in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<BR>

<P><H2>Prevention and psycho-social rehabilitation of child victims of commercial sexual exploitation</H2><BR>

<P>
<H4><B>This paper was prepared as a working document for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children by Jane Warburton and  Maria Teresa Camacho de la Cruz for the NGO Group for the Convention on the  Rights of the Child</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This paper is the product of a consultative process that is ongoing. It is based directly on the information contained in 20 case studies, prepared by non-government organisations, who are currently implementing programmes aimed at preventing the abuse of children through sexual exploitation, or assisting those who have suffered such abuse. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>They have identified national and local macro-level factors that render children vulnerable to exploitation. In addition, they have provided details of individual and family circumstances, which in combination, appear to heighten vulnerability. Poverty, relative and absolute, is a key factor in many situations, but it appears that it is its coincidence with other risk elements that creates a situation in which the sexual exploitation of children is most likely. These additional components include changing value systems, the commodification of individuals within societies, the existence of an underclass, because of ethnic differences or  wide disparities in economic status, family breakdown, and a societal ambivalence and contradiction in relation to the phenomenon of sexual exploitation. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This creates an environment, despite the widespread commitment, in principle, to child welfare and protection epitomised, for example, by countries signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child, whereby sexually exploited children frequently fall outside the welfare net. They may be punished, rejected and reviled, denied their rights as children, and denied an environment that offers an opportunity to develop and mature. For some, the consequences are life threatening--as a result of sexually transmitted disease, violence, used to secure compliance, or precocious pregnancies. For others, the experience of exploitation leaves physical, emotional and psychological scars that demand attention.</H4>
<P>
<H4> </H4>
<P>
<H4>The case studies give practical insights into the strategies that have been adopted by the non-government organisations, aimed at protecting the child from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation (Article 34, CRC), and/or the appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration (Article 39, CRC).  Many have stressed the paramount importance of creating a climate that is child-centred, that recognises and supports the rights and special position of all children, that understands the extent and nature of the abuse and its impact on the children. This appears crucial in terms of developing a political/legislative framework in which there is support for the projects, that promotes protection, that recognises commercial sexual exploitation of children as an abuse and encourages partnerships so that the childs needs are addressed holistically. This strategy would promote the reintegration of the children into their families and communities and enable the children themselves to start the process of regaining their dignity and sense of worth. This is the key element in affecting psycho-social recovery. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The specific approaches will vary as they take into account the particular social and cultural context, but all stress that services and activities must have regard for the childs innate worth, their right to be treated with dignity, and to have their voice heard.  It is apparent from the case studies that all concerned, politicians, decision makers, planners, and those working with young people, need to learn from the experience and reality of the children themselves. That is essentially the rationale for this paper. Knowing what has happened to them, understanding their responses to the abuse, and the services and programmes which they experience as effective, can inform us all, whether we are advocates, legislators, teachers, community activists or therapists.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>I.	BACKGROUND</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This report has been prepared at the request of the NGO Group on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to be one part of their overall contribution to the World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. It was envisaged as a paper that would bring together, and amplify the field experiences of a number of different organisations that were responding to the issue of the abuse of children through commercial exploitation, by establishing community based initiatives for prevention and/or rehabilitation. These case studies were to be based on a core of central information, the format for which was devised in consultation with practitioners. This was supplemented with any additional experiences, perceptions and analyses offered by the report writers, validated by their colleagues and the programme beneficiaries, that would clarify and help bring each unique situation to life. Through reviewing these experiences, it was hoped that a broader analysis of the problem and intervention strategies would be developed. As this would be informed by the reality of the childrens experiences and needs and remain firmly grounded in practice, it was anticipated that such an empirical approach would be of direct relevance to those establishing policies and procedures, as well as of immediate interest to other practitioners, seeking to establish or revise programmes aimed at changing for the better the lives of the children, their families and communities, that are touched by this issue. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The starting point for all those working with children involved in, or at risk of becoming involved in commercial sex, has been that this is a fundamental violation of the rights of children. This basic premise is enshrined within the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which defines a child as every human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier - Article 1. Article 34 requires signatories to protect the child from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation, and under Article 39, to take all appropriate measures to promote physical, and psychological recovery and social re-integration of a child victim ... in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child. This makes explicit that the concerns for children extend beyond their physical and practical needs. It recognises that there will almost always be psychological, social and emotional consequences for children subjected to abuse, neglect, and trauma. Appropriate rehabilitative and/or compensatory measures to restore these children will vary, but will need to take cognisance, explicitly or implicitly, of the reality of the childrens current situation, their external environment and their inner state, and the content and sequence of programmes or inputs that will assist them to regain a sense of psychological well-being and an ability to interact and function within their social milieu.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>II.	SELECTION OF PROJECTS</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>From the outset, the aim was to gather field information from many of the non-government organisations developing services and programmes to prevent and protect children from sexual exploitation, and/or to offer services to those who have already experienced abuse. This process involved the selection of twenty projects to write detailed case studies, providing specific information about the children and the communities in which they operated, their experiences, and the programmatic responses. Approximately 60 organisations, accessed through the network of contacts of interested organisations that were already known to the international organisations which formed part of the NGO Group, provided information about their situations, from which the twenty chosen. This account is, thus, based on the combined experiences that have been presented to us, representing programmes in all continents, across a wide range of social conditions and cultural norms, and responding to this dire concern with a range of intervention strategies. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The selection of the 20 organisations requested to prepare case studies was based on the need for geographic spread, the desire to include a range of different approaches and foci, the wish to provide smaller or lesser known organisations with the opportunity to present their work to an international audience and ultimately, on the organisations ability and willingness to devote sufficient resources to the preparation of a lengthy and detailed report within the necessary time frame. The resulting case studies provide an insight into what can be done in certain circumstances, the mistakes made, and lessons learnt along the way, by practitioners willing to share their experiences. They have provided a base from which some trends and directions can be identified, but in the full knowledge that these are not a complete picture of what is, or what ought to be happening in this field. They are based on work with children, aged from 8 years, (though the majority of programmes work with 12-17+ year olds), with both sexes, though the vast majority concentrate on working with females, over periods ranging from one year (APAP-Ethiopia), to 23 years (UNDUGU-Kenya). Some organisations have operated a pilot model, working with only a small fraction of the exploited children, (30 girls are currently engaged with the Slum Aid project, Uganda), while others offer programmes that have provided services to several hundreds or thousands of young people  (Casa de Passagem, Brazil; UNDUGU, Kenya).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>With the assistance of the practitioners themselves, a format for the case study that would provide a minimum of comparable data and experiences was developed. The aim of the instrument was to assist the agencies in identifying broad areas for inclusion while allowing sufficient flexibility to ensure that the unique or key features of a situation, or community, or programme response could be included. Details of the philosophy and orientation underpinning the work as well as information on the development of the programmes and practical steps taken to achieve objectives were included, alongside some assessment of impact and effectiveness. All were requested to consult and validate the contents of the reports with the children and young people themselves.  The case studies themselves will be incorporated into the final report.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This paper includes information from all of the projects that have written, or are preparing a case study, but the process of information gathering in many instances is still incomplete. Clarification of ambiguity, additional detail, and more analysis of impact are still being discussed. There are still gaps that hinder a fuller understanding of all aspects of the projects. The final report is intended to be very much based on practice, and the temptation to make assumptions, pre-empt the field responses, or reach conclusions and develop generalisations from insufficient data has been avoided. This process will have been completed prior to the preparation of that report, by August 1996.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>III.	TERMINOLOGY</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The aim of this study is to add to the information available, building on real situations and experiences, to provide greater understanding of the issue, and some insights into possible intervention strategies, that can be used and refined in other contexts. One of the problems that has hampered efforts to establish a broader knowledge base, which could inform and direct local, national and international policies and efforts, is the inconsistent use of phrases and terms. The discrepancies in the language used to describe and define the concerns create a lack of clarity about what individual programmes, policies, and objectives are actually addressing in reality. There are differences in the use of the terms child, young person, prostitute, prostituted, or sexually abused, victim, survivor, perpetrator, abuser, etc. While in some instances the differences are accurate and  relevant, in other cases, the language used may be considered inappropriate by others working in the field. It may be seen as conveying certain negative values and perceptions, and demeaning. The linking of the abuse of children through commercial exploitation, with incest, and other forms of sexual abuse, may be confusing when seeking to identify commonalities of approach and gather evidence about the scale of each concern. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The term prostitution is still widely used (but) there is growing concern that this obscures the nature of sexually abusive behaviour, unhelpfully focuses on a concept of informed consent and frames children as offenders rather than as victims. (Barnardos, U.K.)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>IV.	INCIDENCE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The universal comment from all respondents has been that there are no accurate statistics of the incidence of children who are currently being abused through sexual exploitation. Part of this problem clearly relates to the preceding paragraph. How can there be consensus in terms of the scale of the issue while there is a lack of clarity in defining exactly what it is that the various groups involved are referring to when they speak of the sexual abuse of children?</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Projects have been established in response to a perceived problem, but all of those working in the field have indicated that they are aware of just some of the victims. At times the problem has been clearly identified by community concerns, by individual referrals, or through associated issues, as in Uganda, where the problem became apparent in response to work being conducted on AIDS/HIV awareness.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There is a clear view that the numbers of children involved in the sex trade is increasing. Estimates, or guesstimates often include huge variations, but, even with the most conservative figures, the numbers represent hundreds of thousands of children whose lives and future prospects are being devastated by this dreadful phenomenon. NGOs, various writers and commentators have suggested the following:</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Thailand, (1996) 200,000 children involved</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Taiwan, (1987-95)  1978 children sold</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Nepal, 100,000 - 200,00 girls trafficked</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Philippines, (1995) 60,000 children involved in prostitution</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Brazil, (1992) 500,00 children in prostitution</H4>
<P>
<H4>		Chile, 50,000 working in commercial sex</H4>
<P>
<H4>		U.K., (1989-93) 1,800 cautions and 1500 convictions for offences related 	to prostitution amongst under 18 year olds.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>V.	INITIAL FINDINGS FROM THE CASE STUDIES</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The respondents have given broad outlines of the factors which create a climate, locally and nationally, which allows or condones the sexual exploitation of children, alongside more specific information about the particular characteristics of the abused children and their families. There are both differences and similarities illustrated in the case studies received to date, which will be assessed in greater detail in the later report. The following information gives the range of situations identified, the prevalent issues in different locations and some of the challenges faced.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.	Vulnerability Factors</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Who are the children that are victimised and abused through commercial sexual exploitation? What are the factors that indicate a high level of vulnerability and how is this related to the individual and family dynamics that combine to deny the children involved their rights? What societal factors, political characteristics and cultural ethos, combine to produce a situation in which the sexual abuse of children through exploitation occurs, is condoned and accepted?</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.1.	Macro-Level</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In providing details of the demographic, social, economic, ethnic and cultural mix of the national and local contexts of the projects, certain macro scale features have been identified as risk or vulnerability factors, that contribute to a likelihood of commercial sexual exploitation of children. These are critical factors in any subsequent or existing programmes that try to work to change opportunities and attitudes, whether of the broader community, families, or the child concerned. They include:</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Poverty, both absolute and relative. The large numbers of a population that are chronically disadvantaged economically, and for whom there is little access to opportunities for an alternative source of income, create a group for whom mere survival can precipitate their involvement in the sex trade. This may be self propelled. In many cases though it involves children being sold into brothels, by family, neighbours etc. This may be to repay debts or provide absolute essentials (India, Nepal), but it has also been seen as a means of providing relatively luxury items (Thailand). </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Poverty creates a situation where many children will not be in education, and/or where many will be involved in the labour market. Both factors would appear to independently indicate an increased vulnerability.  Many of the situations of children in the labour market, including domestic service, or living and working on the streets, deny them the protection of a family or of concerned and responsible adults. Some may be vulnerable to exploitation by other street dwellers, where sexual favours or services are demanded in return for a degree of protection from other gangs.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Consumerism/Materialism: The commodification of individuals, alongside the perceived attractions of the material rewards of life (Thailand), has contributed to a change in what might be considered appropriate levels of respect and concern within families, neighbourhoods, etc. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>As for our culture, we are a community which is losing its roots; today consumerism, individualism, and competition predominate... (G.A.N., Chile)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This change in values and attitudes allows a situation to develop, in which a parent might consider selling a daughter to a brothel, or intermediary, to provide them with certain consumer goods.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>..The greatest disaster and betrayal fell; my grandmother sold me. She sold me into the brothel for life for NT$800,000. At that time I was eleven years old; there were many things I did not know, and when they asked me to sign my name, I did so. This was my signature to a contract that sold me for life to the brothel owner. (Taiwan).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Poorly educated, marginalised sectors of society, which provide a steady source of children who can be coerced, forced and / or tricked, into the sex trade (Brazil, India, Thailand):</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Extremely poor sectors of the population carry on searching outside the system for ways to survive and constitute a subculture of poverty which reproduces and sustains itself. (G.A.N., Chile)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This may combine with the existence of other ethnic groups or different nationalities, whose access to resources is limited, and whose esteem, or standing within the country makes them particularly vulnerable. (Nepal, Taiwan, India, Brazil, Venezuela)  For this group, the protection measures or general respect that might be given to women and children based on a broad national consciousness or principles, is deemed irrelevant or unnecessary. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>A low regard for females, and the view that they are and can be treated as a form of property: They are denied a voice and equality in terms of protest or protection. (Nepal, Thailand, Brazil, Chile) In Nepal, the combination of their status and the demand from the commercial sex trade in neighbouring countries, has resulted in widespread trafficking of women and girls who are sold into brothels.  Seventy percent of girls interviewed in brothels in a Thai study had been sold once, with 25 percent sold for a second time and five percent for a third time. They subsequently suffer all of the consequences of this abuse and reap none, or few, of the financial benefits for the services they are compelled to render.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Weak, confusing, contradictory legislative frameworks that may contain provision for the protection of children<U>,</U> but where the sexually exploited child may be viewed as a criminal rather than a victim, or somehow treated as outside the category of children for whom protection is warranted (U.K., Ethiopia). An instance is the difficulties of prosecuting pimps and organisers in Chile where the offence would be one of corruption of morals, to which the fact that a child has been labeled a prostitute already would be considered a defence. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>	You cannot corrupt that which is already corrupted.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Government corruption: This may aggravate a confusing legislative framework, where those charged with enforcing certain protection measures, in fact benefit from the continued exploitation, economically or through demanding sexual services</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Weak political will which effectively colludes with the exploiters: Here the incidence of prostituted children may be regarded as an economic benefit which directly profits the exploiters, who are supporters of and in turn supported by the political decision makers. It may be viewed as a phenomenon that attracts foreign revenue through sex tourism and thus as an asset rather than a fundamental violation of childrens rights.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Cultural beliefs: In societies which combine some of the above factors with a belief in the restorative/healing powers of sex with a virgin, there will be a demand for younger children. Certain religious practices, eg the Devadasi system, although illegal in India, continues in certain places and involves or condones sexual exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The demand for sexual services: This may be created by large populations of unattached men, e.g. in military installations or construction operations (Philippines, Brazil) which attracts both vulnerable individuals for whom such opportunity may mean survival and those seeking to act as intermediaries for profit. The lack of regard for these women and young people is perhaps exacerbated by the lack of taboos regarding the treatment of women, boys and girls of a different nationality, ethnic origin, etc. While some know something of the reality of these situations, many others are coerced or tricked into involvement. The methods employed to induce children into the sex trade range from rape to threats of violence, to imprisonment and maintaining children in conditions of slavery (Philippines, Thailand). For others it is compliance with parental demands.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The AIDS pandemic has created a demand for younger children for sexual services, in the belief that they are less likely to carry the HIV virus. (Uganda, Thailand)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.2.	Individual / Family Risk Factors</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Within these broad categories there are children who are exploited and others that somehow avoid it. Which factors protect and which heighten the risks of children becoming victims of this form of abuse?</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Family breakdown: This category would include remarriage and poor relationships between children and step-families (Chile, Ethiopia), children going missing from home (U.K.), children being alienated from carers (UK) or being cared for by someone other than a parent (Uganda), and at an early age abandoning their home and family and trying to survive on the streets through whatever means are possible and available.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Parenting patterns may be inconsistent. In some families parents have been described as suffering from physical or mental illness, drug abuse and alcoholism. They may be living in desperately difficult and stressful circumstances, homeless, unemployed, mobile, unstable, the combination of which may severely limit their ability to care for and protect their children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Abuse at home: Children may have to leave the family home as a result of physical or sexual abuse from a family member. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>..The girl belonging to households in financial and social crisis, through poverty and social and cultural marginalisation, is exposed to high doses of intra-familiar violence. (G.A.N., Chile)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The lack of protection, sometimes coupled with a loss of self respect, a feeling of being damaged goods, makes the child an easy victim for others to exploit.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These youths must cope in isolation having to deal with the emotional trauma of abuse, rejection and neglect which may have led them to leave home. (Youth Link, Canada)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Out of school: Children that are not in education, for whatever reason, are vulnerable. Whether this means that they are working, or simply operating outside of the school system, they are more exposed to risks of abuse. In many situations female children are especially disadvantaged often from a very young age in terms of access to education. For many, employment as domestic servants is one of the very few opportunities for work. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>As soon as a girl is 6 years old she starts to accompany her mother .... and at the age of 8 she is old enough to work independently&quot; (India, Domestic Workers Movement). </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In India, seventeen percent of all domestic workers are below fourteen years of age. This group of children are living with and totally dependent on their employers, for whom their employees rights as children may never be consciously considered. In these circumstances, they are extremely vulnerable to being sexually abused and exploited. They frequently cannot complain or seek protection and frequently accept their fate, until perhaps they become pregnant or are thrown out of the house as corrupter of their employers, or their sons. At this point, a combination of a lack of alternatives and low self image can render them highly susceptible to further abuse within the brothels and prostitution networks.</H4>
<P>
<H4> </H4>
<P>
<H4>Right age group and sex: Although there are instances of very young children being abused through commercial sex, with one case study referring to children aged 8 on average, when they were first sexually abused (Chile), the majority of children involved with the case study projects are aged 12-17. The majority of the programmes work with girls but there are other situations in which boys are targeted or at risk of becoming involved in commercial sex.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Another family member involved: Whether through active recruitment, through increased awareness of the possibility or decreased resistance to it, where an older sibling is already involved in the sex trade, other children are more at risk of becoming involved (Thailand). This is not always the case.  There are reports of sisters and mothers continuing to be involved in or returning to prostitution, with the explicit aim of protecting other family members by providing materially, and thus reducing the economic pressures on the family.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Drug use: Some young people are induced into the sex trade as a means of financing their drug habit. Others use drugs subsequently, to deaden their awareness of the abuse to which they are subjected, and thus are hooked into the vicious cycle of dependence.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Many of the children that are abused through sexual exploitation are multiply disadvantaged or imperilled. The complexity of factors that impinge on an individual and their family, which combine to push, pull, force or maintain a child in a situation of being abused through sexual exploitation, or which somehow, conversely, protect them from the risks, need to be drawn out of the reports and assessed in more detail, to look at orders of significance, most dangerous combinations, etc. The abused child may be a child of war, a street child, or a disabled child in addition to being sexually exploited.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>..Most of these girls were from broken homes, ... ran away from the wrath of step mothers, from wars ... and had suffered ... rape, child abuse, etc (Slum Aid, Uganda).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The data needs to be compared with other research which has identified factors which engender resilience in a child, which might help protect the child either from involvement initially, or from some of the most personally damaging impacts of involvement, or which maximise prospects for ending the involvement and successfully re-establishing within their families or community.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>2.	Consequences of Abuse</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The basic premise that children have a fundamental right to their personal integrity and to freedom from exploitation and abuse, follows from an absolute acceptance that such violations of these rights damage and hurt the children concerned. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>All the agencies involved in the case studies referred to the distressing consequences for children of being abused in this way. These included physical problems, developmental problems, social problems, and  profound psychological and emotional problems. The children concerned have been described in some of the case studies, as suffering from a range of illnesses, including T.B., respiratory problems, headaches, exhaustion, from sexually transmitted diseases, from injuries resulting from violence, inflicted either by those involved in controlling and organising the sexual transactions, or from the immediate abusers, or resulting from self-harm. They may be malnourished, or debilitated because of the inevitable hazards of a poor living environment, of poverty, or from self-neglect. They may use drugs and alcohol. They have frequently been denied an opportunity for entering or continuing in mainstream education and have low academic attainment, coupled with its consequences in terms of future prospects and access to alternate opportunities for income generation. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The psychological and  emotional consequences identified include low self esteem, lack of confidence, self hate, feeling an outcast, unworthy, unloved, unlovable and feeling degraded.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Prostitution is written on my face. (Taiwan)</H4>
<P>
<H4>Prostitution is nothing because I am nothing.(Taiwan)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>They may lose trust in others and yet through an immense need for nurture, affection and support, enter into a series of other relationships that are abusive and exploitative. They may feel helpless and hopeless, accepting their fate as inevitable, with resignation and apathy, and have little regard to a future in which they see simply more of the same. Some may use drugs to lessen the pain and blur the perception of reality. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Our prostitutes need a hard hitting drug that can either block IT all out or that can remove IT totally. Only intravenous opiate abuse and crack cocaine seem to fill the order ... (South Africa).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Others have poor concentration, and loss of ability to structure and use time. They feel powerless and unable to affect change. Many have retained or adopted societal views of themselves as immoral and corrupting and, somehow, to blame for their situation. They survive in an atmosphere of violence and intimidation where their very existence can depend on compliance with their continued exploitation and abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>VI.	RESPONSES</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The non-government organisations that have completed their case studies define their programmes as preventative, therapeutic, rehabilitative, catalytic, enabling and facilitating. None operate entirely and exclusively with just one of these outcomes in mind.  All recognise the interlinkages and spill-over effects of their work but some see their area of expertise or arena of influence as predominantly in one field or the other.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.	Prevention</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>To most of those involved, prevention refers to a number of approaches. It includes raising awareness of the extent and scale of the problem of this abuse of children, of taking the issue into the public arena, rather than allowing the widespread taboos and restrictions on debate of sexual matters to act as a smokescreen which allows children to remain hidden victims. Ways of impacting on public attitudes have been explored that try to create an attitude that is supportive and nurturing of all children and intolerant of those that sexually abuse and exploit them. It also deals with reducing the numbers of potential victims by disseminating information about the reality of sexual exploitation, sharing techniques and skills for self protection and looking at the provision of alternative opportunities for those most at risk. To be effective it needs to take place within a legislative framework aimed at protecting the children, prosecuting offenders and with the expertise to sensitively and safely handle the disclosure of abuse, and within a context where these measures, both protective and criminal, are widely publicised and acknowledged.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Strategies</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.1.	Awareness Raising</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>As a starting point, information about human rights in general and childrens rights in particular, may be a necessary backdrop to more specific programmes aimed at preventing the abuse of children through sexual exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4>...Our whole organization is a permanent project whose purpose is to eliminate the violation of the rights of people under the age of 18 in Costa Rica. (Fundacion Paniamor)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Information about the nature of the abuse, its magnitude and its impact on its victims, is disseminated in a number of ways to impact on people at all levels of society. This would include targeting those populations from which children are recruited (Thailand), informing and thus pre-arming the children themselves and their parents (Brazil), influencing the politicians and decision makers generally, changing attitudes within the international audiences involved and concerned as potential tourists, donors, economic partners, etc...</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The aims of the project are....to raise awareness of agencies and decision makers of the issues, and to influence them to provide resources.(Barnardos,U.K.)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The way that information is presented, the terminology used, the medium chosen, all have an impact on the effectiveness of the message ( Casa De Passagem, Brazil). These include using publications, television, radio, drama and music. Teaching drama to the exploited children, to equip them with the skills to write and present dramatic representations of the dangers and consequences of sexual abuse is one strategy used to maximise both relevance and impact. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The drama on child prostitution is prepared in the form of a forum theatre with 8 actors, four of whom are themselves children involved in prostitution. It centres around the problem, causes and effects of child prostitution ... It has thus been a focal point for awareness creation workshops. (APAP, Ethiopia)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Efforts are made to influence professionals working in the child welfare field, so that they can act as resources for the children and communities at risk, work sensitively and positively with those already involved, and identify early indications that children are in danger, or already being abused.  Rights campaigns may exist independently from projects aimed specifically at the problem of sexual exploitation. Where they operate, they aim at heightening the recognition of children as a group with particular rights, needs and aspirations, and the broad duty of care and responsibility placed on the adult population, towards them. They may be concerned generally with trying to ensure that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is included explicitly or implicitly in the welfare legislation.  They may precede more specific campaigns aimed at childrens rights in respect of protection from sexual abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.2.	Information Gathering</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Understanding the nature and extent of the problem is often a pre-requisite for effective action. Until there is some clarity about the scale of the problem, its particular manifestation and its consequences, presented in a way that has meaning for the proposed consumers of the message, there may be little motivation or political will to address the issue (Philippines).  Despite broad statistics being used, while these remain inaccurate guesses, they can be more easily dismissed and ignored.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.3.	Advocacy</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Lobbying to ensure that those groups that are voiceless or powerless have their rights and concerns raised is important. Taboos and cultural gags that inhibit recognition of the reality of the abuse, create a climate in which there will always be a lack of support, funds and efforts to address the problem. If it can be viewed as an individual aberration, as a reflection of personal difficulties for a few children and their family rather than a problem reflecting a destructive and dysfunctional aspect of many societies, then the responses can be minimised, small in scale and impact and almost hidden. Efforts to change and improve legislation and to ensure that the full authority of existing measures is employed to adequately protect those at risk, etc., are all valid and effective prevention methods (Philippines, Costa Rica). In the Philippines such efforts have succeeded finally in criminalising sexual abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.4.	Network Building</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>In several locations, organisations have sought alliances and a network to develop broad-based  programmes, operating from a multi-disciplinary perspective. These may have a campaigning arm that makes full use of their joint influence and potential for publicity and media links for getting across the appropriate information about victims and exploiters. In addition, through recognising the complexity of the problem, the range of concerns and difficulties that result from this abuse for the children, their families and perhaps their communities, it combines expertise and skills to address them more effectively. It is also of enormous benefit in dealing with contentious issues, where the strengths of the alliance can respond more effectively to hostility and conflict (U.K., Brazil).  For instance, working with the media to present the subtleties of an approach in which policing and welfare agencies co-operate,  can sometimes reduce public hostility which targets the children. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.5.	Rescue Operations</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These operations, using lawyers, social workers, health professionals etc. and aimed at helping children escape from abusive situations, have both a preventative and rehabilitative component. As programmes accompanied by a high degree of publicity and popular support, these activities raise the profile of the victims and engender popular sympathy and support for those rescued and those who continue to suffer abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.6.	Community Based Initiatives</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>To enhance the resources of the local leaders: These may be aimed at populations from which many of the children involved originate, where using role play, story telling, drama and art community leaders are equipped to take responsibility for informing and training their own communities and enhancing self-protection (Taiwan summer/winter camps; Coletivo Mulher Vida, Brazil).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.7.	Use of Legal Systems to Prosecute and Protect</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Understanding the law, in both its roles, the protection of the vulnerable and the imposition of penalties for transgressors, has a dual impact. It increases awareness of the legal sanctions and protective framework, empowering the victims to take action. Such action has a potential deterrent effect, when the sanctions available to punish offenders are severe (Philippines) and restate social disapproval and intolerance of such acts. The project in Ethiopia has adopted a programme of increasing legal literacy through a team of para-lawyers, which includes children who have been sexually exploited.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.8.	Alternate Income Generation/Informal Education</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Both strategies are designed to provide choices for children and their families, where entry into the sex trade may be seen as the only available survival strategy. For children who are excluded from mainstream education, their future prospects and choices are severely limited and this downward spiral of opportunity diminution creates greater risk of being sexually exploited. Alternate education, perhaps with no fees, offered to children who are also working, with a capacity to recognise the needs for those who have missed a great deal of school or who are less academically inclined can maintain a childs hopes and chances for a more positive future.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some girls are not academically inclined, .... but when (they) return to school, the schools emphasize the need to pass examinations so strongly that it serves to make these girls feel more and more inferior (The Good Shepherd Sisters, Taiwan).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These primary prevention programmes seek to minimise the risks of children becoming abused through sexual exploitation, in a number of different ways. Some are pilot projects using experimental techniques for effectively and appropriately spreading the message and for providing children and adults with protection strategies and an awareness of the risks and consequences. In addition to the preventative component, almost all strategies aim at increasing the dignity and respect felt for children by others, and their own feelings of self-worth. This is a key element in programmes seeking to deal with the psycho-social consequences of abuse through sexual exploitation.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>2.	Rehabilitation</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Rehabilitation refers to the concept of restoration to a former state, in this instance to enabling the child to be free from the negative physical, psychological and social repercussions of the abuse to which they have been subjected. In fact in many cases it actually refers to an improvement on the pre-existing situation, by trying to increase physical well-being, elevating self-esteem and respect and providing self protection to a level not previously experienced.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Rehabilitation strategies may be implemented through a range of approaches and in a number of different settings, including residential care, street outreach, psychotherapy, family linking and community work. These are in addition to the positive impact for the individuals that occur as a concomitant of the preventative work described above. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>2.1.	Settings</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Residential Care</B></H4>
<P>
<H4><B> </B></H4>
<P>
<H4>Many projects recognise that children need shelter and a place of respite from the dangers and pressures to survive that are their daily experience working on the street. Many of the projects provide a space within which the children can feel safe and enjoy food, warmth, nurture and opportunities for self care (Kenya, Brazil). This can incorporate a prevention dimension, a sanctuary for children whose only alternative might be survival through selling sex. The access to health care, and  perhaps education, and skills training, that are incorporated into some of these facilities offers both practical help, but importantly, also help to restore to a child the sense of dignity and respect that has been denied. This has more to do with the way in which services are offered and delivered than simply a function of their availability.   The residential facility is seen by most as an inadequate response at best, removing children from the community to which they will have to return. Half-way houses, an interim stage between a residential facility and independence, where the children are equipped with skills and strengths to cope with the pressures of surviving intact, in a harsh environment, are one way of responding (Brazil). </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Children may resist the offer of a residential place, associating them with repressive means of dealing with the issue through placing children in institutions, using control and discipline. Children do not want to be coerced into care; their ability to make choices and to use the services in a manner and at a pace with which they can cope, may be critical in making the service truly available.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>.. the project is designed to increase acceptability of the service for the girls who are alienated from formal agencies (Barnardos, U.K.).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Outreach Work</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This includes both making contact and working with children within their own milieu, including the bars and beer halls, in the slums and red-light areas. In this setting, children are not pressured, but can access information, seek medical and legal advice, discuss alternative support systems and receive some attention and nurture for themselves as children first and foremost (Slum Aid, Uganda). In addition it may also involve contact with the families. At times, this is to confront parents with their responsibilities for their children and to maintain the links so that the children can eventually return (UNDUGU, Kenya).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This service may be complemented by drop-in centres, located within easy reach of the children, where they can rest, eat, wash themselves and their clothes and enjoy a degree of space, safety and privacy (U.K.). Many of these facilities operate from a multi-disciplinary base, with health, education, legal and counseling services available. They may be a centre for distribution of condoms and other contraceptive advice, helping children to avoid sexually transmitted disease or precocious pregnancy. Advocacy and networking with other services in the community are also key elements in enhancing access to appropriate services. For many there is a slow evolution in the type and quality of services requested by the children, which builds on the initial trust and respect established through the provision of practical support, to being able to deal with the pain of their experiences and their revised sense of self (Brazil).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It has been suggested though, that services which sustain children, might also prolong the time they spend in exploitative situations. Achieving a balance between this misplaced compassion and providing life-saving emergency shelter, is a critical dilemma for some organisations. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It is easy for a centre to lengthen the time the child will spend on the Street by cushioning its terrible realities from her.....<U>On the negative side, we have buried almost 200 girls over the past 5 years</U> (The House, South Africa).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Community Work</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Work within communities takes a variety of forms. Mobilising communities to develop and sustain a network of supportive relationships for children that have been sexually exploited appears to be a critical but challenging  step in the childs successful reintegration. Their acceptance and valuing within the community are powerful forces enabling the child to re-evaluate their own self image. This may be a crucial element in changing family attitudes, to allow re-entry into families, while strengthening their protection capacity. Establishing alternate income generation activities, trade training, building funding or credit facilities into the system, are also ways of trying to promote improved long term prospects for these exploited children and their families.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>2.2.	Psycho-Social Rehabilitation Approaches and Techniques</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The organisations in the case studies all recognised that childrens needs extended beyond the practical; they saw at first hand the pain experienced by the children and the emotional and psychological trauma that has resulted, but many have experienced difficulties in terms of resources and/or expertise, in fully meeting these needs. However, they are attempting to offer children a service that addresses at least some of their psycho-social needs. To do this they need to assess:</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>the nature of who the children are, looking at each childs experiences and his/her responses to them,</H4>
<P>
<H4>others within their social context; individuals, groups, systems, that have been crucial in defining the childs experiences, both positive and negative,</H4>
<P>
<H4>and how these interact. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The traumatic experiences cannot be isolated from their societal context and thus whatever treatment/therapy is offered, it must take the social phenomena that are the childs reality, fully into account. Programmes that fail to do so will be in danger of treating the child simply as a dysfunctional individual. This wider approach applies both in assessing the childrens past experiences and future options. It is essential to understand how the past has contributed to any current pathology and to assess coping mechanisms and resources. In looking towards the future these elements can be harnessed and integrated with the appropriate intervention programmes, to combine to help each child achieve an enhanced and healthy maturity.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>2.3.	Techniques</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Within all of these settings, the models of work that are seen as most effective look at the best ways of fostering the childs own sense of his/her worth. They incorporate three basic elements - teaching, healing and caring (Philippines). Through these they hope that the child can be helped to deal with the dysfunctional elements in their life. They frequently refer to the critical importance of listening to the children, responding to what they are saying about their own experiences, and what services and facilities they need. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>... An approach that is honest enough to respect and value the experiences and opinions of the young women who use the project will be one that engages their participation in the service (Barnardos, U.K.).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This may be within therapeutic, clinical situations, offering intensive, individual, long term psychotherapy, but generally such projects are not widely available. Their high cost and ability to impact on very few children, relative to the scale of the problem, probably limits their immediate replaceability in many parts of the developing world. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Providing group therapy allows for more effective treatment, especially at the adolescent stage, for more children within the same time frame (Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexually Abused and Prostituted Children, Philippines).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There has been some work on the application of such models, or at least of the utilisation of the insights learnt within these systems, to other settings, but the implementation, appropriateness, cross-cultural adaptability  and applicability of some of this work is still being tested (Radda Barnen, Sweden and Philippines).  Counseling, as it exists within many of the programmes, helps the child to see their experience as an abuse in which they are the victims or survivors, rather than as culpable and corrupting outcasts, removing the shame. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4>... I can only rejoice and keep on thanking and being grateful that I have escaped from my unhappy black underground experience, and moving ahead with courage to face a bright and clean future ... (Taiwan).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Again, such positive, affirming messages may be inherent in the everyday interactions of carers and children, rather than explicit, though it is extremely important for children to be clearly reassured about this and they may need to hear it directly.</H4>
<P>
<H4> </H4>
<P>
<H4>These children have frequently been labeled by much of society and officialdom as common prostitutes, as immoral, as degenerates. They have an enormous need to be seen and referred to as children or young people with rights, deserving of support and nurture. Sensitivity to what terms are used and to what jargon or slang become incorporated into the programme culture are essential. Terms used must be understood by the children, but the use of street terminology can perpetuate this poor self-image, or self-hate.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Counseling is also used to explore options and choices with the young people, allowing them to make informed choices for themselves (U.K.). For this to be successful, it has to proceed at the pace dictated by the child. Information may be perceived as value laden; it may be presented in a way that makes the child feel obligated to the counselor, and trying to double guess right answers, rather than making the correct choices for themselves. Decisions made in these circumstances are less likely to be acted upon.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some projects, working with children from ethnic minorities, have made use of positive role models, drama, etc., to change some of the negative stereotypes that have been taken on board by the children (Brazil). The mobilisation and equipping of the children themselves as agents for change, as actors, as advocates, as community organisers and as part of support networks for others, can all play a positive part in redressing the negative images to which many have been subjected for years. These skills may be transferable to many other situations, equipping the child with extra resources. But in itself, this experience of being helpful, of being powerful, of being recognised, is of tremendous importance in redirecting the children, in starting that process of reassessment of themselves, their position in society and their strengths (Brazil).  The use of art, drama and music, as mediums for the expression of experiences and the feelings associated with them are also recognised as valuable techniques, allowing the child to address their suffering in less direct ways (Chile).  They can operate on different levels, moving from a relatively superficial, but enjoyable and safe experience, to a profound, life changing catharsis, in which the use of these expressive media, can allow expression, healing and self-discovery.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Working with abused children is a demanding and difficult task, fraught with risks of rejection on both sides. Some of these can be minimised through allowing the child to be ambivalent about leaving the attachments, dangers and excitement that may have been part of their experience. They are old in experience and yet have been denied the opportunity to mature and learn through the successive stages of development. Young people that have dimmed their pain through drug use may find it both physically and emotionally difficult to stop and be confronted with their past without this cushion. It has to be recognised that these forces exert a huge impact on the child, opposing the efforts to help the young person change and adopt new activities and attitudes. It means taking sufficient time, or working at a pace that is appropriate for the child. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These children grow in phases and each time she tries she learns. With your help she can learn in progressive phases if she is guided not to see the end of a particular learning cycle as a failure (South Africa).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The factors that motivate people to enter this area of work vary enormously, but selection and training are vitally important in allowing flexible, dynamic programmes to develop and respond to changing expressions and levels of need (Brazil). A commitment to, and inherent belief in, the innate worth and rights of the children is crucial. Values range from the humanist, to the spiritual, to the political.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Our strategies and approaches might be the same as others, but one thing that sticks us together in providing help and care to these children, is prayer. This work can be, you and me against the world (Kalungan, Philippines).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some projects refer to the positive impact that finding a commitment can have for the children, though the commitment may be to serving god, to helping other victims, or to changing society and may or may not reflect the values of the programme staff, funders or supporters. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>VII.	IMPACT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Though there were specific sections of the case studies that referred to impact and evaluation of programmes, many groups have found it difficult to be precise about what, for them, constitutes a successful outcome, and many have struggled in clearly articulating or evaluating the consequences of their activities. This may be related to problems in identifying the specific impact of perhaps one element in a broad prevention programme of which they are only one part. Sometimes the difficulty appears to be based on limited follow-up with the children, and thus the organisations are unable to determine long term consequences for the individuals with whom they work. Many projects are fairly new and thus have only relatively recent experiences from which to measure and determine outcomes. Some projects establish clear criteria based on the child or young person staying out of the sex trade and classify any continued involvement as failure, regardless of any other changes for the young person. They are concerned that some of their efforts provide a child with the skills to make him/herself more attractive and useful to potential exploiters. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Others perceive broad benefits, which have an impact on whole communities, where the abused child becomes a survivor and activist and may go on to play a pivotal role in changing attitudes and the climate in which other children can be adequately protected. Others talk of decreased numbers leaving the villages for the city, as indicators of a positive outcome. Numbers in school, or alternate education, or vocational skills programme are all cited. Some speak more generally of changed awareness of the reality of sexual exploitation, and enhanced protection.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>... Another qualitative indicator is the effect CPCRs work has in terms of building the capacity of the family and organising the community in Akha village(s),.....and on the national level, .(it) is the acceptance by different disciplines of the usefulness of employing multi-disciplinary approaches to child abuse and the reform of the legal structure to provide for the protection of childrens rights (Center for the Protection of Childrens Rights, Thailand).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These are less easily quantifiable, but are clearly significant. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Discussions with the projects are continuing, to try to ensure that the childrens own views about outcome and impact are incorporated into any evaluation.  These will be included within the final report. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The importance of defining criteria and indicators, as a way of improving and developing programmes, often seems to be accepted more in the abstract than in reality. Establishing certain agreed elements as useful indications of achieving initial objectives, would be a valuable process that would facilitate an evolutionary/developmental approach, based on actual consequences. This in no way minimises  the difficulties in producing measurable indicators which have a relevance to the real problems, activities and desired outcomes. </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>VIII.	CONCLUDING REMARKS</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It will be necessary, in the final report, to re-evaluate the material, both factual and impressionistic, included in the case studies to try to establish, from the reality of this current work with children, some generalised formulations for successful prevention and rehabilitative interventions and establish some measurable indicators of outcome.  At this time only some broad conclusions can be offered:</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The problem can only be effectively tackled if children, their rights and potential, are perceived as crucial, and central to future development and national well-being.  To achieve a truly child-centred system, in which all policies are evaluated in terms that include their impact on childrens welfare, is identified as being perhaps the only way of radically tackling this abuse.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>&quot;... Child welfare is not a charity, nor development of children ... merely a technical matter. Rather they should be the basis of national development. Children are the true representatives of the future. The way children are treated today is the yard stick to measure the situation of the country tomorrow... (Child Workers In Nepal, Nepal).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Raising awareness of the problem, about the number of children damaged and traumatised by their experiences, is an essential first step, if other therapeutic work is going to be accepted, supported and effective. This has to change public opinion, by accurately presenting the victims as abused children;</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>need to advocate strongly that this issue be seen not as prostitution but as the abuse of children and young people through sexual exploitation ... (T)he task of education and awareness raising is  a critical and urgent one (Barnardos, U.K.).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Information about the extent, the nature of the abuse and characteristics of the perpetrators, may all be crucial in forcing the issue into national and/or local consciousness, rather than allowing taboos, or the marginalising of victims or perpetrators to minimise or hide the problem.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>There are many different ways of achieving this end, but co-ordination and consistency are pre-requisites for an effective campaign.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>The legal framework can both protect and victimise. Laws designed to promote childrens welfare and protect them from abuse should be activated to respond to the needs of the children, while criminal sanctions against those who abuse them need to be enforced. This would also do much to restate support for the child and intolerance of the abuse to which he/she has been subjected.  A system that introduces the concept of consent as a defence to charges of sexual offences involving children, denies children due protection, colludes with the perpetrators, and flies in the face of logic.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Participatory models, involving the children, their families and communities, as key players in deciding strategies and content of programmes will probably be more effective and efficient. To be effective, intervention strategies must be responsive and reflect what the children and young people are saying. Their participation as more than passive consumers of services is critical. The ability to really listen to and respect the children, families and community leaders, to believe that they have insights, wisdom, ideas and skills that can inform, direct and evaluate programmes, is important. Using and developing the strengths and resources within communities will help to sustain any positive impact.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Partnerships between local, national and international groups, between professional disciplines, with the media and with economic interests, are the means for achieving sustainable change within the macro-environment and for developing integrated local plans for effective action. Organisations working in isolation find their sphere of influence and scope for achieving change, severely restricted, though with persistence and determination, even small organisations can impact a societys conscience and the way it thinks (The House, South Africa).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Some of the most effective programmes work from a multi-disciplinary perspective.  Agencies and professions can combine to provide the necessary range of services in a co-ordinated way, and through sharing their distinctive ethos or approach, can have a positive impact across traditional boundaries, to enhance services, to alter the understanding and value judgements that might have impeded access.  </H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Shared learning ... is a critical  component of successful intervention. (Barnardos, U.K.)</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>This approach also encourages those working with children to see them as whole people and to try to meet their needs holistically.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4> ... In order to protect childrens rights holistically, we need to employ very broad and multi-disciplinary approaches which link all aspects of society ....</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Addressing the psycho-social needs of abused children takes time and resources, but children have a right to expect services which are aimed at all of the consequences of the abuse they have experienced. Some agencies are focusing on developing quality care for fewer children, but in so doing, learning ways to enhance capability and promote successful replication.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>CPCR ... would rather assist fewer children each year, but provide holistic care in their best interests. ... At the same time we aim to build the capacity of other organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, to work on this issue (Center for the Protection of Childrens Rights, Thailand).</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Efforts to develop therapeutic approaches to different cultural and social settings, to find effective combinations of approaches and seek additional funds and support, are all necessary for the enhancement of the quality of programmes.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It would be unrealistic to assume that any absolute or standard blueprint, with successful response strategies identified in a social and cultural vacuum, is possible. All projects will always need to adapt and evolve from within their own communities, using the strengths and resources of both adults and children.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Given that not all children subjected to similar environmental or familial pressures will become victims, the identification and application of concepts of resilience, to build protection strategies for individuals and to enhance rehabilitation prospects will increase the effectiveness of programmes.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>It is hoped that a feeling of solidarity, of not struggling alone, can emerge from the accounts of others who are facing similar problems, identifying small indications of progress, some working in very different areas, but whose commitment to improving the lives of children, working with and for the children themselves, remains resolute.</H4>
<P>
<P>
<H4>These insights can be used by other practitioners, to help them avoid some of the mistakes, strengthen their negotiating position, and to plan, implement and develop programmes that can successfully help children who are being abused and subjected to the most fundamental denial of their rights. It represents the shared wisdom and experiences of some of those working day by day with children who are victimised, exploited and blamed. Their voices can inform, teach and help articulate and justify the urgent call for local, national and international strategies for child welfare programmes and social mobilisation policies that will address the needs of these children.</H4>

<P><H2>The sex exploiter</H2><BR>

<H4><B>This paper was prepared as a working document for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children by Julia OConnell Davidson for ECPAT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B><BR>

<P>Most child prostitutes are integrated into the mainstream sex industry, and tend to be concentrated in the cheaper end of the prostitute 'market', where conditions are worst and the 'throughput' of customers highest. Although some children are prostituted by and/or specifically for paedophiles and preferential abusers, the majority of the several million men who annually exploit prostitutes under 18 years of age are first and foremost <I>prostitute users</I>  who become child sexual abusers through their prostitute use, rather than the other way about. Child sex exploiters (situational, preferential and paedophile) are thus drawn primarily from the following groups: local prostitute users; the military; seamen and truckers; migrant workers; travelling businessmen; tourists; expatriates; aid workers; and employers of domestic workers.  Within this context the paper defines the terms 'paedophile', 'preferential child sex abuser' and 'situational child sex abuser' and observes that paedophiles and preferential abusers secure sexual access to children in a number of different ways, but typically target children who are in extremely vulnerable situations, or who are being prostituted.<BR>

<P>The paper examines motivations for child sexual abuse in commercial contexts (exploring general questions about why people wish to purchase sexual access to prostitutes and how this relates to the abuse of prostituted children) as well as motivations for child sexual abuse in non-commercial contexts and looks at the cognitive distortions employed by sexual exploiters in both contexts in order to rationalise and justify their acts of abuse. <BR>

<P>The national and international organisation of child sexual exploitation is briefly considered, as are possibilities for the control and rehabilitation of child sex exploiters and some proposals for preventative action in future. Because so many children are sexually exploited within the mainstream sex industry, the need for a worldwide change in public, police and judicial attitudes towards prostitution is stressed. It is prostitute users (the exploiters) and not prostituted children (the victims) who must become the focus of policing. Meanwhile, greater national and international commitment and international co-operation is necessary to effectively police, deter and rehabilitate preferential abusers and paedophiles who sexually exploit children at home and abroad.<BR>

<P><B>THE SEX EXPLOITER</B><BR>

<P>
<P>The Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children will consider the actions of those who sexually exploit children. It will address questions about their identity, actions and motivations, and consider whether and how their behaviours can be changed and/or controlled.<BR>

<P><B>I.	DEFINITIONS</B><BR>
<B> </B><BR>
<B>1.	'Paedophile' and 'Preferential Child Sex Abuser'</B><BR>

<P>The term 'paedophile' is a clinical one, used to refer to an adult who has a personality disorder which involves a specific and focused sexual interest in prepubertal children. Though the majority of paedophiles are male, female abusers are not unknown, and though some paedophiles have a focused interest in either female or male victims, others have no consistent gender preference. Paedophiles do not all act on their sexual interest in the same way. Some restrict their sexual life to fantasy (if they use child pornography for masturbatory purposes, however, they can be said to engage, albeit indirectly, in child sexual abuse). Those who do act upon their impulses may abuse children in a variety of ways, some limiting themselves to non-contact abuse' (exposure of genital organs, showing and/or talking about pornographic material), others perpetrating 'contact abuse' (genital touching and fondling, attempted or actual penetration - oral, anal or vaginal). <BR>

<P>The term preferential child sex abuser is used in this paper to refer to those individuals whose preferred sexual objects are children who have reached or passed puberty. Such abusers are usually, but not always men, and their victims may be either male or female children . Again, psychiatry views their taste for immature and powerless sexual partners as the manifestation of a personality disorder (hebephilia). Neither paedophiles nor preferential abusers constitute a homogeneous group in terms of their <I>modus operandi</I>, and three major behaviour patterns have been identified by the clinicians and law enforcement agents who work with them. First, there is 'the seduction pattern'. This is typically followed by offenders who are motivated by a form of narcissism, seeing some lost part of themselves in the innocent child, and/or having a strong sense of emotional congruence with the children they abuse. This type of abuser is an excellent manipulator (often of adults and public opinion, as well as of children). They use affection, attention and gifts to court children, are willing to spend long periods of time 'grooming' their victims in preparation for the abuse and use threats, blackmail and physical violence to discourage disclosure. Second, there are 'introverted' offenders, who have a preference for children but lack the 'seducer's' interpersonal skills. Such offenders typically engage in a minimum of verbal communication with victims, and tend to abuse unknown or very young children. Third, and least common, there are 'sadistic' offenders, who not only have a sexual interest in children, but also derive sexual pleasure from the infliction of physical or psychological suffering on their victims. This kind of offender may either use lure or force to gain access to the child, and they are more likely to abduct and murder their victims than any other type of offender.<BR>

<P><B>2.	'Situational Child Sex Abuser'</B><BR>

<P>The term 'situational child sex abuser' is used to refer to adult men and women who sexually exploit children not because they have a focused sexual interest in children <I>per se</I>, but <I>either</I> because they are morally and/or sexually indiscriminate and wish to 'experiment' with child sexual partners, <I>or</I> because they have entered into situations in which a) children who match their ideals of physical attraction are sexually accessible to them, and b) certain disinhibiting factors are present which allow them to either delude themselves about the child's true age or about the nature of the child's consent. Unlike preferential abusers and paedophiles, then, situational abusers do not consistently or consciously seek out children as sexual partners, and it is often a matter of indifference to them whether their sexual partners are 14 or 24, providing they are 'fit' and attractive. This type of offender cannot necessarily be described as sexually 'perverse' (in the sense of deviating from culturally prescribed sexual norms) since the physical characteristics that he or she is attracted to often conform to cultural ideals of 'youthful' feminine or masculine<I> </I>beauty, and not to cultural ideals of <I>childlike</I> innocence. Children mature physically at very different rates, so that a 14 or 15 year old girl, for example, can combine the physical characteristics associated with adult woman (large breasts, 'hour-glass' figure, etc.) with attributes of youth that are much admired (good muscle tone, unlined, hairless skin). It is also worth noting here that many models used in the production of pornography aimed at 'normal', and not paedophile, men are actually under the age of 18, and an adult who is sexually aroused by the sight of someone who is legally and chronologically a child, but physically mature and/or close to cultural ideals of sexual beauty, cannot necessarily be understood as sexually or psychologically 'aberrant'.<BR>

<P><B>II.	GROUPS THAT SUPPLY CHILD SEX EXPLOITERS</B><BR>

<P>Paedophiles and preferential abusers secure sexual access to children in a number of different ways.  Sometimes they seek jobs or positions which provide them with opportunities to abuse, or move to areas where they know that sexual access to children is relatively easily attained. This means that certain groups of children are at particular risk of sexual abuse. Street children and children in orphanages and local authority care are perhaps the most obvious examples of children who are vulnerable to sexual abuse by adults occupying positions of trust or authority. They are easy targets for non-violent abusers who wish to construct a fiction of consent around the abuse.  Such children are, by definition, emotionally needy.  They are also often materially deprived. Adults in positions of trust or authority are therefore able to manipulate them with promises, threats and bribes, often making the child feel complicit in its own abuse.  There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that in affluent countries as well as poor countries, children who are being, or have been, abused in this way also become extremely vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation by pimps and pornographers.  Furthermore, there are cases in which commercial sexual exploitation is actually part of the abuse perpetrated by a trusted/feared adult who derives sexual and psychological pleasure, as well as perhaps some financial benefit, from seeing the child prostituted or used in the production of pornography. It is also the case that children in war zones, refugee camps and prisons, as well as street children, are especially vulnerable to violent sexual abuse by strangers, as well as to the forms of non-violent abuse described above.<BR>

<P>Although some children are prostituted by and/or specifically for paedophiles, the vast majority of child prostitutes are integrated into the mainstream sex industry which serves <I>all</I> those who wish to purchase commercial sex, rather than working in some isolated market niche which caters solely to the desires of paedophiles and preferential abusers.  In both affluent and poor countries, it is not only the case that a significant percentage of prostitutes are under the age of 18, but also that younger prostitutes tend to be concentrated in the cheaper end of the prostitute market where conditions are worst and the 'throughput' of customers is highest.  Any group which represents a source of demand for commercial sex can therefore be assumed to supply a significant number of child sex exploiters, many of whom will be situational abusers.  They sexually abuse children because they are prostitute-users (and/or strip and sex show customers, and/or consumers of pornography) in a world which, on the one hand places sexual value on youth, and on the other forces large numbers of children (either through direct coercion or economic necessity) into working in the sex industry. Taken together, all this means that the vast bulk of child sex exploiters (situational, preferential and paedophile) are drawn from the following groups:<BR>

<P><B>1.	The Military</B><BR>

<P>Local and foreign soldiers have long represented a substantial portion of the demand for commercial sex. Several of the poor countries where the sex industry is most developed, either are or were until lately military dictatorships and/or have served or do serve as major bases for foreign troops.  The relationship between the military and prostitution has been most recently illustrated by cases in which the presence of UN peacekeeping troops has fuelled a phenomenal increase in the scale of prostitution, with soldiers often paying for the sexual services of orphaned, abandoned or displaced girls, some as young as 12 years old. Meanwhile, NGOs report that there are countries where girls in their early teens are currently held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off duty local soldiers.  Soldiers are also sometimes responsible for other forms of sexual abuse, such as child rape.  This is especially the case in war zones (the most recent examples of this concern allegations against rebel forces in Uganda and against Serbian troops in Bosnia).<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>2.  	Seamen and Truckers</B><BR>

<P>Seamen and truckers are another group of men known to be extensively involved in prostitution. Large numbers of child prostitutes are to be found working in the red light districts of port towns around the world, serving a clientele that largely consists of merchant sailors, fishermen and naval personnel, and there are also child prostitutes working in and around 'pit stops' for truckers.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Migrant Labour</B><BR>

<P>Migrant workers represent another major source of demand for commercial sex in many parts of the world.  In some cities, men who have migrated from rural areas in search of work are the main source of custom for child as well as adult prostitutes in red light areas.  Likewise, brothels in many mining areas (especially those in South America) are almost exclusively dependent on the custom of migrant workers, and the prostitutes therein are girls aged from 13 to 22, who are often held under conditions of virtual slavery.<BR>

<P><B>4.	Travelling Businessmen</B><BR>

<P>Prostitute-use by businessmen, especially those travelling abroad, is widespread.  The provision of 'call girls' and/or visits to brothels often form part of the 'hospitality' provided by business associates.  Some companies are reported to 'reward' loyal or efficient managerial employees with sex holidays abroad, and some firms are known to supply male employees working in isolated areas with domestic servants who are expected to provide free sexual services in addition to their other duties.  Foreign travel for business purposes can also provide paedophiles and preferential child abusers with opportunities to pursue their sexual interests at low cost and in comparative safety.  Indeed, interview work with preferential child abusers suggests that such men sometimes establish business links in particular countries precisely because this facilitates frequent visits to places where they can easily obtain sexual access to their preferred sexual 'objects'.<BR>

<P><B>5.	Sex Tourists</B><BR>

<P>Sex tourists are individuals who enter into sexually exploitative relationships with local women, men and/or children whilst travelling for leisure purposes.  They are not a homogeneous group. Though the vast majority of sex tourists are heterosexual males, there are also homosexual and paedophile sex tourists, as well as some female sex tourists.  These people range in age from 18 to 80, and are of different national and ethnic origins and socio-economic backgrounds.  In many resort areas, sex tourists represent <I>the</I> major source of demand for prostitution.  Some sex tourists are paedophiles and preferential child abusers who choose particular holiday destinations because they know that sexual access to children in those places can be obtained relatively cheaply, easily and safely.  Numerically more significant are men who have a preference for experiencing multiple, anonymous sexual encounters with postpubertal teenagers and young women or men in their early twenties.  The sexual exploitation of local people is the central focus of their holiday in just the same way that skiing is the primary leisure activity pursued by those who take skiing holidays. Other tourists - male and female - ostensibly select their holiday destination for different reasons (the local culture or climate, the availability of drugs, water sports facilities etc.) but then simulate romantic relationships with a smaller number of local children or adults.  This latter type does not acknowledge the fact that they are prostitute users, preferring to think of their exploitative acts as 'holiday romances'.  Alongside and often overlapping these groups, there are sex tourists who have very specific 'racialised'-sexual fantasies.  They travel in order to secure cheap, easy and/or safe sexual access to 'Oriental', Asian, Black or Latino women, men and/or children.<BR>

<P><B>6.	Expatriates</B><BR>

<P>Almost all the countries favoured by sex tourists are also home to large numbers of expatriates from affluent countries.  These expatriates are usually retirees, professionals or small business owners.  Many are involved in the tourist industry and some are directly involved in prostitution (there are expatriate owned or managed bar-brothels in many sex tourist destinations).  A portion of the regular clientele of both adult and child prostitutes in these countries is also drawn from the expatriate community.  There are also cases of expatriates making money by procuring women or children for sex tourists and foreign businessmen as well as several known cases of expatriate involvement in paedophile 'rings', supplying children to fellow expatriates, visiting friends and tourists, as well as exploiting them for the purposes of pornography.<BR>

<P><B>7.	Local Clients </B><BR>

<P>With the possible exception of those working in brothels set up specifically to cater to military personnel, prostitutes around the world attract local custom, as well as that provided by seamen, soldiers, migrant workers, foreign businessmen and tourists.  In many parts of the world, local clients represent the major source of demand for both child and adult prostitutes.  Local paedophiles and preferential child abusers also often use prostitution as a means of obtaining sexual access to children, and this is true in both affluent and poor countries.<BR>

<P><B>8.	Aid Workers</B><BR>

<P>Much Aid work provides ready access to children, and several cases of NGOs and volunteer workers sexually abusing the children in their care have recently come to light.  Some Aid workers are also prostitute users during their stay abroad.  It is also the case that social welfare projects run by religious missionaries and church workers in both economically developed and underdeveloped countries sometimes attract paedophiles and preferential abusers.  There are cases of priests and supposedly philanthropic 'Christians' setting up vocational centres and residential homes in order to operate paedophile rings, as well as numerous instances of such men exploiting the trust and credibility bestowed on them by virtue of their religious affiliation as a means to secure sexual access to children.<BR>

<P><B>9.	Employers of Domestic Workers</B><BR>

<P>In many countries, children between the ages of 12 and 18 are employed as domestic workers. They are vulnerable to sexual exploitation by their employers, and child domestic workers who are migrants or victims of trafficking are especially unable to resist sexual abuse since their employers often wield enormous power over them (in many cases, the child's rights of residence in a country, as well their livelihood, depend upon their employer).<BR>

<P><B>III	MOTIVATIONS FOR CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IN COMMERCIAL CONTEXTS</B><BR>

<P>In all known societies, there are rules and conventions which govern and constrain people's sexual interaction.  The twilight and often illicit world of prostitution provides an arena within which the laws and rules which constrain sexual practice can be evaded, and, in this sense, the attraction of child prostitution to many paedophiles and preferential child sexual abusers is obvious.  Laws and social conventions make it very difficult and dangerous for such people to satisfy their sexual interests in non-commercial contexts, but prostitution potentially provides 'instant access', often to a selection of children.  Since there are very few countries where large numbers of prepubertal children are prostituted, those which have a reputation for child prostitution attract paedophiles (at least those who can afford to travel) from all around the world.<BR>

<P>However, it cannot be simply assumed that all the clients of child prostitutes are paedophiles or preferential abusers.  Research suggests that, depending upon the setting from which they work, child prostitutes 'service' between 2 and 30 clients per week, i.e., somewhere between 100 and 1,500 clients a year.  Even if the lowest estimates on the numbers of child prostitutes are accepted, the number of <I>clients</I> of child prostitutes still runs into several millions annually. Furthermore, these millions of clients are a very disparate group in terms of their nationalities and their socio-economic, cultural and religious backgrounds.  To explain the behaviour of such a large and varied group solely through reference to two clinically defined personality disorders - paedophilia and hebephilia - (diagnostic categories which are themselves based on research with a relatively small and atypical sample of Western men) would clearly be unsatisfactory. Indeed, it is more reasonable to assume that a majority of these men are first and foremost <I>prostitute users</I>  who become child sexual abusers through their prostitute use, rather than first and foremost paedophiles or hebephiles using prostitution as a means of obtaining sexual access to children. It follows from this that understanding why people sexually abuse children in a commercial context requires us to address general questions about why people wish to purchase sexual access to prostitutes, and how this relates to the abuse of prostituted children.  This section draws on research with prostitutes' clients in a number of different settings which suggests that, in general, men (and some women) use prostitutes for one of the reasons discussed below, or some combination of these reasons.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Some Clients Use Prostitutes to Satisfy What They Imagine to be a Biological or Emotional Need for a Sexual 'Outlet'/ Physical Contact</B><BR>

<P>Many societies socialise their members into a belief that human beings (especially human males) have a biological sexual drive akin to hunger or the need to evacuate the bowels.  Male sexual desire is viewed in terms of <I>needing</I>, rather than <I>wanting</I>, and many men who do not have, or are separated from, a regular non-commercial sexual partner, often believe that prostitute use is necessary to their physical and psychological well being.  A great deal of the prostitute use by seamen, truckers, soldiers and migrant workers appears to be underpinned, at least in part, by this type of thinking.  Some tourists and locals also explain their sexual exploitation of prostitutes in this way, saying that they are lonely and driven to prostitute-use by their need for physical attention, comfort or sexual 'release'.<BR>

<P>In theory, this should mean that the link between prostitute use and child sexual exploitation for these men is an entirely contingent one (i.e., that they only abuse children because it so happens that many of the cheapest and/or most accessible prostitutes just happen to be under the age of 18), and there is some supporting evidence for this view.  A Ukrainian sailor interviewed during the course of research for End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT), for example, commented, 'I'm a man. I have biological needs. I've been on ship for seven months, I needed a woman'.  When the ship docked at a port in an economically underdeveloped country, he therefore went to the red light district, an area which was, in his words, 'dirty and horrible' and where girls enter into prostitution from the age of around 12 or 13.  Clearly, in this setting, the chances that such a man will sexually abuse a child are high, but, according to the sailor, he does not go to such places from choice, but 'out of necessity'.  It is also important to reiterate the fact that child prostitutes are typically concentrated in the cheapest sector of the prostitution market (in the West, this means street prostitution, in poorer countries it often means the seamiest brothels), and it follows that low paid migrant workers and locals who use prostitutes to satisfy their imagined sexual 'needs' are also highly likely to sexually abuse child prostitutes.<BR>

<P>However, it is also the case that while many men justify and defend their prostitute use through reference to the idea that they have a simple biological <I>need</I> for sex, very few are completely indiscriminate as to how this 'need' is satisfied and by whom.  In fact, if they were indiscriminate, there would be no reason to use prostitutes at all, since they could quite easily find sexual 'release' alone or with fellow soldiers, sailors, migrant workers or tourists.  There is no reason to suppose that they are any less discriminating about the <I>kind</I> of woman they 'need' and it seems probable that many of these men do actually prefer to use prostitutes aged somewhere between 14 and 20, since girls in this age range tend to conform more closely to cultural ideals of feminine beauty.  Support for this hypothesis comes from research with prostitutes in port towns, who state that as a woman grows older, she finds it increasingly difficult to attract customers. Finally, misconceptions about the transmission of AIDS and other venereal diseases may encourage men who use prostitutes to satisfy what they imagine to be a biological need for a sexual 'outlet' to select younger prostitutes in the mistaken belief that they are less likely to contract illness from them.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Some Men Use Prostitution in Order to Obtain a Sense of Camaraderie with Male Colleagues or Friends</B><BR>

<P>Prostitute use is sometimes a group activity, experienced as pleasurable because it consolidates a shared masculine identity and heightens a sense of group belonging.  Employers who organise group sexual exploitation for their male employees do so precisely in order to encourage such 'male bonding', as do rugby, cricket and football clubs and other organisations which seek to reproduce and reinforce strict gender segregation.  Male friends also often travel together to engage in sex tourism. It might be hoped that the presence of business colleagues or friends would inhibit men from breaking taboos around child sexual abuse, and this is no doubt the case so far as the abuse of prepubertal children is concerned.  However, research with sex tourists and foreign businessmen suggests that the situational abuse of postpubertal girls aged between 15 and 18 is quite common.  Businessmen and sex tourists travelling in groups of two and more who were interviewed during the course of research for ECPAT often reinforced each other's self serving self delusions as to the true age of the prostitutes they were with, whilst others would joke about the girls' ages with each other, laughingly referring to their friends as 'cradle snatchers' or to their child prostitute 'girl friends' as 'jail bait'.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Some Clients Use Prostitutes in Order to Obtain a Sense of 'True' Masculinity</B><BR>

<P>In a number of otherwise very different societies, men are socialised into a gender ideology which equates masculinity with the successful exercise of control over women, over other men, over their own bodies and over material objects.  They are also often fed a diet of pornography in which 'ideal' men exercise enormous power over sexually objectified women (or, in the case of much homosexual pornography, men).  Many men's non-sexual daydreams as well as their masturbatory fantasies centre around the idea of becoming truly 'masculine' in the sense of having the power to command others, and, providing they have money, the institution of prostitution equips them with precisely this kind of power.  Because the sex industry reduces those who work in it to sexual 'commodities', it simultaneously turns the men who use it into 'sovereign consumers', and all over the world, there are businessmen, soldiers, seamen, migrant workers and locals who find prostitute use (as well as visits to strip, peep and live sex shows) affirmative for this reason.  Once again, because child prostitutes are often found in the cheaper end of the commercial sex market, less affluent men often have greater 'consumer' power in relation to child than to adult prostitutes, and are thus likely to become situational child abusers even if they have no specific sexual interest in children.<BR>

<P>For prostitute users who are motivated by a desire to control and command sexually objectified human beings, locations which combine widespread poverty with a well developed and highly commercialised sex industry are ideal.  This is of particular relevance to understanding one type of sex tourist - the 'Macho Men' who make repeated visits to cities or resorts which conform to this description.  These men's annual or biannual trips to such places are like passing through the looking glass into a world wherein all their masturbatory fantasies are miraculously embodied and attainable.  This is partly because sexual access to prostitutes is extremely cheap, and partly because the array of different forms of commoditised sex on offer is so extensive that they are in a position to command 'anything and everything'.  Furthermore, they feel able to live out their masturbatory fantasies because they are disinhibited by their sense that, in these places, prostitutes really are nothing but 'commodities'.  Indeed, the particular organisation of the sex trade in some of the cities favoured by sex tourists objectifies and deindividualises prostitutes to a quite extraordinary extent.  The seemingly endless numbers of Go Go bars and brothels, for instance, present sex tourists with a sense of prostitutes not only as somehow 'mass produced', but also as highly standardized commodities (for example, large numbers of girls/women or boys/men of roughly similar physical proportions are displayed in matching costumes, and often have numbers pinned to their clothing).  Meanwhile, the live sex shows which some exploiters frequent (generally featuring girls and women performing acts which involve expelling air or objects from their vaginas, or pulling long strands of cloth, or strings of bells or razor blades from them) further reinforce the idea of these racialised 'Others' as nothing more than animated sexual organs.<BR>

<P>Not all prostitute users like this kind of very explicit commoditisation, but the pleasure that those who do derive from it appears to be linked partly to a generalized hostility toward women.  To see women and girls lined up in a brothel, numbered and available to any man who picks them is to see them dominated and humiliated, stripped of their power to 'withhold' the sexual access that such men imagine is so central to their own well being.  Above all, their pleasure is linked to their sense of being in a position to control females as sexual objects as the following extracts from an interview with one British sex tourist shows:<BR>

<P>One night, I went to a brothel... They sit you down on these nice couches... and then pull the curtains back and there are all the girls sitting there behind this glass screen and theyve all got numbers on... and the guy says, Which one would you like then? And you look at the girls and...  say, Oh, I like number 7 or 8 and you say Is she good girl? and he says, Yes, any problems phone me up and Ill sort it out... They get a walkie talkie out to speak through the screen, sends through for her, says Number 7 go and get dressed... and she knows shes been took, and then they go with you. <BR>

<P>This man had abused child prostitutes, not because he has a focused sexual interest in children, but because he is morally and sexually indiscriminate.  Men of this type do not really care whether the girl they take from a brothel or bar is 14 or 24, providing they 'fancy' the look of her, and furthermore, child sexual abuse becomes just one more sexual experience in the range that is on offer to them as a 'consumer'.  An anonymous contributor to a World Sex Guide available on the Internet, for example, provides descriptions of six adventures he had on his 'holiday', the last of which features a visit to a brothel where 12 year old girls were on offer.  The sexual acts he performed upon a physically small and immature child are recounted as neither more nor less than another new and exciting commodity/service purchased during the course of his trip.<BR>

<P><B>4.	Some clients use prostitutes to satisfy a compulsive urge to perform sexually transgressive acts and/or to exercise sexual power over extremely vulnerable, powerless, objectified and/or degraded individuals</B><BR>

<P>It was noted in I) above that many men believe all males to be possessed of some kind of natural sexual drive which makes them <I>need</I> heterosexual intercourse.  For some men (including most of those discussed in iv) above), this belief forms the basis of a deeply misogynistic world view.  Because they see themselves as victims of a biological compulsion to have sex with any beautiful female they meet, women are imagined to control a resource (their female bodies) that is vital to men's physical well being.  Females are therefore resented for their 'immense power', whilst men are viewed as out of control and powerless.  For such men, prostitution represents a means of acquiring control over themselves and others as sexual beings. As one British man, a habitual sex tourist, put it, prostitution means You dont have to worry about going out and getting someone, because you know any time, day or night, you can have anyone you want within seconds. You feel so powerful, you feel youre in control of your sex life.<BR>

<P>The compulsive nature of some men's prostitute use gives it a character very similar to the sexual behaviour of paedophiles and preferential abusers, who likewise tend to view themselves as weak and to express misogynistic rage against women's power to 'withhold' sexual access and unconditional emotional support.  Clients like this often report that the sexual and psychological pleasure they derive from prostitute use comes largely from the knowledge that they are breaking the law, cheating on their wives, flouting the moral codes they have been taught, or in some way transgressing rules and values <I>and</I> getting away with it.  An element of risk is often a vital component of these men's sexual excitement (hence the not uncommon scandals concerning 'upright', wealthy citizens getting caught using street prostitutes, despite the fact that a myriad of more discrete options were readily available).<BR>

<P>For other compulsive prostitute users, the idea of revenge is more central to their sexual excitement.  Recent psychoanalytical work which suggests that perversion is essentially a gender disorder constructed out of a triad of hostility (<I>rage</I> at giving up one's earliest bliss and identification with the mother, <I>fear</I> of not succeeding in escaping out of her orbit, and a need for <I>revenge</I> for her putting one in this predicament), is helpful in understanding such men and their propensity to sexually abuse children. In word and deed, compulsive prostitute users express rage at not being the central focus of a woman's adoring and indulgent gaze.  Adult women who are their economic, social and/or legal equals are perceived as hugely threatening simply because they are in a position to control <I>themselves</I>, that is to say, to exercise choice over whether or not to meet a man's demands.  For a woman to be in a position to exercise choice is for her to assert her separateness, her free will, her capacity to freely withdraw from the relationship and thus to arouse these men's infantile rage.  Even a prostitute may be perceived as threatening if, as many adult Western prostitutes are, she is in a position to determine the limits of the contractual exchange.  An interview with a Canadian sex tourist is revealing. He explained that he 'hated' prostitutes.  He had used prostitutes all over the world, and he hated European and North American prostitutes in particular:<BR>

<P>It's all businesslike.  It's by the hour, like a taxi service, like they've got the metre running... There's no feeling.  If I wanted to fuck a rubber doll, I could buy one and inflate it...  A prostitute in Europe will never kiss you.  In Canada, it's ridiculous.  You know, if you go with a prostitute and you don't pay her, you know what?  They call it rape.  You can be in court on a rape charge.<BR>

<P>He liked the powerlessness of prostitutes in the poor countries he visited.  'Here, they don't even ask for the money.  It's up to you'.  As an affluent tourist to countries where prostitution is illegal, he enjoys the knowledge that, as he put it, 'if you don't pay a girl here, there's nothing she can do.  She's not supposed to be with you anyway.  It's just tough'.  This intense rage against women who exercise the smallest modicum of control over their interactions with men leads some men to search for sexual partners who are perceived as especially powerless, and child prostitutes clearly fit this description.  Meanwhile, because the sexual use of children is, in itself, a transgressive act, it represents a form of revenge against the authority figures who such men imagine are attempting to control them as well as against a world that refuses to gaze indulgently upon them.  Taken to its most extreme form, the desire for this type of control and vengeance can lead individuals to find sexual pleasure in the infliction of pain and/or damage on another human being.<BR>

<P>Finally, there are men, and indeed some women, who use prostitution as a means of obtaining sexual contact with individuals whom they perceive to be objectified and/or degraded in some way.  Psychoanalytic explanations for this type of sexual interest would also centre on the notion of an intense fear of intimacy.  The basic idea is that people who suffered betrayal at the hands of those upon whom they were utterly dependent as children (usually parents or parent figures) sometimes develop a pathological fear of dependency.  Since sexual relationships often imply a high degree of intimacy/dependency, such people seek ways of rendering sexual partners 'safe' and non-threatening.  To select sexual partners who are perceived as powerless (a small child or a visibly brutalised prostitute, for example) and/or in some sense less than human (a 'racialised' Other, for instance), is one strategy for selecting sexual partners who are imagined not to be in a position to reject or harm.<BR>

<P><B>5.	Exploiters Who Do Not Wish to See Themselves as Prostitute Users</B><BR>

<P>Another clearly identifiable subgroup of prostitute users is comprised of men and women who do not view themselves as 'clients' and yet sexually exploit prostitutes.  This may sound like an impressive feat of self-delusion, but it is a trick annually performed by many hundreds of thousands of sex tourists, as well as by some foreign businessmen and expatriates in South American, Caribbean, Asian and S. E. Asian countries.  They are able to deceive themselves about the true nature of their sexual interaction with local people because prostitution takes a number of different forms in the countries they visit.  As well as brothel based prostitution, there exists an informal prostitution sector, comprised of adults and children either soliciting independently from beaches, parks and ordinary tourist bars, or supplementing their very low pay from, say, hotel or bar work with occasional prostitution.  Furthermore, the prostitute-client exchange, especially in the informal, independent sector, is often very different to that which takes place in the West.  Independent prostitutes in countries which host sex tourists do not usually sell sexual services by the piece as Western prostitutes do, but generally provide anything from 18 hours to two weeks of full access to their persons, and perform the kind of acts that in the West are taken to signify genuine affection (kissing, cuddling, sleeping in the bed with clients, providing physical care such as rubbing in sun tan lotion, washing their hair or feet, and so on, all things which an experienced Western prostitute would <I>never</I> do).<BR>

<P>Thus, sex tourists, expatriates and foreign businessmen do not have to go into a brothel, or even into a tacky Go Go Bar, in order to pick up a prostitute, nor do they have to negotiate a 'deal' in advance (the two things which, to most Westerners, are viewed as integral to 'prostitution'). They can therefore interpret the process of 'picking up' as confirmation of a mutual attraction rather than as initiating a commercial sexual encounter and when the adult or child later confides their desperate need for cash, the client constructs the act of giving them money not as payment for services rendered, but as a gesture of compassion or generosity.  All of this makes it possible for some sex exploiters to tell themselves that the girls/boys they exploit are not <I>really</I> prostitutes, and thus that they themselves are not <I>really</I>  'clients'.<BR>

<P>Such people are usually motivated to engage in this form of sexual activity for the reasons discussed in 1, 2 and 4 above, and because large numbers of freelance prostitutes working in sex tourist resorts are under the age of 18 (indeed, the bulk of child prostitution often takes place in this kind of informal prostitution sector), this type of prostitute user is just as prone to situational child sexual abuse as any other prostitute user.  It also seems probable that those paedophile sex tourists who in their own country tend to follow the 'seduction' behaviour pattern also favour the informal prostitution sector as a means of securing sexual access to young children.  If such men veer toward an excessively sentimental regard for children, and have a strong sense of emotional congruence with their victims, then they would almost certainly prefer to arrange sexual access to small children whom they can see playing around on a beach, splashing in the sea, drinking coca colas and so on, than to bruised and half starved children in small cubicles in seamy brothels.<BR>

<P><B>IV.	MOTIVATIONS FOR ABUSE IN NON-COMMERCIAL CONTEXTS</B><BR>

<P>Adults' motivations to sexually abuse children in non-commercial contexts such as refugee camps, orphanages and prisons are probably best understood through reference to ideas discussed in either c) I) or iv) above.  Adults prisoners or refugees who abuse postpubertal teenagers in prisons or refugee camps, for example, are probably acting on the basis of a belief in their 'need' for sexual release (possibly also a desire to overcome their own sense of powerlessness by exercising power over another human being).  Where adults deliberately seek out positions of authority in institutions or organisations that are intended to serve the needs of children in order to obtain sexual access to those children however, it seems likely that they are motivated by the fear of intimacy and/or dependency and the desire for control over powerless sexual partners that have already been discussed.  Clinicians argue that paedophile and preferential abusers' motivation to abuse often rests partly on their sense of emotional congruence with children (they see themselves as somehow as weak and as powerless as the child).  This same sense of 'congruence' would be very easy to marry with a view of the self as someone who 'loves' and 'understands' children, and abusers may therefore genuinely believe that they have a great deal to offer abandoned and neglected children.  Certainly some paedophiles have successfully convinced other adults, funding bodies and officials that they are caring, child-centred philanthropists, whilst simultaneously committing horrific crimes against the children in their charge.<BR>

<P><B>V.	OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY FOR ABUSE TO OCCUR</B><BR>

<P>Research with men who sexually abuse children in non-commercial contexts in their home countries suggests that, as well as needing a motivation to have sex with a child, three further factors need to be present for abuse to occur.  First, the adult has to overcome external inhibitions and create conditions under which they can carry out acts of abuse.  This often requires extensive planning and/or grooming of the victim prior to the actual assault.  Second, the abuser has to overcome the victims resistance, and this is typically achieved through the use of threats, bribes and/or gifts.  Clearly, if children are being prostituted it obviates the need for 'grooming' on the abusers part, and the child is unlikely to offer any resistance.  The amount of effort required to create conditions for the abuse to take place also varies in non-commercial contexts.  The greater the abuser's authority over the child and status in the community, the less likely his interest in children is to be questioned.  The Freddie Peats case in India provides an instructive example.  Peats ran an orphanage, which gave him more or less absolute authority over the daily lives of children therein.  He also actively and successfully sought respect from the local community (through his charity work, by claiming to be a doctor, etc.).  The Frank Beck case in Britain serves to underline that this kind of abuse recognizes no national, economic or 'racialised' boundaries.  It can and does take place in any country of the world.<BR>

<P>Finally, the vast majority of paedophiles and preferential child abusers know their behaviour is illegal and/or socially proscribed, and have to overcome internal inhibitions in order to act out the abuse.  It is also the case that the vast majority of abusers need or want a fiction of consent in order to abuse.  Although there are individuals who derive sexual pleasure from acts that are clearly and inescapably coercive or violent (some child prostitutes describe being vaginally or anally penetrated, or forced to have oral sex while tears are streaming down their faces), they are definitely in a minority.  In both commercial and non-commercial contexts, abusive adults use a series of 'cognitive distortions' to justify and excuse their behaviour and to convince themselves that the children they exploit are actively consenting to sex.  These distortions are considered below.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Cognitive Distortions and Sexual Offending</B><BR>

<P>Research with men who sexually offend against children in the UK and USA has concluded that distortion of attitude and belief, whereby children are portrayed as being in some way responsible for their own abuse, and that they are not harmed by sexual contact with adults and are able to consent to or gain benefit from such encounters, is one of the most common characteristics exhibited by child sexual abusers.  Prostitute users (sex tourists, locals, sailors, soldiers, businessmen and expatriates) employ precisely the same cognitive distortions in relation to the prostitutes they sexually exploit at home and abroad.  Research with preferential and situational child prostitute abusers has found that these distortions take the following forms:<BR>
	<BR>
1.1.	The fact that the child is identified as 'a prostitute' as opposed to being seen as <I>prostituted</I> (either by another person or by economic circumstances) allows the sex exploiter to tell himself that the children he abuses are responsible for their own abuse.  Prostitute users do not consider the fact that the vast majority of prostitutes are survivors of incestuous abuse, rape and/or assault, and have been compelled or coerced into prostitution by a third party or by a complete absence of alternative means of survival (this is true of prostitutes in both the economically developed and underdeveloped world).  Instead, prostitute users tell themselves that the child prostitutes who approach them have actively chosen prostitution as a 'way of life'.  They tell themselves that they did not seduce the child, rather the children <I>invited</I> their own abuse by 'electing' to prostitute themselves.  As one sex tourist said of a 13 year old he had sex with, She was expecting something, and it wasnt a lollipop.  This kind of thinking can be extended to justify the use of force and the infliction of damage and pain on children.<BR>

<P>1.2.	Abusers of child prostitutes typically express either highly sexualized forms of racism or extreme forms of hostility towards prostitutes.  Without exception, sex tourists, expatriates and travelling businessmen interviewed in the course of research for ECPAT described the cultures that host them as more sexually 'open', 'natural' and 'free' than Western culture. This allows them to delude themselves about the meanings that are attached to sexual behaviour in the countries they visit.  They claim that the way in which six year olds dance <I>proves that</I> they are more physical and sexual than Western children; that girls in these countries are grown up and sexually experienced by the time they are 14; that no stigma is attached to prostitution; that 'They' are all 'at it' all of the time.  This is often coupled with a horribly warped interpretation placed on knowledge about the prevalence of incest and/or child prostitution in the host countries.  Abusers tell themselves that the harm from adult-child sexual contact has already been inflicted by someone else, and that their own acts of abuse are not, therefore, the real crime.  In these ways, sex exploiters tell themselves that children are not harmed by sexual contact with them.  To quote a particularly repellent sex tourist in the Caribbean:<BR>

<P>Sex is a natural thing here.  Everyone's at it, fathers do it with their daughters, brothers do it with their sisters, they don't care.  They'll do it with anyone, they do it with everyone, they don't care who it is or how old they are.  They're like animals.  That's the only way I can explain it to you.  They're like dogs or cats or roosters.  Have you seen roosters, the way in the farmyard the way they carry on?  Just hop on top of any chicken they see.  That's what it's like here.  By the time a girl is 10 years old, she's had more experience than, well, an American woman or an Irish woman won't never have that much experience in her whole life...  Girls learn it's the way to keep a man happy.  It's natural to them, it's a natural way to please men.<BR>

<P>Local men use similar reasoning to justify their sexual exploitation of child prostitutes. To understand this, it is necessary to recognize the fact that child prostitutes in many of the world's cities, ports and mining towns are not actually local children, but have either migrated or been trafficked from other countries or other regions of the same country, and thus do not usually share a common 'racialised', ethnic, regional and/or national identity with the local men who abuse them.  Furthermore, where children do share a common social identity with local men, the local abuser will often focus upon the sexual 'looseness' and 'immorality' of the individual child (as opposed to that of their 'race' or culture) in order to justify his acts.  Such men tell themselves that, since the child is already 'a prostitute' (and so already 'dirty' and less than fully human), no harm can result from their own acts of abuse.<BR>

<P>1.3.	The fact that child prostitutes desperately need money, often to support their dependents, is taken as evidence that they both consent to and benefit from sexual contact with adults. Sex tourists, for example, say that the girls depend on them: If we stopped coming out here, I hate to think what would happen to these girls.  Local clients, businessmen, soldiers, expatriates and seamen can likewise tell themselves that they are effectively doing the child a favour by providing 'custom'.<BR>

<P>These cognitive distortions allow exploiters to convince themselves that no physical or emotional harm will result from the act, and that the child actively consents to and will benefit from it. Western sex tourists are particularly adept at manufacturing self serving rationalisations.  A sex tourist guide book, for example, encourages men to try sexually exploiting debt bonded children in brothels, and, should their conscience prick them, the US author helpfully observes that One way to rationalise it is to say, if it's not me, then it's the guy behind me, and who's more likely to be the gentler of the two?<BR>

<P><B>VI.	NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION OF CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	International Paedophile Organisation</B><BR>

<P>It was noted in section a) that paedophiles and preferential abusers do not constitute a homogenous group, and this is also true in relation to their propensity to organise at national and international level.  Some paedophiles and preferential abusers are essentially solitary individuals, but others wish to share their experiences, pornography and even their victims with other abusers.  This latter type can be further subdivided.  Some obtain a sense of validation if they merely 'share' with a small number like-minded individuals, exchanging letters and photographs in a fairly informal way.  Others derive psychological satisfaction (sometime also material benefits) from operating a more structured and systematic organisation serving a larger network of fellow paedophiles/preferential child abusers.  Possibilities for operating international 'rings' have recently been much enhanced by advances in computer technology.  Paedophiles and preferential abusers can now take advantage of the Internet and computer bulletin boards to make contacts across national boundaries as well as to share information, experiences and pornography, all in relative safety.  The motives of abusers involved in such activities are probably best understood through reference to the desire to either a) 'normalise' their own behaviour by developing contacts with others like themselves, or b) to obtain sexual and psychological gratification from behaviours that are risky, secretive and manipulative, and thus demonstrate the abuser's power to control others as well as to master his own fears.  The commercial benefits for individuals operating this kind of paedophile 'ring' are generally believed to be negligible, but the desires of paedophiles and preferential abusers can be profitably exploited as a 'side line' by business people who are already involved in the organised sex trade. For example, there are 'escort' agencies which procure/ recruit children as well as adult prostitutes in order to provide clients greater 'variety'.  Such agencies are often highly organised, if small, and in Latin American as well as North American and European countries, their owners will supply children with mobile phones in order to both facilitate 'customer service' and to avoid detection.<BR>

<P><B>2.	The National and International Promotion and Organisation of Sex Tourism</B><BR>

<P>This is dealt with in the background paper on tourism prepared for the World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Armed Services' Involvement in the Organisation of Prostitution</B><BR>

<P>There is evidence of both national and international armed services' involvement in the organisation of prostitution in a number of countries.  At a national level, military personnel sometimes use their status and authority to supplement their salaries by variously procuring girls for prostitution, or investing in, managing or 'protecting' brothels, including those which sell children's bodies.  At an international level, foreign military personnel have played a significant role in the development of the sex industries in countries used for 'Rest &amp; Recreation', both by continuously transporting vast numbers of prostitute users to those countries, and by getting involved in the setting up and regulation of military brothels around their bases.  In the 1990s, the UN has deployed large numbers of troops around the globe, and whilst prostitute use by these troops is not officially sanctioned, it does not appear to have been vigorously condemned or controlled either.  Serious allegations against UN troops in Mozambique and in Cambodia were made in the early 1990s.  It is claimed that, in response to local groups' complaints about sexual exploitation by UN forces in Cambodia, certain sites were placed off limits and new guidelines for soldiers were introduced.  According to some sources, however, these new 'guidelines' were not strict enough. Soldiers were told not to park their cars in front of massage parlours, and nothing was done to address the issue of child sexual exploitation since, despite all evidence to the contrary, the UN official in charge of the matter simply did not believe that child prostitution existed.<BR>

<P><B>4.	The Organisation of Child Sexual Exploitation via the 'Mail Order Bride' and Domestic Servant Industries</B><BR>

<P>The 'Mail Order Bride' and domestic servant industries represent another means through which the sexual exploitation of children, as well as adult women, is organised at national and international level.  For example, Eastern European girls of 16 years old are currently being offered as 'wives' in mail order catalogues produced by British and German companies; teenage Indian and African girls are trafficked as domestic-cum-sexual servants to Asian and Middle Eastern destinations; in Latin America, children between the ages of 12 and 18 are recruited by employment agencies and supplied to single men as domestic-come-sexual servants.<BR>

<P><B>VII.	THE CONTROL AND REHABILITATION OF CHILD SEX EXPLOITERS</B><BR>

<P>This paper has highlighted the fact that children are sexually exploited by prostitute users, as well as by paedophiles and preferential abusers who may or may not be prostitute users.  This has implications for issues of control and rehabilitation, which are considered below.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Legal Controls on Paedophile and Preferential Abusers who Travel Abroad</B><BR>

<P>It is sadly the case that every nation produces its own paedophiles and preferential abusers, and it is clearly important that each nation attempts to control and deter such individuals.  Here, however, we focus on abusers who travel abroad.  This is because, in general, these abusers are nationals of affluent countries who travel to poor countries which can barely afford to police their own abusers, let alone those from wealthier nations.  Richer nations have a moral obligation to protect <I>all</I> children from their own abusers.  The majority of paedophiles from affluent countries know that adult sexual contact with prepubertal children is criminal almost everywhere in the world, and are usually conscious of the risks associated with their activities. Most therefore target vulnerable children who are unlikely to report them, and will weigh up the risks of getting caught in different settings and countries.  A recent case involving a British man provides a good example of this.  While in Britain, he restricted himself to forms of non-contact abuse for which he could not be prosecuted.  When on holiday in a poor country (where in his estimation the risk of discovery and prosecution was low), he placed no such constraint upon himself, indulging in genital contact, anally penetrating children and filming himself so doing. This man stated explicitly that he would not have abused the children in this way had he believed there was a realistic chance of prosecution, and since he was capable of exercising self control in Britain, this claim seems plausible.  There is, then, reason to believe that the introduction of extraterritorial legislation to cover child sexual offenses and effective enforcement of such law would help to control the incidence, or at least the severity, of child sexual abuse by paedophiles who travel abroad.<BR>

<P>There is some evidence to suggest that while preferential child abusers from affluent nations know that their activities are illegal in their own countries, they are not always aware that age of consent laws exist in certain 'Third World' countries.  Even when they do know the law, like paedophiles, they often believe the chances of being prosecuted for such acts are low.  As one Canadian preferential abuser said of a Caribbean country 'No-one cares, the police don't care, the parents don't care, why should I care?'.  The same man stated, however, that he did take care to avoid underage prostitutes in Europe and North America having had 'bad experiences' with the law there.  Other preferential abusers say that they would not offend at home where 'They clap you in jail for just looking at a girl'.  More visible and effective policing as well as the implementation of extraterritorial legislation would go some way toward inhibiting this type of offender.  It would also help to reduce the incidence of situational child abuse by prostitute users, since they are also typically both ignorant of age of consent laws in S. E. Asian, South American, Caribbean and African countries and convinced that teenage sexual activity is socially acceptable in these places.  Although many of this latter type of abuser prefer to tell themselves that the children they exploit are <I>really</I> over 18, they very patently do not feel the need to enquire too closely as to prostitutes' true ages.  This would undoubtedly change if they believed there was a real risk of being prosecuted for having sex with a minor whilst holidaying abroad. Greater international commitment to and co-operation in policing child sex exploiters is therefore necessary.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Legal Controls on Prostitute Users</B><BR>

<P>Since the vast majority of child sexual exploitation takes place in a commercial context, it is necessary to find ways of controlling <I>all</I> situational abusers of child prostitutes (this includes locals, soldiers, seamen, truckers, businessmen, expatriates and sex tourists).  For them to feel squeezed by the law, it is imperative that the <I>focus</I> of prostitution law enforcement shifts dramatically.  In virtually every part of the world today, it is postpubertal prostitutes and not their clients who are most actively policed.  Girls of 14 years and upwards are routinely harassed, arrested, tried and imprisoned or otherwise punished by criminal justice systems in affluent as well as poor countries, while their adult male abusers walk free.  Prostitute users know this only too well, and rightly estimate that the risk of anything more serious than being required to pay a small fine or bribe is slim, even if the prostitute they are with is underage.  In some countries, sex tourists and locals who are preferential abusers even boast about their own immunity, observing that the child prostitutes they exploit would never dare to go to the police (even if they were robbed or raped) because they know that they would suffer as a consequence. It is therefore vital that child sex abuse which takes place within a commercial context is seen for what it is, namely, <I>abuse</I>.  Only then will the grotesque absurdity of policing and imprisoning the victim, instead of the criminal, become transparent.  And it is only if abusers are seen to be held criminally responsible for their acts of exploitation that the law can hope to act as a deterrent.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Treatment Programmes for Offenders</B><BR>

<P>The vast majority of child sex exploiters need to imagine that their victims actively consent to their abuse, and they use various cognitive distortions to convince themselves that this is the case.  Research with men who offend in non-commercial contexts suggests that those who remain convinced that some children are not harmed by sexual contact with adults, or that they actively seek such contact, also remain at risk of repeating their offending.  The prime objective of treatment programmes for paedophiles and preferential abusers who offend domestically has therefore been to challenge the cognitive distortions employed by abusers, to get them to admit to their abuse rather than minimise or deny it, and to encourage the development of empathy with their victims.  Where resources have been invested in them, such therapeutic programs appear to have enjoyed some degree of success.  As the Director of one clinic for offenders observes, 'The only prospect of keeping children safe from abusers is work extensively, painfully and expensively with those men in order to interrupt their cycle of offending.  Such work -whether they 'deserve' it or not - is simply the best form of child protection we have'.<BR>

<P>However, since a large proportion of child sexual abuse takes place within a commercial context, it is essential that treatment programs for prostitute users are also developed and that those who offend in a commercial context are somehow compelled to participate in them.  Such programs are currently being pioneered in Canada, Australia, the USA and the Netherlands.  The Portland organisation, SEEP, for example, offers an intervention program for arrested clients of prostitutes and an education and a prevention program in schools, universities, colleges, community groups, neighbourhood associations and businesses.  Its intervention work with clients involves both intensive workshops for first time offenders and long term counselling for habitual offenders, and the objective is to challenge the cognitive distortions employed by such men to legitimate their sexually exploitative acts, as well as to educate them about the realities of prostitution (for example, the fact that in the USA, the usual age of entry into prostitution is between 14 and 17, that 85% of prostitutes report being sexually abused as children, that 90% of prostitutes are coerced into prostitution by pimps, etc.).  In this way, the workshops and counselling programs attempt to get prostitute users to empathise with, rather than objectify and denigrate, prostituted women and children.<BR>

<P>Such work is relevant for the problem of local demand in both affluent and poor countries as well as the problem of demand from sex tourists, since both types of demand are underpinned by a profound lack of empathy for child prostitutes who are typically viewed as morally corrupt and/or racially or ethnically 'Other'.  These intervention programs can only work with the active support of law enforcement and criminal justice personnel, however.  The focus of law enforcement needs to be upon the clients of child prostitutes, and courts need to view sexual offenses against prostituted children as seriously as they view offenses against non-prostituted children.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>VIII.	SOME PROPOSALS FOR THE FUTURE</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	Preventative Education with Abusers and Potential Abusers</B><BR>

<P>Preventative education programmes with prostitute users and potential prostitute users need to be developed worldwide.  Popular misconceptions about prostitution and male sexuality need to be challenged amongst young people, some of whom will otherwise grow up to become sexual exploiters.  Education on the impact of child sexual abuse upon victims, on the reasons why children and women enter into prostitution, on age of consent and prostitution law around the world, as well as consciousness raising around issues of gender and racism would also help to deconstruct the permissive narratives used by current abusers to justify their actions.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Preventative Action with Specific Groups of Prostitute Users and Child Sex Exploiters</B><BR>

<P>Since military and naval personnel are effectively a captive audience, it would be very simple to introduce an educational programme along the lines mentioned in I) above for them as part of their training.  (It is particularly important to target military personnel since research indicates that many sex tourists and local prostitute users are ex-military men, suggesting that the armed services often socialise men into a lifelong 'addiction' to prostitute use.)  Companies which tolerate or promote prostitute use by businessmen should also be targeted.  Likewise, during flights to sex tourist destinations, tourists could be exposed to educational videos which specifically challenge the cognitive distortions employed by situational abusers as well as preferential abusers and paedophiles.  This would also encourage non-abusive tourists to challenge the behaviour of abusive tourists when they witness it.<BR>

<P>The demand for commercial sex from migrant workers could be partially addressed through changes to immigration policies and/or company policies which often forcibly separate migrant male workers from their wives or partners.  Oppressive immigration policies also underpin the absolute power that employers wield over domestic workers and thus need to be challenged more generally.  Meanwhile, child sexual abuse by Aid workers, orphanage directors, religious missionaries and church workers could be reduced through the imposition of more thorough vetting and monitoring procedures.  In particular, agencies which make block grants to projects in poor countries should be urged to exercise great caution where a) the project is founded and run by a single foreign male and administered without accountability to the local community, and b) the project has as its sole focus assistance to poor young children.  There are likewise some obvious steps that could be taken to prevent the sexual abuse of child prisoners (i.e., massive reductions to the child prison population, and the provision of separate cells for those for whom incarceration is truly unavoidable).<BR>

<P><B>3.	Awareness Raising to Encourage Better Policing and Reporting of Child Sex Exploiters</B><BR>

<P>Education in countries which are newly attracting sex tourists could also play an important preventative role.  Local people are often unaware of the phenomenon of sex tourism (until it is too late), and more especially, they may have little knowledge about child sexual abuse. Without this knowledge, Western paedophiles' observable behaviour with street children - buying them meals, cuddling them, taking them back to hotel rooms - is often interpreted as 'kindliness', and certainly not seen as a cause for concern.  It is also the case that there are currently a number of organisations (and hundreds of thousands of individuals) in a position to assist in the policing and prevention of child sexual exploitation, which do not offer any assistance. Indeed, through their tolerance of prostitute use, the army, the navy, the tourist industry, employers of maritime sailors and many businesses actually contribute to the problem. Education and awareness raising programmes could be used to encourage such organisations to play a more active role in discouraging and policing abusers.  Individual tourists need to be encouraged to challenge the behaviour of compatriots engaging in sex tourism.  Share holders and pension fund managers need to be encouraged to investigate the nature of the 'hospitality' provided by managers in firms that they invest in.  Finally, it is necessary to educate those involved in criminal justice and law enforcement to recognise child prostitution for what it is, which is not only the <I>abuse</I> of socially, politically and economically powerless individuals but criminal violation of their human rights codified in international and national legal instruments.<BR>

<P><B>4.	Research and Information</B><BR>

<P>There are many areas and issues that need to be investigated and/or monitored in future.  In particular, we need more information on the nature, organisation and scale of child prostitution in different countries around the world and on the identity and motivations of their abusers; we need to monitor the development of sex tourism in new sites; and to monitor the success of therapeutic treatment programs with paedophiles and prostitute users.<BR>

<H4><B>This paper was prepared as a working document for the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children by Martin Staebler for ECPAT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Introduction</B><BR>

<P>International tourism organisations have been unanimous in condemning the use of tourism for the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The World Tourism Organisation calls it a violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which requires strict legal action by tourist sending and receiving countries (Oct. 22, 1995). The Universal Federation of Travel Agents Associations, one of the first travel organisations to condemn child prostitution, has produced a Childrens and Travel Agents Charter which is being circulated for signature by national members and which pledges to &quot;give every assistance to the various organisations, campaigns and charitable associations concerned with the welfare of child victims of sex tourism to help restore the dignity, physical and mental health to such children&quot;.<BR>

<P>It is appropriate that the Congress in Sweden should recognise the growing concern among tourism bodies about the situation of children in prostitution and the related issues of sex tourism. Current estimates put the number of children entering the sex-market every year at well above one million. This issue is now being widely discussed within the industry itself and it is hoped that a new consensus will emerge from the Congress on how the tourism industry can help the international community bring an end to this modern form of slavery.<BR>

<P>This paper provides the background to the involvement of the tourism industry with the issue and describes some of the actions which have been taken. Many people have contributed to the preparation and drafting of this paper. Officials from the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Universal Federation of Travel Agents' Associations (UFTAA), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Union of Food, Agriculture, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers Associations (IUF) have been particularly helpful. <BR>

<P><B>I.	TOURISM</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	The Tourism Experience</B><BR>

<P>Travelling has become a part of everyday life in many societies of todays world. Crossing a border has lost its magic for many people, thus making foreign and domestic travel in their minds more and more alike. However, this does not change a basic reality, namely that travel to a foreign country is not a neutral action. International visitors should therefore enter a foreign country with sensitivity to cultural, ethnic, social, economic or religious differences between their country of origin and should respect the values that these differences entail in the host country.<BR>

<P>This is especially evident in sexual customs. What is acceptable behaviour in one country (e.g. public displays of affection or nudity) may be quite unacceptable and even illegal in another. Sexual mores require particular sensitivity from tourists.<BR>

<P>Historically, travel and prostitution have often been associated. The earliest tourism destinations were religious shrines or trade centres and in the ruins of ancient cities such as Ephesus, Babylon and Pompeii prostitute quarters are still clearly visible and surprisingly large. Inveterate travellers in history, particularly seamen and soldiers, have helped to create a place for prostitution in the cities they visited. <BR>

<P>Today the number of tourists is increasing dramatically. Most of these new travellers are not deliberately seeking sex when they travel but even so the number who make use of commercial sex is considerable, especially in those destinations where sexual services are readily available.<BR>

<P>There are many psychological as well as social and cultural reasons advanced to explain why this takes place:<BR>

<P>When the tourist is away from home there is an anonymity which releases him or her from the usual social restraints which determine behaviour in the home country. A man who would never contemplate visiting a brothel in his home town will often do so in a foreign country where there is little likelihood of detection. Many countries have noted this phenomena. A Japanese proverb claims that the traveller knows no shame&quot;. A common saying in parts of Europe is, &quot;the further I go from home the less moral I become&quot;. <BR>

<P>In exotic&quot; tourist destinations visitors usually cannot understand the language or the cultural nuances in the society. This leads them to make assumptions which are probably untrue but which enable them to rationalise their changed behaviour.  It is common for those tourists who sexually exploit children to explain their behaviour by saying that sex with children &quot;is more acceptable in this culture, and the people here do not have the same sexual hang-ups we have in our country&quot;. Equally common among exploiters is the rationalisation that this is a way of helping poor children to get some money.<BR>

<P>Tourism does not only change behaviour, it can also reinforce prejudice. Visitors who hold strong views, whether explicit or obscure, about the inferiority of people other than their own usually have their racist attitudes reinforced in foreign countries. They see what they want to see. Such people have no scruples about exploiting other persons because they consider them to be inferior.<BR>

<P>The experience of economic superiority in a poorer country tempts some visitors to sexually exploit and abuse local people. Modern tourists from industrialised nations may hold quite menial positions in their own country but the disparity in salaries can mean they are comparatively wealthy when they travel to a poor country. These nouveau riche will sometimes spend their money in sexual activities which they have associated with the rich and the famous.<BR>

<P>Tourists are sometimes fleeing from an unhappy sexual relationship at home and are open to new sexual experiences. Aspects of this have been noted among men from Western industrialised societies. With traditional privileges of patriarchal society slowly being closed off in many Western countries some men feel inadequate to cope with the change. Marriages and other relationships break down, employment opportunities are no longer so readily available and strong women are seen to be a threat to male domination.<BR>

<P>Finally, one of the most important reasons why child sex exploitation is taking place among tourists is because the children are readily available. The ease with which tourists in some countries can obtain a child as a sexual partner is, in itself, a powerful incentive for some to try the novelty of a child sex partner.  The role of organised crime in the supply of children must be recognised. Because tourists are often willing to pay large sums of money for sexual services from children, the trade in children has become more lucrative to criminals and therefore more commonplace.<BR>

<P>2.	The Business Traveller<BR>

<P>Those who travel for business rather than pleasure share many of the attributes listed above. However, they are often more sophisticated travellers and usually have more money to spend. Some of them are more likely to remain in one place for long periods, others return often to the same place.<BR>

<P>Business people usually travel alone and are largely male. Not surprisingly, a number of serious cases of consistent commercial child exploitation have been uncovered among travelling men in the business community.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Business People within Poor Countries</B><BR>

<P>On the other hand, business people in poor countries where tourists arrive in greater numbers, see and seize opportunities for substantial profit at low risk and little investment by developing a sex industry, using the available prostitutes, enticing or forcing women to get involved, and if necessary, recruit or force children to become sex-workers. The sex industry is organised like most other industries. It is a sector in which individuals as well as large organisations operate. It frequently has connections with other illegal and exploitative behaviour - such as trafficking of children, forced labour and pornography.<BR>

<P><B>II.	THE TOURISM INDUSTRY</B><BR>

<P>The tourism industry cannot be held accountable for the behaviour of its clients, unless the industry involves them in (commercial) sex opportunities. But it is always affirmed by those who promote tourism that the fundamental objective for the industry is &quot;to promote peace, human rights, mutual understanding, respect for all peoples and cultures and sustainable development&quot;.<BR>

<P>It is encouraging to see that a number of tourism bodies are taking these objectives seriously and there is a new sense of corporate responsibility among many branches of the tourism industry. This is seen particularly in the growing awareness of the need to protect the environment from the impact of too much tourism on some fragile eco-systems. Tourism must respect the environment and people.<BR>

<P>In terms of tourisms promotion of human rights, respect for all people and sustainable development, there is clearly an issue to be resolved in the general area of sex tourism. This blanket phrase, &quot;sex tourism&quot;, first used by non-governmental organisations in 1980 to describe the phenomenon in South-East Asia, is now seen by many countries as contrary to sustainable economic and human development.<BR>

<P>Several tourism organisations have established trade conventions which ensure that tour agencies which promote sex-tours will forfeit their licence to remain as tour agents. This is sometimes done in response to public pressure. During the Swiss ECPAT campaign in 1992, a journalist arranged a child sex-tour through a travel agent and on his return home he wrote an exposition of the agents operation. The subsequent public outcry ensured that the agent was no longer able to operate his business.<BR>

<P>In introducing laws of extraterritoriality to end child prostitution, several countries, including the United States, Germany and Australia, have also incorporated legal provisions which prohibit the operation of child-sex tours. Any tour operator who attempts to promote child-sex tours now faces the possibility of fine or imprisonment.<BR>

<P>Sex tourism has thus created a &quot;web-work&quot; in which tourists, the sex industry and the tourism industry itself are involved either by necessity or by implication, by intention or not.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>III.	THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROMOTION AND ORGANISATION OF SEX TOURISM</B><BR>

<P>The sex tourism &quot;environment&quot; (sex tourists motives, economic interests, sex-oriented profile of tourist destinations, style of advertising, etc.) provides significant encouragement for persons inclined to exploit children when travelling.<BR>

<P>The comments in this section give at least some insight and background to what the general issue of sex tourism is like and to encourage actions that would eliminate contributing factors to the sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P>The flow of sex tourists is mainly from the economically developed world (Western Europe, Scandinavian countries, North America; Australasia, the Gulf States) to poorer countries of South-East Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. However, some wealthy individuals from less economically developed countries such as Mexico, Argentina and India, are also known to practise sex tourism and there are a small number of sex tourist destinations (for example Amsterdam, New Orleans, Las Vegas) in affluent countries. Some countries in Eastern Europe are also now beginning to attract sex tourists and export child prostitution to other countries. There is enormous variation between the receiving countries in terms of the degree of national level involvement in organising sex tourism. Many receiving countries are under economic and political pressures to promote tourism as a means of generating foreign exchange revenue. In some cases, there is what amounts to official acceptance of the fact that tourism means sex tourism, some government officials have spoken of sacrificing a generation of women in pursuit of economic development.<BR>

<P>In most cases, however, organised crime represents the only concerted organisation of sex tourism at the national level. There are also numerous local individuals who involve themselves in prostitution, including child prostitution, in opportunistic ways; e.g. pimping and procuring, taking payment from either prostitutes or clients for the use of rooms and/or for turning a blind eye, etc. As in all other markets, their behaviour is partly a response to an existing demand for prostitution from tourists, and partly a proactive attempt to generate such demand by creating and promoting an effective supply function. Sadly, many such forms of involvement rely on the existence of corruption among the police force (itself usually explained by the low pay of police officers).<BR>

<P>The international promotion and organisation of sex tourism takes place in different ways. First, there are individual men and groups of men who appear to view the sexual exploitation of people in Third World countries as a benign hobby, and dedicate themselves to providing information for like-minded individuals on a non-profit making basis. This can simply involve the exchange of information between men in sex tourist resorts, or in bars and pubs back home. It is also achieved via the Internet, with some men contributing pornographic accounts of their sexual exploits for others to peruse and supplying details of bars, brothels, prices etc., in various sex tourist destinations. Descriptions of children and/or information about how to obtain child prostitutes are sometimes included in this material. The lack of adequate legislation allows these Internet locations to encourage sex tourists to target new destinations, for example in Asia and in Africa.<BR>

<P>Second, although there are very few tour operators that explicitly arrange child sex tours, there are still various small companies in Europe, Australia, North America and Japan which promote and facilitate sex tourism by identifying resorts where prostitution is widespread; by negotiating deals with local hotels to ensure that their clients will not be charged for bringing companions back to their room for the night; by arranging 24 hour female guides for clients; by providing on the spot holiday reps with an intimate knowledge of prostitution in cities and resorts. Also, tourism destination countries are often marketed in such a way as to create or develop an image or reputation for sex tourism.<BR>

<P>There is reason to believe that European, Australian and North American companies involved in arranging sex tours which may include the abuse of children are usually very small-scale operations, often one man shows.<BR>

<P>Third, there are individuals and companies that write and publish travel guides which promote sex tourism at least by implication. Some guides cater simply and solely to a sex tourist market and provide a wealth of information for the preferential child abuser (specifying bars and brothels where younger girls are to be found), as well as constantly emphasising the youth of the lovely and willing ladies to be found in the locations recommended. There have also been cases of publications which cater very specifically to child abusers.<BR>

<P>Finally, the broader tourist industry at least provides the vehicle for the movements of sex tourists. The fact remains that the travel arrangements of the vast majority of sex tourists are organised by reputable travel agents and package tour operators, and sex tourists are all transported around the world by ordinary air lines. Sex tourism, by implication, means big business for large corporations as well as smaller travel companies, and the composition of sex tourists in any given resort in terms of their nationalities more or less precisely mirrors the pattern of foreign investment in that resort. The marketing material put out by many reputable travel companies also helps to sustain the flow of sex tourists. It often stresses the attractions of the nightlife in resorts where the only nightlife that exists is centred around the sexual exploitation of local people. It also promulgates stereotypes about Third World <BR>

<P>people as happy, smiling, laid-back and exotic. Such stereotypes sometimes indicate quite ethno-centric and racist attitudes.<BR>

<P>IV.	THE ECONOMICS OF TOURISM VERSUS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<BR>

<P>Since 1960, world-wide travel has increased more than sevenfold - about half for recreational purposes. The number of international tourist arrivals in 1995 was estimated at 567 million, to increase by 2010 to 967 million.  International tourism has already become item one in world exports (ahead of petroleum, vehicles, electronic equipment, etc.) and is the leading tradable services sector (WTO). With as many as 200 million jobs in travel and tourism, this industry is the biggest employer in the world. Every 6th job in the world on average is somehow depending on or related to travel and tourism (WTTC). <BR>

<P>Such figures emphasise the economic importance of tourism. Many developing countries now rate tourism as their major export earner and their main hope for future economic development. In Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe enormous investments of time, people and money are going into the development of tourism.<BR>

<P>For some of these countries sex tourism (including child sex) is seen as an unfortunate but necessary part of tourism development. There is a frequently quoted statement by a former Deputy Prime Minister of a government in Asia when his country was developing its tourism industry. Speaking to Provincial Governors in October 1980 he said that they should contribute to the national tourism effort by developing scenic spots while at the same time encouraging &quot;certain entertainments which some of you may find disgusting and embarrassing because they are related to sexual pleasures&quot;. The Deputy Police General responded to the challenge to promote tourism &quot;by lengthening service hours on entertainment places .... to welcome tourists&quot;. The link between tourism and prostitution is a mind-set in many places.<BR>

<P>Sometimes the campaign to end child prostitution has run into conflict with tourism ministries in developing countries because it was considered to be anti-tourism. Tourism developers had been taught that the provision of every kind of sexual service to foreign tourists was a necessary part of tourism development. Fortunately, that phase is now passing but it is still necessary to remind tourism host countries that hospitality need not mean the sexual exploitation of their children. <BR>

<P>The commercial sexual exploitation of children is possible largely because of economic disparities. But this does not excuse it, nor is it a complete explanation. The sale of children can also be a reflection of greed on the part of the parents selling a child, or greed on the part of the criminal in the middle who abducts or seduces a child into prostitution. <BR>

<P>By treating the child as a commodity which can be purchased, hired, sold or thrown away the issue is no longer just a question of poverty but rather one of values - and in particular the values of consumerism.<BR>

<P>This is a subtle distinction but of considerable importance for the way in which tourism is marketed. When tourism advertising promotes the values of consumerism and hedonism as the central goal of the tourism experience it is affirming the same values which make the prostitution of children possible. Tourism promotion must always recognise the need to protect children against all forms of exploitation and sexual violence attributable to the activities of tourists (Childrens and Travel Agents Charter UFTAA).<BR>

<P>It must be clearly pointed out that whatever short-term economic benefits might come from sex customers for tourism and related interests concerned, the unseen long term economic, social, cultural and health costs are high and passed to others, i.e. the future generation, the future government, international aid agencies, aid programmes from the countries of tourists origin, charity organizations etc. This reality defines - by implication - concrete responsibilities on the side of all those, who can influence the course of tourism development.<BR>

<P>V.	WHAT CAN BE DONE?<BR>

<P>The Congress in Sweden includes many sectors of society, from law enforcement officials to politicians to social activists to medical professionals. The tourism representatives will speak not only for the industry itself but also for the commercial sector of society which is driven by economics and profit. Their presence at the Congress is a sign that corporate bodies share the responsibility for ensuring that children will be protected from sex exploitation and that positive human values must be affirmed by the whole of society. <BR>

<P>More importantly, the tourism industry has the capacity to help end the trade in children in a very short time. Tourism is the worlds largest employer of people and therefore has representatives in most towns and cities of the world. In all tourism centres it is the tourism sector which provides the transport, the accommodation and the services which are required by travellers - including those who want to sexually abuse children. Workers in tourism are, therefore, in an unique position to see and report what is happening, thereby enabling management to put pressure on the authorities to ensure that crimes against children are properly investigated.<BR>

<P>The following section of the paper asks what can be done and introduces - as examples of possible alternatives - some programmes which have already been attempted within the tourism sector.<BR>

<P>1.	Tourist Education<BR>

<P>Tourists seek factual information on the place to be visited. Beyond their primary need for prices, timetables etc., they are also given background information on social and cultural customs and restrictions in the country they are visiting. Therefore, as a first level of action, education about child sexual abuse needs to be a major priority.  In the last three years numerous groups have initiated some actions in this regard. Often it has been done as a partnership between the tourism industry and governments or the tourism industry and non-governmental organisations. Some examples:<BR>

<P><I>Travel Agents</I><BR>
Since 1993 a number of countries have passed laws of extraterritoriality which means that nationals from that country who sexually abuse children overseas can be tried for the crime in their home country. To inform the public of this new law several countries have produced material for the use of travellers.<BR>

<P><I>Sweden</I><BR>
The Swedish aid agency R&auml;dda Barnen helped produce an imaginative card to be inserted in airline tickets to Asia. One side gave the bright side of tourism and the other the dark side. The latter warned tourists that they should protect children--not exploit them. Cards were distributed by the Swedish Travel Agency Association.<BR>

<P><I>Norway</I><BR>
Redd Barna and Den Norske Reisebransjeforeningen co-operated to produce a widely-distributed brochure warning against AIDS and child prostitution.<BR>

<P><I>France</I><BR>
The French travel industry and several government ministries have combined to produce a leaflet which warns against child prostitution. Distributed through travel agents, more than 300,000 copies were distributed in the first months and by now over 1 million have been given out.<BR>

<P>1.2	Customs<BR>

<P><I>Australia</I><BR>
The Australian customs service has a supply of leaflets at the counter. They are available to anyone, but one is often directly handed to male travellers going to one of the Asian sex-tourism destinations. The leaflet warns against child sex tourism. It was initiated by ECPAT-Australia and funded by aid agencies. New Zealand is preparing a similar brochure.<BR>

<P> 1.3	In Flight<BR>

<P><I>Germany</I><BR>
During long flights travellers are receptive to some low-key information on the issue. Already in the late seventies and early eighties, Condor flights to Colombo/Sri Lanka successfully showed a 28 minute film on how tourists should not behave. Responses to begging children, behaviour and dressing in sacred sites and temples as well as the personal and social relationship of tourists with a 12-year-old beach boy were topics treated in the film with sensitivity.<BR>

<P><I>Indonesia</I><BR>
Garuda airlines became concerned at the activities of tourists to Indonesia in the 1980s and inserted a brochure in the seat pocket of all their flights from Australia and America to Indonesia. This contained a Code of Ethics for travellers.<BR>

<P><I>Italy</I><BR>
The Italian Federation of Travel and Tourism has declared its willingness to distribute a leaflet and this will probably be done in association with Alitalia air-lines.<BR>

<P><I>Austria</I><BR>
A negative example from Lauda Air, the Austrian airline shows that the issue of child sex abuse is not something which can be treated lightly. In 1992 the inflight magazine of Lauda Air contained an offensive mock postcard from a German tourist. The photo was a young Thai girl naked from the waist up and the message on the back boasted of the pleasures of sex in a bar in Thailand. &quot;Must go&quot;, the message ended, &quot;the tarts in the Baby Club are waiting for me&quot;. It was a particularly tasteless and insensitive piece of journalism and led to public protests in Bangkok and eventually a qualified apology from Lauda Air.<BR>

<P>1.4	On the Ground<BR>

<P><I>Thailand</I><BR>
Groups concerned at the sexual abuse of children produced a pamphlet in 1995 to be widely distributed to foreign tourists through hotels and some shops. Produced by the National Commission on Womens Affairs, it carries the message &quot;Sex with Children is a Crime&quot;.<BR>

<P>
<P>1.5	Through Guide Books<BR>

<P><I>United States</I><BR>
Fodors guide books and videos are the authoritative American guide to travel. Fodors has taken an interest in the campaign against child prostitution and featured it on television programmes. They also include a Code of Ethics in many of their books.<BR>

<P><I>Australia</I><BR>
Lonely Planet is one of the largest travel publications in the world and the company has recently set up a watching brief on issues such as political repression, indigenous rights, ecological damage, the environmental impact of tourism and now child prostitution. In relation to child sex tourism, Lonely Planet believes it has a responsibility to help raise awareness of the sexual exploitation of children, especially in countries where this is particularly acute. To this end it has been sending ECPAT-Australias information kits to authors contracted to update Lonely Planet editions. The aim is to ensure that their authors are informed and address the issue of child sex tourism as well as the recent changes to national and international law which make this activity a criminal offence.<BR>

<P><B>1.6	At Travel Fairs</B><BR>

<P><B></B><B><I>United Kingdom</I></B><BR>
In several countries national travel exhibitions have had displays warning against child sex tourism prepared by local non-governmental organisations. The United Kingdom is one of several examples. In the UK the Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism was given a free stand by the Association of British Travel Agents for a display at the 1995 World Travel Mart.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Cooperation: Employers/Employees</B><BR>

<P>Joint efforts by employers and employees in tourism facilities such as hotels and hostels can assist to ensure that the sexual exploitation of children is prevented or, if it occurs, is reported and cases are put into the hand of law-enforcement officials.<BR>

<P>Already, the IUF/UITA/IUL (International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers Association) has passed resolutions to this effect in June 95 and December 95 stating that workers in the tourism sector can and must play a key-role in the fight against child prostitution and calling for negotiations with employers for appropriate joint action. The IUF/ UITA/IUL also underscores the key responsibility of governments in this struggle, both in host countries and in the home countries of tourists, and urges governments to intensify their efforts aimed at enforcing human rights, in particular for children, by enacting appropriate legislation that makes it a crime for individuals or businesses to promote or engage in business involving child prostitution.<BR>

<P>3.	Self Regulation<BR>

<P>From within the tourism industry there have been several creative proposals for monitoring what is happening and for self-regulation. Two of the more interesting developments in this regard come from Taiwan and Germany:<BR>

<P><B>Taiwan</B><BR>
Following an NGO report of 1993, which revealed a very high number of child prostitutes in Taiwan, the Kaoshiung Hotel Association and the Taipei Hotel Association initiated campaigns among their members to support ECPAT in combating child prostitution in Asian tourism. They discipline any of their members known to encourage child prostitution in their rooms. Other actions include:<BR>
-	hanging anti-child-prostitution plastic cards in front of the hotel reception,<BR>
-	issue of VIP cards for ECPAT supporters, entitling the holder to discounts in the participating hotels (50,000 cards issued so far),<BR>
-	a statement by the Kaoshiung Hotel Association in support of ECPAT, expressing commitment to help victims of child prostitution and mentioning the actions taken.<BR>

<P><B>Germany</B><BR>
On the basis of a draft, <I>Terre Des Hommes</I> Germany made contracts with 12 German tour operators to date, in which the signatories undertake to:<BR>
-	ensure that there will be no child prostitution in their partner hotels,<BR>
-	inform their customers about the background and impact of child prostitution,<BR>
-	train their staff in hotel and tour guides accordingly.<BR>

<P><B>4.		Reporting the Crime</B><BR>

<P>The sexual abuse or trafficking of a child is a crime and must be reported. However, many people prefer to look the other way when they suspect that there is some abuse taking place, while others are reluctant to report for fear of losing their jobs. Reporting is the task of everyone in the field: the tourism industry (tourism companies, trade organizations) individuals employed by the tourism industry (tourism personnel) and the travelling public. In addition, NGOs and private citizens in a given destination could and should report relevant facts and observations. Last, but by no means least, all media have to play a vital role to ensure that facts are brought into the open. Appropriate legislation by governments and self-regulation measures by all sectors of the tourism industry provide a useful and necessary framework for personal action and will encourage any voluntary action based on conscience, sensibility and awareness. The following cases illustrate that some courageous and active responses to this challenge do take place:<BR>

<P><B>India</B><BR>
In 1991 a hostess on Indian Airlines noticed a young girl in distress. Speaking to her in her own dialect she discovered that she was a young girl sold by her parents and being abducted to Saudi Arabia by the man next to her. The hostess radioed to the police in Delhi, announced to the passengers what was happening and got them to sign a petition. The abductor was arrested and the girl freed.<BR>

<P><B>Thailand</B><BR>
In 1993 a French group tour included some single men. When one of the men told his friend that he was going to have sex with a child the friend was outraged. There was a loud argument but the first man finally decided to go and have sex with a young child anyway. The second man went to the police and made them arrest his countryman.<BR>

<P>It may seem an attractive proposal to encourage those in the tourism industry to report a crime or the potential for a crime but the idea must be approached with caution. The semblance of criminality does not necessarily mean that a crime is about to occur. The proposal also gives the possibility of persons fulfilling a vendetta against their enemies.<BR>

<P>5.	 	Lobbying Governments<BR>

<P>In recent years laws to cover the commercial sexual abuse of children in tourism have been passed in Germany (June 1993), France (February 1994), Australia (July 1994), United States (September 1994), Belgium (March 1995) and New Zealand (July 1995) with several other countries considering similar measures. In most cases the government has received submissions from the tourism industry and from tourism ministries. The submissions were in all cases positive in their support of legislation.<BR>

<P>In Italy the government passed an Order of the Day (March 1995) which requires travel agents to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of children.<BR>

<P><B>6.		Training Programmes</B><BR>

<P>Lufthansa and Air New Zealand are among the airlines which have included instruction of their staff on the dangers of commercial child sex exploitation in their regular training programmes. A number of other airlines are discussing the possibility.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>VI.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>The Congress will provide an opportunity for Governments to review their own role in the determination of tourism policies. In many instances political action will be essential to ensure that child sex tourism is prevented. <BR>

<P>A cooperative partnership between governments and tourism could make a positive contribution to ending the commercial sexual exploitation of children.

<H4><B>	Introduction</B></H4>
<P><B>Dans les maisons de prostitution de Manille et de Nairobi</B>, dans les rues de Rio et de New York, dans les bars d'Amsterdam et de Bangkok, dans les autobus, les gares, les chambres d'h&ocirc;tel de toutes les r&eacute;gions du monde, des millions d'enfants	Reconnaissant la distinction entre enfant et adolescent et les diverses d&eacute;finitions de l'&acirc;ge adulte aux termes des 		<BR>
droits nationaux et coutumiers, le terme  enfant  est utilis&eacute; dans l'ensemble du document pour parler de toute 		<BR>
personne &acirc;g&eacute;e de moins de 18 ans, comme d&eacute;fini par la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant.<BR>
 risquent d'&ecirc;tre expos&eacute;s &agrave; une exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales ou sont d&eacute;j&agrave; prisonniers d'une industrie du sexe qui se chiffre en m&eacute;ga-dollars.<BR>

<P>Enfants sacrifi&eacute;s &agrave; l'abus de pouvoir d'adultes sans scrupules ou qui n'ont simplement pas r&eacute;fl&eacute;chi; enfants soumis &agrave; la violence et expos&eacute;s &agrave; de graves dangers sanitaires; leur droit &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation et tous leurs autres droits bafou&eacute;s; leur enfance sacrifi&eacute;e et tous les aspects de leur d&eacute;veloppement entrav&eacute;s; leurs perspectives de vie gravement limit&eacute;es. Telles sont les manifestations tragiques et tr&egrave;s inqui&eacute;tantes de la n&eacute;gligence et de l'&eacute;chec des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, des communaut&eacute;s et des gouvernements dans leur lutte contre le grave probl&egrave;me que repr&eacute;sentent les enfants prisonniers du commerce du sexe.<BR>

<P>Le syst&egrave;me &eacute;ducatif est l'instrument dont dispose la soci&eacute;t&eacute; pour armer les enfants des comp&eacute;tences et des connaissances n&eacute;cessaires et appropri&eacute;es pour r&eacute;aliser leur potentiel et assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s dans la vie. L'&eacute;ducation est un v&eacute;hicule qui permet de transmettre &agrave; la g&eacute;n&eacute;ration montante les valeurs, les attitudes, les convictions, les normes et les comportements consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme importants par la soci&eacute;t&eacute;; c'est &eacute;galement un instrument de transformation sociale. Le fait que l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales se perp&eacute;tue prouve &agrave; l'&eacute;vidence l'&eacute;chec des syst&egrave;mes d'&eacute;ducation; l'&eacute;ducation doit jouer un r&ocirc;le important dans l'&eacute;limination de cette pratique. Quelles possibilit&eacute;s offre l'&eacute;ducation dans la lutte contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants et quelles sont ses limites ? Que peut-on faire pour promouvoir son r&ocirc;le ? Tels sont les th&egrave;mes trait&eacute;s dans ce document.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>II.		&Eacute;ducation et changement social</B></H4>
<P><B>L'exploitation d'enfants &agrave; des fins sexuelles</B> est un probl&egrave;me complexe, qui a diverses facettes, et qui comprend des d&eacute;terminants &eacute;conomiques, sociaux, culturels et politiques. La pauvret&eacute; issue des disparit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques et l'absence d'ouvertures pour les familles et les jeunes sont les premi&egrave;res &agrave; incriminer. Certaines valeurs et normes de comportement sociales et culturelles encouragent l'indiff&eacute;rence, quand elles ne sont pas complices d'agressions graves envers les enfants. Nombreux sont les syst&egrave;mes juridiques et leurs m&eacute;canismes d'application qui sont incapables de s'opposer &agrave; l'injustice ou de prot&eacute;ger les enfants contre les actes criminels dont ils sont victimes. Les syst&egrave;mes politiques emp&ecirc;chent souvent les secteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; qui en ont pourtant le plus grand besoin de s'exprimer, &agrave; savoir ceux qui souffrent d'exploitation et d'in&eacute;galit&eacute;. L'&eacute;ducation, elle-m&ecirc;me soumise &agrave; des pressions sociales concurrentes, doit donc devenir un instrument du changement dont le r&ocirc;le principal sera de pr&eacute;venir, de r&eacute;duire et par la suite d'&eacute;liminer cette pratique.<BR>

<P>Il a &eacute;t&eacute; expliqu&eacute; de mani&egrave;re convaincante que la scolarit&eacute; organis&eacute;e en programmes de type scolaire ou non scolaire ne constitue qu'une infime fraction de l'apprentissage humain. Les principales connaissances, et celles qui sont probablement le plus profond&eacute;ment ancr&eacute;es dans notre esprit, sont acquises gr&acirc;ce aux interactions avec notre milieu social et physique. Cette &eacute;cole de la vie a &eacute;t&eacute; appel&eacute;e <I>apprentissage non structur&eacute;</I> pour faire la diff&eacute;rence avec l'apprentissage organis&eacute; que sont les programmes <I>scolaires</I> et <I>non scolaires</I>	<BR>
Coombs, P. H., et Ahmed, M., <I>Attacking Rural Poverty : How Nonformal Education Can Help</I>, Banque mondiale et 		<BR>
Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974.<BR>
L'&eacute;ducation dans son sens le plus large est une question de circonstance ou de conception. Les enfants apprennent davantage de la mani&egrave;re dont on les traite que de ce qu'on leur enseigne, et cet enseignement peut entraver le d&eacute;veloppement de l'enfant ou au contraire l'aider &agrave; s'&eacute;panouir. C'est gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation que les valeurs et les attitudes, les comp&eacute;tences, les convictions et les comportements naissent et sont inculqu&eacute;s. La compr&eacute;hension que les enfants ont d'eux-m&ecirc;mes et de leur monde d&eacute;pend de leurs relations avec les adultes et les camarades qui comptent dans leur vie, qu'ils prennent pour mod&egrave;les, qu'ils observent et dont ils suivent les enseignements.<BR>

<P>Les enfants assimilent les le&ccedil;ons qu'ils re&ccedil;oivent au foyer, &agrave; l'&eacute;cole, en regardant la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision et en &eacute;coutant la radio, dans les &eacute;glises et les mosqu&eacute;es  tout comme celles que leur donnent la rue, les gares et les stations d'autobus, les bars et les maisons de prostitution. Quelles sont donc les le&ccedil;ons qu'apprennent les enfants qui se livrent &agrave; des activit&eacute;s sexuelles &agrave; des fins commerciales ? Qu'on ne peut pas faire confiance aux adultes; que les enfants, en particulier les fillettes, sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des biens de consommation, dot&eacute;s d'une valeur &eacute;conomique &agrave; court terme; que ceux qui d&eacute;tiennent le pouvoir ont le privil&egrave;ge de pouvoir prendre toutes les d&eacute;cisions; et que l'argent, la situation sociale et les biens mat&eacute;riels ont souvent davantage de valeur que la dignit&eacute;, le respect de soi et parfois m&ecirc;me, la vie.<BR>

<P>Qui sont ceux qui instruisent les victimes d'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales ? Ces enfants tirent des le&ccedil;ons directes du comportement de ceux qui les exploitent : clients, trafiquants, souteneurs, propri&eacute;taires de maisons de prostitution et tous ceux qui ach&egrave;tent et vendent, gagnent de l'argent ou en donnent, pour avoir des relations sexuelles avec des enfants. Mais ces criminels ne pourraient pas exister sans la complicit&eacute; explicite ou implicite de l'ensemble de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;  et celle des adultes responsables d'aider, de prot&eacute;ger et d'assurer le d&eacute;veloppement des enfants  les familles, les enseignants, les professionnels de la sant&eacute; et autres dispensateurs de services, les agents de la force publique, les chefs spirituels et communautaires, les m&eacute;dias, les d&eacute;cideurs et le grand public.<BR>
Le d&eacute;fi lanc&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation comporte deux volets. <I>Premi&egrave;rement</I>, comment le syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation peut-il, en synergie avec d'autres institutions sociales, devenir un moteur proactif du changement social ? Le but de cette collaboration est d'op&eacute;rer un changement dans les attitudes de toutes les institutions et de tous les syst&egrave;mes sociaux afin que l'humanit&eacute;, la dignit&eacute; et les droits de l'enfant soient prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, respect&eacute;s et encourag&eacute;s. <I>Deuxi&egrave;mement</I>, comment le syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation peut-il s'opposer aux influences n&eacute;fastes et renforcer les le&ccedil;ons positives apprises &agrave; l'&eacute;cole de la vie ? Les programmes d'enseignement scolaires ou non scolaires n'y suffisent pas tels qu'ils sont, m&ecirc;me pour les enfants qui fr&eacute;quentent d&eacute;j&agrave; l'&eacute;cole.<BR>
L'&eacute;ducation n'est pas une panac&eacute;e et les mesures p&eacute;dagogiques ne permettront pas en soi de lutter contre les ravages provoqu&eacute;s par le commerce du sexe dans les rangs des enfants. Cependant, aucun effort destin&eacute; &agrave; lutter contre ce fl&eacute;au ne pourra &ecirc;tre entrepris ou durable s'il n'est assorti de mesures p&eacute;dagogiques. Ce document d&eacute;montrera que le syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation peut et doit contribuer bien davantage &agrave; la solution du probl&egrave;me qu'il ne l'a fait jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent.<BR>
Quelque chose ne tourne pas rond lorsque des enfants et des adolescents, au lieu de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole ou d'autres institutions p&eacute;dagogiques, au lieu d'&ecirc;tre &eacute;lev&eacute;s dans un milieu aimant et attentif &agrave; leurs besoins, sont priv&eacute;s de leur droit &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation et oblig&eacute;s de vivre dans les t&eacute;n&egrave;bres des menaces, de la violence et des humiliations. L'&eacute;ducation, alli&eacute;e &agrave; d'autres instruments ou &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, doit contribuer &agrave; redresser ce pr&eacute;judice.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>III.	Un cadre d'action p&eacute;dagogique pour lutter contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>L'&eacute;ducation, dans le meilleur des cas</B>, est un moyen, pour les enfants, d'acqu&eacute;rir la confiance, le respect de soi, une capacit&eacute; de raisonnement et les comp&eacute;tences sociales n&eacute;cessaires pour prot&eacute;ger leurs droits et leur dignit&eacute; et pour devenir des adultes productifs, participant pleinement &agrave; leur soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Une &eacute;ducation r&eacute;ussie peut &eacute;galement aider les adultes, dont le r&ocirc;le est d'&eacute;lever, de garder et d'&eacute;duquer les enfants, &agrave; comprendre qu'ils seront toujours responsables d'aider leurs enfants &agrave; se d&eacute;velopper et &agrave; assumer cette responsabilit&eacute;. Un programme d'&eacute;ducation bien con&ccedil;u et appliqu&eacute; intelligemment peut encourager l'ensemble de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; respecter les droits et la dignit&eacute; de ses enfants.<BR>

<P><B><I>1. La Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant</I></B><BR>

<P>Toute initiative p&eacute;dagogique visant &agrave; lutter contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales doit &ecirc;tre entreprise dans l'esprit de la Convention et la respecter &agrave; la lettre. La Convention, qui est l'expression d'un consensus international concernant les normes et les standards de comportement des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s envers les enfants, d&eacute;finit les obligations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et de l'&Eacute;tat par rapport &agrave; tous les enfants. Sa ratification par 187 &Eacute;tats &agrave; ce jour est la preuve de l'engagement de la plan&egrave;te &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre et &agrave; prot&eacute;ger tous les droits de tous les enfants. Cette reconnaissance quasi universelle repr&eacute;sente une occasion unique d'entreprendre avec d&eacute;termination des activit&eacute;s de plaidoyer et de sensibilisation en faveur des enfants. En tant que premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape du changement, la prise de conscience du probl&egrave;me doit s'accompagner de la mise au point de m&eacute;canismes offrant aux familles et aux enfants des possibilit&eacute;s de trouver et d'adopter de meilleures solutions.<BR>

<P>La Convention est un cadre pertinent pour l'action p&eacute;dagogique : elle souligne le lien qui unit l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales et diverses violations des droits; elle &eacute;tablit des principes fondamentaux et donne des conseils essentiels sur la mani&egrave;re d'envisager et de garantir le respect des droits; de plus, le droit des enfants de participer aux d&eacute;cisions qui les concernent est particuli&egrave;rement pertinent en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;ducation.<BR>

<P>La Convention offre &eacute;galement un cadre d'action, en nous guidant vers des strat&eacute;gies qui combinent le droit des enfants d'&ecirc;tre  prot&eacute;g&eacute;s  des maux de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et celui de <BR>
 b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier  de ses avantages. Car la Convention reconna&icirc;t que les droits de tous les enfants ne sont pas en p&eacute;ril, et que des mesures sp&eacute;ciales doivent &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es pour prot&eacute;ger et faire respecter ceux des enfants vivant dans des conditions particuli&egrave;rement difficiles. La plupart des droits des enfants victimes d'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales sont bafou&eacute;s, notamment le droit &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation. Peut-on, en permettant &agrave; ces enfants d'exercer leur droit &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation, faciliter leur acc&egrave;s &agrave; d'autres droits ?<BR>

<P>Oui, si les strat&eacute;gies d'&eacute;ducation reconnaissent le principe d'indivisibilit&eacute;, &agrave; savoir qu'aucun article ou groupe d'articles ne peut &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; ind&eacute;pendamment des autres et que ces articles constituent un tout. L'&eacute;ducation doit s'accompagner de mesures compl&eacute;mentaires : l&eacute;gislation, nouvelles politiques, programmes de sant&eacute;, possibilit&eacute; de travailler et attachement &agrave; promouvoir un changement de valeurs et d'attitudes.<BR>

<P>Oui, si l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sup&eacute;rieur de l'enfant est une consid&eacute;ration primordiale, compte tenu des droits et des devoirs de ses parents, de ses tuteurs ou des autres personnes l&eacute;galement responsables de lui et en prenant, &agrave; cette fin, toutes les mesures l&eacute;gislatives et administratives appropri&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Oui, si les enfants, selon leur degr&eacute; de maturit&eacute;, sont des participants actifs aux prises de d&eacute;cisions sur toute question qui les int&eacute;resse. Le principe de la participation, exprim&eacute; dans l'article 12 de la Convention, ajoute une nouvelle dimension &agrave; l'interaction du monde des adultes avec celui des enfants. Ce n'est que si les adultes qui comptent dans la vie d'un enfant respectent pleinement ses jugements et ses opinions, eu &eacute;gard &agrave; son &acirc;ge et &agrave; son degr&eacute; de maturit&eacute;, que l'enfant peut devenir un membre r&eacute;ellement actif de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Dans le processus d'&eacute;ducation, les jeunes doivent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des ressources plut&ocirc;t que comme des victimes. Il convient de respecter leur &eacute;nergie, leur force et leurs opinions, et d'en tenir d&ucirc;ment compte.<BR>

<P><B><I>2. Un engagement international</I></B><BR>

<P>Lors de la <I>Conf&eacute;rence mondiale sur l'&eacute;ducation pour tous</I> tenue &agrave; Jomtien (Tha&iuml;lande) en 1990, la communaut&eacute; mondiale s'est engag&eacute;e &agrave; adopter toutes les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour r&eacute;aliser l'objectif de l'&eacute;ducation primaire pour tous les enfants avant la fin de la d&eacute;cennie. Jomtien a &eacute;galement propos&eacute; une  vision &eacute;largie  de l'&eacute;ducation fondamentale universelle, qui d&eacute;passe la notion d'acc&egrave;s et d'inscription &agrave; l'&eacute;cole pour englober &eacute;galement la qualit&eacute; et la pertinence de l'apprentissage en tant qu'outil lib&eacute;rateur. Les objectifs de Jomtien ont servi de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence lors de l'adoption, ult&eacute;rieurement, d'objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement social, notamment ceux du Sommet mondial pour les enfants (1990), de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale sur la population et le d&eacute;veloppement (1994), du Sommet mondial pour le d&eacute;veloppement social (1995) et de la quatri&egrave;me Conf&eacute;rence mondiale sur les femmes (1995).<BR>

<P>Ce n'est qu'aujourd'hui que l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales figure &agrave; l'ordre du jour mondial et qu'un lien est &eacute;tabli avec l'&eacute;ducation en mati&egrave;re de pr&eacute;vention et de redressement. Le Congr&egrave;s mondial qui se d&eacute;roulera &agrave; Stockholm est comme une sorte de r&eacute;veil, un engagement &agrave; sensibiliser le public et &agrave; agir contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. &Agrave; cur de cet engagement se trouve un concept d'&eacute;ducation visant &agrave; modifier les attitudes et les comportements, afin que la soci&eacute;t&eacute; suive irr&eacute;vocablement la voie qui m&egrave;nera &agrave; l'&eacute;limination de cette pratique extr&ecirc;mement n&eacute;faste.<BR>
  <BR>
<B><I>3. Objectifs de l'&eacute;ducation</I></B><BR>

<P>&Eacute;tant donn&eacute; le r&ocirc;le de l'&eacute;ducation dans la promotion du changement social, quelles devraient &ecirc;tre ses priorit&eacute;s et ses objectifs en mati&egrave;re de lutte contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales ? On peut envisager le probl&egrave;me dans deux perspectives, qui ne sont pas sans lien l'une avec l'autre : 1) d&eacute;finir les principaux objectifs pour pouvoir concevoir et appliquer des programmes d'&eacute;ducation; 2) identifier les principaux groupes de population &agrave; cibler.<BR>

<P>  &Eacute;viter ou au moins limiter le risque que des enfants deviennent la proie de l'industrie du sexe en leur garantissant acc&egrave;s et participation &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation;<BR>

<P> Promouvoir et respecter les droits de l'enfant gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des programmes d'&eacute;ducation s'appuyant sur des m&eacute;thodes et un enseignement pertinents;<BR>

<P> Donner des moyens d'agir &agrave; ces enfants gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des mesures p&eacute;dagogiques adapt&eacute;es &agrave; leurs besoins et, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, des mesures de r&eacute;insertion pour les aider &agrave; r&eacute;int&eacute;grer leur famille et leur communaut&eacute;;<BR>

<P> Am&eacute;liorer les comp&eacute;tences, la compr&eacute;hension et les connaissances des adultes en contact avec les jeunes concernant la situation des enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe et de ceux qui sont expos&eacute;s &agrave; ce risque;<BR>

<P> Appuyer les activit&eacute;s de sensibilisation, de plaidoyer et de mobilisation sociale entreprises aupr&egrave;s du grand public sur l'envergure, la nature et l'impact de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales et sur les actions &agrave; entreprendre.<BR>

<P>
<P><B><I>4. Enfants &agrave; cibler</I></B><BR>

<P> Enfants en &acirc;ge de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole, qu'ils aient quitt&eacute; l'&eacute;cole, qu'ils soient scolaris&eacute;s ou embrigad&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe (donc probablement non scolaris&eacute;s). Lors de l'&eacute;laboration des programmes, il convient de tenir compte de nombreuses diff&eacute;rences, notamment en ce qui concerne les besoins et les comportements, l'&acirc;ge et le degr&eacute; de maturit&eacute;; les diff&eacute;rences entre les gar&ccedil;ons et les filles, entre les enfants de zones rurales, urbaines et de milieux culturels diff&eacute;rents; entre les enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; contraints et ceux qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; embrigad&eacute;s dans l'industrie du sexe sans contrainte physique;<BR>

<P> Groupes sp&eacute;cifiques d'adultes et institutions ayant pour r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;lever, de prot&eacute;ger et d'&eacute;duquer les enfants. Il s'agit notamment des familles et des dispensateurs de services (enseignants, professionnels de la sant&eacute;, agents de la force publique, l&eacute;gislateurs, ONG, etc.);<BR>

<P> Le grand public  citoyens, d&eacute;cideurs et personnalit&eacute;s influentes, en ciblant particuli&egrave;rement l'industrie du tourisme, et tous ceux qui ont une influence sur le public, notamment les m&eacute;dias, les organisations confessionnelles, communautaires et populaires, telles que les syndicats et les associations de jeunes et de femmes.<BR>

<P>La difficult&eacute;, lorsqu'on veut d&eacute;finir les cat&eacute;gories d'enfants &agrave; cibler, consiste &agrave; se concentrer sur ceux dont les besoins sont les plus pressants et qui pourront le mieux b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier des programmes d'&eacute;ducation, sans perdre de vue les liens entre les populations et les objectifs lors de la mise au point de strat&eacute;gies coh&eacute;rentes, globales et int&eacute;gr&eacute;es. Par exemple, pour r&eacute;ins&eacute;rer des enfants dans leur famille et leur communaut&eacute;, il conviendra d'&eacute;duquer plusieurs groupes  les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes, les familles, les enseignants, les professionnels de la sant&eacute;, les chefs spirituels et communautaires, les d&eacute;cideurs et les communaut&eacute;s dans leur ensemble.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>IV.	Strat&eacute;gies et mesures p&eacute;dagogiques</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>L'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales</B> touche essentiellement les adolescents, un groupe de population qui tombe souvent dans les br&egrave;ches des politiques publiques. Elle est intimement li&eacute;e &agrave; des th&egrave;mes extr&ecirc;mement sensibles et tabous tels que la sexualit&eacute;, la violence familiale et la grossesse chez les adolescentes qui, r&eacute;cemment encore, &eacute;taient consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des probl&egrave;mes priv&eacute;s ou familiaux qui ne concernaient ni les gouvernements, ni la communaut&eacute; internationale et qui n'&eacute;taient pas abord&eacute;s dans les programmes d'&eacute;ducation.<BR>

<P>Les cons&eacute;quences pr&eacute;judiciables au d&eacute;veloppement de l'enfant de l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales peuvent se comparer &agrave; d'autres situations particuli&egrave;rement difficiles et &agrave; d'autres formes d'exploitation, telles que le travail des enfants, la violence organis&eacute;e, l'inceste et les s&eacute;vices sexuels au foyer. Il convient d'adopter des mesures sp&eacute;ciales pour tous les enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; expos&eacute;s &agrave; de telles situations afin de les prot&eacute;ger contre les cons&eacute;quences de ce qu'ils ont endur&eacute;, de rem&eacute;dier au mal qui leur a &eacute;t&eacute; fait, de leur offrir de meilleures chances et de procurer aux enfants et &agrave; leurs familles les comp&eacute;tences qui leur permettront de tirer parti des possibilit&eacute;s offertes.<BR>

<P>La mise au point de strat&eacute;gies d'&eacute;ducation r&eacute;ussies visant &agrave; combattre ces pratiques doit reposer sur un processus d'apprentissage syst&eacute;matique, permettant d'identifier ce qui est connu et les lacunes &agrave; combler, de comparer les mesures qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; couronn&eacute;es de succ&egrave;s avec celles qui ont &eacute;chou&eacute; et de comprendre pourquoi.<BR>
<I>Article 29 de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant...l'&eacute;ducation de l'enfant doit viser &agrave; : favoriser l'&eacute;panouissement de la personnalit&eacute; de l'enfant et le d&eacute;veloppement de ses dons et de ses aptitudes mentales et physiques, dans toute la mesure de leurs potentialit&eacute;s; inculquer &agrave; l'enfant le respect des droits de l'homme et des libert&eacute;s fondamentales; inculquer &agrave; l'enfant le respect de ses parents, de son identit&eacute;, de sa langue et de ses valeurs culturelles; pr&eacute;parer l'enfant &agrave; assumer les responsabilit&eacute;s de la vie dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; libre, dans un esprit de compr&eacute;hension, de paix, de tol&eacute;rance, d'&eacute;galit&eacute; entre les sexes et d'amiti&eacute; entre tous les peuples... </I><BR>

<P>Le cadre conceptuel des objectifs d'&eacute;ducation, les populations &agrave; instruire et les principes directeurs de l'action formeront l'assise qui permettra de mettre au point des strat&eacute;gies et des programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; combattre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants. Pour atteindre tous les enfants, aussi bien ceux qui sont en danger que ceux dont les droits sont d&eacute;j&agrave; violemment bafou&eacute;s, il convient d'adopter deux approches globales :<BR>

<P> Un train de mesures dans le cadre des programmes d'&eacute;ducation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale destin&eacute;s &agrave; tous les enfants;<BR>
 Des programmes sp&eacute;cialement cibl&eacute;s destin&eacute;s &agrave; ceux qui sont mal desservis ou que les efforts habituels ne peuvent atteindre.<BR>

<P>L'&eacute;largissement de l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation et de la participation pour tous les enfants, y compris les victimes potentielles ou av&eacute;r&eacute;es d'exploitation sexuelle, et les mesures visant &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la qualit&eacute; et la pertinence de l'&eacute;ducation sont de toute &eacute;vidence les premi&egrave;res &agrave; adopter. Les programmes qui sont sp&eacute;cifiquement con&ccedil;us pour des enfants victimes de situations d'exploitation ne font bien &eacute;videmment pas partie des programmes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux.<BR>

<P>Une collaboration entre les secteurs est &eacute;galement n&eacute;cessaire; il conviendra d'utiliser diverses m&eacute;thodes et mesures p&eacute;dagogiques, allant de la sensibilisation &agrave; la formation, en faisant participer les familles, les enseignants, les dispensateurs de prestations de services sociaux et tous les adultes susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre inclus au processus d'&eacute;ducation. Il conviendra &eacute;galement d'adopter des strat&eacute;gies p&eacute;dagogiques en mati&egrave;re de plaidoyer de mobilisation sociale pour appuyer les mesures destin&eacute;es &agrave; lutter contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants. Ces diff&eacute;rentes strat&eacute;gies sont d&eacute;crites ci-dessous.<BR>

<P><B><I>1. &Eacute;largir l'acc&egrave;s et la participation</I></B><BR>

<P>Les enfants scolaris&eacute;s sont moins expos&eacute;s &agrave; l'exploitation que les enfants qui ne vont pas &agrave; l'&eacute;cole, m&ecirc;me si les &eacute;l&egrave;ves se livrent parfois &agrave; un commerce sexuel pour gagner l'argent n&eacute;cessaire pour payer leurs droits de scolarit&eacute;, leurs manuels et leurs uniformes, ainsi que leur transport. En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, la participation &agrave; un programme d'&eacute;ducation primaire ou secondaire est un bon moyen de prot&eacute;ger les enfants contre l'exploitation et, par cons&eacute;quent, un volet critique de la pr&eacute;vention.<BR>

<P><I>Article 28 de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant...Les &Eacute;tats parties reconnaissent le droit de l'enfant &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation...a) ils rendent l'enseignement primaire obligatoire et gratuit pour tous; b) ils encouragent l'organisation de diff&eacute;rentes formes d'enseignement secondaire, tant g&eacute;n&eacute;ral que professionnel, les rendent ouvertes et accessibles &agrave; tout enfant...</I><BR>
Au moins 130 millions d'enfants n'ont pas acc&egrave;s &agrave; l'&eacute;cole primaire aujourd'hui. Cent millions d'autres enfants ne terminent pas le cycle complet. Dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement, la scolarit&eacute; post-primaire ne fait g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas partie du plan d'&eacute;ducation de base universelle, bien que la majorit&eacute; des enfants qui participent &agrave; des activit&eacute;s sexuelles &agrave; des fins commerciales soient en &acirc;ge de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole secondaire. Selon une estimation de l'UNESCO	UNESCO, Rapport mondial sur l'&eacute;ducation, Paris, 1995., pr&egrave;s de 300 millions d'adolescents qui ont pass&eacute; l'&acirc;ge de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole primaire ne sont pas scolaris&eacute;s. Les deux tiers de ces enfants sont des filles et la grande majorit&eacute; d'entre elles appartiennent &agrave; des couches de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es, notamment des minorit&eacute;s ethniques et culturelles  celles qui sont le plus expos&eacute;es &agrave; l'exploitation sous toutes ses formes.<BR>

<P><I>1.1 &Eacute;liminer les in&eacute;galit&eacute;s entre les sexes</I><BR>

<P><B>Pr&eacute;vention par l'&eacute;ducation pour les filles des r&eacute;gions rurales en &acirc;ge de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole secondaire</B><BR>
Sur la base d'une &eacute;tude qui a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; qu'entre 60 et 70 % des jeunes villageoises de la province de Chiang Rai se livraient &agrave; la prostitution apr&egrave;s avoir quitt&eacute; l'&eacute;cole, le DEP (Daughters' Education Programme) a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; pour &eacute;viter que ces filles soient entra&icirc;n&eacute;es dans l'industrie du sexe. uvrant aupr&egrave;s d'une bonne cinquantaine de tribus des montagnes et de villages des terres basses du nord de la Tha&iuml;lande, le DEP se r&eacute;unit chaque semaine avec des chefs communautaires importants, par exemple des moines et des enseignants, pour faire la liste des familles qui pourraient succomber &agrave; une proposition d'achat de leurs enfants. Ensemble, l'ONG et la famille envisagent d'autres alternatives viables. Parmi les projets du DEP, on peut citer un plan de bourses qui permet aux fillettes d'achever au moins trois ans d'&eacute;tudes secondaires et de quitter le programme dot&eacute;es des connaissances et de la confiance en soi n&eacute;cessaires pour trouver un emploi, mener une vie d'adulte et contribuer &agrave; la vie communautaire. Si besoin est, le programme couvre tous les frais d'inscription, d'uniforme, d'&eacute;quipement, ainsi que les diverses activit&eacute;s et le transport des jeunes filles.<BR>

<P>De plus, le DEP organise des  visites guid&eacute;es , dans les bidonvilles urbains et les quartiers chauds pour que les filles voient de leurs propres yeux ce qui est arriv&eacute; &agrave; tant de leurs camarades qui ont quitt&eacute; leur village. Le DEP a &eacute;galement constitu&eacute; un r&eacute;seau avec 59 autres ONG afin d'offrir une aide sp&eacute;cifique aux familles, allant de l'appui &agrave; l'agriculture aux pr&ecirc;ts, &agrave; la formation professionnelle ou aux secours en tout genre.<BR>
L'in&eacute;galit&eacute; entre les sexes dans le secteur de l'&eacute;ducation en termes tant quantitatifs que qualitatifs est indubitablement li&eacute;e au fait que les filles repr&eacute;sentent la grande majorit&eacute; des enfants qui courent le risque d'&ecirc;tre impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe ou qui y participent. Malgr&eacute; les efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s dans le monde entier pour am&eacute;liorer l'acc&egrave;s des filles &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation, les taux d'abandon scolaire restent &eacute;lev&eacute;s dans de nombreux pays et les filles continuent &agrave; souffrir d'attitudes et de traitements discriminatoires dans les salles de classe. La s&eacute;curit&eacute; des filles et leur protection contre les attentats &agrave; la pudeur &agrave; l'&eacute;cole et sur le chemin de l'&eacute;cole doivent &ecirc;tre renforc&eacute;es dans plusieurs pays. Le grand probl&egrave;me et l'objectif &agrave; atteindre consiste &agrave; offrir aux filles un cadre favorable &agrave; la poursuite et &agrave; la r&eacute;ussite de leurs &eacute;tudes, un cadre qui tienne compte de leurs aspirations pour leur vie future, qui renforce leur confiance en leur potentiel et leur permet d'am&eacute;liorer leurs r&eacute;sultats.<BR>

<P>Un effort de coop&eacute;ration entre les enseignants et les administrateurs du syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation, d'une part, et l'ensemble de la communaut&eacute;, notamment les parents, les administrateurs du secteur public et les dirigeants de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, d'autre part, est indispensable pour lever les barri&egrave;res culturelles, &eacute;conomiques et sociales qui emp&ecirc;chent les filles de participer totalement &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation, tant dans les salles de classe qu'en dehors. &Agrave; cette fin, l'UNICEF a lanc&eacute; une grande initiative en coop&eacute;ration avec des gouvernements, d'autres institutions et des ONG internationales.<BR>

<P>Il reste encore beaucoup &agrave; faire pour s'assurer que les adolescents, et en particulier les filles, soient pr&eacute;sents dans les salles de classe. L'exp&eacute;rience a prouv&eacute; que des approches diversifi&eacute;es et souples, dans le cadre d'un syst&egrave;me global unifi&eacute;, sont indispensables pour atteindre les groupes de population priv&eacute;s d'&eacute;ducation. En particulier, il convient d'offrir des programmes novateurs aux filles et aux autres groupes abandonn&eacute;s &agrave; leur triste sort. Un programme local, dirig&eacute; par le DEP (Daughters' Education Programme soit Programme d'&eacute;ducation pour les filles) au nord de la Tha&iuml;lande est un exemple d'approche int&eacute;gr&eacute;e destin&eacute;e aux filles en &acirc;ge de fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole secondaire, particuli&egrave;rement celles qui appartiennent &agrave; des minorit&eacute;s ethniques.<BR>

<P><B><I>2. Am&eacute;liorer la pertinence et la qualit&eacute; de l'apprentissage</I></B><BR>

<P><B>Participation des enfants dans les salles de classe</B><BR>
Un programme d'&eacute;ducation de base non scolaire ex&eacute;cut&eacute; dans les r&eacute;gions rurales du S&eacute;n&eacute;gal propose un plan d'enseignement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral en langues locales, alliant l'apprentissage de la lecture, de l'&eacute;criture et du calcul &agrave; des connaissances et des comp&eacute;tences fonctionnelles. Financ&eacute; par un partenariat &eacute;tabli entre le Gouvernement, l'UNICEF, l'ACDI et TOSTAN, une ONG locale, le projet se fonde sur l'hypoth&egrave;se selon laquelle un d&eacute;veloppement int&eacute;gr&eacute;, la prise de conscience des probl&egrave;mes, un apprentissage actif et participatif, la connaissance des langues locales et le respect de la culture autochtone sont des ingr&eacute;dients essentiels &agrave; une participation totale &agrave; la vie de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le programme d' &Eacute;ducation pour le d&eacute;veloppement  appliqu&eacute; pa&eacute;s et en d&eacute;veloppement de connaissances qui leur donneront les moyens d'agir et leur permettront d'&ecirc;tre des pr&eacute;curseurs du changement dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; actuelle et &agrave; l'avenir. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la m&eacute;thode participative et ax&eacute;e sur la r&eacute;solution des probl&egrave;mes qui est appliqu&eacute;e, les enfants apprennent &agrave; faire le lien entre les concepts mondiaux et leur propre vie. Ils sont capables de reconna&icirc;tre le pouvoir de perception et de cr&eacute;ation d'images qui tient lieu de v&eacute;rit&eacute; objective en analysant les messages des m&eacute;dias; ils mettent en pratique les m&eacute;thodes de r&eacute;solution des conflits et appliquent la justice sociale, tout en remettant en question leurs propres valeurs et attitudes; gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des jeux interactifs et &agrave; la simulation, ils ressentent l'injustice qu'entra&icirc;ne une distribution in&eacute;quitable des ressources.<BR>

<P>Dans le syst&egrave;me de l'Escuela Nueva, pratiqu&eacute; dans les r&eacute;gions rurales de Colombie, les r&eacute;sultats scolaires des enfants se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce au r&ocirc;le actif jou&eacute; par les &eacute;l&egrave;ves, qui consiste &agrave; faire passer leurs connaissances &agrave; leurs camarades, &agrave; organiser des activit&eacute;s d'apprentissage, &agrave; planifier et &agrave; g&eacute;rer les divers aspects de la vie scolaire en collaboration avec le directeur et les enseignants.<BR>
La D&eacute;claration de Jomtien sur l'&eacute;ducation pour tous et les articles 28 et 29 de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant ont d&eacute;fini l'&eacute;ducation universelle en termes d'inscription aux programmes d'&eacute;ducation, d'acquisition de connaissances de base et de r&eacute;sultats de l'apprentissage, et de pr&eacute;paration &agrave; une vie responsable dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; libre. L'attention accord&eacute;e &agrave; la pr&eacute;paration &agrave; la vie active et &agrave; la connaissance des droits dans le contenu et la m&eacute;thodologie des programmes d'&eacute;ducation est particuli&egrave;rement importante pour la pr&eacute;vention et la lutte contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants. On sait aujourd'hui qu'une bonne pr&eacute;paration &agrave; la vie active  r&eacute;solution des probl&egrave;mes, jugement, n&eacute;gociation, concentration et persistance, foi en ses capacit&eacute;s, confiance en soi et en autrui, identification avec sa propre culture associ&eacute;e au respect de la culture des autres  est essentielle au d&eacute;veloppement et au bien-&ecirc;tre futur de l'enfant.<BR>

<P>Cependant, de nombreux pays qui s'efforcent de permettre &agrave; tous leurs enfants d'acc&eacute;der au syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation consid&egrave;rent comme un luxe de tenter de leur offrir davantage qu'un programme de base. En pratique, cette <I>base</I> se limite souvent &agrave; la m&eacute;morisation d'un certain nombre de faits. Les informations n'ont souvent rien &agrave; voir avec la vie de l'enfant. Il a pourtant &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;montr&eacute; que la mise au point de programmes de pr&eacute;paration &agrave; la vie active et d'apprentissage permettant &agrave; l'enfant de r&eacute;aliser son potentiel ne revenait pas cher lorsque ces objectifs &eacute;taient d&eacute;finis sp&eacute;cifiquement d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part.<BR>

<P>La Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme un outil de plaidoyer en faveur de l'&eacute;largissement des possibilit&eacute;s d'&eacute;ducation pour les enfants, mais sa signification pour le contenu de l'&eacute;ducation et les m&eacute;thodes d'enseignement n'a pas encore re&ccedil;u l'attention qui convenait. L'enseignement des droits fondamentaux, la compr&eacute;hension des principes et de l'esprit de la Convention, la pratique et l'exercice des droits dans les salles de classe et dans le syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation devraient faire partie int&eacute;grante des m&eacute;thodes d'enseignement. Cela signifie qu'il faut se fonder directement sur les dispositions de la Convention pour appliquer des normes de discipline et de non-discrimination dans les &eacute;coles, pour revoir et enrichir les programmes et permettre aux enfants de s'exprimer et de participer pleinement aux activit&eacute;s scolaires.<BR>

<P>
<P><B><I>Qualit&eacute; de l'enseignement</I></B><BR>
<I>Toute personne  enfant, adolescent ou adulte  doit pouvoir b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'une formation con&ccedil;ue pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ses besoins &eacute;ducatifs fondamentaux. Ces besoins concernent aussi bien les outils d'apprentissage essentiels (lecture, &eacute;criture, expression orale, calcul, r&eacute;solution de probl&egrave;mes) que les contenus &eacute;ducatifs fondamentaux (connaissances, aptitudes, valeurs, attitudes) dont l'&ecirc;tre humain a besoin pour survivre, pour d&eacute;velopper toutes ses facult&eacute;s, pour vivre et travailler dans la dignit&eacute;, pour participer pleinement au d&eacute;veloppement, pour am&eacute;liorer la qualit&eacute; de son existence, pour prendre des d&eacute;cisions &eacute;clair&eacute;es et pour continuer &agrave; apprendre. Le champ des besoins &eacute;ducatifs fondamentaux et la mani&egrave;re dont il convient d'y r&eacute;pondre varient selon les pays et les cultures et &eacute;voluent in&eacute;vitablement au fil du temps.</I><BR>

<P>Article 1, D&eacute;claration mondiale sur l'&eacute;ducation <BR>
pour tous<BR>
Sur les 43 pays qui ont soumis des rapports nationaux concernant la mise en uvre de la Convention au Comit&eacute; des droits de l'enfant, 13 ont incorpor&eacute; la Convention &agrave; leurs programmes d'&eacute;ducation ou &agrave; leurs cours. El Salvador, le Portugal et Sri Lanka, par exemple, ont introduit des notions sur les droits de l'enfant dans les programmes d'enseignement primaire et secondaire. En 1991, le Danemark a lanc&eacute; une campagne destin&eacute;e &agrave; faire conna&icirc;tre au grand public les principes de la Convention; des documents sur les droits de l'enfant ont &eacute;t&eacute; distribu&eacute;s &agrave; tous les jeunes de la premi&egrave;re &agrave; la dixi&egrave;me ann&eacute;e d'&eacute;cole. Le Chili a ouvert en 1994 une institution pour la d&eacute;fense des &eacute;coliers, charg&eacute;e d'examiner les plaintes des enfants contre les autorit&eacute;s scolaires	<I>Le progr&egrave;s des nations</I> 1996,  La Convention : mesures d&eacute;j&agrave; prises , p. 40.. Les programmes d'&eacute;ducation qui s'appuient sur une vision progressiste et d&eacute;mocratique de l'&eacute;ducation permettent aux &eacute;l&egrave;ves de participer &agrave; la gestion des salles de classe, &agrave; des activit&eacute;s, de donner leur avis sur le syst&egrave;me de discipline et sur la gestion de l'&eacute;tablissement.<BR>

<P>Si l'am&eacute;lioration de l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation et de la qualit&eacute; de l'enseignement peut avoir un r&ocirc;le pr&eacute;ventif, il faut absolument que les &eacute;coles se dressent plus vigoureusement contre l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales, dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle touche les enfants. Une forte r&eacute;sistance des familles, des enseignants et des administrateurs, dans certaines r&eacute;gions, &agrave; laquelle vient s'ajouter le fait que la majorit&eacute; des enfants menac&eacute;s par l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales ne sont plus d'&acirc;ge &agrave; fr&eacute;quenter l'&eacute;cole primaire, rendent d'autant plus urgentes les actions de sensibilisation dans les &eacute;coles partout o&ugrave; elles peuvent &ecirc;tre entreprises. &Eacute;tant bien ancr&eacute;es dans leur communaut&eacute;, les &eacute;coles peuvent devenir un lieu s&ucirc;r et accueillant dans lequel enfants et familles peuvent explorer des sujets sensibles et souvent tabous tels que la sexualit&eacute;, le VIH/sida, les grossesses non d&eacute;sir&eacute;es chez les adolescentes, les stup&eacute;fiants, tout en inculquant aux gar&ccedil;ons et aux filles le respect de soi et d'autrui et des comp&eacute;tences utiles pour quand ils deviendront parents. La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de mettre rapidement en place des programmes d'&eacute;ducation sexuelle et de sant&eacute; de la reproduction a &eacute;t&eacute; soulign&eacute;e par de nombreuses ONG et par d'autres d&eacute;fenseurs de l'enfance dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement; ils se disent &eacute;galement d&eacute;courag&eacute;s par l'opposition vigoureuse &agrave; leur incorporation dans certains programmes scolaires ou extrascolaires. En Afrique du Sud, o&ugrave; l'&eacute;ducation sexuelle a &eacute;t&eacute; rendue obligatoire par la loi, ce sont souvent les directeurs, les enseignants, les administrateurs et les familles qui font opposition<BR>

<P>Des initiatives entreprises par l'UNICEF en collaboration avec des gouvernements et des ONG ont permis de pr&eacute;parer une s&eacute;rie d'interventions scolaires en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; et de d&eacute;veloppement de la jeunesse. Ces initiatives constituent un effort de sensibilisation de la population aux besoins physiques, psychosociaux et &eacute;conomiques des jeunes, une couche cruciale de la population qui est souvent ignor&eacute;e ou rejet&eacute;e par les adultes chez qui elle suscite la crainte ou un sentiment d'impuissance. En plus de donner aux jeunes des informations et des comp&eacute;tences sp&eacute;cifiques en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute;, ces programmes essaient aussi de les aider &agrave; comprendre les r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de la sexualit&eacute;, notamment les plaisirs, les dangers et les responsabilit&eacute;s qui lui sont associ&eacute;s, &agrave; apprendre &agrave; faire face &agrave; leurs besoins &eacute;motionnels et &agrave; r&eacute;agir aux pressions contradictoires de leurs camarades et de leurs familles	<BR>

<P>Dans de nombreux pays, la crise du VIH/sida a &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; l'origine d'une pl&eacute;thore de programmes scolaires, non acad&eacute;miques, qui pourraient &ecirc;tre directement appliqu&eacute;s &agrave; la question de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales ou qui pourraient servir de mod&egrave;les pour traiter ce probl&egrave;me. On peut notamment citer les clubs de sant&eacute; scolaires, les programmes d'&eacute;ducation sanitaire et familiale, la pr&eacute;paration &agrave; une vie active.<BR>

<P><B>Un programme extrascolaire qui s'attaque &agrave; des probl&egrave;mes sensibles</B><BR>
SHAPE (Swaziland HIV/AIDS Population Education) est une nouvelle ONG, financ&eacute;e par l'OMS et CARE International, et appuy&eacute;e par le minist&egrave;re de la Sant&eacute;, qui a pour vocation de lutter contre la propagation alarmante du VIH/sida et un nombre de grossesses chez les adolescentes sur lequel on ne peut plus fermer les yeux. La cr&eacute;ation de clubs  anti-sida  dans 26 &eacute;coles de l'axe Manvini-Mbabame (les deux principales villes du Swaziland) a ouvert la porte &agrave; un large d&eacute;bat sur plusieurs questions sensibles li&eacute;es &agrave; la sexualit&eacute;, notamment la pr&eacute;paration &agrave; la vie active  &agrave; savoir la n&eacute;gociation et la confiance en soi pour les filles, les attitudes des adolescents par rapport &agrave; la sexualit&eacute;, la compr&eacute;hension de la diff&eacute;rence entre une relation s&eacute;rieuse et monogame et la promiscuit&eacute;, et la capacit&eacute; de juger des circonstances et des options possibles lorsqu'il s'agit de choisir, par exemple, entre l'utilisation du pr&eacute;servatif ou l'abstinence. Un aspect important du processus d'&eacute;ducation, qui n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; sans difficult&eacute;, a consist&eacute; &agrave; gagner l'appui des enseignants.<BR>

<P><B>Apprendre le respect de soi</B><BR>
Krousar Thmey (nouvelle famille) est une ONG cambodgienne qui dirige trois centres de protection de l'enfance. Leur objectif est d'inculquer un sentiment d'amour-propre aux enfants en leur apprenant &agrave; respecter leur culture. Les enfants cr&eacute;ent et pr&eacute;sentent des danses et des pi&egrave;ces de th&eacute;&acirc;tre autochtones lors de manifestations locales et nationales. L'int&eacute;gration communautaire est la pierre angulaire de la philosophie et des pratiques de cette ONG dont certains membres sont d'anciennes prostitu&eacute;es, qui ne sont jamais livr&eacute;es &agrave; elles-m&ecirc;mes ou identifi&eacute;es en public. Les portes restent ouvertes pour encourager l'&eacute;tablissement de relations naturelles entre les enfants du centre et ceux de la communaut&eacute;. Dans la mesure du possible, l'ONG coop&egrave;re avec les familles dont les enfants ont &eacute;t&eacute; impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe, pour essayer d'&eacute;liminer les traumatismes et de surmonter les r&eacute;actions de rejet, et pour favoriser la r&eacute;insertion des jeunes.<BR>
<B><I>4. Programmes ciblant les enfants non scolaris&eacute;s, y compris ceux qui sont engag&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe</I></B><BR>

<P>Parmi les enfants qui travaillent et/ou vivent dans les rues, beaucoup sont exploit&eacute;s sur le plan sexuel et n'ont de toute &eacute;vidence pas la possibilit&eacute; de suivre un programme scolaire r&eacute;gulier. Ces enfants ont parfois abandonn&eacute; l'&eacute;cole ou ils n'y ont jamais &eacute;t&eacute; inscrits. Leur &acirc;ge et leurs conditions de vie font qu'il leur sera tr&egrave;s difficile de suivre les m&ecirc;mes cours que les autres enfants, et les programmes ne r&eacute;pondront probablement pas &agrave; leurs besoins particuliers sur les plans social, culturel, &eacute;motionnel et p&eacute;dagogique.<BR>

<P>Les enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe sont souvent contraints et ils ne peuvent s'en sortir sans un appui juridique, psychologique et social. Certains enfants, qui ne sont pas soumis &agrave; une contrainte physique mais ne voient pas d'autres options dans la vie, ont &eacute;galement besoin de beaucoup d'aide et d'encouragement pour trouver d'autres solutions et lutter pour les atteindre. Ceux qui ont quitt&eacute; le commerce du sexe de leur propre chef ou avec l'aide de services sociaux, d'organisations non gouvernementales, d'amis ou de parents, continuent &agrave; avoir besoin d'appui, d'empathie et d'aide pour se r&eacute;ins&eacute;rer dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et trouver une nouvelle signification et un nouveau but &agrave; leur vie.<BR>

<P>Les programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; ces enfants et con&ccedil;us sp&eacute;cialement pour eux ne doivent pas se limiter &agrave; &ecirc;tre simplement  &eacute;ducatifs  dans le sens traditionnel du terme. Parce qu'ils se sont retrouv&eacute;s pi&eacute;g&eacute;s dans une situation illicite et sous l'emprise du vice, ces enfants ont perdu l'appui familial et communautaire qu'ils seraient en droit d'esp&eacute;rer. Pour les aider, il faut r&eacute;&eacute;difier le syst&egrave;me d'aide sociale. C'est pourquoi les programmes d'&eacute;ducation doivent associer les rudiments essentiels de l'&eacute;ducation de base conventionnelle, tels que l'apprentissage de la lecture, de l'&eacute;criture et de l'arithm&eacute;tique, &agrave; d'autres formes d'aide sociale, telles que les conseils psychologiques pour les aider &agrave; retrouver le sentiment de leur valeur personnelle, l'aide au logement, des services de sant&eacute; et de maternit&eacute;, des soins pour les enfants, des conseils et une protection juridiques. Ces programmes doivent &eacute;galement s'accompagner d'une formation et d'un appui professionnels.<BR>

<P>Des ONG et d'autres organisations b&eacute;n&eacute;voles, de plus en plus pr&eacute;occup&eacute;es par la vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; et l'exploitation des enfants, ont lanc&eacute; des programmes dans plusieurs r&eacute;gions du monde. Tous ces programmes fournissent des informations pr&eacute;cieuses sur les strat&eacute;gies qui peuvent aider les enfants victimes d'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales. Leurs caract&eacute;ristiques sont les suivantes :<BR>

<P> Ils poursuivent plusieurs objectifs et sont multidisciplinaires, combinant l'&eacute;ducation traditionnelle avec les services d'appui pertinents;<BR>

<P><B>Acqu&eacute;rir des connaissances professionnelles utiles</B><BR>
Les chercheurs et les r&eacute;alisateurs de programmes soulignent les dangers d'une formation professionnelle traditionnelle dispens&eacute;e sans avoir pr&eacute;alablement test&eacute; ou analys&eacute; le march&eacute; pour savoir s'il existe r&eacute;ellement une demande ou un d&eacute;sir pour un produit ou un service. Une &eacute;tude a soulign&eacute; que dans les programmes destin&eacute;s aux enfants des rues, ceux ax&eacute;s sur les filles leur apprenaient g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement &agrave; &ecirc;tre dociles et &agrave; travailler dans des secteurs traditionnels, tels que la couture, la cuisine, la coiffure et les travaux domestiques, alors qu'au contraire, les programmes ciblant les gar&ccedil;ons leur apprenaient &agrave; &ecirc;tre ind&eacute;pendants et &agrave; remettre en question la soci&eacute;t&eacute; qui les avait marginalis&eacute;s. Rares sont apparemment les programmes ciblant les filles qui abordent leurs probl&egrave;mes d'un point de vue f&eacute;ministe et leur enseignent l'ind&eacute;pendance, tout en remettant en question les st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes li&eacute;s au sexe.<BR>

<P><B>Traiter de probl&egrave;mes sensibles</B><BR>
L'UCJF du Botswana ex&eacute;cute un programme pour les adolescentes enceintes qui ne sont pas autoris&eacute;es &agrave; poursuivre leur scolarit&eacute;. Le Centre d'&eacute;ducation pour les adolescentes pr&eacute;pare ces jeunes m&egrave;res &agrave; leurs examens, leur offre des cours particuliers dans toutes les mati&egrave;res, des consultations individuelles et de groupe avec la participation de leur famille, et si possible du p&egrave;re, et une formation professionnelle appropri&eacute;e avec placement apr&egrave;s l'obtention du dipl&ocirc;me.<BR>
 Ils sont lanc&eacute;s et g&eacute;r&eacute;s par des organisations non gouvernementales, parfois des organisations confessionnelles et communautaires dont l'approche souple, originale et intelligente peut pr&ecirc;ter un avantage comparatif aux secteurs b&eacute;n&eacute;voles;<BR>

<P> Ils sont appliqu&eacute;s &agrave; petite &eacute;chelle, con&ccedil;us pour r&eacute;pondre aux besoins de groupes sp&eacute;cifiques dans des conditions particuli&egrave;res, bien qu'ayant en commun certains principes et approches;<BR>

<P> Leur enseignement porte sur des probl&egrave;mes pratiques et &agrave; traiter de toute urgence, tels que la sexualit&eacute;, la grossesse chez les adolescentes, la drogue, la violence, la mani&egrave;re de r&eacute;agir aux pressions exerc&eacute;es par les camarades, la famille et la soci&eacute;t&eacute;;<BR>

<P> Ils tiennent compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de la vie; tout programme d'&eacute;ducation doit conna&icirc;tre les dures r&eacute;alit&eacute;s et les <BR>

<P>exp&eacute;riences douloureuses v&eacute;cues par ces enfants; les conseils pratiques utiles dans la vie quotidienne sont plus importants que l'accumulation de connaissances;<BR>

<P> Ils offrent une formation professionnelle et des possibilit&eacute;s d'emploi; la pauvret&eacute; et l'absence d'ouverture &eacute;conomique pour ces enfants et leur famille, qui sont &agrave; l'origine de leur vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; et de l'exploitation dont ils sont victimes, sont les premiers facteurs &agrave; prendre en compte en leur offrant de nouvelles options;<BR>

<P> Ils s'efforcent de coop&eacute;rer avec les familles et de les aider &agrave; am&eacute;liorer leur situation, ce dont les enfants b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront; un s&eacute;minaire tenu en Am&eacute;rique latine en 1994 est arriv&eacute; &agrave; la conclusion qu'il fallait coop&eacute;rer avec les familles, en particulier avec les m&egrave;res, ainsi qu'avec les filles qui travaillaient, ou qui avaient travaill&eacute;, dans l'industrie du sexe	<BR>

Un dispensaire pour adolescents, financ&eacute; par l'ONG internationale ChildHope et l'Universit&eacute; d'&Eacute;tat de Rio, uvre en faveur des jeunes non scolaris&eacute;s des<I> favelas</I> br&eacute;siliennes. Les &eacute;ducateurs ont d&eacute;couvert que la pr&eacute;vention directe du VIH/sida &eacute;tait un aspect de la formation qui laissait &agrave; d&eacute;sirer. Le volet du programme qui encourage le respect de soi chez les jeunes femmes et qui inculque aux jeunes hommes qu'ils n'ont aucun droit sur une femme ou sur son corps est plus efficace.<BR>

<P><B>Capacit&eacute; d'adaptation et atouts</B><BR>
Les jeunes citadines qui travaillent pour l'organisation Casa de Passagem, une ONG bas&eacute;e &agrave; Recife, au Br&eacute;sil, sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e dans la pr&eacute;vention contre le VIH/sida, se sont heurt&eacute;es au sentiment d'impuissance et au fatalisme des filles concernant la possibilit&eacute; de se prot&eacute;ger contre la maladie en s'appuyant sur leur capacit&eacute; de survie et sur des m&eacute;thodes connues. En montrant &agrave; ces filles des diapositives repr&eacute;sentant de l'eau contamin&eacute;e pour leur prouver que les virus, m&ecirc;me s'ils &eacute;taient invisibles, existaient bel et bien, le personnel les a persuad&eacute;es que si elles arrivaient &agrave; &eacute;viter les ennuis en &eacute;chappant &agrave; la police, elles &eacute;taient &eacute;galement capables de se prot&eacute;ger contre un minuscule virus.<BR>

<P><B>R&eacute;apprendre &agrave; respecter son corps</B><BR>
Casa de Passagem a &eacute;galement recours &agrave; la danse et au th&eacute;&acirc;tre pour aider les jeunes femmes &agrave; &eacute;tablir des liens positifs avec leur corps. Malgr&eacute; leur grande exp&eacute;rience sur le plan sexuel, de nombreuses adolescentes qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; exploit&eacute;es n'ont aucune connaissance de base sur leur propre corps et ne font pas grand chose pour se prot&eacute;ger. D'autres programmes encouragent les filles &agrave; dessiner leur corps ou &agrave; utiliser des miroirs pour encourager l'introspection et le respect de soi.<BR>
<B><I>5. &Eacute;ducation pour adultes responsables d'enfants</I></B><BR>

<P>Les adultes dont le r&ocirc;le est d'&eacute;lever, de prot&eacute;ger et de faire en sorte que les enfants se d&eacute;veloppent sainement ont une responsabilit&eacute; particuli&egrave;re car ils dispensent un enseignement direct et servent de mod&egrave;les aux enfants, que ce soit au foyer, &agrave; l'&eacute;cole ou dans le monde en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, en particulier dans les postes de police et les tribunaux o&ugrave; &eacute;chouent tant d'enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe. Pour que les adultes acceptent d'assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s envers l'enfant qui s'&eacute;veille, pour qu'ils deviennent des partenaires actifs et des agents du changement social, il faut tout d'abord qu'ils comprennent les dangers que repr&eacute;sente l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales pour les enfants et la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, et qu'ils prennent conscience du fait que leurs attitudes et leurs comportements contribuent &agrave; la situation.<BR>

<P><B>Aider les familles, aider les enfants   </B><BR>
En 1992, l'Association Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud (AFXB), une ONG bas&eacute;e en Suisse, a lanc&eacute; un programme de suivi pour 95 adolescentes lib&eacute;r&eacute;es des maisons de prostitution tha&iuml;landaises et rapatri&eacute;es au Myanmar. Au d&eacute;part, le programme portait sur des activit&eacute;s de formation professionnelle et d'&eacute;ducation fond&eacute;es sur les r&ecirc;ves, les capacit&eacute;s et la sant&eacute; de ces adolescentes, tout en tenant compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de la vie. Il a aujourd'hui &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;largi aux membres de leur famille, dans le cadre d'un programme de r&eacute;insertion qui englobe leurs fr&egrave;res et surs, cousins et autres membres de la famille, soit en tout 150 personnes participant &agrave; un programme de formation de trois ans leur permettant d'acqu&eacute;rir des comp&eacute;tences pour cr&eacute;er de petites entreprises dans les communaut&eacute;s locales ou pour rentabiliser celles qui existent d&eacute;j&agrave;.<BR>
<I>5.1 Les familles</I> <BR>

<P>Les efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;ducation doivent avoir pour but d'aider les familles &agrave; comprendre le lien entre les responsabilit&eacute;s et les valeurs &eacute;conomiques, les cons&eacute;quences de leurs comportements sur les enfants, et &agrave; am&eacute;liorer leurs conditions de vie. Pour ce faire, les familles doivent avoir acc&egrave;s au cr&eacute;dit, &agrave; d'autres moyens de gagner de l'argent et aux comp&eacute;tences et connaissances qui leur premettront de tirer parti des possibilit&eacute;s qui se pr&eacute;sentent pour se prot&eacute;ger et en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier, tant pout eux-m&ecirc;mes que pour leurs enfants.<BR>

<P><I>5.2 Les enseignants</I><BR>

<P><B>Donner des moyens aux enseignants pour qu'ils puissent aider les enfants   </B><BR>
En Inde, l'un des volets de la grande initiative nationale d'&eacute;ducation primaire universelle , le projet de responsabilisation des enseignants, donne aux ma&icirc;tres d'&eacute;cole le pouvoir de prendre des d&eacute;cisions et de faire preuve de cr&eacute;ativit&eacute; dans leur enseignement en les encourageant &agrave; participer &agrave; la conception et &agrave; l'organisation de leurs s&eacute;minaires de formation. L'attention vigoureuse accord&eacute;e &agrave; la participation des enseignants leur redonne confiance en leurs capacit&eacute;s et r&eacute;hausse leur statut aux yeux de la communaut&eacute;. De la p&eacute;riph&eacute;rie, ils passent au centre m&ecirc;me du processus d'&eacute;ducation. Ces &eacute;coles sont favorables &agrave; l'&eacute;veil de l'enfant, car les enseignants utilisent une p&eacute;dagogie participative ax&eacute;e sur l'&eacute;l&egrave;ve; les enfants font de la danse et chantent, cr&eacute;ent des objets et aident &agrave; d&eacute;corer et &agrave; entretenir les salles de classe. Au lieu d'accuser les enseignants d'incomp&eacute;tence et de manquer de motivation, la communaut&eacute;, les parents et les sup&eacute;rieurs hi&eacute;rarchiques des ma&icirc;tres d'&eacute;cole leur accordent aujourd'hui leur soutien.<BR>
 Les enseignants ont souvent beaucoup d'influence sur les enfants. Mais en m&ecirc;me temps, ils peuvent &ecirc;tre le miroir d'attitudes et de comportements sociaux inconsid&eacute;r&eacute;s, et m&ecirc;me les plus d&eacute;vou&eacute;s et les plus r&eacute;solus se sentent souvent impuissants dans un syst&egrave;me qui les tient en pi&egrave;tre estime. Car la plupart d'entre eux sont soumis &agrave; un stress &eacute;norme, ils sont mal pay&eacute;s, sans appui, et ils ne jouissent pas eux-m&ecirc;mes du respect et de la compr&eacute;hension dont ils sont cens&eacute;s faire preuve &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des enfants. M&ecirc;me lorsque des r&eacute;formes ont &eacute;t&eacute; appliqu&eacute;es au syst&egrave;me d'&eacute;ducation, la formation des enseignants a &eacute;t&eacute; largement n&eacute;glig&eacute;e et seul un faible pourcentage des ressources financi&egrave;res a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute; aux cours pour futurs enseignants <BR>
ou &agrave; la formation en cours d'emploi	<BR>
Ce paragraphe et l'encadr&eacute; suivant sont tir&eacute;s de : Stacki, S., Pigozzi M.,  Empowering Female Teachers as an 		Interactive Dialectic Process: Examples from South Asia , <I>Convergence</I> , Vol. XXVIII, No 3, 1995.. <BR>
Des recherches effectu&eacute;es par la Banque mondiale sur les programmes de r&eacute;forme qui avaient &eacute;t&eacute; couronn&eacute;s de succ&egrave;s ont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; qu'une telle formation &eacute;tait l'une des trois interventions les plus importantes.<BR>

<P><I>5.3 Les dispensateurs de services</I><BR>

<P>Il semblerait que les dispensaires se montrent r&eacute;ticents &agrave; desservir les enfants des rues, bien que cette r&eacute;sistance soit, semble-t-il surtout le fait du personnel auxiliaire et des infirmi&egrave;res	 <BR>
 Lessons Learned.. ., S&eacute;minaire r&eacute;gional organis&eacute; en Am&eacute;rique latine, ibid.. <BR>
De plus, de nombreux assistants sociaux, ONG et autres qui offrent des services &agrave; des enfants en situation difficile, estiment que leur efficacit&eacute; est limit&eacute;e par leurs propres frustrations, par leurs jugements et leur impuissance face aux comportements et aux attitudes difficiles et &agrave; la r&eacute;sistance des filles des rues, en particulier celles qui se livrent ou se sont livr&eacute;es &agrave; la prostitution. Ils essaient parfois de  r&eacute;former  des jeunes, hommes et femmes, impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe ou de les obliger &agrave;  revenir sur le droit chemin  sans les &eacute;couter, les comprendre ou les aider &agrave; am&eacute;liorer leurs comp&eacute;tences professionnelles et sans leur donner les aptitudes n&eacute;cessaires pour pouvoir d&eacute;cider s'il y a lieu ou non de modifier leurs comportements. Par cons&eacute;quent, beaucoup de services de la jeunesse tournent au ralenti parce que leurs employ&eacute;s portent un jugement n&eacute;gatif sur leurs clients, en particulier les pr&eacute;pos&eacute;s aux services de sant&eacute; de la reproduction	<BR>
Sexual and Reproductive Health Promotion, Rapport de la r&eacute;union finale du Groupe d'appui technique, UNICEF, 		12-15 juin 1995, Lusaka, Zambie.<BR>
. <BR>

<P>Ces cadres doivent &ecirc;tre des pr&eacute;curseurs en mati&egrave;re d'attitudes &eacute;clair&eacute;es, amicales et tol&eacute;rantes et ils doivent prendre la t&ecirc;te de la mobilisation sociale et des activit&eacute;s de sensibilisation; il est donc essentiel qu'ils montrent l'exemple par leur comportement, et qu'ils deviennent les champions des droits de l'enfant.<BR>

<P>Les ateliers de formation destin&eacute;s &agrave; sensibiliser les dispensateurs de services sur leurs propres attitudes peuvent d&eacute;boucher sur la mise en place de services d'&eacute;ducation ouverts et accessibles, capables d'aller &agrave; la rencontre des groupes de jeunes difficiles &agrave; atteindre et a priori r&eacute;ticents. Les organismes dont les programmes sont ax&eacute;s sur des activit&eacute;s r&eacute;mun&eacute;ratrices et sur la formation professionnelle doivent se doter d'un personnel suffisamment comp&eacute;tent pour juger de la pertinence et du bien-fond&eacute; des cours qu'ils offrent.<BR>

<P><I>5.4 Les forces de l'ordre</I> <BR>

<P>La complicit&eacute; de la police et d'autres fonctionnaires appartenent au syst&egrave;me judiciaire &agrave; qui incombe la responsabilit&eacute; particuli&egrave;re de promulguer et d'appliquer les lois qui prot&egrave;gent les enfants et garantissent le respect de leurs droits est particuli&egrave;rement pr&eacute;occupante. Les officiers de police et le personnel judiciaire, des juges aux avocats, doivent apprendre que traiter des enfants comme des coupables et/ou comme des adultes constitue non seulement une violation de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant et de certaines juridictions nationales, mais est &eacute;galement contreproductif. <BR>

<P>Ils ont besoin des comp&eacute;tences et des outils dont dispose le personnel form&eacute; &agrave; cet effet pour rendre plus accueillants et plus hospitaliers les postes de police, les salles d'audience ou encore les bureaux frontaliers o&ugrave; sont retenus, dans l'isolement et la peur au ventre, les enfants qui font l'objet d'un trafic. La police pourrait (et devrait) jouer un r&ocirc;le de pivot en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;ducation, de pr&eacute;vention, de protection et de r&eacute;insertion. En tant que mod&egrave;le, les policiers peuvent &eacute;galement aider ces enfants &agrave; conna&icirc;tre leurs droits et &agrave; trouver le moyen d'&eacute;chapper &agrave; la prostitution. Dans certains pays, par exemple au P&eacute;rou, les ONG et d'autres organismes pr&eacute;parent des programmes de formation sur les droits de l'enfant pour les officiers de police; au N&eacute;pal, les unit&eacute;s de police travaillent en tandem avec l'ONG Maiti, l'UNESCO et l'UNICEF dans le cadre d'un programme multidimensionnel qui offre un enseignement et un appui aux familles pour les dissuader de vendre leurs enfants &agrave; des trafiquants.<BR>

<P><B><I>6. &Eacute;ducation du public et mobilisation sociale</I></B><BR>

<P>Tous les secteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; sont responsables dans une certaine mesure de l'existence et de la poursuite de l'exploitation d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. En plus des groupes d&eacute;j&agrave; mentionn&eacute;s dans les paragraphes pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents, on peut &eacute;galement citer les chefs spirituels et communautaires qui consid&egrave;rent parfois les adolescents comme des &ecirc;tres immoraux ou incontr&ocirc;lables, le personnel des agences de voyage et de tourisme qui ne pensent pas aux ramifications tragiques des activit&eacute;s sexuelles avec des enfants, les d&eacute;cideurs et les l&eacute;gislateurs qui estiment que leurs responsabilit&eacute;s se limitent &agrave; prendre des d&eacute;cisions de justice et &agrave; passer des lois; le public qui consid&egrave;re que ce probl&egrave;me n'est pas le sien.<BR>

<P><B>Recours aux m&eacute;dias pour persuader les d&eacute;cideurs  </B><BR>
Les travaux de l'Association de planification familiale du Ghana dans sa campagne contre le sida ont &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;rieusement entrav&eacute;s par l'interdiction du Gouvernement de faire de la publicit&eacute; ou m&ecirc;me simplement de parler des pr&eacute;servatifs dans les m&eacute;dias. L'ONG a lanc&eacute; une campagne visant &agrave; persuader le Gouvernement de changer de politique en d&eacute;montrant que le VIH/sida constituait une menace grave pour le pays, qu'il n'existait ni cure ni vaccin contre la maladie, et que la promotion de la sant&eacute; &eacute;tait l'unique moyen de ralentir sa propagation. <I>L'Association de planification familiale voulait d&eacute;montrer que faire de la publicit&eacute; dans les m&eacute;dias faisait progresser la vente de pr&eacute;servatifs, et que cette interdiction faisait croire aux gens qu'ils n'&eacute;taient pas sans danger.</I><BR>

<P>L'Association a produit une vid&eacute;o comportant une interview d'une jeune Ghan&eacute;enne atteinte du sida. Un fonctionnaire de haut niveau, qui &eacute;tait favorable &agrave; cette campagne, a fait en sorte que la vid&eacute;o soit projet&eacute;e lors d'une r&eacute;union de cabinet et au chef de l'&Eacute;tat. Peu apr&egrave;s, le Gouvernement a publi&eacute; une d&eacute;claration en faveur de la campagne, lui allouant des fonds sp&eacute;ciaux et demandant &agrave; l'ensemble de la population d'y participer.<BR>
Partout dans le monde, l'&eacute;ducation du public, surtout par les m&eacute;dias, s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e tr&egrave;s efficace dans plusieurs secteurs de l'action sociale   planification familiale, campagnes anti-tabac, utilisation de pr&eacute;servatifs, num&eacute;ros verts pour les femmes battues, campagnes en faveur de l'allaitement maternel. Elle peut &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;ventive et contribuer au processus de r&eacute;&eacute;ducation et de r&eacute;insertion des enfants expos&eacute;s aux dangers de l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales. Le succ&egrave;s de l'&eacute;ducation en tant que facteur de mobilisation sociale repose sur l'&eacute;tablissement du plus grand nombre possible de partenariats avec les m&eacute;dias afin de faire conna&icirc;tre l'&eacute;tendue du probl&egrave;me et ses cons&eacute;quences et de faire passer des messages au public  par exemple sous forme de programme de  divertissement  t&eacute;l&eacute;vis&eacute; pr&eacute;sentant l'histoire d'une jeune fille vendue &agrave; l'industrie du sexe et son sauvetage; de messages radiophoniques ou imprim&eacute;s mettant en garde contre les m&eacute;thodes utilis&eacute;es par les trafiquants dans les villages; d'articles dans des revues touristiques ou celles des compagnies a&eacute;riennes; de brochures d'information ou de d&eacute;pliants entrepos&eacute;s dans les halls et les chambres d'h&ocirc;tels mettant en garde contre l'ill&eacute;galit&eacute; des relations sexuelles avec les enfants.<BR>

<P>L'&eacute;ducation &agrave; des fins de mobilisation sociale doit se fonder sur une analyse  Qui voulons-nous sensibiliser ? Comment atteindre ces groupes ? Quel message d&eacute;sirons-nous faire passer? Quel est le meilleur moyen d'atteindre ce public ? Elle doit tenir compte de la relation entre la capacit&eacute; de communication et la r&eacute;ceptivit&eacute; du milieu social.<BR>

<P><B>&Eacute;ducation &agrave; des fins de mobilisation sociale  </B><BR>

<P><B>Qui faut-il cibler ?</B><BR>
 Les d&eacute;cideurs, les l&eacute;gislateurs, les parlementaires, les touristes, les hommes d'affaires en d&eacute;placement, les agences de voyages, le personnel h&ocirc;telier et des compagnies d'aviation, la police, les chefs spirituels et communautaires, les enseignants, les cadres, les dispensateurs de services et les enfants.<BR>

<P><B>Quelles sont les attitudes sociales &agrave; modifier ?  </B><BR>
 Le fait que les enfants, en particulier les filles, soient consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des biens &eacute;conomiques;<BR>
 Le fait que les enfants soient tenus pour responsables de leurs conditions de vie;<BR>
 La notion selon laquelle une activit&eacute; sexuelle avec une tr&egrave;s jeune fille permet de gu&eacute;rir ou d'&eacute;viter le sida, constitue une cure de jouvence pour les personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es, procure la richesse, etc.;<BR>
 L'indiff&eacute;rence, l'ignorance et/ou la n&eacute;gation du probl&egrave;me et de ses cons&eacute;quences;<BR>
 La honte ou la peur de la sexualit&eacute; des adolescents;<BR>
 La frustration ou le d&eacute;go&ucirc;t face au comportement  irresponsable ,  incontr&ocirc;lable  et &agrave; la<BR>

<P><B>Quels sont les comportements et actions d&eacute;sirables ?    </B><BR>
 La cr&eacute;ation d'un milieu social et de services d'appui tels que num&eacute;ros de t&eacute;l&eacute;phone vert, centres de secours et de conseils;<BR>

<H4><B>V.	Des strat&eacute;gies &agrave; l'action : les &eacute;tapes suivantes</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>1. Action au niveau national</I></B><BR>

<P>Les strat&eacute;gies d&eacute;crites dans ce document doivent &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute;es &agrave; chaque situation nationale particuli&egrave;re. Les priorit&eacute;s, les objectifs et les activit&eacute;s varieront selon l'envergure du probl&egrave;me au plan national. L'&eacute;valuation des besoins et de l'importance du probl&egrave;me doit se fonder sur <BR>

<P>une analyse de la situation, effectu&eacute;e de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence en collaboration	<BR>
Un document publi&eacute; r&eacute;cemment par l'UNICEF sur les politiques et les strat&eacute;gies relatives &agrave; la protection de l'enfance 		<BR>
a pr&eacute;conis&eacute; l'adoption d'une approche &agrave; deux volets compl&eacute;mentaires, &agrave; savoir des activit&eacute;s g&eacute;n&eacute;rales et des activit&eacute;s 		<BR>
cibl&eacute;es. La r&eacute;ussite de cette strat&eacute;gie repose sur l'&eacute;tablissement de partenariats afin d'am&eacute;liorer la pertinence et la 		<BR>
qualit&eacute; de l'&eacute;ducation dispens&eacute;e aux enfants les plus vuln&eacute;rables et les plus d&eacute;savantag&eacute;s, tout en combinant 			l'enseignement avec d'autres services sociaux essentiels.<BR>

<P>  avec les principaux acteurs nationaux responsables des questions relatives au bien-&ecirc;tre de l'enfant. Les autres mesures essentielles sont les suivantes :<BR>

<P><I>1.1 &Eacute;tablir des partenariats.</I> Ni les ONG, qui sont souvent des pr&eacute;curseurs en mati&egrave;re de lutte contre l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales, ni les gouvernements ne peuvent &agrave; eux seuls r&eacute;gler ces probl&egrave;mes. Un partenariat doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;tabli &agrave; diff&eacute;rents niveaux entre les autorit&eacute;s du secteur public, les ONG nationales et internationales, les institutions de recherche et de formation, les groupements communautaires, les m&eacute;dias, le monde des affaires et les donateurs ext&eacute;rieurs, afin qu'ils puissent conjuguer leurs efforts de pr&eacute;vention et leurs mesures correctives.<BR>

<P><I>1.2 Cr&eacute;er un r&eacute;seau d'organisations non gouvernementales.</I> Les ONG et les organisations communautaires, qui sont souvent tr&egrave;s petites, sont les chefs de file de l'aide aux enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe ou expos&eacute;s &agrave; ce danger. Ces organisations sont souvent fond&eacute;es par des gens d&eacute;vou&eacute;s qui re&ccedil;oivent au d&eacute;part l'appui d'organismes caritatifs religieux ou sociaux. Les efforts communs auront davantage d'impact et seront plus durables que les efforts individuels; les coalitions doivent &ecirc;tre appuy&eacute;es et consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme un facteur permanent et essentiel de tout programme national destin&eacute; &agrave; lutter contre ce probl&egrave;me. &Agrave; cette fin, il est indispensable que les ONG travaillent de concert pour regrouper leurs comp&eacute;tences, renforcer leurs capacit&eacute;s et surtout pour nouer des relations avec les autorit&eacute;s gouvernementales et municipales.<BR>

<P><I>1.3 &Ecirc;tre &agrave; l'&eacute;coute des enfants.</I> En dehors du droit g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des enfants de participer aux d&eacute;cisions qui les concernent, les programmes auront davantage de chance d'&ecirc;tre couronn&eacute;s de succ&egrave;s si les enfants et les jeunes peuvent exprimer leurs points de vue et leurs pr&eacute;occupations sur la difficult&eacute; de leur situation. Pour ce faire, il faudrait encourager les activit&eacute;s culturelles telles que th&eacute;&acirc;tre, festivals de la chanson et expositions organis&eacute;s par des groupements et des institutions de la jeunesse. Tous les programmes et les initiatives du type  Maires, d&eacute;fenseurs des enfants , doivent permettre aux enfants et aux jeunes de d&eacute;fendre leur cause.<BR>

<P><I>1.4 Recherche.</I> La recherche et la mise au point d'outils de recherche devraient &ecirc;tre un &eacute;l&eacute;ment essentiel de l'action destin&eacute;e &agrave; prot&eacute;ger les enfants vuln&eacute;rables et ceux qui sont exploit&eacute;s. Nous ne disposons pas de suffisamment d'informations sur l'&eacute;tendue et la nature du probl&egrave;me dans des cadres sociaux, culturels, &eacute;conomiques et politiques diff&eacute;rents. On ne comprend pas toujours certains enfants se retrouvent sur une pente glissante et passent d'une situation &agrave; risque &agrave; une situation d'exploitation. Les instituts de recherche, les bureaux de statistiques et les ONG sont des partenaires importants pour entreprendre une recherche participative et ax&eacute;e sur l'action, qui permettra de combler les lacunes en mati&egrave;re de connaissances, d'&eacute;laborer des programmes efficaces et de proc&eacute;der &agrave; leur &eacute;valuation.<BR>

<P><B><I>2. Activit&eacute;s de plaidoyer au niveau mondial</I></B><BR>

<P>Il est ind&eacute;niable que dans un contexte de d&eacute;fense chauviniste et de n&eacute;gation du probl&egrave;me douloureux que constituent les enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans des activit&eacute;s sexuelles &agrave; des fins commerciales, le fait d'avoir expos&eacute; et d&eacute;battu de la question au plan international et d'avoir entrepris des activit&eacute;s de sensibilisation a contribu&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;vision des politiques publiques et a entra&icirc;n&eacute; des changements d'attitudes. Les efforts qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s aux niveaux r&eacute;gional et international doivent &ecirc;tre poursuivis, en particulier le remaniement des syst&egrave;mes d'enseignement scolaire et la mise au point de programmes novateurs ciblant des groupes pr&eacute;cis. Cependant, les activit&eacute;s de plaidoyer doivent veiller &agrave; ne pas offenser les enfants dans la course au scoop et en faisant une publicit&eacute; tapageuse autour de leur cas. Les messages lanc&eacute;s sans r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir et qui &eacute;tablissent un lien entre la violence et l'exploitation et des groupes culturels ou ethniques particuliers peuvent contribuer &agrave; renforcer les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s &agrave; l'encontre des minorit&eacute;s, ce qui ne contribuera qu'&agrave; les stigmatiser et &agrave; les exclure encore davantage.<BR>

<P><I>2.1 Promotion du renforcement des capacit&eacute;s et du pouvoir d'action aux niveaux local et national.</I> Les organisations ext&eacute;rieures ne peuvent pas, individuellement, aider les enfants vuln&eacute;rables ou exploit&eacute;s d'un pays donn&eacute;; leur r&ocirc;le n'est d'ailleurs pas de s'attaquer &agrave; des probl&egrave;mes nationaux. La contribution des organisations ext&eacute;rieures, notamment des donateurs &eacute;trangers, des organes intergouvernementaux et des ONG internationales, sera appropri&eacute;e et pr&eacute;cieuse dans la mesure o&ugrave; ils appuyeront des actions strat&eacute;giques et catalytiques visant &agrave; promouvoir et &agrave; renforcer les politiques, les priorit&eacute;s et les programmes nationaux en collaborant avec les partenaires et les homologues nationaux appropri&eacute;s. Le principal avantage de cette collaboration sera d'am&eacute;liorer les comp&eacute;tences et les capacit&eacute;s des organisations autochtones, de sorte que les politiques et les programmes nationaux soient plus autonomes et durables.<BR>

<P><I>2.2 Une action coordonn&eacute;e au niveau national.</I> Il est particuli&egrave;rement important que les organisations ext&eacute;rieures adoptent une approche coordonn&eacute;e lors de la mise au point et de l'ex&eacute;cution de leurs activit&eacute;s d'aide. On ne peut s'attendre et il n'est pas non plus d&eacute;sirable que l'ensemble de la coop&eacute;ration internationale suive une politique ou un plan national particulier, notamment lorsque la solution la plus efficace n'a pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;couverte. La diversit&eacute; et l'originalit&eacute; sont des atouts lorsqu'on s'attaque &agrave; des questions aussi complexes et difficiles que l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants. En m&ecirc;me temps, la communaut&eacute; internationale doit reconna&icirc;tre la primaut&eacute; de la responsabilit&eacute; des populations locales et contribuer &agrave; renforcer les capacit&eacute;s nationales afin d'&eacute;viter que des ressources limit&eacute;es soient dissip&eacute;es dans l'application de programmes trop divergents ou conflictuels. Les organismes ext&eacute;rieurs <BR>

<P>doivent &eacute;tablir un dialogue avec les autorit&eacute;s nationales, s'efforcer de reconna&icirc;tre, de comprendre et d'appuyer leurs priorit&eacute;s et leurs objectifs, tant en ce qui concerne les efforts d'enseignement scolaire, que ceux qui sont destin&eacute;s &agrave; des enfants particuli&egrave;rement expos&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>VI. 	Conclusion</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>Pour que le signal d'alarme</B> lanc&eacute; par le Congr&egrave;s r&eacute;sonne dans le monde entier, il faudra traduire en actions les strat&eacute;gies et les mesures p&eacute;dagogiques mentionn&eacute;es dans ce document. La valeur des efforts ind&eacute;pendants d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par les gouvernements, les ONG locales et internationales, l'ONU et les institutions multilat&eacute;rales, les donateurs et les m&eacute;dias ne doit pas &ecirc;tre sous-estim&eacute;e; ils ont contribu&eacute; &agrave; sensibiliser le public et lui ont montr&eacute; la voie de l'action concert&eacute;e. Mais le probl&egrave;me reste entier. L'&eacute;ducation doit &ecirc;tre le moteur du changement si l'on veut que l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants disparaisse de la surface de notre plan&egrave;te ou pour le moins qu'elle r&eacute;gresse. Cette &eacute;ducation doit &ecirc;tre dispens&eacute;e dans les &eacute;coles et les communaut&eacute;s, tant par l'interm&eacute;diaire des enfants que des adultes, et elle doit &ecirc;tre fermement ancr&eacute;e dans la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant, qui dispose que les &Eacute;tats parties et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile doivent respecter et prot&eacute;ger tous les droits de tous les enfants. Elle doit en outre embrasser des principes fondamentaux : conscience de sa propre valeur, la participation, respect d'autrui et de l'ind&eacute;pendance. Cependant, l'&eacute;ducation n'est pas une solution en soi. Seule la d&eacute;cision de tous les secteurs et de toutes les couches de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, dans le monde entier, de s'allier et de poursuivre un m&ecirc;me objectif permettra d'&eacute;liminer cet obstacle qui menace la dignit&eacute; et le d&eacute;veloppement des enfants.<BR>

<P><H2>Pr&eacute;vention et r&eacute;insertion psychosociale des enfants victimes d'exploitation sexuelle</H2><BR>
<B>RESUME</B><BR>

<P>Cet article est le fruit d'une proc&eacute;dure de consultation en cours. Il se fonde directement sur des informations contenues dans 20 &eacute;tudes de cas pratiques pr&eacute;par&eacute;es par des organisations non gouvernementales qui mettent actuellement en oeuvre des programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; pr&eacute;venir l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants ou &agrave; porter assistance &agrave; ceux qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; victimes de tels abus.<BR>

<P>Elles ont identifi&eacute; des facteurs nationaux et locaux &agrave; grande &eacute;chelle qui exposent les enfants &agrave; l'exploitation. Elles ont en outre fourni des d&eacute;tails de situations individuelles et familiales qui, combin&eacute;es, semblent augmenter la vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; des enfants. La pauvret&eacute;, relative et absolue, est dans de nombreux cas un &eacute;l&eacute;ment-cl&eacute; mais il s'av&egrave;re que c'est sa superposition sur d'autres facteurs de risque qui est &agrave; l'origine d'une situation dans laquelle les risques d'exploitation sexuelle des enfants sont tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;s. Ces composantes additionnelles sont notamment des syst&egrave;mes de valeurs en mutation, la mercantilisation du statut des individus au sein des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, l'existence d'une classe inf&eacute;rieure due &agrave; des diff&eacute;rences ethniques ou &agrave; une forte disparit&eacute; des statuts &eacute;conomiques, l'&eacute;clatement des familles ainsi qu'une ambivalence et une contradiction au sein de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; face au ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de l'exploitation sexuelle.<BR>

<P>Ces conditions g&eacute;n&egrave;rent un environnement o&ugrave; les enfants victimes d'exploitation sexuelle &eacute;chappent fr&eacute;quemment au r&eacute;seau d'assistance sociale et ce malgr&eacute; l'important engagement, en principe, en faveur de l'assistance et de la protection de l'enfant qu'ont affirm&eacute; notamment les pays signataires de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant. Il arrive que les enfants soient punis, rejet&eacute;s, insult&eacute;s, qu'ils soient priv&eacute;s de leurs droits en tant qu'enfants et d'un environnement qui leur offre une opportunit&eacute; de se d&eacute;velopper et de grandir. Pour certains, les cons&eacute;quences risquent d'&ecirc;tre mortelles &agrave; la suite de maladies sexuellement transmissibles, d'actes de violence perp&eacute;tr&eacute;s pour obtenir leur consentement ou de grossesses pr&eacute;coces. Pour d'autres, l'exp&eacute;rience de l'exploitation sexuelle laisse des cicatrices physiques, &eacute;motionnelles et psychologiques qui doivent &ecirc;tre soign&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Les &eacute;tudes fournissent des &eacute;claircissements pratiques sur les strat&eacute;gies adopt&eacute;es par les organisations non gouvernementales pour prot&eacute;ger l'enfant de toutes les formes d'exploitation et d'abus sexuels (article 34, CDE) ou sur les &quot;mesures appropri&eacute;es pour encourager le r&eacute;tablissement physique et psychologique et la r&eacute;insertion sociale&quot; (article 39, CDE). Beaucoup ont soulign&eacute; l'extr&ecirc;me importance de la mise en place d'un climat centr&eacute; sur l'enfant, qui reconna&icirc;t et appuie les droits et la position particuli&egrave;re de tous les enfants, qui comprend l'ampleur et la nature des abus et leur impact sur les enfants. Cet aspect semble rev&ecirc;tir une importance cruciale en ce qui concerne le d&eacute;veloppement d'un cadre politique et l&eacute;gislatif qui fournit un soutien pour les projets, qui encourage la protection, qui reconna&icirc;t l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales comme un crime et qui favorise les partenariats pour que les besoins de l'enfant re&ccedil;oivent une r&eacute;ponse holistique. Un tel cadre encourage la r&eacute;insertion des enfants dans leurs familles et dans leurs communaut&eacute;s et permet aux enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes d'entamer le processus qui leur fera retrouver leur dignit&eacute; et le sens de leur propre valeur. Il s'agit de l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment-cl&eacute; qui d&eacute;termine le r&eacute;tablissement psychosocial.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Les approches sp&eacute;cifiques connaissent des variations puisqu'elles tiennent compte d'un contexte social et culturel particulier mais toutes insistent sur le fait que les services et les activit&eacute;s doivent reconna&icirc;tre la valeur intrins&egrave;que des enfants, leur droit d'&ecirc;tre trait&eacute;s avec dignit&eacute; et d'&ecirc;tre entendus. Il ressort des &eacute;tudes de cas que toutes les personnes concern&eacute;es, les responsables politiques, les d&eacute;cideurs, ceux qui &eacute;laborent les programmes et ceux qui travaillent avec les jeunes ont beaucoup &agrave; apprendre de l'exp&eacute;rience et des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s des enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes. C'est l&agrave; l'objectif essentiel de ce dossier. La connaissance de ce qu'ont travers&eacute; les enfants, la compr&eacute;hension de leurs r&eacute;actions face aux abus ainsi que les services et les programmes qu'ils estiment efficaces: ces informations peuvent nous &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s utiles, que nous soyons avocats, responsables politiques, enseignants, animateurs au sein d'une communaut&eacute; ou th&eacute;rapeutes.<BR>

<P><B>I.	ORIGINES</B><BR>

<P>Ce rapport a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;par&eacute; &agrave; la demande du groupe des ONG pour la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant et il fait partie de sa contribution globale au Congr&egrave;s mondial sur l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u comme un dossier visant &agrave; rassembler et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper les exp&eacute;riences sur le terrain de diff&eacute;rentes organisations qui apportent des r&eacute;ponses au probl&egrave;me des abus d'enfants par l'exploitation &agrave; des fins commerciales en mettant en place des initiatives ancr&eacute;es dans les communaut&eacute;s pour la pr&eacute;vention ou la r&eacute;insertion. Ces &eacute;tudes de cas devaient se baser sur un noyau d'informations centrales dont la structure a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;ue en collaboration avec des travailleurs de terrain. A cela s'ajoutent plusieurs exp&eacute;riences, perceptions et analyses suppl&eacute;mentaires propos&eacute;es par les auteurs du rapport et valid&eacute;es par leurs coll&egrave;gues ainsi que par les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires du programme et qui sont susceptibles de clarifier et de mieux d&eacute;peindre chaque situation unique. L'espoir a &eacute;t&eacute; exprim&eacute; que l'examen de ces exp&eacute;riences permettrait de d&eacute;velopper une analyse plus large du probl&egrave;me et des strat&eacute;gies d'intervention. Etant donn&eacute; que cette analyse serait fond&eacute;e sur des informations issues de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; des exp&eacute;riences et besoins des enfants et resterait fermement ancr&eacute;e dans la pratique, on attend d'une telle approche empirique qu'elle soit tr&egrave;s significative pour ceux qui &eacute;tablissent les politiques et les proc&eacute;dures et qu'elle soit &eacute;galement d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t imm&eacute;diat pour les autres travailleurs de terrain qui cherchent &agrave; mettre en place ou &agrave; revoir des programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; apporter un changement positif dans les vies des enfants touch&eacute;s par ce probl&egrave;me, de leurs familles et de leurs communaut&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Le point de d&eacute;part pour tous ceux qui travaillent avec des enfants impliqu&eacute;s ou qui risquent d'&ecirc;tre touch&eacute;s par des activit&eacute;s sexuelles &agrave; des fins commerciales a &eacute;t&eacute; que de tels actes constituent une violation des droits fondamentaux des enfants. Ce principe fondamental est inscrit dans la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant, qui d&eacute;finit l'enfant comme &quot;tout &ecirc;tre humain &acirc;g&eacute; de moins de 18 ans sauf si, selon la loi applicable &agrave; l'enfant, la majorit&eacute; est atteinte plus t&ocirc;t&quot; - article 1. L'article 34 exige des signataires qu'ils prot&egrave;gent l'enfant de toutes les formes d'exploitation et d'abus sexuels et l'article 39 pr&eacute;cise qu'ils doivent &quot;prendre toutes les mesures appropri&eacute;es pour favoriser le r&eacute;tablissement physique et psychologique et la r&eacute;insertion sociale des victimes ... dans un environnement favorable &agrave; la sant&eacute;, au respect de soi et &agrave; la dignit&eacute; de l'enfant.&quot; Cet article indique explicitement que la responsabilit&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis des enfants s'&eacute;tend au-del&agrave; de leurs besoins physiques et pratiques. Il reconna&icirc;t que les enfants victimes d'abus, de n&eacute;gligence, de traumatisme souffrent presque toujours de cons&eacute;quences psychologiques, sociales et &eacute;motionnelles li&eacute;es &agrave; ces exp&eacute;riences. Les mesures de r&eacute;insertion ou de compensation appropri&eacute;es pour ces enfants peuvent varier mais doivent tenir compte, explicitement ou implicitement, des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de la situation actuelle des enfants, de leur environnement externe et de leur &eacute;tat psychologique ainsi que de la nature et de la succession des programmes ou des actions susceptibles de les aider &agrave; retrouver un sentiment de bien-&ecirc;tre psychologique et la capacit&eacute; d'interagir et d'&eacute;voluer au sein de leur milieu social.<BR>

<P><B>II.	SELECTION DES PROJETS</B><BR>

<P>D&egrave;s le d&eacute;part, l'objectif &eacute;tait de rassembler des informations concr&egrave;tes aupr&egrave;s de nombreuses organisations non gouvernementales qui mettent en place des services et des programmes pour pr&eacute;venir l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants et prot&eacute;ger ces derniers ou qui apportent leur aide &agrave; ceux qui ont d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; victimes d'abus. A cet effet, il fallait s&eacute;lectionner vingt projets susceptibles de servir de base &agrave; la r&eacute;alisation d'&eacute;tudes de cas d&eacute;taill&eacute;es fournissant des informations sp&eacute;cifiques au sujet des enfants et des communaut&eacute;s dans lesquelles ils &eacute;voluaient, de leurs exp&eacute;riences et des r&eacute;ponses apport&eacute;es par les programmes. Les vingt organisations ont &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;es parmi une soixantaine qui avaient &eacute;t&eacute; contact&eacute;es via le r&eacute;seau des organismes concern&eacute;s d&eacute;j&agrave; connus des organisations internationales appartenant au groupe ONG et qui avaient fourni des informations sur leur situation. Ce compte rendu est donc bas&eacute; sur les exp&eacute;riences combin&eacute;es qui nous ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es. Ces exp&eacute;riences sont issues de programmes du monde entier, mis en place dans des contextes de conditions sociales et de normes culturelles tr&egrave;s divers et qui font face &agrave; ce terrible probl&egrave;me avec toute une s&eacute;rie de strat&eacute;gies d'intervention.<BR>

<P>Les crit&egrave;res de s&eacute;lection appliqu&eacute;s pour choisir les 20 organisations qui allaient pr&eacute;parer les &eacute;tudes de cas ont &eacute;t&eacute; fix&eacute;s sur base de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une large distribution g&eacute;ographique, du d&eacute;sir d'inclure toute une s&eacute;rie d'approches et de points de mire diff&eacute;rents, du souhait de donner &agrave; des organisations de petite envergure ou moins connues l'occasion de pr&eacute;senter leur travail &agrave; une audience internationale, et finalement, de la capacit&eacute; et de la volont&eacute; de l'organisation &agrave; consacrer des ressources suffisantes &agrave; la pr&eacute;paration d'un rapport long et d&eacute;taill&eacute; dans les d&eacute;lais fix&eacute;s. Dans ces &eacute;tudes de cas, des travailleurs de terrain d&eacute;sireux de partager leurs exp&eacute;riences donnent un aper&ccedil;u de ce qui peut &ecirc;tre fait dans certaines circonstances ainsi que des erreurs commises et des le&ccedil;ons apprises en chemin. Les &eacute;tudes r&eacute;alis&eacute;es ont fourni une base permettant d'identifier certaines tendances et orientations &agrave; condition de ne jamais perdre de vue qu'elles ne forment pas un tableau complet de ce qui se passe ou de ce qui devrait se passer dans ce domaine. Elles se fondent sur des travaux avec des enfants dont les plus jeunes ont 8 ans (m&ecirc;me si la majorit&eacute; des programmes concernent des jeunes de 12-17 ans et plus). Ces travaux touchent les deux sexes bien que, dans leur large majorit&eacute;, ils se concentrent sur les victimes f&eacute;minines, et s'&eacute;tendent sur des p&eacute;riodes allant d'un an (APAP - Ethiopie) &agrave; 23 ans (UNDUGU - Kenya). Certaines organisations ont mis en place une exp&eacute;rience-pilote et n'ont travaill&eacute; qu'avec une petite partie des enfants exploit&eacute;s (30 filles suivent actuellement le projet Slum Aid, en Ouganda) alors que d'autres proposent des programmes qui ont d&eacute;j&agrave; fourni des services &agrave; plusieurs centaines de milliers de jeunes (Casa de Passagem, Br&eacute;sil; UNDUGU, Kenya).<BR>

<P>Une structure pour l'&eacute;tude de cas qui soit susceptible de fournir un minimum de donn&eacute;es et d'exp&eacute;riences comparables a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e avec le concours des travailleurs de terrain eux-m&ecirc;mes. L'objectif de cet instrument &eacute;tait d'aider les organismes &agrave; identifier les grands secteurs &agrave; inclure dans l'&eacute;tude tout en conservant une flexibilit&eacute; suffisante pour garantir que les aspects uniques ou les particularit&eacute;s-cl&eacute;s d'une situation, d'une communaut&eacute; ou d'une r&eacute;ponse d'un programme puissent y trouver leur place. La structure choisie comprend des indications concernant la philosophie et l'orientation qui sous-tendent le travail ainsi que des informations sur le d&eacute;veloppement des programmes et sur les dispositions pratiques prises pour atteindre les objectifs, tout comme une &eacute;valuation de l'impact et de l'efficacit&eacute; des mesures. Toutes les organisations ont &eacute;t&eacute; pri&eacute;es de consulter les enfants et les jeunes au sujet du contenu des rapports pour s'assurer qu'ils l'approuvaient. Les &eacute;tudes de cas seront reprises dans le rapport final.<BR>

<P>Cet article comprend des informations au sujet de tous les projets qui ont r&eacute;alis&eacute; ou qui pr&eacute;parent une &eacute;tude de cas mais, bien souvent, toutes les informations n&eacute;cessaires n'ont pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; rassembl&eacute;es. Des discussions sont encore en cours au sujet de l'&eacute;claircissement de certaines ambigu&iuml;t&eacute;s, de d&eacute;tails suppl&eacute;mentaires et d'une analyse plus pouss&eacute;e de l'impact. Il subsiste certaines zones d'ombre qui emp&ecirc;chent de comprendre pleinement tous les aspects des projets. Le rapport final devrait &ecirc;tre bas&eacute; &agrave; un degr&eacute; tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; sur la pratique et on n'a pas c&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; la tentation de faire des suppositions, d'anticiper les r&eacute;ponses du terrain ou de tirer des conclusions et d'arriver &agrave; des g&eacute;n&eacute;ralisations sans disposer au pr&eacute;alable des donn&eacute;es suffisantes. Cette d&eacute;marche arrivera &agrave; son terme avant la pr&eacute;paration du rapport, en ao&ucirc;t 1996.<BR>

<P><B>III.	TERMINOLOGIE</B><BR>

<P>L'objectif de cette &eacute;tude est de compl&eacute;ter les informations disponibles en se fondant sur des situations et des exp&eacute;riences r&eacute;elles afin de parvenir &agrave; une meilleure compr&eacute;hension de la question. Elle vise &eacute;galement &agrave; fournir un aper&ccedil;u des strat&eacute;gies possibles d'intervention qui peuvent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es et am&eacute;lior&eacute;es dans d'autres contextes. Un des probl&egrave;mes qui a entrav&eacute; les efforts pour &eacute;tablir une plus large base de connaissance qui serait susceptible de fournir des informations et de diriger les politiques et les interventions locales, nationales et internationales est le manque de coh&eacute;rence dans l'utilisation de certains termes et expressions. Ces divergences dans le langage utilis&eacute; pour d&eacute;crire et d&eacute;finir les probl&egrave;mes sont &agrave; l'origine d'un manque de clart&eacute; au sujet du contenu v&eacute;ritable des programmes, politiques et objectifs particuliers. Il existe des diff&eacute;rences dans l'utilisation des termes &quot;enfant&quot;, &quot;jeune&quot;, &quot;prostitu&eacute;e&quot;, &quot;victime de la prostitution&quot;, ou encore &quot;victime d'abus sexuels&quot;, &quot;rescap&eacute;&quot;, &quot;criminel&quot;, &quot;coupable d'abus&quot;, etc. Si les diff&eacute;rences sont dans certains cas fond&eacute;es et significatives, dans d'autres cas, les termes utilis&eacute;s peuvent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme inappropri&eacute;s par certaines personnes travaillant dans ce domaine. Certains mots peuvent &ecirc;tre per&ccedil;us comme v&eacute;hiculant des valeurs et des perceptions n&eacute;gatives ou m&ecirc;me comme d&eacute;gradants. Les liens entre les abus d'enfants par l'exploitation &agrave; des fins commerciales et l'inceste ou d'autres formes d'abus sexuels peuvent &ecirc;tre une source de confusion lorsqu'on cherche &agrave; identifier des similitudes d'approche et &agrave; recueillir des informations au sujet de l'ampleur de chaque probl&egrave;me.<BR>

<P>&quot;Le terme 'prostitution' est encore largement employ&eacute; (mais) on craint de plus en plus qu'il n'obscurcisse la nature du comportement que l'on peut qualifier d'abus sexuel puisqu'il &eacute;voque fortement un concept de 'consentement d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;' et donne aux enfants un r&ocirc;le de coupables plut&ocirc;t que de victimes.&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.)<BR>

<P><B>IV.	AMPLEUR DU PROBLEME</B><BR>

<P>La remarque unanime de toutes les personnes interrog&eacute;es est qu'il n'y a pas de statistiques exactes du nombre d'enfants actuellement victimes d'exploitation sexuelle. Il est &eacute;vident que ce probl&egrave;me est en partie li&eacute; &agrave; nos explications du paragraphe pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent. Comment pourrait-il y avoir un consensus au sujet de l'ampleur du probl&egrave;me alors qu'il existe une confusion concernant la d&eacute;finition des faits auxquels les diff&eacute;rents groupes concern&eacute;s font r&eacute;f&eacute;rence quand ils parlent de l'abus sexuel des enfants?<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Des projets ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis en place pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; un probl&egrave;me per&ccedil;u mais tous ceux qui travaillent sur le terrain ont indiqu&eacute; qu'ils n'&eacute;taient au courant que de certains cas seulement. Parfois, le probl&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; clairement identifi&eacute; gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des questions touchant l'ensemble de la communaut&eacute;, &agrave; des cas individuels ou par l'interm&eacute;diaire d'autres probl&egrave;mes qui y sont associ&eacute;s, comme en Ouganda, o&ugrave; on a pris conscience du ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne &agrave; la suite de travaux de sensibilisation au SIDA/VIH.<BR>

<P>Il est manifeste que le nombre d'enfants impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe est en train d'augmenter. Les estimations, ou les suppositions, sont souvent extr&ecirc;mement variables mais m&ecirc;me en ne retenant que les chiffres les plus modestes, il s'agit encore de centaines de milliers d'enfants dont les vies et les perspectives d'avenir sont saccag&eacute;es par cet atroce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne. Les ONG, plusieurs auteurs et observateurs ont avanc&eacute; les chiffres suivants:<BR>
	Tha&iuml;lande, (1996) 200,000 enfants impliqu&eacute;s<BR>
	Taiwan, (1987-95) 1978 enfants vendus<BR>
	N&eacute;pal, 100,000 - 200,000 filles touch&eacute;es par le commerce du sexe<BR>
	Philippines, (1995) 60,000 enfants prostitu&eacute;s<BR>
	Br&eacute;sil, (1992) 500,000 enfants prostitu&eacute;s<BR>
	Chili, 50,000 enfants travaillant dans le commerce du sexe<BR>
    	R.-U., (1989-93) 1800 inculpations et 1500 condamnations pour des d&eacute;lits li&eacute;s &agrave; la prostitution de jeunes de moins de 18 ans.<BR>

<P><B>V.	PREMIERS RESULTATS DES ETUDES DE CAS</B><BR>

<P>Les personnes interrog&eacute;es ont fourni une large esquisse des facteurs qui sont &agrave; l'origine d'un climat, &agrave; l'&eacute;chelon local et national, qui tol&egrave;re ou veut ignorer l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants ainsi que des renseignements plus sp&eacute;cifiques sur les caract&eacute;ristiques particuli&egrave;res des enfants victimes d'abus et de leurs familles. On trouve &agrave; la fois des divergences et des recoupements dans les &eacute;tudes de cas que nous avons re&ccedil;ues jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent. Nous les examinerons plus en d&eacute;tail dans un prochain rapport. Le compte rendu suivant reprend la gamme des situations identifi&eacute;es, les probl&egrave;mes fr&eacute;quents en diff&eacute;rents endroits et certains des d&eacute;fis qu'il faut relever.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Facteurs de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute;</B><BR>

<P>Qui sont les enfants victimes d'abus dans le cadre de l'exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales? Quels sont les facteurs qui indiquent un degr&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute; de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; et quel est le lien avec les param&egrave;tres individuels et familiaux qui se combinent pour nier les droits des enfants concern&eacute;s? Quels sont les facteurs soci&eacute;taux, les caract&eacute;ristiques politiques et les marques culturelles qui s'associent pour donner naissance &agrave; une situation o&ugrave; l'abus sexuel des enfants par l'exploitation est une r&eacute;alit&eacute;, r&eacute;alit&eacute; sur laquelle on ferme les yeux et qu'on accepte?<BR>

<P><B>1.1.	A grande &eacute;chelle</B><BR>

<P>Une connaissance plus approfondie des composantes d&eacute;mographiques, sociales, &eacute;conomiques, ethniques et culturelles des diff&eacute;rents contextes nationaux et locaux a permis d'identifier certaines particularit&eacute;s &agrave; grande &eacute;chelle comme des facteurs de risque ou de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; qui font augmenter la probabilit&eacute; de l'exploitation sexuelle d'enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. Il s'agit de facteurs d'une importance cruciale pour tous les programmes futurs ou existants qui cherchent &agrave; modifier les opportunit&eacute;s et les attitudes soit de la communaut&eacute; au sens large, soit de la famille, soit de l'enfant concern&eacute;. On trouve parmi ces facteurs:<BR>

<P>  La pauvret&eacute;, tant absolue que relative. Au sein d'une population, un grand nombre de personnes chroniquement d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es sur le plan &eacute;conomique et qui n'ont qu'un acc&egrave;s limit&eacute; &agrave; des opportunit&eacute;s d'obtenir une source alternative de revenus peuvent former un groupe dans lequel la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de la simple survie peut dicter l'implication des enfants dans le commerce du sexe. Il peut arriver que les enfants fassent eux-m&ecirc;mes ce choix. Mais dans de nombreux cas, ils sont vendus aux maisons closes par la famille, les voisins, etc. Il peut s'agir d'un moyen de rembourser des dettes ou de se procurer de quoi simplement survivre (Inde, N&eacute;pal) mais aussi parfois d'acqu&eacute;rir des biens de consommation relativement luxueux (Tha&iuml;lande).<BR>

<P>La pauvret&eacute; g&eacute;n&egrave;re une situation dans laquelle de nombreux enfants ne sont pas scolaris&eacute;s ou se retrouvent sur le march&eacute; du travail. Ces deux facteurs semblent indiquer ind&eacute;pendamment l'un de l'autre une vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; accrue. La situation des enfants sur le march&eacute; du travail, y compris ceux engag&eacute;s comme domestiques ou ceux qui vivent et travaillent dans la rue, les prive dans la plupart des cas de la protection d'une famille ou d'adultes attentionn&eacute;s et responsables. Certains peuvent &ecirc;tre vuln&eacute;rables &agrave; une exploitation par d'autres exclus qui vivent dans la rue et qui exigent d'eux des faveurs et des services sexuels en &eacute;change d'une certaine protection contre d'autres gangs.<BR>

<P>Le consum&eacute;risme/le mat&eacute;rialisme: la mercantilisation du statut des individus ainsi que l'attraction exerc&eacute;e par les aspects mat&eacute;riels de la vie (Tha&iuml;lande) a contribu&eacute; &agrave; initier un changement dans ce qu'on pourrait d&eacute;finir comme les niveaux appropri&eacute;s de respect et d'attention au sein des familles, avec les voisins, etc.<BR>

<P>	&quot;En ce qui concerne notre culture, nous sommes une communaut&eacute; en train de perdre ses racines; aujourd'hui, le consum&eacute;risme, l'individualisme et la comp&eacute;tition sont pr&eacute;dominants...&quot; (G.A.N., Chili)<BR>

<P>	Ce changement des valeurs et des attitudes aboutit &agrave; une situation dans laquelle un parent pourrait envisager de vendre une de ses filles &agrave; une maison close ou &agrave; un interm&eacute;diaire pour procurer au reste de sa famille certains biens de consommation.<BR>

<P>	&quot;...Le plus grand d&eacute;sastre et la plus effroyable trahison se produisirent; ma grand-m&egrave;re me vendit &agrave; un bordel pour la vie pour la somme de 800,000 NT$. A l'&eacute;poque, j'avais onze ans; j'ignorais encore beaucoup de choses, et lorsqu'ils m'ont demand&eacute; de signer, je l'ai fait. J'ai sign&eacute; un contrat qui me vendait pour la vie au propri&eacute;taire du bordel.&quot; (Taiwan).<BR>

<P>Des franges peu instruites et marginalis&eacute;es de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; procurant une source stable d'enfants qui peuvent &ecirc;tre contraints, oblig&eacute;s ou attir&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe (Br&eacute;sil, Inde, Tha&iuml;lande).<BR>

<P>	&quot;Les franges extr&ecirc;mement pauvres de la population continuent &agrave; chercher en dehors du syst&egrave;me des moyens leur permettant de survivre et constituent une sous-culture de la pauvret&eacute; qui se reproduit et s'alimente elle-m&ecirc;me.&quot; (G.A.N., Chili).<BR>
Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne peut se combiner &agrave; l'existence d'autres groupes ethniques ou de nationalit&eacute;s diff&eacute;rentes dont l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources est limit&eacute; et qui sont particuli&egrave;rement vuln&eacute;rables en raison de leur r&eacute;putation ou de leur position sociale dans le pays (N&eacute;pal, Taiwan, Inde, Br&eacute;sil, Venezuela). Pour ce groupe, les mesures de protection ou le respect g&eacute;n&eacute;ral qui pourrait &ecirc;tre accord&eacute; aux femmes et aux enfants en s'enracinant dans une conscience ou des principes nationaux r&eacute;pandus sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme sans importance ou inutiles.<BR>

<P>Le peu de consid&eacute;ration pour les femmes et l'opinion qu'elles sont et peuvent &ecirc;tre trait&eacute;es comme une forme de propri&eacute;t&eacute;: on leur refuse le droit de s'exprimer et la possibilit&eacute; de se d&eacute;fendre et de se prot&eacute;ger (N&eacute;pal, Tha&iuml;lande, Br&eacute;sil, Chili). Au N&eacute;pal, la combinaison d'un tel statut de la femme et de la demande provenant du commerce du sexe dans les pays voisins a donn&eacute; naissance &agrave; un important trafic de femmes et de filles qui sont vendues dans les maisons de prostitution. 70% des filles interrog&eacute;es dans des maisons de prostitution dans le cadre d'une &eacute;tude tha&iuml;landaise avaient &eacute;t&eacute; vendues une fois, 25% une deuxi&egrave;me fois et 5% une troisi&egrave;me fois. Par la suite, elles souffrent de toutes les cons&eacute;quences de ces abus et ne r&eacute;coltent aucun - ou tr&egrave;s peu - des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices financiers pour les services qu'elles sont oblig&eacute;es de rendre.<BR>

<P>Un cadre l&eacute;gislatif faible, vague, contradictoire, qui peut contenir des dispositions pour la protection des enfants mais o&ugrave; l'enfant exploit&eacute; dans le commerce du sexe peut &ecirc;tre vu comme un criminel plut&ocirc;t que comme une victime ou encore consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme n'appartenant pas &agrave; la cat&eacute;gorie des enfants pour lesquels la protection est garantie (R.-U., Ethiopie). On peut citer par exemple les difficult&eacute;s de poursuivre en justice les prox&eacute;n&egrave;tes et les souteneurs au Chili, o&ugrave; le d&eacute;lit serait l'atteinte aux bonnes moeurs, puisque le fait que l'enfant ait d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; catalogu&eacute; comme prostitu&eacute; par le pass&eacute; est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un &eacute;l&eacute;ment de d&eacute;fense.<BR>

<P>	&quot;On ne peut pas corrompre ce qui est d&eacute;j&agrave; corrompu.&quot;<BR>

<P>La corruption au sein du gouvernement. Elle peut aggraver les cons&eacute;quences d'un cadre l&eacute;gislatif vague lorsque les responsables charg&eacute;s de faire appliquer certaines mesures de protection tirent en r&eacute;alit&eacute; des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices de l'exploitation, financi&egrave;rement ou en exigeant des services sexuels.<BR>

<P>Un manque de volont&eacute; politique qui se traduit par une v&eacute;ritable complicit&eacute; avec les exploiteurs. Dans ce cas, l'ampleur de la prostitution des enfants peut &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme une source de b&eacute;n&eacute;fices &eacute;conomiques qui profite directement aux exploiteurs qui soutiennent et sont en &eacute;change soutenus par les d&eacute;cideurs politiques. La prostitution enfantine peut &ecirc;tre vue comme un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne qui attire les revenus &eacute;trangers par le tourisme du sexe et donc comme un atout plut&ocirc;t que comme une violation des droits fondamentaux des enfants.<BR>

<P>Les convictions culturelles: dans les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s qui combinent certains des facteurs d&eacute;j&agrave; cit&eacute;s avec la croyance que des relations sexuelles avec une fille vierge ont des pouvoirs fortifiants ou curatifs, il y a une demande pour des enfants plus jeunes. Certaines pratiques religieuses aboutissent au m&ecirc;me r&eacute;sultat. Par exemple le syst&egrave;me &quot;Devadasi&quot; qui, bien qu'ill&eacute;gal, est encore pratiqu&eacute; dans certaines parties de l'Inde, entra&icirc;ne ou tol&egrave;re l'exploitation sexuelle.<BR>

<P>La demande de services sexuels. Une telle demande peut provenir de larges groupes d'hommes sans partenaires, par exemple dans des bases militaires ou sur de grands chantiers de construction (Philippines, Br&eacute;sil), qui attirent &agrave; la fois des individus pour qui de telles opportunit&eacute;s peuvent &ecirc;tre synonymes de survie et d'autres qui cherchent &agrave; servir d'interm&eacute;diaires pour r&eacute;aliser des profits. Le manque de consid&eacute;ration pour ces femmes et ces jeunes est peut-&ecirc;tre exacerb&eacute; par l'absence de tabous relatifs au traitement des femmes, des gar&ccedil;ons et des filles de nationalit&eacute; diff&eacute;rente, ayant d'autres origines ethniques, etc. Si certains sont conscients des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de l'exploitation sexuelle et d&eacute;cident pourtant de s'y engager, beaucoup d'autres sont forc&eacute;s ou attir&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe. Les m&eacute;thodes utilis&eacute;es pour contraindre les enfants &agrave; participer au commerce du sexe vont du viol &agrave; des menaces de violence en passant par l'emprisonnement et le fait de soumettre les enfants &agrave; des conditions d'esclavage (Philippines, Tha&iuml;lande). D'autres ne font que se soumettre aux exigences de leurs parents.<BR>

<P>La pand&eacute;mie d&eacute;&eacute; une demande d'enfants plus jeunes pour les services sexuels car ces derniers seraient moins susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre porteurs du virus VIH (Ouganda, Tha&iuml;lande).<BR>

<P><B>1.2.	Facteurs de risque individuels/familiaux</B><BR>

<P>Au sein de ces larges cat&eacute;gories, on trouve des enfants qui sont exploit&eacute;s et d'autres qui, pour une raison ou une autre, parviennent &agrave; l'&eacute;viter. Quels sont les facteurs qui prot&egrave;gent et ceux qui augmentent les risques des enfants de devenir les victimes de cette forme d'abus?<BR>

<P>L'&eacute;clatement familial. Cette cat&eacute;gorie englobe les remariages avec de mauvaises relations entre les enfants et leur belle-famille (Chili, Ethiopie), les enfants qui quittent le domicile familial (R.-U.), les enfants qui entretiennent de mauvaises relations avec les adultes responsables d'eux (R.-U.) ou qui sont &agrave; la charge d'une personne autre qu'un des parents (Ouganda) ainsi que ceux qui quittent tr&egrave;s t&ocirc;t leur domicile et leur famille pour essayer de survivre dans la rue par tous les moyens possibles et disponibles.<BR>

<P>Le contexte parental dans lequel grandit l'enfant peut &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s instable. Dans certaines familles, on trouve des parents qui souffrent de maladies physiques ou mentales, qui sont toxicomanes ou alcooliques. Il arrive qu'ils vivent dans des conditions d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;ment difficiles et stressantes, qu'ils soient sans-abri, sans-emploi, mobiles, instables, et la combinaison de ces facteurs peut r&eacute;duire consid&eacute;rablement leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; s'occuper de leurs enfants et &agrave; les prot&eacute;ger.<BR>

<P>Les abus dans la cellule familiale: il arrive que les enfants doivent quitter le domicile familial &agrave; la suite de mauvais traitements ou d'abus sexuels perp&eacute;tr&eacute;s par un des membres de la famille.<BR>

<P>&quot;...La fille dont la famille traverse une crise financi&egrave;re ou sociale due &agrave; la pauvret&eacute; et &agrave; la marginalisation sociale et culturelle est expos&eacute;e &agrave; une violence importante au sein de la cellule familiale.&quot; (G.A.N., Chili)<BR>

<P>L'absence de protection, qui s'accompagne parfois de la perte de l'estime de soi, du sentiment d'&ecirc;tre 'ab&icirc;m&eacute;', fait de l'enfant une victime facile pour ceux qui cherchent &agrave; l'exploiter.<BR>

<P>&quot;Ces jeunes doivent se d&eacute;brouiller seuls et faire face au traumatisme &eacute;motionnel provoqu&eacute; par les abus, le rejet et la n&eacute;gligence qui peuvent les avoir pouss&eacute;s &agrave; partir de chez eux.&quot; (Youth Link, Canada)<BR>

<P>En dehors du syst&egrave;me scolaire. Les enfants non scolaris&eacute;s, quelle qu'en soit la raison, sont vuln&eacute;rables. Que ce soit parce qu'ils travaillent ou simplement parce qu'ils &eacute;voluent en dehors du syst&egrave;me scolaire, ils sont davantage expos&eacute;s aux risques d'abus. Dans de nombreux cas, les filles sont particuli&egrave;rement d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es souvent d&egrave;s leur plus jeune &acirc;ge en ce qui concerne l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; l'enseignement. Pour bon nombre d'entre elles, un emploi de domestique est une des rares opportunit&eacute;s de travailler.<BR>

<P>&quot;D&egrave;s qu'une fille atteint l'&acirc;ge de 6 ans, elle commence &agrave; accompagner sa m&egrave;re ... et quand elle a 8 ans, elle est suffisamment grande pour travailler de mani&egrave;re ind&eacute;pendante.&quot; (Inde, Domestic Workers Movement)<BR>

<P>En Inde, 17 % des domestiques ont moins de 14 ans. Ces enfants vivent avec leurs employeurs et d&eacute;pendent totalement d'eux. Et il arrive que ces employeurs ne soient m&ecirc;me pas conscients que leurs employ&eacute;s ont des droits en tant qu'enfants. Dans de telles circonstances, les enfants sont extr&ecirc;mement vuln&eacute;rables face &agrave; l'exploitation et aux abus sexuels. Il est fr&eacute;quent qu'il ne leur soit pas possible de se plaindre ou de chercher une protection et ils acceptent souvent leur destin jusqu'&agrave; ce que peut-&ecirc;tre une grossesse survienne ou qu'ils soient chass&eacute;s parce qu'ils &quot;corrompent&quot; leurs employeurs ou les fils de ces derniers. A ce moment, la combinaison d'une absence d'alternatives et d'une mauvaise image de soi peut les rendre extr&ecirc;mement vuln&eacute;rables &agrave; de nouveaux abus dans les maisons closes et les r&eacute;seaux de prostitution.<BR>

<P> Le bon &acirc;ge et le bon sexe: bien qu'on connaisse des cas de tr&egrave;s jeunes enfants victimes d'abus dans le cadre du commerce du sexe, avec une &eacute;tude mentionnant une moyenne d'&acirc;ge de 8 ans quand les enfants sont pour la premi&egrave;re fois victimes d'abus sexuels (Chili), la majorit&eacute; des enfants cit&eacute;s dans les &eacute;tudes de cas sont &acirc;g&eacute;s de 12-17 ans. Une grande partie des programmes concernent les filles mais, dans certaines situations, les gar&ccedil;ons sont &eacute;galement vis&eacute;s ou risquent d'&ecirc;tre impliqu&eacute;s dans le commerce du sexe.<BR>

<P>L'implication d'un autre membre de la famille. Que ce soit par un recrutement actif, en raison d'une plus grande propension &agrave; envisager cette possibilit&eacute; ou d'une r&eacute;sistance moins forte, on constate que les enfants qui ont une soeur ou un fr&egrave;re plus &acirc;g&eacute; d&eacute;j&agrave; exploit&eacute; dans le commerce du sexe courent de plus grands risques d'y &ecirc;tre eux aussi impliqu&eacute;s (Tha&iuml;lande). Ce n'est cependant pas toujours le cas. On a connaissance de soeurs ou de m&egrave;res qui continuent ou recommencent &agrave; se prostituer dans le but explicite de prot&eacute;ger d'autres membres de leur famille en subvenant aux besoins mat&eacute;riels, r&eacute;duisant ainsi les pressions &eacute;conomiques qui p&egrave;sent sur la famille.<BR>

<P>La toxicomanie: certains jeunes se tournent vers le commerce du sexe pour obtenir les moyens de se procurer de la drogue. D'autres deviennent toxicomanes par la suite et prennent de la drogue pour avoir moins conscience des abus auxquels ils sont soumis. Ils sont alors pris dans le cercle vicieux de la d&eacute;pendance.<BR>

<P>Une grande partie des enfants victimes de l'exploitation sexuelle sont d&eacute;favoris&eacute;s sur de nombreux plans ou expos&eacute;s &agrave; des risques multiples. Les facteurs complexes qui affectent un individu et sa famille et qui se combinent pour inciter, attirer, contraindre ou maintenir un enfant dans une situation o&ugrave; il est victime d'abus par l'exploitation sexuelle ou qui, &agrave; l'inverse, prot&egrave;gent l'enfant face &agrave; ces risques, doivent &ecirc;tre recherch&eacute;s dans les rapports et examin&eacute;s plus en d&eacute;tail pour d&eacute;couvrir leur degr&eacute; d'importance, les combinaisons les plus dangereuses, etc. En plus du probl&egrave;me de l'exploitation sexuelle, l'enfant victime d'abus peut &ecirc;tre un enfant de la guerre, un enfant de la rue ou un enfant handicap&eacute;.<BR>

<P>&quot;...La plupart de ces filles &eacute;taient originaires de familles &eacute;clat&eacute;es, ... avaient fui la col&egrave;re d'une belle-m&egrave;re, s'&eacute;taient &eacute;loign&eacute;es d'une guerre ... et avaient &eacute;t&eacute; les victimes ... d'un viol, d'abus sexuels lorsqu'elles &eacute;taient enfants, etc.&quot; (Slum Aid, Ouganda)<BR>

<P>Il faut comparer ces donn&eacute;es avec une autre recherche qui a identifi&eacute; les facteurs qui engendrent la r&eacute;silience chez l'enfant, qui peuvent contribuer &agrave; prot&eacute;ger l'enfant soit de l'exploitation en elle-m&ecirc;me, soit des r&eacute;percussions les plus pr&eacute;judiciables sur le plan personnel, ou qui maximisent les perspectives de mettre un terme &agrave; l'exploitation de l'enfant ou de le r&eacute;int&eacute;grer avec succ&egrave;s dans sa famille ou sa communaut&eacute;.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Cons&eacute;quences des abus</B><BR>

<P>Le principe de base selon lequel les enfants ont un droit fondamental &agrave; l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; personnelle et &agrave; ne pas &ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;s ou victimes d'abus r&eacute;sulte de l'acceptation absolue du fait que des violations de ces droits portent atteinte et font du mal aux enfants concern&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Tous les organismes auxquels on a fait appel pour les &eacute;tudes de cas mentionnent les cons&eacute;quences p&eacute;nibles pour les enfants qui sont victimes de ces abus. Parmi ces r&eacute;percussions, on peut citer des probl&egrave;mes physiques, des probl&egrave;mes de d&eacute;veloppement, des probl&egrave;mes sociaux ainsi que de graves troubles psychologiques et &eacute;motionnels. Certaines des &eacute;tudes indiquent que les enfants souffrent de toute une s&eacute;rie de maladies, notamment de tuberculose, de probl&egrave;mes respiratoires, de c&eacute;phal&eacute;es, d'&eacute;puisement, de maladies sexuellement transmissibles, de blessures r&eacute;sultant d'actes de violence perp&eacute;tr&eacute;s soit par les personnes qui contr&ocirc;lent et organisent les activit&eacute;s commerciales sexuelles, soit par ceux qui commettent les abus, ou que les enfants s'infligent eux-m&ecirc;mes. Ils peuvent souffrir de malnutrition ou &ecirc;tre affaiblis par les in&eacute;vitables cons&eacute;quences d'un mauvais cadre de vie, de la pauvret&eacute; ou de leur n&eacute;gligence de leur propre personne. Certains prennent de la drogue ou boivent de l'alcool. On leur a souvent refus&eacute; la possibilit&eacute; de s'int&eacute;grer dans la vie scolaire normale ou de poursuivre leur scolarit&eacute;, et leur niveau d'&eacute;ducation est tr&egrave;s bas. Cela ne manque pas d'avoir &eacute;galement des r&eacute;percussions sur leurs perspectives d'avenir et sur le plan de l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; d'autres possibilit&eacute;s d'obtenir des revenus.<BR>

<P>Les cons&eacute;quences psychologiques et &eacute;motionnelles identifi&eacute;es comprennent une mauvaise estime de soi, un manque d'assurance, une haine de soi, un sentiment d'exclusion, l'impression d'&ecirc;tre indigne, mal aim&eacute;, impossible &agrave; aimer et un sentiment d'avilissement.<BR>

<P>&quot;La prostitution se lit sur mon visage.&quot; (Taiwan)<BR>
&quot;La prostitution n'est rien parce que je ne suis rien.&quot; (Taiwan)<BR>

<P>Ces enfants ont parfois perdu toute confiance dans les autres mais, pouss&eacute;s par leur immense besoin d'attention, d'affection et de soutien, s'engagent malgr&eacute; tout dans une s&eacute;rie d'autres relations d'abus et d'exploitation. Ils peuvent se sentir impuissants et d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;s, accepter leur destin comme in&eacute;vitable avec r&eacute;signation et apathie. Ils ne font que peu de cas de leur avenir qu'ils consid&egrave;rent simplement comme une prolongation de la m&ecirc;me situation. Certains se droguent pour calmer leur souffrance et estomper leur perception de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>&quot;Nos prostitu&eacute;es ont besoin d'une drogue dure capable de les d&eacute;tacher compl&egrave;tement de CELA ou de supprimer CELA totalement. Seule la prise de drogues opiac&eacute;es par voie intraveineuse ou la consommation de crack semble remplir ces conditions ...&quot; (Afrique du Sud).<BR>

<P>D'autres ont beaucoup de mal &agrave; se concentrer et ont perdu la capacit&eacute; de structurer et d'utiliser leur temps. Ils se sentent impuissants et incapables de provoquer des changements. Beaucoup ont retenu ou adopt&eacute; l'opinion de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; leur &eacute;gard selon laquelle ils seraient immoraux et sources de corruption et, d'une mani&egrave;re ou d'une autre, responsables de leur situation. Ils survivent dans une atmosph&egrave;re de violence et d'intimidation dans laquelle leur existence elle-m&ecirc;me peut d&eacute;pendre de leur soumission face &agrave; une exploitation et des abus permanents.<BR>

<P><B>VI.	REPONSES</B><BR>

<P>Les organisations non gouvernementales qui ont achev&eacute; leur &eacute;tude de cas d&eacute;finissent leurs programmes respectifs comme pr&eacute;ventif, th&eacute;rapeutique, de r&eacute;insertion, de catalyse, qui donnent des moyens et des facilit&eacute;s. Aucune organisation ne poursuit exclusivement un seul de ces objectifs. Toutes reconnaissent les liens qui existent entre ces diff&eacute;rents aspects et les effets de chevauchement de leur travail mais certaines estiment que leur aire de comp&eacute;tence ou leur secteur d'influence se trouve essentiellement dans l'un ou l'autre domaine.<BR>

<P><B>1.	Pr&eacute;vention</B><BR>

<P>Pour la plupart des organisations, la pr&eacute;vention passe par toute une s&eacute;rie d'approches diff&eacute;rentes. Il s'agit ainsi de faire prendre conscience de l'&eacute;tendue et de l'ampleur du probl&egrave;me des abus dont sont victimes les enfants et d'amener cette question sur la sc&egrave;ne publique plut&ocirc;t que de laisser les tabous et restrictions largement r&eacute;pandus concernant les discussions sur des questions sexuelles former un &eacute;cran qui fait que les enfants restent des victimes cach&eacute;es. On a recherch&eacute; des moyens d'influencer l'opinion publique afin de d&eacute;velopper une attitude de support et de soutien de tous les enfants et d'intol&eacute;rance vis-&agrave;-vis de ceux qui les exploitent et abusent d'eux. Il s'agit &eacute;galement de r&eacute;duire le nombre des victimes potentielles en diffusant des informations sur la r&eacute;alit&eacute; de l'exploitation sexuelle, de propager les techniques et aptitudes permettant aux enfants de se prot&eacute;ger eux-m&ecirc;mes ainsi que de rechercher d'autres opportunit&eacute;s pour les enfants les plus expos&eacute;s &agrave; ces risques. Pour &ecirc;tre efficace, la pr&eacute;vention doit s'int&eacute;grer &agrave; un cadre l&eacute;gislatif visant &agrave; prot&eacute;ger les enfants, &agrave; poursuivre ceux qui commettent ces d&eacute;lits. Il faut &eacute;galement disposer des comp&eacute;tences n&eacute;cessaires pour traiter avec doigt&eacute; et en s&ucirc;ret&eacute; la d&eacute;couverte d'abus dans un contexte o&ugrave; ces mesures, &agrave; la fois de protection et d'ordre judiciaire, sont port&eacute;es &agrave; la connaissance du plus grand nombre et approuv&eacute;es.<BR>

<P><B>Strat&eacute;gies</B><BR>

<P><B>1.1	Provoquer une prise de conscience</B><BR>

<P>Pour commencer, des informations sur les droits de l'homme en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et sur les droits de l'enfant en particulier peuvent &ecirc;tre indispensables pour former la toile de fond sur laquelle d&eacute;velopper des programmes plus sp&eacute;cifiques visant &agrave; pr&eacute;venir l'exploitation sexuelle des enfants.<BR>

<P>&quot;...Toute notre organisation est un projet permanent dont le but est de supprimer les violations des droits des personnes de moins de 18 ans au Costa Rica.&quot; (Fundacion Paniamor)<BR>

<P>Des informations concernant la nature des abus, leur ampleur et leur impact sur les victimes sont diffus&eacute;es par de nombreux canaux afin de toucher les gens &agrave; tous les niveaux de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Cette d&eacute;marche suppose que les populations parmi lesquelles les enfants sont recrut&eacute;s soient vis&eacute;es (Tha&iuml;lande), que les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes et leurs parents soient inform&eacute;s et donc puissent se d&eacute;fendre (Br&eacute;sil), qu'on exerce une influence sur les responsables politiques et sur les d&eacute;cideurs dans leur ensemble, qu'on modifie les attitudes des groupes de la communaut&eacute; internationale qui sont impliqu&eacute;s ou concern&eacute;s par ce probl&egrave;me comme les touristes potentiels, les pays donateurs, les partenaires &eacute;conomiques, etc.<BR>

<P>&quot;Les objectifs du projet sont ... de sensibiliser &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me les organismes et les d&eacute;cideurs et de les inciter &agrave; fournir des moyens pour y rem&eacute;dier.&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.)<BR>

<P>La fa&ccedil;on de pr&eacute;senter l'information, la terminologie utilis&eacute;e, les m&eacute;dias choisis: tous ces facteurs exercent une influence sur l'efficacit&eacute; du message (Casa De Passagem, Br&eacute;sil). Les canaux choisis pour faire passer le message peuvent &ecirc;tre la presse &eacute;crite, la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision, la radio, le th&eacute;&acirc;tre et la musique. Une des strat&eacute;gies utilis&eacute;es pour maximiser la signification et l'impact est d'apprendre des pi&egrave;ces de th&eacute;&acirc;tre aux enfants exploit&eacute;s, de leur fournir les moyens d'&eacute;crire et de jouer des repr&eacute;sentations th&eacute;&acirc;trales traitant des dangers et des cons&eacute;quences des abus sexuels.<BR>

<P>&quot;La pi&egrave;ce de th&eacute;&acirc;tre sur la prostitution enfantine est pr&eacute;par&eacute;e sous la forme d'un forum qui rassemble 8 acteurs, dont 4 sont des enfants touch&eacute;s par la prostitution. Le th&egrave;me central est la prostitution enfantine, ses causes et ses effets... Cette op&eacute;ration a &eacute;t&eacute; un point essentiel dans les ateliers de sensibilisation.&quot; (APAP, Ethiopie)<BR>

<P>Des efforts sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s pour influencer les professionnels qui travaillent dans le domaine de l'assistance aux enfants afin qu'ils puissent apporter leur aide aux enfants et communaut&eacute;s en danger, travailler avec doigt&eacute; et positivement avec les enfants d&eacute;j&agrave; touch&eacute;s par ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne et identifier les premiers signes indiquant que l'enfant est en danger ou d&eacute;j&agrave; victime d'abus. Des campagnes d'information sur les droits des enfants peuvent &ecirc;tre organis&eacute;es ind&eacute;pendamment de projets visant sp&eacute;cifiquement &agrave; lutter contre le probl&egrave;me de l'exploitation sexuelle. L&agrave; o&ugrave; ces campagnes se d&eacute;roulent, elles ont pour objectif d'augmenter la reconnaissance des enfants en tant que groupe ayant des droits, des aspirations et des besoins particuliers, et de souligner le large devoir d'attention et de responsabilit&eacute; des adultes envers les enfants. Plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, elles peuvent chercher &agrave; obtenir que la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant soit reprise explicitement ou implicitement dans la l&eacute;gislation relative &agrave; l'aide sociale. Ces campagnes peuvent ouvrir la voie &agrave; d'autres plus sp&eacute;cifiques sur les droits des enfants en ce qui concerne la protection face aux abus sexuels.<BR>

<P><B>1.2	Rassemblement d'informations</B><BR>
La compr&eacute;hension de la nature et de l'&eacute;tendue du probl&egrave;me est souvent une condition indispensable pour une action efficace. Tant qu'il n'y a pas une certaine clart&eacute; sur l'&eacute;tendue du probl&egrave;me, ses manifestations particuli&egrave;res et ses cons&eacute;quences, et tant que ces informations ne sont pas pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es de mani&egrave;re &agrave; toucher le public cibl&eacute; par le message, la motivation ou la volont&eacute; politique de s'occuper de cette question peuvent &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s faibles (Philippines). M&ecirc;me si on utilise de larges statistiques, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; que celles-ci ne sont que des suppositions impr&eacute;cises, elles peuvent &ecirc;tre plus ais&eacute;ment rejet&eacute;es et ignor&eacute;es.<BR>

<P><B>1.3	D&eacute;fense</B><BR>

<P>Il est important d'exercer des pressions pour que les groupes qui n'ont pas la possibilit&eacute; de se faire entendre et qui n'ont aucun pouvoir voient leurs droits et leurs probl&egrave;mes reconnus. Les tabous et les b&acirc;illons culturels qui emp&ecirc;chent de reconna&icirc;tre la r&eacute;alit&eacute; des abus cr&eacute;ent un climat qui sera toujours marqu&eacute; par un manque de soutien, de fonds et d'efforts pour faire face au probl&egrave;me. Si cette question peut &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;e comme une aberration individuelle, comme l'image des difficult&eacute;s personnelles de quelques enfants et de leurs familles plut&ocirc;t que comme le reflet d'un aspect destructeur et dysfonctionnel de nombreuses soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, les r&eacute;ponses peuvent alors &ecirc;tre minimis&eacute;es, de petite &eacute;chelle et de faible impact, presque cach&eacute;es. Les efforts pour modifier et am&eacute;liorer la l&eacute;gislation et pour s'assurer que tout le poids des mesures existantes est utilis&eacute; pour prot&eacute;ger de mani&egrave;re ad&eacute;quate les enfants menac&eacute;s, etc. sont tous des mesures de pr&eacute;vention valables et efficaces (Philippines, Costa Rica). Aux Philippines, ce type d'efforts a finalement permis de faire reconna&icirc;tre la nature criminelle des abus sexuels.<BR>

<P><B>1.4	Formation de r&eacute;seaux</B><BR>

<P>En diff&eacute;rents endroits, des organisations ont cherch&eacute; &agrave; former des alliances et un r&eacute;seau pour d&eacute;velopper des programmes de grande envergure en op&eacute;rant dans une perspective multidisciplinaire. Ces programmes peuvent avoir un volet &quot;communication&quot; qui utilise pleinement leur influence commune et leurs potentiels sur le plan publicitaire et sur celui des liens avec les m&eacute;dias pour faire passer les informations appropri&eacute;es sur les victimes et les exploiteurs. En outre, ce type d'initiatives, en reconnaissant la complexit&eacute; de la question, la s&eacute;rie de probl&egrave;mes et de difficult&eacute;s qui r&eacute;sultent de ces abus pour les enfants, leurs familles et peut-&ecirc;tre leurs communaut&eacute;s, rassemble les diff&eacute;rentes comp&eacute;tences et aptitudes pour faire face plus efficacement &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me. Il s'agit &eacute;galement d'une d&eacute;marche extr&ecirc;mement efficace pour traiter les questions contest&eacute;es puisque les forces rassembl&eacute;es au sein d'une alliance peuvent r&eacute;pondre de mani&egrave;re plus efficace &agrave; l'hostilit&eacute; et aux conflits (R.-U., Br&eacute;sil). Par exemple, travailler avec les m&eacute;dias pour pr&eacute;senter toute la finesse d'une approche dans laquelle les organismes de contr&ocirc;le et d'assistance sociale coop&egrave;rent peut parfois contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;duire l'hostilit&eacute; publique &agrave; l'encontre des enfants.<BR>

<P><B>1.5	Op&eacute;rations de sauvetage</B><BR>

<P>Ces op&eacute;rations, qui impliquent des juristes, des travailleurs sociaux, des professionnels de la sant&eacute;, etc. et qui visent &agrave; aider les enfants &agrave; s'&eacute;chapper de situations o&ugrave; ils sont victimes d'abus, associent les deux aspects de la pr&eacute;vention et de la r&eacute;insertion. Etant donn&eacute; que ces programmes s'accompagnent d'une large publicit&eacute; et obtiennent un important soutien populaire, ils am&eacute;liorent le profil des victimes et engendrent la sympathie et le soutien du public pour les enfants &quot;sauv&eacute;s&quot; et ceux qui continuent &agrave; &ecirc;tre victimes d'abus.<BR>
<B>1.6	Initiatives ancr&eacute;es dans les communaut&eacute;s</B><BR>

<P>Il s'agit d'exploiter les ressources que repr&eacute;sentent les dirigeants &agrave; l'&eacute;chelon local. Ces initiatives peuvent viser les populations dont sont originaires un grand nombre de victimes. Les dirigeants de la communaut&eacute; peuvent faire appel &agrave; des m&eacute;thodes telles que les jeux de r&ocirc;les, les spectacles de conteurs, le th&eacute;&acirc;tre et l'art et re&ccedil;oivent les moyens qui leur permettent de se charger d'informer et de former leur propre communaut&eacute; ainsi que d'accro&icirc;tre l'autoprotection. (camps d'&eacute;t&eacute; / d'hiver, Taiwan; Coletivo Mulher Vida, Br&eacute;sil).<BR>

<P><B>1.7	Utilisation des syst&egrave;mes l&eacute;gaux pour poursuivre les coupables et prot&eacute;ger les victimes</B><BR>

<P>La compr&eacute;hension de la loi dans ses deux fonctions, celle de prot&eacute;ger les plus vuln&eacute;rables et celle d'imposer des peines &agrave; ceux qui la transgressent, a un double effet. Elle fait prendre mieux conscience des sanctions l&eacute;gales et du cadre de protection, donnant ainsi aux victimes la possibilit&eacute; d'intenter une action en justice. De telles poursuites ont un effet potentiellement dissuasif lorsque les sanctions qui peuvent &ecirc;tre prononc&eacute;es &agrave; l'encontre des coupables sont s&eacute;v&egrave;res (Philippines) et rendent &agrave; nouveau manifestes la d&eacute;sapprobation sociale et l'absence de tol&eacute;rance face &agrave; ces actes. Le projet mis en place en Ethiopie a adopt&eacute; un programme visant &agrave; faire conna&icirc;tre le cadre l&eacute;gal gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'action d'une &eacute;quipe de personnes au courant des questions juridiques et comprenant des enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; victimes d'exploitation sexuelle.<BR>

<P><B>1.8	Sources de revenus alternatives / Education non officielle</B><BR>

<P>Ces deux strat&eacute;gies sont con&ccedil;ues pour fournir des alternatives aux enfants et &agrave; leurs familles lorsque la participation au commerce du sexe est vue comme le seul moyen disponible pour survivre. Pour les enfants exclus de la vie scolaire normale, les perspectives et les choix d'avenir sont fortement limit&eacute;s et cette spirale descendante de r&eacute;duction des opportunit&eacute;s augmente le risque d'exploitation sexuelle. Une &eacute;ducation alternative, peut-&ecirc;tre gratuite, propos&eacute;e aux enfants qui travaillent, et qui serait en mesure de reconna&icirc;tre les besoins de ceux qui ont peu fr&eacute;quent&eacute; l'&eacute;cole ou qui sont moins enclins &agrave; &eacute;tudier, peut soutenir les espoirs et les chances de l'enfant d'avoir un avenir plus positif.<BR>

<P>&quot;Certaines filles ne sont pas attir&eacute;es par les &eacute;tudes, ... mais lorsqu'elles sont &agrave; nouveau scolaris&eacute;es, les &eacute;coles insistent tellement sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;ussir les examens que ces filles ne s'en sentent que de plus en plus inf&eacute;rieures&quot; (The Good Shepherd Sisters, Taiwan).<BR>

<P>Ces programmes orient&eacute;s avant tout sur la pr&eacute;vention cherchent &agrave; r&eacute;duire les risques  d'abus d'enfants par l'exploitation sexuelle et mettent en oeuvre pour cela des m&eacute;thodes tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes. Certains de ces programmes sont des projets-pilotes qui emploient des techniques exp&eacute;rimentales pour r&eacute;pandre le message de mani&egrave;re efficace et appropri&eacute;e, pour fournir aux enfants et aux adultes des strat&eacute;gies de protection et pour les sensibiliser aux risques et cons&eacute;quences. En plus de la composante pr&eacute;ventive, presque toutes les strat&eacute;gies ont pour but d'augmenter la dignit&eacute; et le respect des enfants par les autres ainsi que le sentiment d'estime de soi des enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes. Il s'agit d'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment-cl&eacute; dans les programmes qui cherchent &agrave; faire face aux cons&eacute;quences psychosociales d'abus d'enfants par l'exploitation sexuelle.<BR>

<P><B>2.	R&eacute;insertion</B><BR>

<P>La r&eacute;insertion fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence au concept de r&eacute;tablissement d'une situation ant&eacute;rieure, dans ce cas pour permettre aux enfants de se lib&eacute;rer des r&eacute;percussions n&eacute;gatives d'ordre physique, psychologique et social des abus dont ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; victimes. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, dans de nombreux cas, cela revient &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la situation d'origine en essayant d'augmenter le bien-&ecirc;tre physique, le respect et l'estime de soi des enfants et en leur donnant les moyens de se prot&eacute;ger eux-m&ecirc;mes mieux qu'auparavant.<BR>

<P>Les strat&eacute;gies de r&eacute;insertion peuvent &ecirc;tre mises en pratique par toute une s&eacute;rie d'approches diff&eacute;rentes et dans les cadres les plus divers, y compris l'assistance en &eacute;tablissement ferm&eacute;, le travail de rue, la psychoth&eacute;rapie, les contacts avec les familles et le travail au sein d'une communaut&eacute;. Ces d&eacute;marches viennent s'ajouter &agrave; l'impact positif pour les individus qui accompagne le travail de pr&eacute;vention d&eacute;crit plus haut.<BR>

<P><B>2.1	Cadre</B><BR>

<P><B>Assistance en &eacute;tablissement ferm&eacute;</B><BR>

<P>De nombreux projets indiquent que les enfants ont besoin d'un refuge et d'un lieu de r&eacute;pit o&ugrave; ils ne sont plus confront&eacute;s aux dangers et aux pressions pour survivre qui sont leur lot quotidien lorsqu'ils travaillent dans la rue. De nombreux projets ont mis en place un lieu o&ugrave; les enfants peuvent se sentir en s&eacute;curit&eacute; et trouver de la nourriture, de la chaleur, de l'attention et des opportunit&eacute;s de s'occuper d'eux-m&ecirc;mes (Kenya, Br&eacute;sil). Une initiative de ce type peut contenir une dimension pr&eacute;ventive puisque les enfants dont la seule possibilit&eacute; pour survivre est de se vendre sur le march&eacute; du sexe peuvent y trouver refuge. L'acc&egrave;s aux soins de sant&eacute;, et peut-&ecirc;tre &eacute;galement &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation et &agrave; la formation, qui fait dans certains cas partie des possibilit&eacute;s offertes aux enfants, leur fournit non seulement une aide pratique mais aussi, et c'est essentiel, une aide pour leur rendre la dignit&eacute; et le respect qui leur ont &eacute;t&eacute; refus&eacute;s. Ce qui importe ici est davantage la mani&egrave;re dont les services sont offerts et fournis que la simple existence de ces possibilit&eacute;s. La plupart estiment que l'assistance en &eacute;tablissement ferm&eacute; est au mieux une r&eacute;ponse inad&eacute;quate puisque les enfants sont ainsi retir&eacute;s de la communaut&eacute; o&ugrave; ils devront pourtant retourner. Les centres ouverts de r&eacute;insertion, qui occupent une position interm&eacute;diaire entre l'assistance en &eacute;tablissement ferm&eacute; et l'ind&eacute;pendance, et o&ugrave; on fournit aux enfants les aptitudes et la force de supporter sans mal les pressions pour survivre dans un environnement dur, semblent &ecirc;tre une des r&eacute;ponses ad&eacute;quates (Br&eacute;sil).<BR>

<P>Les enfants peuvent refuser une place en &eacute;tablissement ferm&eacute; car ils associent ces lieux &agrave; des moyens r&eacute;pressifs de faire face au probl&egrave;me en pla&ccedil;ant les enfants dans des institutions, en utilisant le contr&ocirc;le et la discipline. Les enfants ne veulent pas &ecirc;tre contraints &agrave; accepter l'assistance; leur capacit&eacute; de faire des choix et d'utiliser les services d'une mani&egrave;re et &agrave; un rythme qu'ils peuvent affronter peut &ecirc;tre d'une importance primordiale pour rendre le service v&eacute;ritablement utile.<BR>

<P>&quot;... le projet est con&ccedil;u pour augmenter le degr&eacute; d'acceptation du service parmi les filles qui sont rejet&eacute;es par les organismes officiels&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.).<BR>

<P><B>Travail sur le terrain</B><BR>

<P>Ce type de d&eacute;marche comprend &agrave; la fois la prise de contact et le travail avec les enfants dans leur propre milieu, y compris dans les bars et les caf&eacute;s, dans les bas quartiers et les zones de prostitution. Dans ce cadre, les enfants ne se sentent pas sous pression mais ils peuvent obtenir des informations, rechercher des avis m&eacute;dicaux et l&eacute;gaux, discuter des syst&egrave;mes alternatifs pour subvenir &agrave; leurs besoins et recevoir de l'attention et des soins avant tout en tant qu'enfants (Slum Aid, Ouganda). En outre, une initiative de ce genre peut &eacute;galement inclure des contacts avec les familles. Parfois, ce contact permet de mettre les parents face &agrave; leurs responsabilit&eacute;s vis-&agrave;-vis de leurs enfants et de maintenir les liens familiaux de sorte que les enfants puissent finalement rentrer chez eux (UNDUGU, Kenya).<BR>

<P>Ce service peut &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute; par des centres d'accueil situ&eacute;s &agrave; proximit&eacute; des lieux o&ugrave; se trouvent les enfants et o&ugrave; ceux-ci peuvent se reposer, se laver, faire leur lessive et obtenir un certain espace et un certain degr&eacute; de s&eacute;curit&eacute; et d'intimit&eacute; (R.-U.). Bon nombre de ces &eacute;tablissements fonctionnent sur une base multidisciplinaire et proposent des services m&eacute;dicaux, scolaires, l&eacute;gaux et d'assistance socio-psychologique. Ils peuvent &eacute;galement remplir les fonctions d'un centre de distribution de pr&eacute;servatifs et de conseil en mati&egrave;re de contraception, aidant ainsi les enfants &agrave; se prot&eacute;ger des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et &agrave; &eacute;viter les grossesses pr&eacute;coces. Les interactions et la collaboration avec les autres services au sein de la communaut&eacute; sont &eacute;galement des &eacute;l&eacute;ments-cl&eacute;s pour am&eacute;liorer l'acc&egrave;s aux services appropri&eacute;s. Pour beaucoup d'enfants, il y a une lente &eacute;volution, dont le point de d&eacute;part est la confiance et le respect initiaux &eacute;tablis gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'apport d'un soutien pratique, dans le type et la qualit&eacute; des services qu'ils demandent et qui leur permettent de faire face aux souffrances li&eacute;es &agrave; leurs exp&eacute;riences et &agrave; leur nouvelle opinion d'eux-m&ecirc;mes (Br&eacute;sil).<BR>

<P>Toutefois, certains ont avanc&eacute; que les services qui apportent un soutien aux enfants peuvent &eacute;galement prolonger la p&eacute;riode o&ugrave; ils demeurent dans des situations d'exploitation. Pour certaines organisations, trouver le juste &eacute;quilibre entre cette &quot;compassion d&eacute;plac&eacute;e&quot; et la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de fournir un refuge d'urgence pour les cas o&ugrave; c'est une question de survie est un dilemme critique.<BR>

<P>&quot;Un centre peut facilement prolonger la p&eacute;riode que l'enfant passe dans la rue en att&eacute;nuant les terribles r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de cette situation... <U>D'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, nous avons vu mourir pr&egrave;s de 200 filles au cours des 5 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es</U>&quot; (The House, Afrique du Sud).<BR>

<P><B>Le travail au sein des communaut&eacute;s</B><BR>

<P>Le travail au sein d'une communaut&eacute; peut prendre des formes tr&egrave;s vari&eacute;es. Inciter les communaut&eacute;s &agrave; d&eacute;velopper et &agrave; maintenir un r&eacute;seau de relations qui apportent un soutien aux enfants victimes de l'exploitation sexuelle s'av&egrave;re &ecirc;tre une &eacute;tape critique mais stimulante dans une r&eacute;insertion r&eacute;ussie des enfants. Le fait qu'ils soient accept&eacute;s et estim&eacute;s par la communaut&eacute; est une force puissante qui permet aux enfants de r&eacute;&eacute;valuer l'image qu'ils ont d'eux-m&ecirc;mes. Ceci peut &ecirc;tre un &eacute;l&eacute;ment crucial pour changer les attitudes de la famille afin de permettre aux enfants de retourner chez eux; il renforce en outre leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; se prot&eacute;ger. La mise en place d'activit&eacute;s fournissant des sources alternatives de revenus, la formation au commerce, l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; des possibilit&eacute;s de financement ou de cr&eacute;dit au sein du syst&egrave;me sont d'autres m&eacute;thodes pour essayer de d&eacute;velopper de meilleures perspectives &agrave; long terme pour ces enfants exploit&eacute;s et leurs familles.<BR>

<P><B>2.2	Approche et techniques de r&eacute;insertion psychosociale</B><BR>

<P>Dans les &eacute;tudes de cas, toutes les organisations ont indiqu&eacute; que les besoins des enfants n'&eacute;taient pas simplement d'ordre pratique. Elles ont pu constater directement les souffrances que connaissaient les enfants et le traumatisme &eacute;motionnel et psychologique qu'ils subissent. Une grande partie des organisations ont &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; confront&eacute;es &agrave; des difficult&eacute;s sur le plan des ressources ou des comp&eacute;tences n&eacute;cessaires pour r&eacute;pondre compl&egrave;tement &agrave; ces besoins des enfants. Toutefois, elles s'efforcent d'offrir aux enfants un service qui puisse au moins satisfaire certains de leurs besoins psychosociaux. Pour cela, elles doivent &eacute;valuer:<BR>

<P>qui est chaque enfant en particulier en examinant ses exp&eacute;riences personnelles et ses r&eacute;ponses &agrave; ces exp&eacute;riences,<BR>
les autres dans leur contexte social; les individus, les groupes, les syst&egrave;mes qui ont influenc&eacute; de mani&egrave;re cruciale les exp&eacute;riences de l'enfant, qu'elles soient positives ou n&eacute;gatives,<BR>
et comment ces facteurs interagissent.<BR>

<P>Les exp&eacute;riences traumatisantes ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre isol&eacute;es de leur contexte soci&eacute;tal et quel que soit le traitement ou la th&eacute;rapie propos&eacute;e, il faut tenir compte pleinement des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes sociaux qui sont la r&eacute;alit&eacute; de l'enfant. Les programmes qui n&eacute;gligent de proc&eacute;der de cette mani&egrave;re risquent de ne traiter l'enfant que comme un individu dysfonctionnel. Cette approche plus large doit &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;e &agrave; la fois pour &eacute;valuer les exp&eacute;riences pass&eacute;es de l'enfant et ses options pour l'avenir. Elle est essentielle si on veut comprendre comment le v&eacute;cu de l'enfant a contribu&eacute; &agrave; faire na&icirc;tre une pathologie pr&eacute;sente et si on veut &eacute;tablir des m&eacute;canismes et des ressources pour y faire face. En se tournant vers l'avenir, ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments peuvent &ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;s et int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans les programmes d'intervention appropri&eacute;s pour concourir &agrave; aider chaque enfant &agrave; parvenir &agrave; une maturit&eacute; accrue et saine.<BR>

<P><B>2.3	Techniques</B><BR>

<P>Dans toutes ces circonstances, les mod&egrave;les d'action consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme les plus efficaces s'attachent &agrave; trouver les meilleurs moyens de d&eacute;velopper chez l'enfant le sens de sa propre valeur. Ils sont form&eacute;s de trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments de base: enseigner, soigner et apporter de l'attention (Philippines). Ces moyens doivent permettre &agrave; l'enfant de faire face aux &eacute;l&eacute;ments dysfonctionnels de sa vie. Il est fr&eacute;quemment fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; l'importance primordiale que rev&ecirc;t le fait d'&eacute;couter les enfants, de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ce qu'ils disent au sujet de leurs propres exp&eacute;riences ainsi que des services et moyens qui leur sont n&eacute;cessaires.<BR>

<P>&quot;... Une approche suffisamment honn&ecirc;te pour respecter et accorder de la valeur aux exp&eacute;riences et opinions des jeunes femmes qui utilisent les services du projet induit &eacute;galement la participation de ces derni&egrave;res dans le service&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.).<BR>

<P>Ces d&eacute;marches peuvent trouver leur place dans des contextes th&eacute;rapeutiques ou m&eacute;dicaux et fournir une psychoth&eacute;rapie intensive, individuelle et de long terme mais de tels projets ne sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas tr&egrave;s r&eacute;pandus. Leur co&ucirc;t &eacute;lev&eacute; et le fait qu'ils ne concernent qu'un tr&egrave;s petit nombre d'enfants par rapport &agrave; l'&eacute;tendue du probl&egrave;me limite probablement les possibilit&eacute;s de les implanter dans une grande partie des pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement.<BR>

<P>&quot;L'organisation d'une th&eacute;rapie de groupe am&eacute;liore l'efficacit&eacute; du traitement, en particulier dans l'adolescence et pour des enfants ayant &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s le m&ecirc;me &acirc;ge.&quot; (Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexually Abused and Prostituted Children, Philippines).<BR>

<P>Certains travaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s sur l'application de mod&egrave;les de ce type &agrave; d'autres cadres, ou du moins sur l'utilisation des enseignements tir&eacute;s de ces syst&egrave;mes, mais la mise en place, le caract&egrave;re ad&eacute;quat, les possibilit&eacute;s d'adaptation et de transposition de ces travaux entre les diff&eacute;rentes cultures sont encore test&eacute;s actuellement (Radda Barnen, Su&egrave;de et Philippines). L'assistance socio-psychologique, telle qu'elle existe dans une grande partie des programmes, aide les enfants &agrave; consid&eacute;rer leurs exp&eacute;riences comme des abus dont ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; les victimes ou les rescap&eacute;s et &agrave; faire dispara&icirc;tre leur sentiment de culpabilit&eacute; ou leur impression d'&ecirc;tre des parias qui corrompent les autres; elle les &quot;lib&egrave;re de leur honte&quot;.<BR>

<P>&quot;... Je ne peux que me r&eacute;jouir et continuer &agrave; adresser des remerciements et &agrave; &ecirc;tre reconnaissante envers ceux qui m'ont aid&eacute;e &agrave; m'&eacute;chapper de ma triste existence dans la clandestinit&eacute; et poursuivre courageusement ma route vers un avenir radieux et d&eacute;gag&eacute;...&quot; (Taiwan).<BR>

<P>Une fois encore, de tels messages positifs et d'affirmation de soi peuvent &ecirc;tre inh&eacute;rents aux interactions quotidiennes entre les responsables et les enfants sans &ecirc;tre n&eacute;cessairement explicites mais il est extr&ecirc;mement important pour les enfants d'&ecirc;tre clairement rassur&eacute;s &agrave; ce sujet et ils peuvent avoir besoin d'entendre ces messages directement.<BR>

<P>Ces enfants ont souvent &eacute;t&eacute; catalogu&eacute;s par une grande partie de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et des autorit&eacute;s comme de &quot;vulgaires prostitu&eacute;es&quot;, des individus immoraux, des d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s. Ils ont infiniment besoin d'&ecirc;tre vus et consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des enfants ou des jeunes qui ont des droits, qui m&eacute;ritent d'&ecirc;tre soutenus et de recevoir de l'attention. Il est essentiel de faire preuve de d&eacute;licatesse en ce qui concerne les termes utilis&eacute;s et le jargon ou les expressions qui sont int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans la culture du programme. Les termes employ&eacute;s doivent &ecirc;tre compris des enfants mais le fait d'utiliser la terminologie de la rue peut renforcer la mauvaise image qu'ils ont d'eux-m&ecirc;mes ou leur haine de leur propre personne.<BR>

<P>L'assistance socio-psychologique est &eacute;galement utilis&eacute;e pour explorer avec les jeunes les diff&eacute;rents choix et options qui s'offrent &agrave; eux, leur permettant de faire leurs choix en connaissance de cause (R.-U.). Pour que cette initiative soit r&eacute;ussie, elle doit se d&eacute;rouler au rythme dict&eacute; par l'enfant. Les informations peuvent &ecirc;tre per&ccedil;ues comme porteuses de valeurs; elles peuvent &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es d'une mani&egrave;re telle que l'enfant se sente redevable vis-&agrave;-vis du conseiller socio-psychologique. Il arrive alors qu'il essaye de deviner les &quot;bonnes r&eacute;ponses&quot; plut&ocirc;t que de chercher &agrave; faire les bons choix pour lui-m&ecirc;me. Les d&eacute;cisions prises dans de telles circonstances sont moins susceptibles de d&eacute;boucher sur du concret.<BR>

<P>Certains projets qui travaillent avec des enfants issus de minorit&eacute;s ethniques ont utilis&eacute; des mod&egrave;les d'&eacute;mulation positifs, des repr&eacute;sentations th&eacute;&acirc;trales, etc. pour modifier certains des st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes n&eacute;gatifs adopt&eacute;s par les enfants (Br&eacute;sil). La mobilisation des enfants et le fait de leur donner les moyens de jouer un r&ocirc;le d'initiateurs d'un changement, d'acteurs, de d&eacute;fenseurs, d'organisateurs au sein de la communaut&eacute; et de participants &agrave; un r&eacute;seau de soutien pour les autres, tout cela peut favoriser la correction des images n&eacute;gatives dont beaucoup ont souffert pendant des ann&eacute;es. Ces aptitudes peuvent &ecirc;tre transf&eacute;rables &agrave; de nombreuses situations diff&eacute;rentes, fournissant &agrave; l'enfant des ressources suppl&eacute;mentaires. Mais cette exp&eacute;rience qui consiste pour les enfants &agrave; se rendre utile, &agrave; exercer un certain pouvoir, &agrave; jouir d'une certaine reconnaissance, est en elle-m&ecirc;me d'une &eacute;norme importance pour r&eacute;orienter les enfants, pour d&eacute;buter le processus de r&eacute;&eacute;valuation d'eux-m&ecirc;mes, de leur position dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et de leurs forces (Br&eacute;sil). L'utilisation de l'art, du th&eacute;&acirc;tre et de la musique comme canaux pour exprimer les exp&eacute;riences et les sentiments qui y sont associ&eacute;s est &eacute;galement consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme une technique de valeur qui permet aux enfants de faire face &agrave; leurs souffrances d'une mani&egrave;re moins directe (Chili). Cette technique peut op&eacute;rer &agrave; diff&eacute;rents niveaux, depuis une exp&eacute;rience relativement superficielle mais amusante et sans danger jusqu'&agrave; une profonde catharsis porteuse de changements pour la vie de l'enfant, et l'utilisation de ces moyens d'expression permet aux enfants de formuler leurs pens&eacute;es, de gu&eacute;rir leurs blessures et de se d&eacute;couvrir eux-m&ecirc;mes.<BR>

<P>Le travail avec des enfants victimes d'abus est une t&acirc;che exigeante et difficile, charg&eacute;e de risques de rejet pour les deux parties. Il est possible de r&eacute;duire certains de ces risques en laissant &agrave; l'enfant une certaine ambivalence au sujet de l'abandon des liens, des dangers et des aventures qui ont pu faire partie de son v&eacute;cu. Ils ont une longue exp&eacute;rience derri&egrave;re eux mais n'ont pourtant pas eu l'occasion de grandir et d'apprendre par des &eacute;tapes de d&eacute;veloppement successives. Les jeunes qui ont diminu&eacute; leur souffrance en se droguant peuvent &eacute;prouver des difficult&eacute;s tant physiques qu'&eacute;motionnelles &agrave; arr&ecirc;ter et &agrave; &ecirc;tre confront&eacute;s &agrave; leur pass&eacute; une fois disparu l'&eacute;cran de protection que formait la drogue. Il faut &ecirc;tre conscient que ces forces exercent une grande influence sur l'enfant et s'opposent aux efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s pour l'aider &agrave; changer et &agrave; adopter de nouvelles activit&eacute;s et attitudes. Cela signifie qu'il faut prendre le temps n&eacute;cessaire, travailler &agrave; un rythme qui convienne &agrave; l'enfant.<BR>

<P>&quot;Ces enfants grandissent par phases. Chaque fois qu'elle fait un effort, elle apprend. Avec votre aide, elle peut apprendre par phases progressives, &agrave; condition qu'on la guide pour qu'elle ne voie pas la fin d'un cycle d'apprentissage particulier comme un &eacute;chec.&quot; (Afrique du Sud).<BR>

<P>Les facteurs qui poussent les gens &agrave; se lancer dans ce domaine de travail peuvent &ecirc;tre extr&ecirc;mement variables mais la s&eacute;lection et la formation rev&ecirc;tent une importance vitale puisqu'elles permettent &agrave; des programmes flexibles et dynamiques de se d&eacute;velopper et d'apporter des r&eacute;ponses &agrave; des manifestations et niveaux de besoin changeants (Br&eacute;sil). L'engagement et la conviction inh&eacute;rente de la valeur intrins&egrave;que et des droits des enfants ont une importance cruciale. Les valeurs sont d'ordre humaniste, spirituel, politique.<BR>

<P>&quot;Nos strat&eacute;gies et nos approches peuvent &ecirc;tres semblables &agrave; celles des autres mais ce qui nous rassemble pour fournir de l'aide et des soins &agrave; ces enfants est la pri&egrave;re. Ce travail peut &ecirc;tre vous et moi contre le monde&quot; (Kalungan, Philippines).<BR>

<P>Certains projets mentionnent l'impact positif que le fait de trouver une vocation peut avoir sur les enfants. Cette vocation peut &ecirc;tre le service de Dieu, l'aide aux autres victimes ou la volont&eacute; de changer la soci&eacute;t&eacute;; elle ne refl&egrave;te pas n&eacute;cessairement les valeurs de l'&eacute;quipe des travailleurs sociaux et des personnes qui financent ou soutiennent le programme.<BR>

<P><B>VII.	IMPACT</B><BR>

<P>M&ecirc;me si les &eacute;tudes de cas contenaient des sections sp&eacute;cifiques faisant r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; l'impact et &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation des programmes, de nombreux groupes ont &eacute;prouv&eacute; des difficult&eacute;s &agrave; pr&eacute;ciser ce qu'&eacute;tait &agrave; leurs yeux un aboutissement r&eacute;ussi et ont eu le plus grand mal &agrave; formuler clairement ou &agrave; &eacute;valuer les cons&eacute;quences de leurs activit&eacute;s. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne est peut-&ecirc;tre li&eacute; &agrave; la difficult&eacute; d'isoler l'impact sp&eacute;cifique de leur action, qui n'est probablement qu'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment parmi d'autres au sein d'un large programme de pr&eacute;vention. Parfois, le probl&egrave;me semble issu d'un suivi limit&eacute; des enfants. En effet, les organisations sont alors dans l'incapacit&eacute; de d&eacute;terminer les cons&eacute;quences &agrave; long terme sur les enfants avec qui ils travaillent. Bon nombre de projets sont relativement nouveaux et ne disposent donc que d'exp&eacute;riences assez r&eacute;centes pour &eacute;valuer et d&eacute;terminer les r&eacute;sultats de leur travail. Certains projets &eacute;tablissent des crit&egrave;res tr&egrave;s nets selon lesquels l'enfant ou le jeune doit sortir compl&egrave;tement du commerce du sexe et o&ugrave; toute prolongation de sa situation est vue comme un &eacute;chec, ind&eacute;pendamment d'autres changements ayant pu survenir pour le jeune. Ils s'inqui&egrave;tent du fait que certains de leurs efforts fournissent &agrave; l'enfant des aptitudes pour se rendre plus attirant ou plus utile aux exploiteurs potentiels.<BR>

<P>D'autres organisations s'attachent aux r&eacute;sultats &agrave; grande &eacute;chelle, qui ont un impact sur des communaut&eacute;s enti&egrave;res. L'enfant qui a &eacute;t&eacute; victime d'abus devient un rescap&eacute; qui s'engage pour sa communaut&eacute; et peut continuer &agrave; jouer un r&ocirc;le essentiel dans le changement des attitudes et dans la mise en place d'un climat dans lequel les autres enfants peuvent &ecirc;tre prot&eacute;g&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re ad&eacute;quate. Dans d'autres programmes encore, une diminution du nombre de personnes qui quittent le village pour s'installer en ville est vue comme l'indicateur d'un r&eacute;sultat positif. Le nombre d'enfants scolaris&eacute;s, qui suivent un enseignement alternatif ou participent &agrave; un programme de formation professionnelle fait &eacute;galement partie des &eacute;l&eacute;ments cit&eacute;s. Certaines organisations parlent d'une mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale d'une prise de conscience des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de l'exploitation sexuelle et d'une am&eacute;lioration de la protection.<BR>

<P>&quot;... Un autre indicateur qualitatif est l'effet du travail du CPCR en ce qui concerne le renforcement des potentiels de la famille et l'organisation de la communaut&eacute; en village(s) Akha et au niveau national, (c'est) la reconnaissance par les professionnels de diff&eacute;rentes disciplines de l'utilit&eacute; de faire appel &agrave; des approches multidisciplinaires du probl&egrave;me des abus d'enfants ainsi que la r&eacute;forme de la structure l&eacute;gale afin d'assurer la protection des droits des enfants&quot; (Center for the Protection of Children's Rights, Tha&iuml;lande).<BR>

<P>Ces facteurs sont plus difficiles &agrave; quantifier mais sont tr&egrave;s significatifs.<BR>

<P>Les discussions avec les responsables des projets se poursuivent afin de s'assurer que les opinions des enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes au sujet des r&eacute;sultats et de l'impact soient prises en compte dans les &eacute;valuations. Ces informations feront partie du rapport final.<BR>

<P>L'importance d'une d&eacute;finition de crit&egrave;res et d'indicateurs pour l'am&eacute;lioration et le d&eacute;veloppement des programmes semble souvent mieux accept&eacute;e en th&eacute;orie que dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute;. L'&eacute;tablissement de certains &eacute;l&eacute;ments convenus comme des indications utiles de la r&eacute;alisation des objectifs initiaux serait une d&eacute;marche pr&eacute;cieuse susceptible de faciliter une approche &eacute;volutive fond&eacute;e sur des cons&eacute;quences r&eacute;elles. Ceci ne minimise en rien les difficult&eacute;s inh&eacute;rentes au choix d'indicateurs mesurables en rapport avec les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;els, les activit&eacute;s et les r&eacute;sultats souhait&eacute;s.<BR>

<P><B>VIII.	REMARQUES DE CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>Dans le rapport final, il sera n&eacute;cessaire de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une nouvelle &eacute;valuation du mat&eacute;riel, tant factuel que subjectif, fourni par les &eacute;tudes de cas afin de tenter d'&eacute;tablir, &agrave; partir des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de ce travail actuel avec les enfants, certaines formulations d'ordre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pour des interventions de pr&eacute;vention et de r&eacute;insertion r&eacute;ussies ainsi que des indicateurs mesurables pour les r&eacute;sultats obtenus. Pour l'instant, on ne peut proposer que de larges conclusions:<BR>

<P>On ne peut s'attaquer &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me de mani&egrave;re efficace que si les enfants, leurs droits et leurs potentiels sont per&ccedil;us comme rev&ecirc;tant une importance cruciale et occupant une position centrale pour le d&eacute;veloppement futur et le bien-&ecirc;tre national. La mise en place d'un syst&egrave;me v&eacute;ritablement centr&eacute; sur l'enfant, dans lequel toutes les politiques sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es en fonction notamment de leur impact sur le bien-&ecirc;tre des enfants, est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme &eacute;tant peut-&ecirc;tre le seul moyen de s'attaquer &agrave; ces abus de fa&ccedil;on radicale.<BR>

<P>&quot; ... Le bien-&ecirc;tre des enfants n'est pas de la charit&eacute; et le d&eacute;veloppement des enfants n'est pas non plus une simple question technique... Les enfants devraient plut&ocirc;t &ecirc;tre la base du d&eacute;veloppement national. Les enfants sont les v&eacute;ritables repr&eacute;sentants de l'avenir. La fa&ccedil;on dont les enfants sont trait&eacute;s aujourd'hui est l'&eacute;talon qui nous permet de mesurer quelle sera demain la situation du pays... &quot; (Child Workers In Nepal, N&eacute;pal).<BR>

<P>Pour que le travail th&eacute;rapeutique soit accept&eacute;, soutenu et efficace, une premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape essentielle est de faire le n&eacute;cessaire pour que la population ait conscience de ce probl&egrave;me, du nombre d'enfants bless&eacute;s et traumatis&eacute;s par leurs exp&eacute;riences. Cette initiative doit modifier l'opinion publique en pr&eacute;sentant exactement les victimes comme des enfants dont on abuse;<BR>
&quot;(Il est) n&eacute;cessaire d'insister pour que ce probl&egrave;me soit vu non comme de la &quot;prostitution&quot; mais comme des abus d'enfants et de jeunes par l'exploitation sexuelle... La mission d'&eacute;duquer et de favoriser une prise de conscience est urgente et d'une importance primordiale&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.).<BR>

<P>Une information au sujet de l'ampleur, de la nature des abus et des caract&eacute;ristiques des responsables de ces abus peut &ecirc;tre d'une importance cruciale pour induire une prise de conscience nationale ou locale au lieu de permettre aux tabous ou &agrave; la marginalisation des victimes ou des coupables de minimiser ou de masquer le probl&egrave;me.<BR>

<P>Il existe plusieurs voies pour aboutir &agrave; cet objectif mais la coordination et la coh&eacute;rence sont des conditions indispensables pour qu'une campagne soit efficace.<BR>

<P>Le cadre l&eacute;gal peut &agrave; la fois prot&eacute;ger et punir. Les lois &eacute;tablies pour favoriser le bien-&ecirc;tre des enfants et les prot&eacute;ger des abus doivent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es pour r&eacute;pondre aux besoins des enfants et les sanctions criminelles contre ceux qui se rendent coupables des abus doivent &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es. Cela contribuerait &eacute;galement grandement &agrave; r&eacute;tablir le soutien &agrave; l'enfant et le sentiment d'intol&eacute;rance vis-&agrave;-vis des abus dont il/elle a &eacute;t&eacute; victime. Un syst&egrave;me qui introduit le concept de consentement comme une d&eacute;fense contre des charges de d&eacute;lits sexuels impliquant des enfants refuse aux enfants la protection qui leur est due, est complice des coupables et va &agrave; l'encontre de toute logique.<BR>

<P>Les mod&egrave;les de participation, qui font jouer aux enfants, &agrave; leurs familles et &agrave; leurs communaut&eacute;s un r&ocirc;le-cl&eacute; dans le processus de d&eacute;cision des strat&eacute;gies et de la teneur des programmes, sont probablement plus efficaces et plus rentables. Pour &ecirc;tre efficaces, les strat&eacute;gies d'intervention doivent &ecirc;tre capables de r&eacute;agir et de refl&eacute;ter ce que disent les enfants et les jeunes. Ces derniers ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre des consommateurs passifs des services; leur participation est essentielle. La capacit&eacute; d'&eacute;couter v&eacute;ritablement et de respecter les enfants, les familles et les dirigeants des communaut&eacute;s ainsi que la conviction qu'ils ont des opinions, une sagesse, des id&eacute;es et des aptitudes qui peuvent fournir des informations, une direction et une base d'&eacute;valuation pour les programmes, rev&ecirc;tent une importance primordiale. L'utilisation et le d&eacute;veloppement des forces et des ressources disponibles au sein de la communaut&eacute; aide &agrave; renforcer tout type d'impact positif.<BR>

<P>Les partenariats entre les groupes locaux, nationaux et internationaux, entre les diff&eacute;rentes disciplines professionnelles, avec les m&eacute;dias et les repr&eacute;sentants des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques sont des moyens de parvenir &agrave; un changement durable de l'environnement macrosocial et de d&eacute;velopper des plans locaux int&eacute;gr&eacute;s pour une action efficace. Les organisations qui travaillent de mani&egrave;re isol&eacute;e voient leur sph&egrave;re d'influence et de capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;aliser des changements fortement r&eacute;duite, m&ecirc;me si, avec de la t&eacute;nacit&eacute; et de la d&eacute;termination, m&ecirc;me les petites organisations &quot;peuvent avoir un impact sur la conscience collective d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; et sur sa fa&ccedil;on de penser&quot; (The House, Afrique du Sud).<BR>

<P>Certains des programmes les plus efficaces travaillent dans une perspective multidisciplinaire. Les organismes et les professionnels de diff&eacute;rents domaines peuvent s'associer pour fournir la n&eacute;cessaire palette de services d'une fa&ccedil;on cordonn&eacute;e et, par le partage de leur conception ou approche particuli&egrave;re, avoir ainsi un impact positif au-del&agrave; des limites traditionnelles, am&eacute;liorer les services et modifier la compr&eacute;hension et les jugements de valeur qui peuvent avoir entrav&eacute; l'acc&egrave;s aux services.<BR>

<P>&quot;Le partage des connaissances acquises ... est une composante primordiale pour une intervention r&eacute;ussie.&quot; (Barnardos, R.-U.)<BR>

<P>Cette approche encourage &eacute;galement ceux qui travaillent avec les enfants &agrave; les consid&eacute;rer comme des individus complets et &agrave; essayer de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; leurs besoins de mani&egrave;re holistique.<BR>

<P>&quot;... Afin de prot&eacute;ger les droits des enfants de mani&egrave;re holistique, il nous faut employer des approches tr&egrave;s larges et multidisciplinaires qui associent tous les aspects de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;...&quot;<BR>

<P> Il faut du temps et des ressources pour r&eacute;pondre aux besoins psychosociaux des enfants victimes d'abus mais ceux-ci sont en droit d'attendre des services qu'ils tiennent compte de toutes les cons&eacute;quences des abus auxquels ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis. Certains organismes s'attachent &agrave; d&eacute;velopper une assistance de qualit&eacute; pour un nombre d'enfants plus r&eacute;duit mais, en proc&eacute;dant ainsi, ils d&eacute;couvrent des voies pour augmenter les potentialit&eacute;s et favoriser une reproduction r&eacute;ussie de l'exp&eacute;rience.<BR>

<P>&quot;Le CPCR ... s'attache plut&ocirc;t &agrave; aider un nombre d'enfants qui ne cesse de diminuer chaque ann&eacute;e mais en fournissant une assistance holistique dans leur propre int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. ... Simultan&eacute;ment, nous avons pour objectif de d&eacute;velopper les capacit&eacute;s d'autres organisations, gouvernementales et non gouvernementales, &agrave; intervenir dans ce probl&egrave;me.&quot; (Center for the Protection of Children's Rights, Tha&iuml;lande).<BR>

<P>Les efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s pour d&eacute;velopper des approches th&eacute;rapeutiques adapt&eacute;es &agrave; diff&eacute;rents cadres culturels et sociaux, pour trouver des combinaisons d'approches efficaces et pour trouver des fonds et des soutiens suppl&eacute;mentaires sont n&eacute;cessaires pour am&eacute;liorer la qualit&eacute; des programmes.<BR>

<P>Il ne serait pas r&eacute;aliste de croire qu'il est possible d'&eacute;tablir un sch&eacute;ma directeur absolu ou standard comprenant des strat&eacute;gies de r&eacute;ponse adapt&eacute;es quels que soient les param&egrave;tres sociaux et culturels. Tous les projets auront toujours besoin de s'adapter et d'&eacute;voluer au sein des communaut&eacute;s o&ugrave; ils sont mis en place, utilisant les forces et les ressources des adultes et des enfants.<BR>

<P>Etant donn&eacute; que les enfants soumis &agrave; un environnement comparable ou &agrave; des pressions familiales ne deviennent pas tous des victimes, l'identification et l'application de concepts de r&eacute;silience permettant de d&eacute;velopper des strat&eacute;gies de protection pour les individus et d'am&eacute;liorer les perspectives de r&eacute;insertion augmentent l'efficacit&eacute; des programmes.<BR>

<P>Il y a lieu d'esp&eacute;rer que le fait de prendre connaissance des explications d'autres personnes confront&eacute;es &agrave; des probl&egrave;mes semblables et qui mettent en lumi&egrave;re quelques indications de progr&egrave;s fasse na&icirc;tre un sentiment de solidarit&eacute;, de n'&ecirc;tre pas seul &agrave; lutter, m&ecirc;me si ces autres personnes travaillent dans des domaines tr&egrave;s divers, &agrave; condition que leur engagement pour am&eacute;liorer la vie des enfants, pour travailler avec et pour les enfants eux-m&ecirc;mes reste in&eacute;branlable.<BR>

<P>Ces id&eacute;es peuvent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es par d'autres travailleurs de terrain et les emp&ecirc;cher de commettre certaines erreurs, renforcer leur position de n&eacute;gociation et les aider &agrave; planifier, &agrave; mettre en place et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper des programmes susceptibles de fournir une assistance efficace aux enfants victimes d'abus et soumis &agrave; la n&eacute;gation de leurs droits les plus fondamentaux. Il s'agit de l'expression de la sagesse et des exp&eacute;riences partag&eacute;es de certaines personnes qui travaillent jour apr&egrave;s jour avec les enfants qui sont victimes d'abus, exploit&eacute;s et bl&acirc;m&eacute;s de cette situation. Ces voix peuvent informer, &eacute;duquer, et contribuer &agrave; formuler et &agrave; justifier l'appel pressant &agrave; la mise en place de strat&eacute;gies locales, nationales et internationales pour les programmes d'assistance aux enfants et les politiques de mobilisation sociale qui vont r&eacute;pondre aux besoins de ces enfants.<BR>

<P><H2>Tourisme et prostitution des enfants</H2><BR>
<B>Introduction</B><BR>

<P>Les organisations internationales de tourisme ont &eacute;t&eacute; unanimes &agrave; condamner l utilisation du tourisme dans le but d une exploitation sexuelle d enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales. L Organisation Mondiale du Tourisme parle d une violation de la Convention relative aux Droits de l Enfant et appelle les pays pourvoyeurs de touristes comme les pays d accueil &agrave; prendre des mesures juridiques s&eacute;v&egrave;res (22 Octobre 1995). La F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Universelle des Associations d Agents de Voyages, une des premi&egrave;res organisations &agrave; avoir condamn&eacute; la prostitution des enfants, a &eacute;tabli la Charte L Enfant et l Agent de Voyages qui a &eacute;t&eacute; soumise &agrave; ses adh&eacute;rents nationaux pour signature, et s engage &agrave; offrir de l assistance &agrave; toutes les organisations, campagnes et associations caritatives pr&eacute;occup&eacute;es du bien-&ecirc;tre des enfants victimes du tourisme sexuel afin que ces enfants retrouvent dignit&eacute;, sant&eacute; physique et mentale.<BR>

<P>Il est important que le Congr&egrave;s de Su&egrave;de reconnaisse la pr&eacute;occupation croissante des organisations du tourisme quant &agrave; la situation des enfants prostitu&eacute;s et aux probl&egrave;mes li&eacute;s au tourisme sexuel. Selon les estimations actuelles, le nombre d enfants entrant chaque ann&eacute;e dans le march&eacute; de l exploitation sexuelle s &eacute;l&egrave;verait &agrave; plus d un million. Aujourd hui l industrie touristique elle-m&ecirc;me accorde une large place aux d&eacute;bats autour de ce probl&egrave;me. On esp&egrave;re que ce Congr&egrave;s pourra aboutir &agrave; un nouveau consensus sur la question de savoir comment l industrie du tourisme peut aider la communaut&eacute; internationale &agrave; &eacute;radiquer cette forme moderne d esclavage.<BR>

<P>Le pr&eacute;sent expos&eacute; fournit un aper&ccedil;u historique sur le r&ocirc;le de l industrie du tourisme dans la lutte contre ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne et d&eacute;crit certaines des actions entreprises. De nombreuses personnes ont contribu&eacute; &agrave; la pr&eacute;paration de ce document: en particulier des repr&eacute;sentants officiels de l Organisation Mondiale du Tourisme (OMT), la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Universelle des Associations d Agents de Voyages (FUAAV), l Association du Transport A&eacute;rien International (IATA) et l Union internationale des travailleurs de l alimentation, de l agriculture, de l h&ocirc;tellerie-restauration, du tabac et des branches connexes (UITA) nous ont apport&eacute; leur aide pr&eacute;cieuse.<BR>

<P><B>I.	TOURISME</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	L exp&eacute;rience touristique</B><BR>

<P>Dans la plupart des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s actuelles, voyager fait partie de la vie de tous les jours. Traverser une fronti&egrave;re n a plus rien de magique si bien que voyager dans son pays ou voyager &agrave; l &eacute;tranger se confondent petit &agrave; petit dans les esprits. Il y a pourtant une r&eacute;alit&eacute; fondamentale qui ne changera pas pour autant: Voyager dans un pays &eacute;tranger n est pas une action anodine. C est pourquoi tout visiteur international devra, lorsqu il se rend dans un pays autre que le sien, &ecirc;tre sensible aux diff&eacute;rences culturelles, ethniques, sociales, &eacute;conomiques ou religieuses qui peuvent exister entre le pays en question et son pays d origine. Aussi doit-il respecter les valeurs du pays d accueil.<BR>

<P>Ceci est particuli&egrave;rement vrai pour les moeurs sexuelles. Un comportement acceptable dans un pays (par exemple exhibition d affection ou de nudit&eacute; en public) peut &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme tout &agrave; fait inacceptable voire ill&eacute;gal dans un autre pays. Les moeurs sexuelles n&eacute;cessitent une sensibilit&eacute; particuli&egrave;re de la part des touristes.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>D un point de vue historique, le voyage et la prostitution ont souvent &eacute;t&eacute; associ&eacute;s. Ainsi les premi&egrave;res destinations touristiques &eacute;taient les lieux saints ou les centres d &eacute;changes commerciaux et l on retrouve encore aujourd hui, dans les cit&eacute;s anciennes telles Eph&egrave;se, Babylone et Pomp&eacute;i les quartiers de prostitution clairement visibles et &eacute;tonnamment grands. Historiquement les grands voyageurs, en particuliers les marins et les militaires ont contribu&eacute; &agrave; cr&eacute;er des lieux de prostitution dans les villes dans lesquelles ils se rendaient.<BR>

<P>Aujourd hui le nombre de touristes augmente r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement et de mani&egrave;re spectaculaire. La majorit&eacute; de ces voyageurs modernes ne cherche pas d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;ment le sexe pendant leurs voyages. Il n en reste pas moins que le nombre de ceux qui pratiquent des rapports sexuels &agrave; caract&egrave;re commercial est consid&eacute;rable notamment dans les pays o&ugrave; ce type de service est largement disponible.<BR>

<P>Nombreuses sont les raisons - tant psychologiques que sociales et culturelles - avanc&eacute;es pour chercher &agrave; expliquer ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne :<BR>

<P>  Lorsqu un touriste est loin de chez lui il se retrouve dans un climat d anonymat qui le d&eacute;gage des contraintes habituelles qui d&eacute;terminent le comportement dans son pays d origine. Ainsi un homme qui n aurait jamais envisag&eacute; de se rendre dans un bordel dans sa ville de r&eacute;sidence pourra tr&egrave;s bien le faire dans un pays &eacute;tranger o&ugrave; il y a peu de chances d &ecirc;tre reconnu. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne a pu &ecirc;tre observ&eacute; dans de nombreux pays. Selon un proverbe japonais le voyageur ne conna&icirc;t point de honte. Ce qui correspond &agrave; un dicton connu dans certaines r&eacute;gion d Europe: Plus je m &eacute;loigne de chez moi et plus j oublie la morale.<BR>

<P> Dans les destinations touristiques exotiques le visiteur ne comprend g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement ni la langue du pays ni les nuances culturelles de sa soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Cette situation le conduit &agrave; se baser sur des pr&eacute;somptions qui sont vraisemblablement fausses mais qui lui permettent de justifier apr&egrave;s coup son nouveau comportement. Il est par exemple tr&egrave;s courant parmi les touristes qui exploitent sexuellement des enfants de justifier leur comportement en pr&eacute;tendant que les rapports sexuels avec des enfants sont plus acceptables dans cette culture et que les gens de ce pays n ont pas les m&ecirc;mes complexes que nous en mati&egrave;re de sexualite. Un autre argument dont usent volontiers les exploiteurs d enfants est que c est leur fa&ccedil;on d aider ces pauvres enfants &agrave; gagner un peu d argent.<BR>

<P> Non seulement le tourisme modifie le comportement, mais il peut aussi renforcer les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s. Ainsi les voyageurs qui sont fermement convaincus - explicitement ou inconsciemment - de l inf&eacute;riorit&eacute; des peuples autres que le leur vont afficher une attitude raciste encore plus accentu&eacute;e lors qu ils se trouvent &agrave; l &eacute;tranger. Autrement dit, ils ne voient que ce qu ils voudraient voir. Les personnes de cette cat&eacute;gorie n ont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement point de scrupules &agrave; exploiter d autres personnes car elles les consid&egrave;rent comme &eacute;tant inf&eacute;rieures.<BR>

<P> L exp&eacute;rience d une sup&eacute;riorit&eacute; &eacute;conomique peut &eacute;galement conduire certains voyageurs &agrave; pratiquer l exploitation ou l abus sexuel &agrave; l &eacute;gard de la population locale. Actuellement les touristes modernes de nos pays industrialis&eacute;s, m&ecirc;me s ils n occupent que des positions assez modestes dans leurs soci&eacute;t&eacute;s peuvent, du fait de la disparit&eacute; des salaires, se consid&eacute;rer comme relativement riches lorsqu ils se rendent dans un pays pauvre. Ces nouveaux riches  vont assez souvent d&eacute;penser de l argent dans des activit&eacute;s sexuelles qu ils croyaient r&eacute;serv&eacute;es aux personnes riches et c&eacute;l&egrave;bres.<BR>
  <BR>
 Dans certains cas les touristes fuient des relations sexuelles dans leur pays pour chercher &agrave; l &eacute;tranger de nouvelles exp&eacute;riences sexuelles. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne a fr&eacute;quemment &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute; parmi les hommes venant des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s occidentales industrialis&eacute;es. Voyant peu &agrave; peu dispara&icirc;tre les privil&egrave;ges traditionnels que leur r&eacute;servaient les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s patriarcales, certains hommes dans les pays occidentaux se sentent incapables d assumer cette nouvelle situation. Les divorces et, plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, les ruptures sentimentales sont de plus en plus fr&eacute;quentes, les chances d emploi se font plus que jamais rares et les femmes fortes  semblent s&eacute;rieusement menacer la domination masculine.<BR>

<P> Cependant, l une des causes les plus importantes de l exploitation sexuelle d enfants dans le contexte du tourisme est le fait que les enfants sont largement mis &agrave; leur disposition. La facilit&eacute; avec laquelle un touriste peut obtenir un enfant &agrave; des fins sexuelles est &agrave; elle seule une incitation si puissante que certains se laissent facilement tenter par cette nouvelle exp&eacute;rience d un rapport sexuel avec un enfant. A ce titre, l importance du crime organis&eacute; pour procurer des enfants &agrave; des fins d exploitation doit &ecirc;tre officiellement reconnue. Puisque les touristes sont souvent pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; payer d importantes sommes d argent pour se procurer des plaisirs sexuels en abusant d un enfant, le trafic de ces derniers devient de plus en plus lucratif et donc de plus en plus courant.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Le voyageur d affaires</B><BR>

<P>Ceux qui voyagent non pas pour le loisir mais pour des raisons professionnelles partagent la plupart des attributs mentionn&eacute;s ci-dessus. A cette diff&eacute;rence pr&egrave;s qu il s agit de voyageurs plus sophistiqu&eacute;s   qui ont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement plus d argent &agrave; leur disposition que les touristes. Certains d entre eux vont faire des s&eacute;jours prolong&eacute;s dans un lieu pr&eacute;cis, d autres vont revenir fr&eacute;quemment au m&ecirc;me endroit.<BR>

<P>Les voyageurs d affaires se d&eacute;placent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement seuls et sont majoritairement du sexe masculin. Quoi de surprenant alors qu un certain nombre de cas graves d exploitation sexuelle r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;e d enfants &agrave; des fins sexuelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;voil&eacute; dans le milieu des voyageurs d affaires.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Les hommes d affaires dans les pays pauvres</B><BR>

<P>D un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, les pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement qui re&ccedil;oivent un afflux de touristes important offrent &agrave; certains voyageurs d affaires des occasions de gros b&eacute;n&eacute;fices &agrave; petit risque et avec un investissement minime: elles consistent &agrave; d&eacute;velopper un commerce du sexe en utilisant les prostitu&eacute;es disponibles, en incitant ou en for&ccedil;ant des femmes &agrave; rejoindre ce commerce et, si n&eacute;cessaire, en recrutant ou en for&ccedil;ant des enfants &agrave; devenir esclaves sexuels . L industrie du sexe est organis&eacute;e comme n importe quelle autre industrie. C est un secteur dans lequel oeuvrent des particuliers &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de grandes organisations et il est fr&eacute;quemment associ&eacute; &agrave; d autres activit&eacute;s ill&eacute;gales telles que le trafic d enfants, le travail forc&eacute; et la pornographie.<BR>

<P><B>II.	L INDUSTRIE DU TOURISME</B><BR>

<P>L industrie du tourisme ne peut &ecirc;tre tenue responsable du comportement de ses clients, &agrave; moins qu elle ne les incite elle-m&ecirc;me &agrave; des rapports sexuels (de nature commerciale). N&eacute;anmoins, les promoteurs du tourisme ont toujours affirm&eacute; que l objectif fondamental de cette industrie &eacute;tait de promouvoir la paix, les Droits de l Homme, l entente mutuelle, le respect de tous les peuples et cultures et un d&eacute;veloppement durable .<BR>

<P>Il est en effet encourageant de voir que certaines organisations de tourisme prennent ces objectifs au s&eacute;rieux et qu on assiste actuellement dans plusieurs branches de l industrie du tourisme &agrave; l &eacute;mergence d un sens de la responsabilit&eacute; collective. On constate tout particuli&egrave;rement une prise de conscience en mati&egrave;re d environnement et une volont&eacute; accrue de prot&eacute;ger certains &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes fragiles des effets n&eacute;fastes d un tourisme de masse. Le tourisme doit respecter l environnement et les peuples.<BR>

<P>En ce qui concerne la promotion par l industrie du tourisme des Droits de l Homme, du respect des peuples et d un d&eacute;veloppement durable, il existe une question &agrave; r&eacute;soudre dans le domaine plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du tourisme sexuel . Ce terme g&eacute;n&eacute;rique de tourisme sexuel  qui a &eacute;t&eacute; introduit par des organisations non-gouvernementales en 1980 pour d&eacute;signer un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne observ&eacute; alors dans les pays d Asie du Sud-est, est aujourd hui consid&eacute;r&eacute; par la plupart des pays comme &eacute;tant un obstacle au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et social durable.<BR>

<P>Plusieurs organisations de tourisme ont conclu des accords commerciaux assurant que des tour-operators se livrant &agrave; la promotion du tourisme sexuel soient priv&eacute;s de leur licence. Souvent ces mesures ont &eacute;t&eacute; le r&eacute;sultat de la pression de l opinion publique. Ainsi au cours de la campagne ECPAT en Suisse en 1992, un journaliste a organis&eacute; par l interm&eacute;diaire d un agent de voyages des tours sexuels  impliquant des enfants et, &agrave; son retour en Suisse, a r&eacute;dig&eacute; un expos&eacute; sur les activit&eacute;s de l agent en question. La vague de protestations de l opinion publique qui a suivi sa publication a suffi pour que cet agent disparaisse d&eacute;finitivement du march&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Certains pays dont les Etats Unis, l Allemagne et l Australie qui ont introduit de nouvelles lois couvrant l extraterritorialit&eacute; en mati&egrave;re de prostitution d enfants y ont &eacute;galement int&eacute;gr&eacute; des dispositions interdisant la promotion de voyages &agrave; buts sexuels impliquant des enfants. Tout tour-operator qui se livre &agrave; la promotion de tels voyages est ainsi passible de peines allant de l amende jusqu &agrave; l emprisonnement.<BR>

<P>Ainsi le tourisme sexuel s est cr&eacute;&eacute; un r&eacute;seau  dans lequel coop&egrave;rent les touristes, l industrie du sexe et m&ecirc;me l industrie du tourisme de mani&egrave;re plus ou moins d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;e.<BR>

<P><B>III.	LA PROMOTION ET L ORGANISATION DU TOURISME SEXUEL AUX NIVEAUX NATIONAL ET INTERNATIONAL</B><BR>

<P>Le cadre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du tourisme sexuel (les motivations des sexe-touristes, les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques, l image &agrave; connotation sexuelle de certaines destinations touristiques, le style de publicit&eacute; etc.) fournit suffisamment d encouragement &agrave; tous ceux qui sont enclins &agrave; exploiter des enfants lors de leurs voyages.<BR>

<P>Les remarques de ce chapitre fourniront quelques &eacute;claircissements ainsi que des informations de base sur la question du tourisme sexuel afin d encourager des actions permettant de supprimer des facteurs favorisant l exploitation sexuelle d enfants.<BR>

<P>Le flux des sexe-touristes va essentiellement des pays &eacute;conomiquement d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s (Europe occidentale, pays scandinaves, Am&eacute;rique du Nord, Australasie, les pays du Golfe) vers les pays plus pauvres de l Asie du Sud-est, l Afrique, l Am&eacute;rique Latine et les Cara&iuml;bes. Mais on peut &eacute;galement trouver, dans certains pays moins d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s, des individus fortun&eacute;s qui pratiquent le tourisme &agrave; but sexuel de m&ecirc;me qu il existe quelques destinations de sexe-tourisme dans les pays dits d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s  (Amsterdam, La Nouvelle Orl&eacute;ans, Las Vegas par exemple). Certains pays de l Europe de l Est commencent &eacute;galement &agrave; attirer des sexe-touristes et &agrave; exporter la prostitution d enfants dans d autres pays. Parmi les pays d accueil on constate des diff&eacute;rences importantes quant &agrave; leur degr&eacute; d implication au niveau national dans l organisation du tourisme sexuel. Nombre de ces pays sont soumis &agrave; des pressions &eacute;conomiques et politiques les poussant &agrave; promouvoir le tourisme en tant que g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur de revenus en devises. Dans certains cas cette politique peut aller jusqu &agrave; une acceptance officielle du fait que tourisme  est pratiquement synonyme de tourisme sexuel  et certains repr&eacute;sentants gouvernementaux ont m&ecirc;me parl&eacute; de sacrifier une g&eacute;n&eacute;ration de femmes  pour la cause du d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique.<BR>

<P>Dans la plupart des cas, toutefois, la seule forme d organisation concert&eacute;e du sexe-tourisme au niveau national reste le crime organis&eacute;. On trouve &eacute;galement un grand nombre d individus qui sont m&ecirc;l&eacute;s &agrave; la prostitution, y compris la prostitution d enfants, par simple opportunit&eacute; : ce sont les maquereaux, les prox&eacute;n&egrave;tes, ceux qui re&ccedil;oivent de l argent soit des prostitu&eacute;s soit de leur clients pour l utilisation de chambres et/ou pour fermer les yeux etc. Comme dans n importe quel autre commerce leur comportement est d une part la r&eacute;ponse &agrave; une demande existante de la part des touristes et d autre part une tentative active de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer une telle demande par la cr&eacute;ation et la promotion d une offre efficace. Malheureusement, ces diff&eacute;rentes formes d activit&eacute;s ne sont le plus souvent possibles que gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la corruption qui r&egrave;gne parmi les forces de l ordre (et qui, elle, s explique par les bas salaires des policiers).<BR>

<P>Au niveau international la promotion et l organisation du tourisme sexuel s op&egrave;rent de diff&eacute;rentes mani&egrave;res. Premi&egrave;rement, il y a des hommes ou des groupes d hommes qui consid&egrave;rent l exploitation sexuelle de personnes dans les pays du tiers-monde  comme un passe-temps anodin et se consacrent volontiers &agrave; fournir des informations utiles &agrave; des personnes partageant leur penchant, tout ceci sur une base non-lucrative. Il peut s agir d un simple &eacute;change d informations entre sexe-touristes fr&eacute;quentant le m&ecirc;me h&ocirc;tel ou alors, au retour dans leur pays, le m&ecirc;me bar ou bistrot. Il peut &eacute;galement se faire via Internet o&ugrave; certains hommes livrent les r&eacute;cits pornographiques de leurs exploits sexuels tout en fournissant &agrave; d autres des d&eacute;tails utiles concernant les lieux de prostitution (adresses de bars ou de bordels, prix etc.) dans les diff&eacute;rentes destinations touristiques avec, quelquefois, des descriptions d enfants et/ou des informations sur les fa&ccedil;ons de se procurer des enfants prostitu&eacute;s. Etant donn&eacute; qu il n existe &agrave; l heure actuelle aucune l&eacute;gislation ad&eacute;quate &agrave; l &eacute;gard de ce type activit&eacute;s, Internet permet aux touristes sexuels de viser des destinations toujours nouvelles , par exemple en Asie ou en Afrique.<BR>

<P>Deuxi&egrave;mement, bien que tr&egrave;s peu de tour-operators organisent de mani&egrave;re explicite des sex-tours  impliquant des enfants il existe encore en Europe, en Australie, en Am&eacute;rique du Nord et au Japon un certain nombre de petites soci&eacute;t&eacute;s qui facilitent le sexe-tourisme en identifiant des stations de vacances o&ugrave; la prostitution est r&eacute;pandue; en concluant un march&eacute; avec des h&ocirc;tels sur place afin d assurer que leurs clients ne payeront pas de surcharge lors qu ils invitent  quelqu un pour la nuit; en offrant aux clients des guides  f&eacute;minines pour 24 heures; en fournissant les services de repr&eacute;sentants locaux  particuli&egrave;rement bien inform&eacute;s sur la prostitution dans les villes et les stations baln&eacute;aires. Et finalement il ne faut pas oublier que certaines destinations touristiques sont commercialis&eacute;es de telle mani&egrave;re que leur image et leur r&eacute;putation en mati&egrave;re de tourisme sexuel ne fait plus aucun doute.<BR>
Nous avons lieu de croire que les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes, australiennes et am&eacute;ricaines impliqu&eacute;es dans l organisation de voyages &agrave; but sexuel y compris dans certains cas la prostitution d enfants sont essentiellement de toutes petites structures voire des entreprises unipersonnelles.<BR>

<P>Troisi&egrave;mement, il existe des individus ou des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s qui publient des guides touristiques encourageant, ne serait-ce que de mani&egrave;re implicite, le tourisme sexuel. Certains de ces guides visent exclusivement le march&eacute; des sexe-touristes en fournissant &eacute;galement une foule d informations destin&eacute;es aux abuseurs d enfants (en identifiant les bars et les bordels o&ugrave; ils trouvent des jeunes filles ) de m&ecirc;me qu en soulignant constamment les qualit&eacute;s juv&eacute;niles des femmes charmantes et tr&egrave;s accueillantes  que l on peut trouver dans les lieux recommand&eacute;s. Il existe &eacute;galement des publications qui s adressent sp&eacute;cifiquement &agrave; des p&eacute;dophiles.<BR>

<P>Finalement, l industrie du tourisme au sens plus large, si elle ne participe pas activement &agrave; l organisation du tourisme sexuel, fournit tout de m&ecirc;me les moyens n&eacute;cessaires aux d&eacute;placements des sexe-touristes. Il est de fait que la plupart des sexe-touristes organisent leurs voyages en passant par des agences de voyages et des tour-operators et il est certain qu ils sont tous bel et bien transport&eacute;s par les compagnies a&eacute;riennes ordinaires . Que ce soit pour les grandes soci&eacute;t&eacute;s ou les petits agents de voyages, le tourisme sexuel, implicitement, repr&eacute;sente un grand march&eacute; pour tout le monde et la r&eacute;partition des sexe-touristes en termes de nationalit&eacute;s dans n importe quelle station baln&eacute;aire donne une image plus ou moins pr&eacute;cise de la structure de l investissement &eacute;tranger dans cette station. De plus, le mat&eacute;riel publicitaire utilis&eacute; par la plupart des grandes soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de voyages contribue &agrave; maintenir le flux des sexe-touristes. En effet, il souligne souvent les attraits de la vie nocturne  dans des endroits o&ugrave; la vie nocturne est exclusivement centr&eacute;e sur l exploitation sexuelle de la population locale. Il favorise &eacute;galement les st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes sur les gens du tiers-monde  les d&eacute;crivant comme des personnes heureuses , souriantes , d&eacute;tendues  ou exotiques . De telles id&eacute;es re&ccedil;ues traduisent souvent des attitudes assez ethnocentriques voire racistes.<BR>

<P><B>IV.	TOURISME--INTERETS ECONOMIQUES OU RESPONSABILITE SOCIALE</B><BR>

<P>Depuis 1960 les voyages au niveau international ont &eacute;t&eacute; multipli&eacute;s par sept et la moiti&eacute; environ sont des d&eacute;placement &agrave; but touristique. Le nombre de touristes internationaux qui est estim&eacute; &agrave; 567 millions en 1995 s &eacute;l&egrave;vera &agrave; 967 millions en 2010. Le tourisme international est d&eacute;sormais en t&ecirc;te de l ensemble des exportations dans le monde (devant le p&eacute;trole, les automobiles, les &eacute;quipements &eacute;lectroniques etc.) et repr&eacute;sente le premier secteur dans les services marchands (OMT). Avec 200 millions d emplois dans le domaine du voyage et du tourisme cette industrie est en effet le plus grand employeur dans le monde et un emploi sur six en moyenne est d une mani&egrave;re ou d une autre li&eacute; au tourisme (WTTC).<BR>

<P>Ces chiffres d&eacute;montrent le poids &eacute;conomique de l industrie du tourisme. Nombre de pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement consid&egrave;rent le tourisme comme leur premi&egrave;re source de recettes d exportation et leur plus grand espoir en terme de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique. En Asie, en Afrique, en Am&eacute;rique Latine et en Europe de l Est d &eacute;normes investissements d argent, de temps et de ressources humaines sont consacr&eacute;s au d&eacute;veloppement du tourisme.<BR>

<P>Pour certains de ces pays le tourisme sexuel (y compris celui impliquant des enfants) est vu comme un effet secondaire du d&eacute;veloppement touristique - d&eacute;plorable, certes, mais in&eacute;vitable. On cite fr&eacute;quemment les propos d un Vice-Premier Ministre d un pays d Asie lorsque ce pays a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de d&eacute;velopper l industrie du tourisme. En s adressant aux gouverneurs des provinces en 1980 il les a incit&eacute;s &agrave; soutenir la politique gouvernementale en faveur du tourisme en mettant en valeur les attractions naturelles de leurs r&eacute;gions mais, en m&ecirc;me temps, en encourageant la cr&eacute;ation de divertissements que certains d entre vous jugeront d&eacute;go&ucirc;tants et embarrassants car ils sont associ&eacute;s au plaisir sexuel . Le repr&eacute;sentant de la Police, en r&eacute;ponse &agrave; l appel &agrave; la promotion du tourisme, dit qu il fallait prolonger les heures de service dans les lieux de divertissement ... pour accueillir les touristes . L association entre tourisme et prostitution est un &eacute;tat d esprit dans beaucoup d endroits.<BR>

<P>Dans plusieurs pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement, la campagne de lutte contre la prostitution d enfants s est heurt&eacute;e aux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts des minist&egrave;res du tourisme qui la jugeaient anti-touristique. On a inculqu&eacute; aux promoteurs du tourisme que la mise &agrave; disposition de services sexuels  de tous genres est un &eacute;l&eacute;ment n&eacute;cessaire dans le d&eacute;veloppement du tourisme. Heureusement cette &eacute;poque est aujourd hui en train de passer mais il faut encore rappeler aux pays d accueil de touristes que l hospitalit&eacute; ne signifie pas n&eacute;cessairement exploitation sexuelle de leurs enfants.<BR>

<P>L exploitation sexuelle &agrave; des fins commerciales est essentiellement due &agrave; des disparit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques. Ceci ne doit pas l excuser ni en fournir une explication satisfaisante. La vente d enfants peut &eacute;galement traduire une attitude d avidit&eacute; de la part des parents qui vendent leurs enfants ou celle des agents interm&eacute;diaires qui enl&egrave;vent ou s&eacute;duisent des enfants &agrave; des fins de prostitution.<BR>

<P>En traitant l enfant comme une marchandise que l on peut acheter, louer, commercialiser ou tout simplement jeter, il ne s agit plus seulement d un probl&egrave;me de pauvret&eacute; mais plut&ocirc;t d une question d &eacute;thique - et plus particuli&egrave;rement de l &eacute;thique des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de consommation.<BR>

<P>Cette distinction est subtile mais d une importance consid&eacute;rable dans la commercialisation du tourisme. La publicit&eacute; du tourisme, en promouvant les principes du consum&eacute;risme et de l h&eacute;donisme comme &eacute;tant les buts principaux de l exp&eacute;rience touristique soutient justement les valeurs qui rendent la prostitution d enfants possible. Il est imp&eacute;ratif que la promotion du tourisme reconnaisse la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de prot&eacute;ger les enfants contre toute forme d exploitation ou de violence sexuelle du fait de touristes  (Charte l Enfant et l Agent de Voyages, FUAAV).<BR>

<P>Les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices &eacute;conomiques imm&eacute;diats du sexe-tourisme pour l industrie du tourisme et les industries connexes sont ind&eacute;niables. Mais on oublie souvent que les co&ucirc;ts occasionn&eacute;s &agrave; long terme tant sur le plan &eacute;conomique, social, culturel et m&eacute;dical sont tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;s et souvent l&eacute;gu&eacute;s &agrave; d autres , c est-&agrave;-dire aux g&eacute;n&eacute;rations et gouvernements futurs, aux organisations d aide au d&eacute;veloppement, aux programmes d aide des pays founisseurs de touristes, aux organisations caritatives etc. Au regard de cette r&eacute;alit&eacute;, tous ceux qui ont une influence sur le d&eacute;veloppement du tourisme doivent se sentir, implicitement, responsables.<BR>

<P><B>V.	QUE PEUT-ON FAIRE ?</B><BR>

<P>Le Congr&egrave;s en Su&egrave;de r&eacute;unit de nombreux secteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, depuis les repr&eacute;sentants officiels des institutions charg&eacute;es de l application de la loi jusqu aux professions m&eacute;dicales en passant par les hommes politiques et les militants des causes sociales. Les repr&eacute;sentants de l industrie du tourisme parleront non seulement au nom de leur branche mais repr&eacute;senteront le secteur marchand de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, celui qui cherche l int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &eacute;conomique et le profit. Leur pr&eacute;sence au Congr&egrave;s d&eacute;montre que les personnes morales peuvent assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s quand il s agit d assurer la protection des enfants contre l exploitation sexuelle et que les valeurs humaines positives doivent &ecirc;tre affirm&eacute;es par l ensemble de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Ce qui est plus important, n&eacute;anmoins, c est que l industrie du tourisme ait la capacit&eacute; d aider &agrave; mettre fin &agrave; l exploitation d enfants, et ce en tr&egrave;s peu de temps. Etant le plus grand employeur du monde le tourisme a des repr&eacute;sentants dans tous les coins du globe. Dans toutes les structures touristiques c est l industrie du tourisme qui fournit les moyens de transport, les logements et les services n&eacute;cessaires aux voyageurs - y compris ceux qui cherchent &agrave; abuser d enfants. Les employ&eacute;s de ce secteur sont par cons&eacute;quent dans une position leur permettant d observer et de faire &eacute;tat de ce qui se passe, ils peuvent aider leurs directeurs &agrave; faire pression sur les autorit&eacute;s afin que les crimes dont sont victimes les enfants sont poursuivis comme il convient.<BR>

<P>Le chapitre suivant s interroge sur les moyens d action et pr&eacute;sente - &agrave; titre d exemples - un certain nombre de programmes d ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; entrepris au sein de l industrie du tourisme.<BR>

<P><B>1.	L Information des Touristes</B><BR>

<P>Le touriste cherche des informations sur les destinations qu il souhaite visiter. Au del&agrave; des renseignements pratiques concernant les prix, les horaires etc., il re&ccedil;oit &eacute;galement des informations d ordre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral sur le cadre socioculturel, les coutumes et les contraintes du pays en question. Par cons&eacute;quent, l information du voyageur sur l abus sexuel des enfants doit &ecirc;tre la premi&egrave;re priorit&eacute; &agrave; ce niveau d action. Au cours des trois derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es un certain nombre d actions de ce type ont &eacute;t&eacute; initi&eacute;es par plusieurs associations, souvent en coop&eacute;ration avec l industrie du tourisme et des gouvernements ou l industrie du tourisme et des organisations non-gouvernementales. Voici quelques exemples :<BR>

<P> 	<I>Les agents de voyages</I><BR>
Depuis 1993 un certain nombre de pays ont introduit de nouvelles lois couvrant l extraterritorialit&eacute;, c est-&agrave;-dire qu un citoyen peut &ecirc;tre jug&eacute; dans son pays pour un crime commis dans un autre pays. Afin d informer le public sur ces nouvelles l&eacute;gislations plusieurs pays ont produit des documents destin&eacute;s aux voyageurs.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Su&egrave;de</I><BR>
En Su&egrave;de, l organisation de d&eacute;fense des enfants R&auml;dda Barnen a &eacute;dit&eacute; un d&eacute;pliant destin&eacute; &agrave; &ecirc;tre ins&eacute;r&eacute; dans les pochettes des billets d avion des voyageurs en partance pour l Asie. Il montre au recto le c&ocirc;t&eacute; positif et au verso le c&ocirc;t&eacute; n&eacute;gatif du tourisme o&ugrave; il demande au touriste de prot&eacute;ger les enfants - au lieu de les exploiter. Les d&eacute;pliants ont &eacute;t&eacute; diffus&eacute;s par l Association Su&eacute;doise des Agents de Voyages.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Norv&egrave;ge</I><BR>
Redd Barna en association avec Den Norske Reisebransjeforeningen a produit une brochure mettant en garde contre les risques du sida et la prostitution des enfants.<BR>

<P> 	<I>France</I><BR>
En France, l industrie du tourisme et plusieurs minist&egrave;res se sont associ&eacute;s pour &eacute;diter un d&eacute;pliant d informations sur le probl&egrave;me de la prostitution des enfants. Le document a &eacute;t&eacute; diffus&eacute; par le canal des agences de voyages. Plus de 300.000 exemplaires ont &eacute;t&eacute; remis aux voyageurs pendant les premiers mois et &agrave; ce jour le d&eacute;pliant a &eacute;t&eacute; distribu&eacute; &agrave; plus d un million d exemplaires.<BR>

<P><B>1.2	Le service des douanes</B><BR>

<P> 	<I>Australie</I><BR>
En Australie, le service des douanes distribue des d&eacute;pliants au comptoir. Ils sont disponibles pour tous mais sont plus sp&eacute;cifiquement remis &agrave; des voyageurs masculins en partance pour une des destinations d Asie connues pour l accueil des sexe-touristes. Le d&eacute;pliant qui a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute; par ECPAT-Australie et financ&eacute; par des agences d aide met en garde contre le tourisme sexuel impliquant des enfants.<BR>

<P><B>1.3	A bord des avions</B><BR>

<P> 	<I>Allemagne</I><BR>
Sur les longs courriers les voyageurs sont relativement r&eacute;ceptifs &agrave; des informations sur le probl&egrave;me si elles sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es de mani&egrave;re discr&egrave;te. D&egrave;s la fin des ann&eacute;es 70 on pr&eacute;sentaient aux voyageurs sur les vols Condor &agrave; destination de Colombo/Sri Lanka un film de 28 minutes sur les comportements &agrave; &eacute;viter par les touristes. Ce documentaire qui abordait avec grande sensibilit&eacute; le probl&egrave;me des enfants mendiants, la conduite et les r&egrave;gles vestimentaires dans les temples et les lieux sacr&eacute;s ainsi que les rapports personnels et sociaux des touristes avec un gar&ccedil;on de la plage  &acirc;g&eacute; de 12 ans, a &eacute;t&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement tr&egrave;s bien re&ccedil;u.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Indon&eacute;sie</I><BR>
C est dans les ann&eacute;es 80 que la compagnie Garuda Airlines a commenc&eacute; &agrave; s int&eacute;resser au probl&egrave;me du tourisme sexuel en Indon&eacute;sie et a lanc&eacute; une brochure qui a &eacute;t&eacute; ins&eacute;r&eacute;e dans les pochettes des passagers &agrave; bord des avions sur les vols en provenance d Australie et des Etats Unis. Cette brochure comprenait &eacute;galement un code de bonne conduite destin&eacute; aux touristes.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Italie</I><BR>
La F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Italienne des Voyages et du Tourisme a manifest&eacute; sa volont&eacute; de distribuer un d&eacute;pliant ce qu elle fera certainement en association avec la compagnie Alitalia.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Autriche</I><BR>
La compagnie a&eacute;rienne Lauda Air a montr&eacute;, par un mauvais exemple, que le probl&egrave;me de l abus sexuel des enfants ne se traite pas &agrave; la l&eacute;g&egrave;re. En 1992, le magazine de bord pr&eacute;sentait une carte postale d un touriste allemand tournant au ridicule le probl&egrave;me de la prostitution d enfants. Sur la photo se trouvait une fille au buste d&eacute;nud&eacute;, le verso contenait un message vantant les plaisirs &eacute;rotiques des bo&icirc;tes de nuit en Tha&iuml;lande. Le message se terminait de la fa&ccedil;on suivante: Faut qu  j y aille, les cocottes du Baby Club m attendent. Ce type de journalisme douteux et de mauvais go&ucirc;t &agrave; provoqu&eacute; une vague de protestations &agrave; Bangkok et, &agrave; la suite de cet incident, Lauda Air a du pr&eacute;senter officiellement ses excuses.<BR>

<P><B>1.4	Au sol</B><BR>

<P> 	<I>Tha&iuml;lande</I><BR>
Plusieurs associations luttant contre les abus sexuels des enfants ont produit, en 1995, une brochure destin&eacute;e &agrave; une tr&egrave;s large diffusion par l interm&eacute;diaire d h&ocirc;tels et de boutiques. Edit&eacute;e par la National Commission on Women s Affairs, elle porte le message Le rapport sexuel avec un enfant est un crime.<BR>

<P><B>1.5	Par l interm&eacute;diaire des guides de voyages</B><BR>

<P> 	<I>Etats Unis</I><BR>
Les guides et documents vid&eacute;o Fodors sont les publications am&eacute;ricaines qui font autorit&eacute; dans le monde du tourisme. Fodors a commenc&eacute; &agrave; s int&eacute;resser &agrave; la campagne contre la prostitution des enfants et en fait &eacute;tat &agrave; la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision. La plupart de ses publications comportent &eacute;galement un code d &eacute;thique pour touristes.<BR>

<P> 	<I>Australie</I><BR>
Lonely Planet est une des plus grandes publications dans le monde et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;cemment commenc&eacute; &agrave; inclure des observations concernant des probl&egrave;mes tels que la r&eacute;pression politique, les droits des peuples indig&egrave;nes, les probl&egrave;mes &eacute;cologiques, les effets n&eacute;fastes du tourisme sur l environnement et maintenant aussi le tourisme sexuel impliquant des enfants. En ce qui concerne la prostitution d enfants, Lonely Planet estime avoir une responsabilit&eacute; dans la sensibilisation du public sur l exploitation sexuelle des enfants, notamment dans les pays o&ugrave; ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne a pris une dimension importante. A cet effet, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; a envoy&eacute; la documentation d ECPAT-Australie &agrave; tous les auteurs charg&eacute;s de la mise &agrave; jour des &eacute;ditions Lonely Planet afin qu ils aient connaissance du probl&egrave;me et puissent en faire &eacute;tat de m&ecirc;me que des nouvelles l&eacute;gislations nationales et internationales p&eacute;nalisant ces activit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P><B>1.6	Aux salons du tourisme</B><BR>

<P> 	<I>Royaume Uni</I><BR>
Dans plusieurs pays dont le Royaume Uni le probl&egrave;me du tourisme sexuel impliquant des enfants a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute; par des organisations non-gouvernementales locales lors des salons du tourisme. Au Royaume Uni l Association Britannique des Agents de Voyages a gracieusement offert &agrave; la <I>Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism </I>un stand d exposition gratuit lors de la World Travel Mart en 1995.<BR>

<P><B>2.	Coop&eacute;ration entre employeurs et employ&eacute;s</B><BR>

<P>La coop&eacute;ration entre employeurs et employ&eacute;s des &eacute;tablissements de tourisme peut aider &agrave; pr&eacute;venir l exploitation sexuelle des enfants ou, si elle existe, aider &agrave; en faire &eacute;tat afin que les cas soient trait&eacute;s par les autorit&eacute;s judiciaires.<BR>

<P>L Union internationale des travailleurs de l alimentation, de l agriculture, de l h&ocirc;tellerie-restauration, du tabac et des branches connexes (UITA) a adopt&eacute; en Juin 1995 et D&eacute;cembre 1995 des r&eacute;solutions &agrave; ce sujet en d&eacute;clarant que  les travailleurs dans le secteur du tourisme ont un r&ocirc;le important &agrave; jouer dans la lutte contre la prostitution des enfants et en invitant &agrave; n&eacute;gocier avec les employeurs afin de mettre en place des actions concert&eacute;es. L UITA souligne &eacute;galement la responsabilit&eacute; des gouvernements dans cette campagne, tant dans les pays d accueil que dans les pays fournisseurs de touristes&quot;. Elle exhorte les gouvernements &agrave; intensifier leurs efforts pour le respect des Droits de l Homme, en particulier des enfants, en adoptant des lois appropri&eacute;es qui reconnaissent toute promotion ou implication dans la prostitution d enfants par des personnes physiques ou morales comme &eacute;tant un crime&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>3.	L auto-contr&ocirc;le</B><BR>

<P>Plusieurs propositions sont issues de l industrie du tourisme destin&eacute;es &agrave; observer le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne du tourisme sexuel et &agrave; prendre des mesures d auto-contr&ocirc;le. Deux exemples significatifs dans ce domaine proviennent de Ta&iuml;wan et de l Allemagne:<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Ta&iuml;wan</B><BR>
En 1993, &agrave; la suite du rapport d une ONG faisant &eacute;tat d un nombre tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; d enfants prostitu&eacute;s &agrave; Ta&iuml;wan, la Kaoshiung Hotel Association et la Taipeh Hotel Association ont lanc&eacute; des campagnes invitant leurs membres &agrave; soutenir la campagne ECPAT dans sa lutte contre la prostitution des enfants li&eacute;e au tourisme en Asie. Elles p&eacute;nalisent tout membre de leur association tol&eacute;rant ou favorisant la prostitution d enfants dans son &eacute;tablissement. D autres actions comportent :<BR>
-	enseignes anti-child-prostitution  appliqu&eacute;es &agrave; la r&eacute;ception des h&ocirc;tels et par lesquelles les &eacute;tablissements manifestent leur soutien de la campagne;<BR>
-	&eacute;mission de cartes de type VIP destin&eacute;es aux activistes d ECPAT ouvrant droit &agrave; une r&eacute;duction dans les h&ocirc;tels participant &agrave; la campagne (50.000 cartes distribu&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour);<BR>
-	une d&eacute;claration de la Kaoshiung Hotel Association en faveur d ECPAT exprimant son engagement &agrave; aider les enfants victimes et mentionnant les actions entreprises.<BR>

<P><B>Allemagne</B><BR>
12 tour operators ont conclu des accords avec l associations <I>terre des hommes. </I>Les signataires s engagent notamment &agrave;:<BR>
-	assurer qu il n y ait pas de prostitution d enfants dans les &eacute;tablissements associ&eacute;s ;<BR>
-	informer leurs clients sur le contexte et les cons&eacute;quences de la prostitution d enfants;<BR>
-	former leur personnel h&ocirc;telier ainsi que les guides &agrave; ce sujet.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>4.	Signaler le crime</B><BR>

<P>L abus sexuel et le trafic d enfants sont des crimes qui doivent &ecirc;tre signal&eacute;s. Toutefois, la plupart des gens ferment les yeux lorsqu ils soup&ccedil;onnent un abus sexuel d enfants tandis que d autres pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent se taire craignant de perdre leur emploi. Or, dans ce domaine il est imp&eacute;ratif que toute personne ayant connaissance d un cas le signale aux autorit&eacute;: l industrie du tourisme (les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, organisations commerciales), les particuliers employ&eacute;s dans ce secteur (le personnel du tourisme) et les voyageurs. De m&ecirc;me les ONG et les citoyens du pays concern&eacute; peuvent et doivent faire &eacute;tat des faits et des observations. Et enfin les m&eacute;dias jouent &eacute;galement un r&ocirc;le important lorsqu il s agit de d&eacute;voiler ces pratiques. Une l&eacute;gislation appropri&eacute;e mise en place par les gouvernements ainsi qu un certain nombre de mesures d auto-contr&ocirc;le  dans l ensemble du secteur touristique repr&eacute;sentent le cadre utile et indispensable pour les actions individuelles et favorisent les interventions spontan&eacute;es bas&eacute;es sur la conscience et la sensibilisation. Les exemples suivants montreront qu il existe d&eacute;j&agrave; quelques initiatives courageuses en r&eacute;ponse &agrave; ce d&eacute;fi:<BR>

<P><B>Inde</B><BR>
En 1991 une h&ocirc;tesse de la compagnie Indian Airlines remarque une jeune fille visiblement en d&eacute;tresse. En lui parlant dans sa langue locale elle apprend que la fille a &eacute;t&eacute; vendue par ses parents et que l homme qui &eacute;tait assis &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; d elle allait l emmener en Arabie Saoudite. L h&ocirc;tesse le signale &agrave; la police &agrave; Delhi par radio et informe l ensemble des passagers qui acceptent de signer une petition. Le ravisseur est arr&ecirc;t&eacute; et la fille lib&eacute;r&eacute;e.<BR>

<P><B>Tha&iuml;lande</B><BR>
En 1993 un groupe de touristes fran&ccedil;ais comprenant plusieurs hommes seuls se rend en Tha&iuml;lande. Lorsque l un d eux raconte &agrave; son ami qu il allait avoir des rapports sexuel avec un enfant celui-ci est scandalis&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Ils ont une dispute ce qui n emp&ecirc;che pas le premier d aller tout de m&ecirc;me abuser un enfant. Son ami le signale &agrave; la police qui arr&ecirc;te son concitoyen.<BR>

<P>L id&eacute;e d encourager tous ceux qui sont en rapport avec l industrie du tourisme &agrave; signaler le crime et m&ecirc;me le soup&ccedil;on de crime peut sembler tr&egrave;s s&eacute;duisante mais cette approche doit &ecirc;tre aborder avec grande pr&eacute;caution. L apparence d activit&eacute;s criminelles ne signifie pas toujours que ces crimes sont r&eacute;ellement commis. Il faut &eacute;galement &eacute;viter que cette d&eacute;marche ne d&eacute;g&eacute;n&egrave;re en vendetta.<BR>

<P><B>5.	Le lobbying aupr&egrave;s des gouvernements</B><BR>

<P>De nombreux pays ont adopt&eacute;, au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, de nouvelles lois p&eacute;nalisant l abus sexuel d enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales du fait de touristes: l Allemagne (Juin 1993), la France (F&eacute;vrier 1994), l Australie (Juillet 1994), les Etats Unis (Septembre 1994), la Belgique (Mars 1995) et la Nouvelle Z&eacute;lande (Juillet 1995). D autres pays envisagent des mesures similaires. Dans la plupart des cas le gouvernement avait re&ccedil;u des propositions de la part de l industrie du tourisme ou des minist&egrave;res du tourisme. Dans tous les cas, ces propositions cherchaient &agrave; renforcer la l&eacute;gislation existante.<BR>

<P>En Italie le gouvernement a vot&eacute; un ordre du jour (Mars 1995) demandant aux agents de voyages de respecter la Convention relative aux Droits de l Enfant, notamment dans le domaine de l exploitations sexuelle d enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales.<BR>

<P><B>6.	Programmes de formation</B><BR>

<P>Lufthansa et Air New Zealand ont introduit le probl&egrave;me de l exploitation sexuelle d enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales dans les programmes de formation de leur personnel. Un certain nombre d autre compagnies envisagent d en faire autant.<BR>

<P><B>VI.	CONCLUSION</B><BR>

<P>Ce Congr&egrave;s sera pour les gouvernements une occasion de revoir leur propre r&ocirc;le dans la politique de d&eacute;veloppement du tourisme. Les mesures politiques seront &agrave; plusieurs &eacute;gards d&eacute;terminantes dans la pr&eacute;vention du tourisme sexuel impliquant des enfants.<BR>

<P>Le partenariat efficace entre les gouvernements et l industrie du tourisme constituera une contribution positive pour mettre fin &agrave; l exploitation sexuelle des enfants &agrave; des fins commerciales.
