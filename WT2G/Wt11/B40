BBC Radio 4 news this morning (19th March 1993):

Sir John Bourne, head of the Government Audit office, stated that an audit of
the Social Fund had revealed that (pounds) 37 million could not be accounted
for.  It appeared that 16 million of this could be ascribed to the "usual"
errors in inputting data to the computer system. The other 21 million was
"lost" due to the incorrect operation of the computer system itself.

The Social Fund is used to make "one-of" payments to people receiving social
benefit, e.g., for the purchase of an essential item such as a cooker. The
failure occurs when such people move from one area to another: the system does
not transfer the record of the payment they have received to the new area, and
the money appears to have been "lost".  It is expected that it will be
possible to trace most of the money.

A Labour MP who chairs one of the Social Benefit committees (sorry, name 
and committee not recorded) stated that this sort of problem is all too 
frequent, and is due to computers having been introduced too rapidly into 
government departments, and to the advice of the government's own computer 
experts having been ignored.

NY Times, 3/20 from Dallas, 3/19...

   The collapse of the snow-laden roof of a computer center in Clifton, NJ,
   last Saturday also brought down 5,000 ATM's nationwide, causing
   particularly serious problems in California and Illinois.  The situation
   has left the banking industry and its customers wondering about their
   growing reliance on such machines.

   Some of the questions concern the planning for such emergencies.  The
   computer center's crisis plan called for it to move to a backup site in
   North Bergen, NJ, operated by a company that supplies such
   disaster-recovery services.  That plan was thwarted because the center was
   filled with other computer operators who had been displaced from the World
   Trade Center by last month's bombing.

             RESEARCHERS UNCOVER "ETHICALLY SUSPECT" 
       TECHNOLOGICAL MANIPULATIONS IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING

Most Americans are aware of the potential impact of political ads on their
voting behavior; but many may not realize that a significant percentage of ads
they see on television have been technologically manipulated to create a false
or misleading impression.  Researchers supported by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) analyzed 2,000 ads from the 1952 through the 1992 campaigns
-- primarily at the presidential level -- and found that nearly 15 percent of
them were deliberately distorted.

"We think we've identified a substantial problem that has implications for the
political process," said Lynda Lee Kaid, director of the Political
Communication Center at the University of Oklahoma, who is leading the pilot
project.  "The technology provides an opportunity for candidates to perhaps
abuse the trust that the voters have in our political process."

Along with a panel of ethics experts, Dr. Kaid has analyzed the ways in which
modern computer and audio-video technologies have been used to create
ethically suspect television spots in political campaigns.  Her analysis
uncovered a variety of manipulation techniques, including speeding-up or
slowing down an audio track to make a candidate's voice seem either God-like
or whiny, and distorting video images.  Such manipulations, Kaid said, were
more likely to appear in negative ads than in positive ones.

According to Kaid, distorting video images has become an increasingly popular
technique which she considers ethically "dangerous." "Many of these new
technological devices make it possible to alter images in a way that is not
perceptible to the human eye when they're viewed on television."  For example,
footage can be edited so that a candidate's comments are taken completely out
of context or are used with other footage to portray an entirely different
meaning than originally intended.  Kaid pointed out that, while manipulation
techniques are often used in many kinds of advertising, "we believe it's a
particular problem in political advertising because it has become the major
way in which candidates communicate with voters."

Kaid hopes her research will be used as a defense against unrecognized
manipulation of voter opinion. "We're trying to help voters and the public
recognize these techniques, so they can make better judgments and become
informed consumers of political ads." She plans to create an educational
videotape with her research findings.

In subsequent research phases, Kaid hopes to conduct experimental studies to
determine the extent to which voters are actually misled by manipulation
techniques, or whether they are capable of recognizing the distortions when
they see them.  "We'd like to develop a direct link between the technological
distortions and the actual voter decision-making process so that we can show
whether or not these techniques really do result in an abuse of the political
process."

According to Rachelle Hollander, NSF program director of Ethics and Values
Studies, the research findings point to the need to systematically examine the
impact of political ads on voter behavior, and thus on public policy-making.
"We need to start thinking about how new communications technologies can
influence and persuade...but also can mislead," she said.

The Thursday 18th March 1993 issue of The Independent newspaper covers the
acquittal of a teenage hacker in the UK in some depth. A front page article
includes the following:

  Conspiracy trial ends in `Surprise' acquittal
  Hacker penetrated MoD [UK Ministry of Defence]

  The teenage hacker acquitted yesterday of conspiracy charges under the 
  Computer Misuse Act 1990 gained access to Ministry of Defence computers
  holding confidential information.  ...
  The print-outs show confidential telephone numbers and information about
  the US network and missile bases linked to the US Army.  ...
  Police officers involved said they were "surprised" by yesterday's
  verdict. The Computer Crimes Unit was eager to prosecute this first
  major trial under the new legislation. [sic]

Page 4 includes a full page article on the subject in which it is estimated
that the annual bill to British business of computer fraud is 1.1 billion
UK pounds (c. $1.5B).

A leading article on page 25 states:

  If Mr Bedworth's acquittal sets a prededent, it will make an ass of the
  Computer Misuse Act 1990. The Act was drafted specifically in order to
  close loopholes that had previously allowed people to do legally what he
  did.

This morning the Globe and Mail (Canada) reported that Fujitsu of Japan is
working on a brain-wave interface for computers. According to The Times of
London, company spokesperson Michael Beirne said, "Our goal is to create an
intuitive computer that can pick up your thoughts even as you walk around a
room." The Globe and Mail summary claims that the researchers are currently
working on distinguishing thoughts of "up" from those of "down" to move a
cursor.

RISKS participants will easily think of some fascinating problems ahead of
the researchers and of society as this technique evolves. For example,
in the 1956(?) movie, "Forbidden Planet," space-farers approach an
unknown planet and are warned away by the lone inhabitants (an elderly man
and his--naturally--nubile and short-skirted daughter). He shows the
visitors the remains of the original people who had lived on the planet.
The Krell were masters of technology and even devised a mechanism for
giving life to the thoughts of sentient beings. Unfortunately they suddenly
disappeared without a trace shortly after this technology was introduced.
Some crewmembers try the device out and create little dancing women for
their amusement. Then disaster strikes: invisible monsters turn crewmen
into hamburger every night, leaving bent stairways and huge footprints.
Eventually, a dying man croaks out the clue: "Monsters," he says, "monsters
from the id." 

So what will happen to the brain-wave sensitive user interface when the
ostensible desire to do productive work on a certain file for that nasty
boss is overridden by the subconscious desire to delete the file?

And if the R&amp;D folk really are working on pattern recognition for mental
vocalization, will this lead to pattern recognition of unconscious
mentation? Are we headed for telepathy machines? Mind readers? 

What fun! Expect an increase in the volume of email in RISKS-L.

The March 13th issue of The Economist has a short article on interference by
passengers' electronic devices on aircraft control systems.  It mentions "a
Boeing 747-400 that weaved from side to side until two laptops ... were turned
off" and Nintendos "confusing the automatic direction-finder" of a DC10.
Possible causes include plastic composites used in airplane construction, and
lower-voltage electronic systems.  Electronic devices used by passengers "near
the front of an aircraft appear to be most disruptive".  [Maybe we should
banish business class to the back of the plane.]  There are also reports of
interference "triggering anti-lock brake systems" in German cars, and causing
Japanese robots to "run amok".

[Another article in the same issue discusses the failure of the London
Stock Exchange's computer trading system, Taurus.]

The new version of Virus Test Center' *Computer Virus Catalog* is now available
for ftp (ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de). The following files may be downloaded:

       INDEX.ZIP              the new index file (INDEX.293), listing all
                              283 viruses in 5 platforms yet described
       AMIGAVIR.ZIP           the cumulative AMIGAVIR files, now describing
                              77 AMIGA viruses (15 new ones)
       MSDOSVIR.ZIP           the cumulative MSDOSVIR.files, now classifying
                              156 MSDOS viruses and trojans (32 new ones)
       MACVIR.ZIP             the cumulative MACVIR files; no update since
                              July 1992 (.792) as no new viruses were found
       ATARIVIR.ZIP           the old AtariVir files (20 viruses) not updated
                              as we have no new viruses for analysis.

The single UNIX virus (AT&amp;T Attack) will be sent on request (on ftp soon). 
In the new MSDOSVIR.293 file, the following new PC viruses are classified:

     10_past_3 (2), Adolf, Alabama, Chemnitz, Exe_Bug (2), Flip, Hey_You,
     Kampana=Spanish Telecom (2), Minimal (15), Techno, VOID_POEM, V-163
     and V-Sign/CANSU.

Moreover, characteristic features of viruses generated by the following
authoring packages are also classified:

     PS-MPC and VCL.

As announced last year, the new *machine readable CVC version* called CVBASE
is also available for downloading: cvbase-293.zip. CVBASE allows to display
all CVC entries (in total 288, on Amiga, Atari, Mac, MsDos and the single UNIX
virus), under option VIRUS, but also gives an OVERVIEW and STRAIN
relationship about All (about 2,200) viruses in the CARO/VTC collections
(using CARO naming scheme) as well as the VTC collection on Amiga (77), Atari
(20), Mac (35) and Unix (1). From STRAIN, one may read available CVC entries.

   *Any suggestions how to improve this version are welcome*

In an earlier posting, Ross Anderson discusses the cancellation of the Taurus
project in the UK.  The information he presents, some from the UK media, is
misleading and in some cases incorrect.

This gave a rather unfair appraisal of IBM security products.  In fact, this
part of the system was finished, installed, and tested.  I've been asked to
post the following "official" description of the situation, so everyone knows
what really happened.

 "The overall Taurus project was managed by the London Stock Exchange with
  Coopers and Lybrand and other consultants in a number of key management
  positions; with a range of contractors involved in sub-projects modifying
  and enhancing the Stock Exchange systems.

  A US software house was meant to be providing a new custody application and
  IBM provided a market-leading security infrastructure.  The shelving of the
  overall TAURUS project is for reasons unconnected with IBM's role.

  IBM's involvement has been as subcontractor for the TAURUS Message Security
  system.  This leading-edge development exploited IBM ICRF host cryptography,
  OS/2, smart cards, and PS/2 cryptography and signature verification 
  technology to deliver an outstandingly secure method of transferring data
  between member firms and the Stock Exchange.

  The development was successfully completed last summer, then rigorously
  acceptance-tested by the Stock Exchange.  IBM installed the system across
  200+ separate financial institutions, completing on time in February
  against an aggressive schedule."

I've been told that the massive complexity of the back-end settlement systems
was a major factor in the collapse, but I don't really know all the details.

(Note that the "signature verification technology" mentioned above is dynamic
signature verification, a biometric technology -- not public key digital
signatures.  RSA public key functions are also available in TSS, but that's
not what was used in Taurus.)

We should not disparage physical security just because we can't sell our pet
methodologies.  Physical security is a necessary component of any security
system.  Private keys must be stored -- and _used_ -- in a secure environment
where there is no risk of exposure.  Formal methods and elliptic curves are
orthogonal to the need for steel boxes.

+Future systems however may well use public key algorithms, and maybe even 
+electronic wallets which distribute the security processing entirely into 
+smartcards.

Regardless of whether we use public key or private key, we still need the
ability to perform secure processing with the secret key.  Be it a computer
room with armed guards, a giant steel box, or other forms of tamper-proof
hardware, -some- of the bank's computation must be secure.  Whether we use
public key or private key is again orthogonal to physical security needs.

Smart cards may appear attractive for many applications, but they do not
suffice for handling the case of trying to ``distribute the security
processing entirely into'' them.  Even if we assume that they have sufficient
power to run public key cryptosystems, a problem remains: we still can't
always trust the balance on a smart card.  Today's smart cards don't provide
any physical security; their users do.  The implicit assumption is that users
of smart cards carry their smart cards with them at all times, and can keep
the secrets/data kept within their smart cards from being exposed/modified.
Malicious users, on the other hand, have plenty of opportunity to tamper with
their smart cards.  Keys may be exposed, balances may be changed -- there are
no privacy and integrity guarantees with malicious users.

Not being able to keep balance information in smart cards means that there
must be servers where such information is kept.  Central servers mean that our
electronic wallets do not really hold electronic currency but serves only as
an ID card.

Chaum's digicash fixes some of the tampering problems by using cryptography,
but it really is not much better than a checking system -- receivers of the
digicash must contact a centralized server to verify that the digicash hasn't
been previously spent before committing a transaction, or otherwise risk the
digicash ``bouncing''; digicash is not really transferable except through
centralized servers, since the need to trace its transfer path for duplication
detection diametrically opposes the need for anonymity.

What are the risks?  Mainly that of attitudes that we as
scientists/professionals should avoid.  We shouldn't jump on technological
bandwagons.  Public key cryptosystems, electronic wallets and smart cards,
formal methods, etc, are powerful, useful tools, but they are no panacea.  We
must be careful in evaluating exactly how much can be done with them.  Just
because DES-in-steel-boxes may seem old and ``clunky'', there were good
reasons for using it, and we had better think things through before we start
dreaming about (or ``selling'') alternative technologies for the future.

The "Volkskrant", a leading Dutch newspaper carried an article last saturday
about the latest computer hacker arrest in the Netherlands.  It was the first
arrest made under the new Dutch Computer Crime Law.  The hacker was arrested
while sitting at a terminal in the computer room of the Amsterdam University.
When the police arrived late in the afternoon, he was supposedly caught
red-handed. A couple of hours later, the police searched his parents house,
and confiscated some equipment and papers. The hacker was arrested last year
also, but no charges were brought against him at that time. This time he
probably will have a harder time getting out of it, because of the new law. It
is unclear what charges he was arrested on exactly, or what he was doing at
the time of his arrest.  Watch this space for more news.....

The Majority Leader of the Minnesota House of Representatives has just
resigned amid disclosures that his son and nephew obtained his access code for
the state long distance service.  The service involves calling an 800 number
and entering a personal code for making long distance calls related to state
business.  Although the son and nephew reportedly made less than $50 worth of
calls themselves, they shared the codes with their friends.  The total bill is
now estimated at around $85,000 worth of calls.  For now, taxpayers appear to
be liable for the bill.

I think what needs to be mentioned is the reason why he was acquitted (or at
least, the reason that journalists propagated): "He was addicted to hacking".
That, I find, is the weakest explanation I have ever heard about a crime. Just
imagine a society where serial killers are acquitted "because they are
addicted to killing" !

While, IMHO, a prison sentence would have been tough on Mr. Bedworth; a fine,
or some sort of community service would have been welcome.  Why have laws, if
they are not properly applied ?

This posting creates a slightly false impression by not giving the grounds
that the acquittal was acquired on.  The court deemed that Mr Bedworth's
behaviour was uncontrollable by him due to a total addiction to hacking.  In
other words he was unable to form the "guilty mind" that is necessary to get a
conviction in a British court on such charges.  Very much like an acquittal on
any other charge due to being unable to know what you are doing (be the cause
mental illness, temporary effect from prescribed drugs etc).

Despite the Independent's leader, no new precedent has been set has been set
in this case.  It is just the application of a well established piece of
British law to a new statute.

In reply to this:

(1) My primary source was `Waiting for Taurus' by J Green-Armitage in Computer
Weekly March 4 1993 pp 28 - 29. This article states that the considerable
delays and cost overruns were due to a number of problems, including the
security subsystem, management hassles and regulatory delays. To quote the
article `IBM must accept a modicum of blame because it needed an extra three
months in 1992 to finish its solution'.

This article appeared a few days before the project was cancelled and the
chief executive of the stock exchange resigned.

(2) There will be a lot of lawyers picking over this disaster. Two hundred
banks and brokers have lost over half a billion dollars between them, and IBM
seems to be one of three possible defendants (the others are Coopers and the
Stock Exchange itself).

If, as IBM now say, their system was finally signed off a few days before the
project meltdown, then they may get lucky. But they're obviously still
worried.  Why else did they not just keep quiet and let the matter die? If
they hadn't tried to argue the matter, my initial posting to sci.crypt would
have been forgotten by now.

There are all sorts of risks present.  Perhaps IBM should be expanding its
signature verification software to verify that you really want to add a
particular signature to your posting?

There are semantic and syntactic risks too.  The word "official" is
surrounded by quotes, indicating that perhaps it doesn't retain the
normal meaning.

Or perhaps Todd's final line was in OO syntax.  The message "disclaimer"
meaning denial, repudiation, is being sent to the text string denying
the authority of the posting.  Computers routinely know what to do with
double negatives which humans tend to contract into a single negative.  

One speculates whether PGN will append a message, "I normally suppress all
humor except my own.  This one is intriguing,  ..." :-)

[Was: Buy IBM and get fired, Bennet Yee]

I'm not sure what 'digicash' you are talking about. The smartcard based
electronic cash system that Chaum's _company_ DigiCash is marketing does not
require any on-line processing during payment.  The payment protocol uses a
commit-challenge-response structure which can eliminate the need for on-line
communication with a central server. In contrast to other smartcard based
systems there is no system-wide 'master' key stored in a tamper-resistant box
at each shop. The recipient can validate the money by a simple signature
verification using a public key. The system does rely on the tamper-resistance
of the smartcards for security; if anybody 'breaks' a smartcard and extracts
all the keys, then this will allow a limited amount of fraud.

The use of master keys in many smartcard based applications is of course a
serious risk. If the master key is ever compromised for any reason, then the
whole system collapses. It is questionable if storing such a master key in
thousands of tamper-resistant boxes is secure enough. Especially for
electronic cash applications, the fraud potential once the master key is known
is unlimited.

There are several other purely cryptographic systems for electronic cash. The
early systems were indeed on-line to prevent a user from spending the same
piece of money twice. Later systems achieve an off-line payment protocol
without any compromise regarding the privacy. (For more details, see the
Chaum-Fiat-Noar paper of Crypto '88.) All of these systems do NOT require any
tamper-resistant device anywhere, except in the central bank. The security
depends only on the cryptography used. Up to now these kind of systems have
not been used due to their complexity and inefficiency. Recent improvements
have lead to systems which are much more efficient and simpler.

There is a general construction to make any of these systems transferable.
With electronic cash the transferability is less important than with physical
payment systems; it only takes a phone call to hand in the received money and
withdraw some new cash. The transferability has some disadvantages, one of
which is that the size of the money (in bits) MUST grow as it is passed from
one user to another. Another disadvantage is that any user can always
recognise any piece of money that passed through her hands, which reduces the
level of privacy.

The current state of affairs is that electronic cash without tamper-resistant
user devices is technically feasible.  We are considering implementing one of
the newer protocols to provide electronic payments via e-mail.

This is of interest both to human factors people (the military has been

A split version of this message has been sent to the Ethics-L 
list.  It will be sent as one long message to the Risks List.  
 
A user who did not put his E-Mail address in his message, 
wrote the following on the Ethics-L list (ETHICS-L@vm.gmd.de) :
 
&gt; Should the author of shareware be held liable for possible 
&gt; damages caused by the use of their product, and if so to 
&gt; what extent?  Should a shareware author be held liable for 
&gt; the performance of their product in every hardware and software 
&gt; configuration?  
 
First off, I'm not a lawyer but I do know a little about the laws relating to
the operation of a business in general.
 
What you are (in general) referring to are the laws relating to warranty and
"fitness of purpose".  These laws place the general burden of operation for a
product upon the manufacturer or seller, subject to whatever provisions they
warrant; and in addition, each state has some laws of its own relating to
warranty protection.
 
In general, a manufacturer is supposed to provide a product which meets the
"fitness of purpose" test, i.e. an iron should heat and it be warm enough to
press clothes.  It should not explode when plugged in, nor should the person
be electrocuted when touching any metal parts.  If the person is burned by
touching the face plate, that's a consequence of misuse of the product for
which the manufacturer is not responsible.
 
If one makes a program to do accounts payable, it should accept transactions,
print checks and keep a list of checks it printed, among other things.  It
should not crash when started, it should not damage other programs or files on
the system, it should be able to print checks without printing 50 pages of
garbage (and wasting 50 checks).  If the person's checks are ruined because
they put them in upside down, or the printer jammed, that's a consequence of
misuse of the product for which the manufacturer is not responsible.
 
What the law should do is hold the manufacturer of a piece of software
responsible for (1) any bugs he knew about (2) any failure to test under
reasonable conditions of the market place, i.e. running without a printer,
with printer unconnected, without a floppy disk inserted, and make sure it can
recover without damage.  Also a program would be expected to refuse to run
under conditions it can't handle, for example, on any version of DOS less than
2.0, or under MS-Windows except in DOS mode, or whatever.  If it requires VGA
it should quit with a message if one isn't present.  If a program requires a
286 or better, running it on an 8086 should issue a message and it should quit
to the operating system, not crash or lockup the machine.
 
These, and perhaps other requirements, are reasonable minimum standards by
which a program should be required to act.  Under no circumstances should a
program damage other program's files, nor should it be damaging to the
hardware (unless the hardware is extremely delicate and can be damaged simply
by misprogramming, such as with the older Hercules Graphics boards).  Is it
reasonable to assume that someone should have known that something should be
done a certain way?  Crashing and damaging other people's files are evidence
of negligence.  If this is the result of other programs contributing to it,
that's another issue.
 
However, holding a software manufacturer liable for damages is going to be
difficult.  I ain't seen a program publisher who didn't put down a
laundry-list of disclaimers, exclusions and warranty negations, even up to the
point of declaring the software to be "as is".  That's a legal term meaning
the seller makes no representations about the particular item at all; in the
context of computers it could be anything from a fantastic product that does
everything you can imagine and even fulfils needs that you haven't even
realized you had, to a worm that slags the motherboard and roaches the hard
drives, then procedes to jump to other computers via the modem and network
cards and do the same.
 
There is legal precedent in where a man was placed on trial for doing exactly
that; he put in a program patch that destroyed everything in sight when he was
removed from the payroll.  I believe that man is now having an extended
vacation with free room and board as a guest of the People of the State of
Texas.
 
&gt; Should the author of shareware be held liable for possible 
&gt; damages caused by the use of their product, and if so to 
&gt; what extent?  Should a shareware author be held liable for 
&gt; the performance of their product in every hardware and software 
&gt; configuration?  
 
&gt; If they can then it is unlikely that they ever could write 
&gt; program and not get sued.  Should a shareware author be treated
&gt; differently if they make their living off shareware?
 
Technically a person can be sued if they provide a software package for free;
technically anyone can be sued for anything at all; whether someone else can
win and collect from them is another thing altogether.  If the seller is some
guy who makes, say $5,000 a year or less selling programs, nobody is going to
sue him because he probably doesn't carry Errors &amp; Omissions insurance and
he's judgement proof, meaning there's no money for the shyster to go after
even if he does win.
 
Now let's say some large company, with assets is found.  Using the term from
the vernacular, let's call them "Deep Pockets Software, Inc."  Since many
companies are only incorporated in their home state, you have to sue them
there; unless they are doing business in other states (and merely providing
programs to a multistate distributor such as Egghead, Babbages, Waldenbooks,
GTSI, Comp USA, or Micro Center in the area of retail stores, and Cost Plus,
Programmers Shop, Dustin Discount Software or 47th Street Computer in the Mail
Order arena, does not necessarily constitute "doing business") you might not
be able to get service upon them.  You might be able to sue the seller, but if
the company simply put the software out on racks and people buy it, or simply
put a description in a catalog, there may not be grounds for a claim against
the seller since they've made no promises.  If the in-store seller makes it
possible to try the program on their machine first, then the claims are even
weaker.
 
Also, contributory negligence comes into play: You look stupid when the
defense attorney asks, "Did you have recent backups of your computer system's
files?  Aren't you aware you're supposed to have backups?  Did you not read
the message on the package that said 'Do not install this program without
backing up everything'?"  In some states, if the plaintiff (the one suing) is
even 1% at fault, (s)he gets nothing.
 
&gt; For example:  A shareware author writes a disk defragmentation 
&gt; software which is tested and works perfectly on several computer 
&gt; setups.  A person gets the software and runs it on their computer.
&gt; The software destroys several important files which cost the person 
&gt; a large sum of money.  Should the person be able to sue the author 
&gt; of the software?
 
First of all, even if the buyer of the software patched the program so that it
was defective, an ran it despite no backups, and then saw his hard disk
mangled, he can still sue the (1) maker of the hard drive (2) seller of his
computer (3) seller of the software (4) manufacturer of the software (5)
company that made the car that drove him there, etc.
 
The question at hand is whether he can collect damages from any of these
parties.  He can always sue even if he has no case at all; whether he can
collect damages is another thing altogether.
 
You have to look at (1) the purpose of the product at hand (2) intended
audience of the product (3) potential damage which can be caused by the
product and (4) is this something the manufacturer could have foreseen?
 
There are disk defragmenters sold for many different computers, including VAX
systems.  I'll review this for MS DOS systems as I have more familiarity with
those.
 
The purpose of a disk defragmenter is to reduce the number of separate
segments of a file which are stored on a disk, presumably down to one
contiguous set of segments for each file.  As such, a defragmenter program
works at the lowest level of the file system, even manipulating the File
Access Table on an MSDOS computer.  This places it in the class of Maintenance
programs, of a level of dangerousness as a computer virus.  (In fact, you have
to disable any virus checking software to run this sort of thing because it
has to have WRITE ACCESS to the FAT table of the hard disk.)  This is probably
the most dangerous class of user accessible programs around.
 
The best method for constructing a disk defragmenter is to (1) move one or
more file block(s) to an empty spot to either make the space contiguous for a
file or to open up empty space in front of a file in order to make it
contiguous (2) update the fat table with the new location (3) do the next
block.
 
What this does is ensure that the FAT table, the most critical part of the
system, is updated when the information changes.  You don't update the FAT
table until AFTER you move the file.  This way, the worst that can happen - a
reboot, a power failure - the file system is still intact and no damage is
done even if the process dies half-way through.
 
Now, the question at hand is what type of damage occurred, and why it
happened.  First, if the manufacturer failed to tell people to take
precautions (1) disable virus checkers (2) disable disk caching (3) disable
multitasking (4) disable TSRs or anything that keeps a file open (5) run the
program from the DOS prompt, then there would be cause to raise negligence.
 
In fact, if someone wrote a disk defragmenter to run under MS-Windows, or
failed to tell people to shut it down, first, I'd assume that to be almost
automatic negligence.  (In fact, I think people should be told to remove MS
Windows before attempting to get any serious work done.  Not just remove it
from memory, remove and erase it from their system, but that's another story.
:))
 
Now, the question comes up about why the user didn't have a backup of that
critical file or files.  Floppy disks sell for 53c each at a computer store or
less for anything up to 1.44 meg.  (I just bought 100 of them from the local
store, which sells them for 17c each.  If I wanted to go in and buy just one,
it would have been 17c plus tax.)  There is no excuse for failing to have
critical files backed up.
 
The user can raise the issue that he did not know this.  Well, if the program
showed a screen stating these facts and asked if the user wanted to continue,
and he did, there would be a hard time proving that the user didn't know.
 
Let's go further; let's say the user ran the defragmenter, and he does have
his files backed up, but it trashes everything because of a bug in the system.
Then, he could have a case for liability to the extent necessary to pay the
cost of reparation of damages, i.e. the amount of work needed for restoring
his system.  Considering that a diskette takes about one minute to read, plus
maybe 30 seconds to change disks, the time value of someone to restore a
system, plus perhaps lost time discovering files had been damaged, would be
what they could expect, if it was reasonable for this to be expected.  Perhaps
the maximum liability might be $1 per megabyte damaged.  But this would be for
every system damaged.
 
If a manufacturer does not state what his program should not be run on (for
example, IDE or MFM or SCSI or ESDI disks, or whatever), or does not warn of
the consequences of use (you must make sure you have current backups, you have
to disable TSRs, you have to turn off MS-Windows) then they have a problem.
 
The question is reasonableness: what could be reasonably expected to happen in
ordinary use?  If the manufacturer discovers, after 100,000 copies have been
shipped, that there is a bug that if the defragmenter is run between 11:59 pm
and midnight, on the last day of the year on an IDE drive it will damage the
FAT table and exit, it would then be liable for anyone injured by this until
the public had knowledge of this.  Sending a letter to every owner of the
package along with a correction is one way, but the real question is whether
they knew about the problem or could reasonably foresee it.
 
The question of a company's liability for erroneous software is more-or-less
all moot because nobody provides warranties for software.  But, this may
change as software usage becomes so prevalent that these days of "caveat
emptor" (let the buyer beware) stops being tolerated for software packages.
Then the question of what warranty protection the buyer is entitled to comes
into question.  Also, the "standing" of a software company with respect to
what type of work it does is also a question to be answered.
 
The "standing" of a company depends on whether it claims to be professional or
technical.  A professional does not guarantee the work he does, but he does
guarantee that he meets the minimum standards set by the industry he works in,
or by law or both.  For example, a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer all adhere to
the "professional" doctrine: you meet the minimum educational qualifications
needed to be licensed, i.e. you at least know how to do the work in question.
When a professional operates, in the absence of negligence, he is not liable
if his actions fail to fix the problem, as long as his technical
qualifications are intact.  That's why you can't sue a lawyer if your side
loses.  You still have to pay an architect for his drawings even if you don't
like the way the building looks.
 
On the other side is the technical person.  He does not guarantee his
experience, but he does guarantee the technical performance of his work.  For
example, a construction company will use the required materials and
workmanship to construct a bridge according to the architect's specifications.
If the bridge fails, as long as the materials and workmanship were
satisfactory to complete the task as described, the builder isn't liable.  He
may have just graduated from hod carrier to owner of a construction company,
but he does guarantee he will follow the requirements and not use materials of
less quality than is required for the task.
 
In the Software industry, we are attempting to exclude both classifications of
qualification: we do not claim to have the professional background (in some
cases, the people who are in the industry cannot do so; many of them may not
even have the qualifications), so we cannot stand on professionalism, i.e.  we
can't guarantee our ability to do the work.  And because we can't know that
the programs will work, nor can we guarantee we know what the best methods
there are out there, we can't guarantee the product.  Since we cannot
guarantee our qualifications, and we can't guarantee our product, places that
make computer programs are refusing to guarantee {anything}.
 
I think the ability to do this will be limited in the future as common
practice and legislation force the makers of software to take some
responsibility for their creations.  Incidents like the attempt by the State
of New Jersey a couple of years ago to license programmers is one such
foretaste of things to come.

	Several months ago we started noticing that (now and again) the
network connection to the mainland would become very very slow; this would
continue for 10-15 minutes or so, then all would suddenly be well again.  A
while after this started happening a coworker of mine complained to me that
the connection to the mainland _never_ worked anymore. It seems that he had
some FORTRAN source that he needed to copy to a machine on the mainland, but
he never could because "the network wouldn't stay up long enough for the ftp
to complete".

	Yes, it turned out that the network outages happened whenever he
attempted to ftp that _particular_ FORTRAN source file to the mainland. We
next tried compressing the file; it copied just fine then (but unfortunately
the machine on the mainland had no uncompress program, so it was still no go).
Finally we "split" his FORTRAN program up into very small pieces and sent them
one at a time. Most of the pieces would copy without trouble, but a few would
either not go at all or only go after many _many_ retries.

	Examining the troublesome pieces, we found they all had one thing in
common: they contained comment blocks that began and ended with lines
consisting of nothing but capital C's (his preferred FORTRAN commenting
style). At this point we started sending e-mail to the network gurus on the
mainland asking for help. Of course, they wanted to see an example of our
un-ftp-able files, so we mailed some to them... but our mail never got there.
Finally we got the bright idea of simply _describing_ what the unsendable
files were like. That worked. :-) [Dare I include in this message an example
of one of the offending FORTRAN comment blocks? Probably better not!]

	Eventually we were able to piece together the story. A new gateway had
recently been installed between our part of campus and the connection to the
mainland. This gateway had GREAT difficulty transmitting packets that
contained repeated blocks of capital C's!!!! Just a few such packets would
occupy all its energies and prevent most everything else from getting through.
At this point we complained to the gateway manufacturer... and were told "Oh,
yes, you've hit the repeated C's bug! We know about that already.".
Eventually we solved the problem... by buying new gateways from another
manufacturer. (In the manufacturer's defense I suppose an inability to
propagate FORTRAN programs might be considered a feature by some!)

I Found the squib below on the Prodigy service -- 

  QUIRKS                                 Offbeat Computer News              

  Mary Bandar recently turned down an invitation to attend kindergarten with
  others born in '88.  "Boy, wouldn't those kids ever be surprised when they
  see me coming to school," Bander, 104, told the Associated Press. "Why would
  they want me? I know the ABCs yet. And I can count to 10," said the Winona,
  Minn, resident, who was born in 1888.

  Sister Mary Donald Miller, superintendent of Winona Area Catholic Schools,
  told the AP that the mix-up occurred when school officials instructed a
  computer to search for the names of people born in '88.

The RISKS aware person might ask a few more questions-- which computer was the
school using?  Where is this central database of all the people in Winona,
Minnesota?  Who puts the data into it, and who decides who else can pull the
data out?

I expect that as we approach the millenium, we'll see a lot more of
these "off by a century" errors.

From: Derek Cooper &lt;RCAA000@maple.cc.kcl.ac.uk&gt;

From the London Times today (I did check that it's not April 1st!)-

  Officers in Warrington Cheshire fed up with people listening in to their
  messages, broadcast that a flying saucer had crash-landed in a field &amp; gave
  details of where to find it.

  Radio messages about a huge glowing spacecraft were broadcast with the
  warning "Do not approach.  It may be radioactive."  The warning was followed
  by directions to the field in Appleton.  The eavesdroppers arrived within
  minutes, expecting to see little green men.  They were arrested instead.

  Police said that 5 people had been reported to the Crown Prosecution Service
  for telecommunications offences.  Scanning devices that can pick up police
  radio messages are widely available but using them to listen to police
  transmissions is an offence.

     [I have seen this on several groups.  There is a question whether it
     is actually illegal if you are merely listening, as opposed to doing
     something about it.  PGN]

From a NY Times article (3/29/93, p. A1,B2) on financial and management
problems at NY state health insurer Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield:

  Empire was forced to write off $50 million that had gone uncollected or
  unbilled because of computer problems dating to the mid-1970's, according to
  an internal report obtained by The New York Times.
    One glitch involved a computer system that could not understand bills of
  $100,000 or more.  A $103,000 charge, for example, would be interpreted as
  only $3000, and the smaller amount would be billed to the client.  That
  failure occurred 29 times and cost Empire $3 million, the report said.

[Management comments about such problems being ancient history and Empire's
real problems lying elsewhere.]

  Still, the computer problems persist. An expensive new electric system
  for handling claims --- being developed by a former board member --- was
  expected to be finished about 18 months ago, but is not likely to be
  completed until later this year.  Empire has invested $17 million in that
  venture.

As baseball season is upon us, those who belong to fantasy leagues begin to
devour all available material about players, statistics, injuries, and so on.
One such supplier of these needed facts and opinions, The Fantasy Baseball
Journal, recently apologized for a particularly buggy issue.  They attribute
the printing errors to a "so-called virus that has seeped onto our computer
network."  This is not so startling, as we all know this kind of thing can
happen.  What is startling is the claim in the FBJ that "if [the virus] is the
problem, then that's solvable."  Perhaps these baseball statisticians are
smarter that we thought...

Subject: TCAS Glitchs

Organization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)

I've been a controller at the Cleveland ARTCC for 22 yrs. I've always welcomed
the arrival of any new procedure or technology that can enhance our ability to
safely separate air traffic. TCAS has proven to be one such aid. However, a
problem has been discovered which has the potential to be disastrous.

Here is the problem:
 Aircraft "A" is climbing to an assigned altitude of 23,000' (as an example),
while aircraft "B" is descending to an assigned altitude of 24,000'. The two
a/c are on converging courses and their combined verticle closure rate is
high, in this case we'll say about 6000' fpm. TCAS (on each aircraft) does
what is called a coordinated interrogation, meaning the equipment talks back
and forth and decides on the best resolution. Of course, the TCAS has no way
of knowing the aircraft are intending to both level off 1,000' apart, so it
issues a resolution advisory (RA) to both flight crews telling them to
INCREASE their respective rates of climb and descent. This is in direct
conflict to the controllers clearances. Only after the controller notices the
mode c readouts deviating from the assigned altitudes is he aware of a
problem. (actually, the frightcrews (pun intended) are required to inform the
controller that they are responding to a TCAS RA, but due to frequency
blockage, other duties, etc.  this may not happen. Upon seeing the deviation,
the controller attempts to have the aircraft return to their assigned
altitudes.

There have been several incidents similar to this fictional one. The loss
of separation has been severe (as little as 200') and resulted from the
crews confusion on who's instructions to follow. In the past few weeks,
the FAA has issued directives to all controllers to NOT attempt to 
countermand a TCAS RA. By following only the TCAS RA, it is felt that the
separation, even though less than standard, will be sufficient.

The so-called hacker, the twenty-year-old Ronald O., whom we caught on one of
our PC's doing things as yet unknown at Delft University, will be in temporary
custody (or whatever the correct English term for that is) for 30 more days.
This is to give the police more time to gather evidence.

According to the papers, forged credit cards were found while searching his
home, and that also will not help his case.  He is supposedly unwilling to
answer any questions at this point, but is charged with crimes that could send
him to jail for a maximum of four years.

Although I am definitely not suggesting he is a nice guy, somehow I have some
difficulty connecting this nervous kid in our room with a sentence of four
years. I hope that being the first to be caught under the new law, and in the
act to boot, is not going to give him too much extra attention from law
officers.

Never forget the RISK of someone dying to try out his new toy. This goes for
hackers and law enforcement personnel alike.

Over the past couple of weeks it has been pleasant to see the dangers of
faulty information held on computer being acknowledged in Britain.  Under the
Data Protection Act (1986) in this country a Data Protection Registrar was set
up to monitor uses of computers to store personal information and to be an
independent source of help to get faulty data corrected.

Recently a television advert has been running showing clips of actors
mentioning problems that can happen with computer systems (My building society
thinks I died three years ago, According to my bank I have a criminal record
etc.) finishing with the address of the Data Protection Registrar and a
voice-over saying that if you have problems with faulty information held on
you to contact him.  People in other countries might like to know that it is
possible to for officialdom to acknowledge risks of faulty information.

Drawing on a variety of newspaper and magazine articles I hope I can sketch a
slightly wider picture of the case.  The best overall article I have seen is
in this week's New Scientist, (27 March 1993), which I recommend for further
reading.

A little terse I'm afraid, but here is my precis:

On 26 June 1991 British police arrested 3 men who had been cooperating in
hacking a number of university, government and commercial computer systems
across the world.  Individually they used the handles "Gandalf", "Wandaii" and
"Lizard", collectively they called themselves the "Eight Legged Groove
Machine".  They left messages to system managers on some hacked systems signed
"8LGM" or "Eight Little Green Men".

They did not meet, or even know each others real names and addresses, until
they were introduced by the arresting officers, but discussed hacking,
passwords and vulnerable systems on bulletin boards and hacked systems.

Karl Strickland, 22, of Liverpool and Neil Woods, 26, of Oldham in Lancashire
were charged with conspiracy to dishonestly obtain telecommunications
services, having pleaded guilty they are waiting to be sentenced.

Paul Bedworth, then 18, of Ilkley in West Yorkshire was charged with two
counts of conspiracy under the Computer Misuse Act, and one of conspiring to
dishonestly obtain telecommunications services.

It is interesting that the Crown Prosecution Service chose to charge Bedworth
with conspiracy, rather than a simpler charge of unauthorised access
to/modification of a computer system.  This decision was the foundation of the
acquittal, requiring the prosecution to demonstrate that he had a "guilty
mind" at the time of the hacking.

In court Bedworth's solicitor, (lawyer to you US folks), claimed that the case
was a show trial, and brought in a psychiatric expert who described Bedworth
as having a "nonchemical dependence" on using a computer.

It is hard to see how a compulsion to use computers, or even to hack, can be
adequate grounds for acquittal, indeed the judge quite clearly directed the
jury to disregard this.  Nevertheless the jury returned not guilty verdicts on
all charges.  It is impossible to know their reasoning, as it is a criminal
offence to publish any details of the jurors deliberations.

Much of the press, including the New Scientist article, represent this as
setting a legal precedent.  Firstly, this doesn't make sense, because nobody
can say what the supposed precedent is.  Secondly, only the ruling of a judge
can do this, (subject to appeal to a higher courts, ..).

In this case we can do little but accept that our jury system has again
demonstrated it's unpredictability.  Though this is of little consolation to
those institutions who suffered expensive tampering with their systems, and
had to foot tens of thousands of pounds of phone bills, due to the actions of
these men.

&gt; ...places that make computer programs are refusing to guarantee {anything}.
&gt;This is as it should be.  The risk is not that software might not work; the
&gt;risk is that people blindly assume that it worked, is working, or will work.

A mildly related thought is that the following sort of problem will frequently
rear its ugly head in the near future: An engineer (or architect, etc.)
screws up and is sued, but the problem is traced back to a faulty piece of
third-party software that he or she used.  Now the court must try to untangle
the liabilities, a process that will require detailed technical knowledge that
no judge or jury is likely to have.

MUNROE FALLS CARRYOUT
Akron Beacon Journal (AK) - WEDNESDAY March 24, 1993, A14
 
The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution was written to safeguard ordinary
citizens against unreasonable search and seizure.  Recently, however,
law-enforcement officials have taken to seizing possessions of convicted and
suspected criminals, particularly drug dealers.
 
   In the case of 23-year-old Munroe Falls resident Mark Lehrer, police
confiscated a sophisticated, $3,000 computer setup, programs and disks on the
suspicion that he might be letting kids look at dirty pictures. That charge
was never proved.  In fact, it appears that police received only one or two
complaints about his computer bulletin board, none from area parents.  Lehrer
contends a clerical error put the pornography into files accessible to all the
bulletin board's users, not just adults.  Police enlisted a 15-year-old,
falsified his identity for a membership and then helped the teen call up a
possibly offending program.
 
   But, when the Summit County grand jury refused to indict the University of
Akron computer whiz on the original charges, Munroe Falls police filed other
charges based on the possibility that some of the programs in Lehrer's private
collection contained pictures of minors.
 
   Lehrer did plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 'attempted possession of
criminal tools' -- his computer -- based on those subsequent charges.
 
   No one downplays the seriousness of crime in our society, whether it's in
the suburbs or inner cities. None argue that children should be able to view
pornography.
 
   But in the absence of compelling evidence that Lehrer was trying to peddle
child porn to kids, either at the outset of this case nine months ago or now,
it could appear that the police acted hastily in confiscating the computer.
Such actions invite questions as to whether the police were protecting against
a child pornographer or using the intimidating powers of the police and
judicial system to help themselves to a nice hunk of expensive machinery. dl

In a copyrighted story, the March 24 Washington Post includes an article
describing a ruling by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals that Virginia's
law requiring a SSN to register to vote is unconstitutional.

The decision is being hailed by civil rights groups as a victory for the 4
million Virginians who are registered to vote.  Because voter roles are public
information, registering to vote is equivalent to publishing your SSN.  The
judges wrote "The harm that can be inflicted from the disclosure of a Social
Security Number to an unscrupulous individual is alarming and potentially
ruinous....  The statute at issue compels a would-be voter in Virginia to
consent to the possibility of a profound invasion of privacy."

A spokesperson for the Virginia Attorney General's office said they have not
decided whether to appeal the ruling.

The case was brought by Marc Alan Greidinger, a 29-year-old Fredricksburg
lawyer (who represented himself) after he was denied the right to register to
vote because he refused to reveal his SSN.  Greidinger said that during the
lawsuit he gave his SSN who was able to get his current balance on two loans,
last payment dates, and university transcripts.

It is not believed that the ruling will affect other state agencies
(such as motor vehicles) which require SSNs, because those are not
considered public records.

The article mentions help from the Public Citizen Litigation Group
(one of the Ralph Nader organizations), and quotes the legal director
for the ACLU, which was not involved in the case.

Our local "News Radio 74" has a feature called "the Osgood File" in which
Charles Osgood talks for several minutes.  This morning his topic was Social
Security numbers.  He said a little, but missed some very important points.

He talked about the invasions of privacy that were possible with someone
else's SSN, but said only one or two sentences about possible loss of money.
He mentioned that cards used to say "Not to be used for ID purposes" and don't
say that anymore, but did not talk at all about which uses are actually
illegal.  He talked about a lawyer in Virginia (?) who sued the election
officials because they required his SSN to register to vote and then sold the
lists to special interest groups.  But he did not say anything about all the
other abuses that happen, and especially did not give any advice on how to
reduce your risk.

I was disappointed with the report.  He could have given some very useful
information about our rights and the danger of SSNs, but aside from a closing
comment about "Remember, if they've got your Social Security number they've
got your number!" there was almost nothing in the report that was actually
useful to a listener.

PRESS RELEASE, March 26, 1993

"FEDERAL APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS PRIVACY: USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER LIMITED
CPSR Expresses Support for Decision"

A federal court of appeals has ruled that Virginia's divulgence of the Social
Security numbers of registered voters violates the Constitution.  The Court
said that Virginia's registration scheme places an "intolerable burden" on the
right to vote.

	The result comes nearly two years after Marc Greidinger, a resident of
Falmouth, Virginia, first tried to register to vote.  Mr. Greidinger said that
he found it nearly impossible to obtain a driver's license, open accounts with
local utilities or even rent a video without encountering demands for his
Social Security number.

	Mr. Greidinger told the New York Times this week that when the State
of Virginia refused to register him as a voter unless he provided his Social
Security number he decided to take action.  He brought suit against the state,
and argued that Virginia should stop publishing the Social Security numbers of
voters.

	This week a federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia ruled that the
state's practice constituted "a profound invasion of privacy" and emphasized
the "egregiousness of the harm" that could result from dissemination of an
individual's SSN.

	Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), a national
membership organization of professionals in the computing field, joined with
Mr.  Greidinger in the effort to change the Virginia system.  CPSR, which had
testified before the U.S. Congress and the state legislature in Virginia about
growing problems with the misuse of the SSN, provided both technical and legal
support to Mr. Greidinger.  CPSR also worked with Paul Wolfson of the Public
Citizen Litigation Group, who argued the case for Mr. Greidinger.

	In an amicus brief filed with the court, CPSR noted the long-standing
interest of the computing profession in the design of safe information systems
and the particular concerns about the misuse of the SSN.  The CPSR brief
traced the history of the SSN provisions in the 1974 Privacy Act.  The brief
also described how the widespread use of SSNs had led to a proliferation of
banking and credit crime and how SSNs were used to fraudulently obtain credit
records and federal benefits.

  	CPSR argued that the privacy risk created by Virginia's collection and
disclosure of Social Security numbers was unnecessary and that other
procedures could address the State's concerns about records management.

  	This week the court of appeals ruled that the state of Virginia must
discontinue the publication of the Social Security numbers of registered
voters.  The court noted that when Congress passed the Privacy Act of 1974 to
restrict the use of the Social Security number, the misuse of the SSN was "one
of the most serious manifestations of privacy concerns in the Nation."

    The Court then said that since 1974, concerns about SSN confidentiality
have "become significantly more compelling. For example, armed with one's SSN,
an unscrupulous individual could obtain a person's welfare benefits, or Social
Security benefits, order new checks at a new address, obtain credit cards, or
even obtain the person's paycheck."

	The Court said that Virginia's voter registration scheme would "compel
a would-be voter in Virginia to consent to the possibility of a profound
invasion of privacy when exercising the fundamental right to vote."

	The Court held that Virginia must either stop collecting the SSN or
stop publicly disclosing it.

	Marc Rotenberg, director of the CPSR Washington office said, "We are
extremely pleased with the Court's decision.  It is a remarkable case, and a
real tribute to Marc Greidinger's efforts.  Still, there are many concerns
remaining about the misuse of the Social Security number.  We would like to
see public and private organizations find other forms of identification for
their computing systems.  As the federal court made clear, there are real
risks in the misuse of the Social Security number."

	Mr. Rotenberg also said that he hoped the White House task force
currently studying plans for a national health care claims payment system
would develop an identification scheme that did not rely on the Social
Security Number.  "The privacy concerns with medical records are particularly
acute.  It would be a serious design error to use the SSN," said Mr.
Rotenberg.

	Cable News Network (CNN) will run a special segment on the Social
Security number and the significance of the Greidinger case on Sunday evening,
March 28, 1993.  The Court's opinion is available from the CPSR Internet
Library via Gopher/ftp/WAIS.  The file name is
"cpsr/ssn/greidinger_opinion.txt".  The CPSR amicus brief is available as
"cpsr/ssn/greidinger_brief.txt".

  	CPSR is a national membership organization, based in Palo Alto,
California.  CPSR conducts many activities to protect privacy and civil
liberties.  Membership is open to the public and support is welcome.  For more
information about CPSR, please contact, CPSR, P.O. Box 717, Palo Alto, CA
94302, call 415/322-3778 or email cpsr@csli.stanford.edu.

       Society for the Promotion of Ergonomically Reasonable Measurement
                                                Peter Mellor, 1st April 1993

This is to announce the formation of the above-named Society.

Aims:

1. To resist the use of meaningless scales of measurement. 
   
2. To improve the friendliness of information systems. 

3. To resist imposed uniformity. 

4. To counteract official nonsense with unofficial nonsense. 

5. To have a good piss-up at least once a year. 

6. Err...that's it.


Discussion of Aims:

There is a regrettable tendency today to make everything more friendly to 
computers, and less friendly to people. Even some recent changes which were 
intended to make calculations easier for humans have had unfortunate effects. 

For example, when measuring the height and weight of people, is it more 
meaningful to say:

  "Pete Mellor is 1.880 metres tall, and weighs 79.378 kilogrammes stripped." 

or:

  "Pete Mellor is 6' 2" tall, tips the scales at 12 and 1/2 stone, and looks 
  quite striking in a pair of tight-fitting flared jeans."? 

Supporters of the aims of the Society would all agree that the second of 
these descriptions is easier to grasp, and conveys far more information 
that is likely to be of interest than the first. 

The Society therefore supports the use of scales of measurement that are
scaled to people. So, for instance, the inch (length of top joint of thumb) is
more informative than the millimetre when doing anything on a small scale.
Going up one level of scale, the foot (distance from big toe to heel) and yard
(distance from tip of nose to end of middle finger of outstretched arm) have
served architects and furniture makers well for centuries. The metre, by
comparison, is too large for small work, and too small for large. Nobody ever
uses the decimetre or decametre anyway, so most of the metric system is
immediately redundant. Similar remarks apply to grammes and kilogrammes versus
ounces and pounds.

The scales of measurement that have evolved with us are the ones that we find
most natural to use. This applies even when it comes to measuring new things,
like software. The Society therefore promotes the measurement of source code
in hands (applied vertically up the side of a pile of print-out, in the same
way that the height of a horse is measured).

The Biblically minded may use the cubit for medium-scale measurement,
otherwise the use of the rod, pole or perch is recommended.

The system of units that the Society favours will be known as the "ton, 
furlong, fortnight" system. 


Political Allegiance:

In the UK, the society will seek the support of the Rainbow Alliance, and the 
personal patronage of Screaming Lord Sutch and Cynthia Paine. 

In Italy, it is hoped that La Cicciolina will be persuaded to sponsor us. 

In other countries, all suggestions welcome. 


Diversity:

Any Eurocrap aimed at doing away with our essential differences is deprecated. 

For example, in the UK pillar boxes and telephones should be red, in Germany 
they should be yellow. 

The Society believes that books written in Britain should be spelt according
to the Oxford Dictionary. Americans who do not wish to follow this standard
are encouraged to use Mencken. The Society fully supports the Academie
Francaise in its attempt to prevent its fine language from being corrupted by
either American or English. In fact, it would like to see the Germans doing
more, such as reintroducing Gothic script. The same goes for the Welsh, Irish,
Russians, etc.

The intention is to cause a fragmentation of knowledge across language 
boundaries. Since there is already far too much information around for anyone 
to use sensibly, this would be entirely beneficial. 

Any academic who really wants to know what is going on in artificial 
intelligence at the University of Beijing should have the dedication to 
learn Mandarin Chinese! 


Membership:

The fee is 17s. 6d. per annum, payable to: "P. Mellor Ethanol Supplies Ltd." 

Annual meetings will be held in the King's Head, Upper Street, Islington, 
London, where beer is still sold at 1 pound 16 shillings per pint. 
(Dates to be arranged to suit members.) 

Paid-up members may charge for consultations on any matter regarding 
measurement, provided fees are quoted in the appropriate national currency, 
e.g., a UK member should quote a consultancy rate in guineas per fortnight. 
(Any attempt to quote in ECUs will result in immediate expulsion.) 


Other points:

The use of metric sizes of nuts and bolts in the UK should be discontinued 
in favour of Whitworth. 

Aeroplane prices should be quoted in the currency of the country of origin. 
For example, British aeroplanes should be sold at so many pounds sterling per 
hundredweight, like everything else of a comparable size. 

If this causes a problem in purchasing an A320, it is recommended that the
individual bits be bought independently from the various members of the Airbus
Industrie consortium in the appropriate national currencies and that these are

In a humorous vein, I've regularly proposed a "programmer's cruise" that would
depart on December 30, 1999.  The cruise would be 30 days long and would come
with the following guarantees:

* The ship would be be controlled by mechanical or simple electric
  controls -- no computers in the loop.

* The crew would be tested on their ability to navigate via dead reckoning
  and celestial navigation.

* It's route would avoid going under established routes for airliners and
  would stay out of the normal shipping lanes.

* It would be impossible for anyone on-board to be contacted from the shore.

* Anything else that could be done to avoid date-related failures.

Given the spate of date-related failures, I'm starting to give it serious
consideration.

The "Tagespiegel", a Berlin daily, carried an article on Monday describing the
problems encountered switching from Middle European Time to Middle European
Summer Time on Sunday. It seems that the Bavarian Police Computer System was
caught unawares, and responded by closing down. "Inpol", which stores all
information about persons the police are looking for, as well as having
connections to the car and stolen car registries and other databases, just
stopped.

From 3 a.m. on no checks could be made at the borders or for stopped cars,
except for alcohol tests. A dragnet action, scheduled for 4 a.m. was carried
out despite the data loss, but only resulted in 16 arrests for DUI. The cause
of the error was still being feverishly searched for as the paper went to
press.  [no update in Tuesday's papers, so they must have found it ;-)]

An item on BBC news a few days ago described how the latest shuttle launch was
aborted when the control computers closed down the main engines 3 seconds
before lift-off.

It was reported that the system had detected a stuck fuel valve. 

If so, this appears to be a case of a computer system doing the 
right thing for once, and probably saving the lives of the astronauts. 

Does anyone have any more information on the incident?

There was an item a couple issues ago about a phone fraud case in the
Minnesota Legislature.  Events since then may be of interested to RISKS
readers.

As reported previously, the Majority Leader of the Minnesota House of
Representatives (the second most powerful position in the House) hid an
$85,000 phone fraud problem for several months.

The fraud occurred because the Majority Leader's son revealed his father's
access code to the state phone system to a few of his friends, who then told
it to others, and so on.  The system was set up to allow users to dial in on
an 800 number, enter the code, then dial any number.

Once the fraud was publicly revealed the scandal has grown and the leadership
of the DFL (the Minnesota Democratic party) has been working overtime on
damage control.  Already there are articles in the local press (normally
supporters of the DFL) suggesting that they has become "too arrogant" in its
power.

Since the discovery of the fraud the following has occurred:

* The Majority Leader was forced to resign from his post.

* There has been an effort by the Democrats to shift the blame to MCI, who is
  the Legislature's long distance provider.  The Republicans, sensing a
  political opportunity, are battling efforts to shift the blame.

* The House suspended its rules to approve an amendment to Minnesota's Open
  Meeting act, which restricts what types of public business can be conducted
  in private.  The amendment adds the Legislature to the list of public bodies
  which are affected by the law, which is a step that many have felt desirable
  for years.

The case has recently taken a turn into the realm of privacy law.  The Ramsey
County Attorney (the county in which the state Capitol is located) yesterday
issued a grand jury subpoena for the detailed phone records of every member of
the House.  Many members are opposed to this on the grounds that
communications between them and their constituents are privileged.  State law
is unclear on the issue and it is likely that the subpoena will be challenged
in court.  Separately, the House Speaker has asked the District Court to rule
on whether she can release the records.

In addition to the investigation by the County Attorney, State Attorney General
Hubert H. Humphrey III has opened a criminal investigation into the matter.

The local paper had a bit more information.  I believe that the database in
question was one maintained by the church that Mary Bandar belongs to, in
which she is listed by consent.  This does not seem to be the usual bugbear 
of huge and ill-controlled government databases.

More interesting to me from a RISKS perspective is that the clerk who
generated the form letters to potential kindergarteners actually *typed*
"1988" -- it was the program itself that accepted but discarded the leading
digits, without notice.  Sorry, no idea what software was in use.

Further to the mailing by Peter Debenham &lt;PPXPMD@ppn1.nott.ac.uk&gt; in 
<A HREF="/Risks/14.44.html">RISKS-14.44</A>: 

&gt; Recently a television advert has been running showing clips of actors
&gt; mentioning problems that can happen with computer systems  ... 

It is interesting that the government is embarking on a publicity campaign 
now. I do not recall a comparable campaign when the act first came into 
force, though this may be due to erasable memory chips between the ears. 
DP professionals certainly had it drawn to their attention by poster 
campaigns and training sessions provided internally by large computer 
manufacturers, but I don't *think* there were any TV ads. 

&gt; Under the Data Protection Act (1986) in this country a Data Protection 
&gt; Registrar was set up to monitor uses of computers to store personal 
&gt; information and to be an independent source of help to get faulty data 
&gt; corrected.

This poses certain risks for computer users. Suppose that I keep 
the following information on-line for my own reference: 

a) Names and addresses of professional contacts. 

b) Notes on their research interests. 

c) Names and birthdays of members of their families. (It might be good for 
   business if I sent their kids birthday cards! :-) 

d) Comments such as: "This guy is an idiot. Don't get into any more projects 
   with him!" 

As I understand it, I am not required to register as a data holder if I 
merely keep type a) data. I am *probably* required to register if I keep  
b), and more so if I keep type c). 

In any case, it is extremely unlikely that I would be prosecuted for failing 
to register unless I were foolish enough to keep type d) data and also to 
supply a copy of my file to someone who passed it back to the person about 
whom I had written nasty comments. 

The University keeps computer files with staff and student records. Naturally 
it is registered and every employee or student has the right to see the 
information held and demand that it be corrected if it is error. (In fact, 
hard copies are posted to staff periodically to remind them to update their 
records, e.g., change of address.) 

What about e-mail, though? Suppose I send a piece of vitriolic e-mail about 
a particular student to another member of staff (not that I would, of 
course! :-). Am I in breach of the Act by sending the e-mail? Am I in breach 
of the Act if I keep an on-line copy? Is the recipient in breach by filing 
an on-line copy, and if the recipient keeps one but I don't, am I still 
liable? Is the recipient in breach while it resides in the destination 
mail-box before it is read? Are we both covered by the fact that the 
University is registered? (In fact I *think* the Act requires registration 
of particular systems.)  

Regardless of whether we should register or not, does every student in the 
University have the right to read every e-mail memo about them sent between 
staff if these have been stored on-line? If comments are felt to be unfair, 
should the student be able to demand that the record of past correspondence 
be toned down even though the vitriolic original was read and acted upon 
long ago, or would it suffice simply to print and file a hard copy of the 
memo and delete it from the on-line file, thereby removing it from the terms 
of the Act? 

I am not thoroughly familiar with the wording of the Act, but I suspect the 
answers to some of the above questions are far from obvious. 

Does anyone know how successful the Act has been in terms of prosecutions 
for unregistered holding of data or justified demands for corrections? 
Have any test cases established precedents for the points I have raised? 

Perhaps a publicity campaign should be aimed at holders of data who might 
be unwittingly breaking the law (as was the earlier campaign at the time the 
Act came into force).

-&gt;According to the papers, forged credit cards were found while searching his
-&gt;home, and that also will not help his case.  He is supposedly unwilling to
-&gt;answer any questions at this point, but is charged with crimes that could 
-&gt;send him to jail for a maximum of four years.

Don't forget that when he was arrested the previous time, he also was
unwilling to answer any questions. This gives a good motive for 'nailing' this
guy. The credit cards shouldn't be much of a problem for him, because
possession of them is not as big an offense as actually using them, and that's
hard to prove.

-&gt;Although I am definitely not suggesting he is a nice guy, somehow I have some
-&gt;difficulty connecting this nervous kid in our room with a sentence of four
-&gt;years. I hope that being the first to be caught under the new law, and in the
-&gt;act to boot, is not going to give him too much extra attention from law
-&gt;officers.

I'm afraid that being the first will only make for a harsh trial, to set an
example.  It's not only the first time a hacker will go to trial under the new
law, it's also the first time one was caught red-handed. A sentence of four
years will not only ruin those four years for him, but the rest of his career
will also be in severe danger. I hope the judge has done his homework on
computers though...

(Trials in the Netherlands do not work with juries, which might be to his 
advantage, because in this case, the parties involved will at least know what
they are talking about...)

On returning from my US vacation yesterday, I found a strange letter asking me
to contact my old bank whose accounts I'd closed more than a year and a half
ago.  On calling the bank today, they tell me that an Avis car rental was
billed to my old VISA card I had with then, although I'd charged it to another
card when I made the rental.  The a/c number they used was the one used on the
application form.  Must be yet another benefit of having an Avis ``Wizard
Card''.

So, this begs the question: Will any random digit sequence work as long as the
leading digits point to a real bank?  [Not if they do a real-time check.  PGN]

This is just another problem caused by renting from Avis.  The last time I did
it, their data on me was misused and cost me some US$2000 through fraudulent
`telephone' transactions of which I've only recoved half of, some 6 months
later.

&gt; [I have seen this on several groups.  There is a question whether it

Might as well indulge my sense of the obvious by inserting, "...under UK
laws."  I don't know if they subscribe to the idea, as we do in the US, that
most things heard on the air may be listened to and even acted upon with
impunity.  (Newsies with a police/fire scanner take advantage of this, for
instance.)  According to my faulty memory of possibly obsolete US broadcast
law, *disclosing* the contents of non-broadcast transmissions is the no-no.

I had a very similar problem last year with the SLIP link to my house.  Every
time I tried to FTP the individual files making up the infamous PC game
Wolfenstein 3D, the transfer hung at the same point in one particular file. A
compressed archive of the same files went over fine.

Investigation showed that the offending data sequence was a long string of
ascii '+' characters.  This is the default "command escape" character on a
modem with the Hayes command set. To escape from data mode to command mode,
you send '+++' preceded and followed by at least a second of idle time. But I
*wasn't* triggering the command escape. The modem stayed in data mode. It just
corrupted my packets.

The modems in question were Motorola/Codex 3260 FASTs, which support DTE
speeds up to 115.2 kb/s. It seems that at such a high link speed,
whatever special processing the modems do on the '+' character (e.g.,
restarting a timer) takes more than one character time. So if you send
too many '+' characters in a row the modem's fifo eventually overflows.

The workaround was to change the command escape character to 128, which
effectively disabled the in-band escape feature, and to use DTR to control the
modem state. Not only is this completely reliable, it's faster too. And it
avoids Hayes' stupid patent on the "+++" sequence, a worthwhile goal in
itself.

The April 5th 1993 edition of the Washington Post contains a short item
describing how AT&amp;T is modifying some of the technology it developed for
submarine warfare to smooth traffic flow on the highways.  They are currently
testing the system on the New Jersey Turnpike where they've installed
"SmartSonic" sensors that ... ``measure the speed of passing vehicles by
listening to their individual sounds or `acoustical signatures' just as they
have been used to listen to other submarines.''

The RISKS? The system will supposedly control ramp access and offer
alternative, less-congested routes.  This means we are effectively replacing a
low-level system with one that is high-level and if not drive-by-wire, at
least navigate-by-wire.  I have no ideas whether the highways obey/mimic
differential equations that are potentially chaotic, but I hope they will
check these things out.

Naturally, the privacy arguments about electronic tollbooths apply to this
situation.  I can imagine the 21st century crook on the lam (and lambs
avoiding the crook): he hacks his carburetor chip to change the distinctive
signature of his car.  Or better yet, he hacks his DSP-controlled

This article appeared in the New Orleans Times Picayune on Thursday,
April 2. It in interesting to note that a software company
unknowing helped these teenagers in their escapade.

Four 16-year-old students were issued misdemeanor citations by Slidell (a
suburb of New Orleans) police for unlawful use of a license.  Apparently they
had made phony driver licenses using one of the student's father computer and
a desk top publisher program.  The driver licenses were from the states of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington.  The 4 students would manufacture these
IDs and sell them for $30.  The students were all honor students from one of
the local high schools.

The police seized a computer disk, a cutting board and a lam&lt;inating device
from the home of one of the students. The arresting officer said that the 4
students picked Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Washington states because they
assumed bar owners in the area would be less likely to scrutinize driver's
licenses from so far away.

The four told the police they researched the appearances of driver's licenses
from the three states they chose and then called a computer software company
to learn how to replicate the typefaces used in the logos of the three states.
They then punched into the computer fake names, addresses, social security
numbers, license issuance and expiration dates and birth dates. Those that
wanted to buy one of these fake licenses went to a photo booth at places like
K-Mart to obtain photos. The ringleaders placed the photos on the fake
licenses, cut them to proper size and then laminated them.

It is interesting to note the way the students were caught. A street informant
working for the Slidell police department told police of the enterprise in
February. I wonder how long it would have taken the police to spot the phony
licenses without the street contact.

Here is a classic example of the screw-ups that can happen when a simple
number gets mangled in a computer database.

I am a member of the Columbia House CD Club.  The way such clubs work is you
get a bunch of (nearly) free CDs at the beginning of your membership, with an
obligation to purchase a certain number within a specified time.  They reserve
the right to bill you for unpurchased CDs if you do not fulfill the
obligation.

Last Summer, the US Post Office gave us a new zip code (the population in our
community had grown to the point where this was necessary).  I sent a change
of address form in with the change (55369 -&gt; 55311).  After this, their
monthly mailings stopped.  Last week, I received a letter from a collection
agency due to my unfulfilled agreement.  The address was so incredibly
mangled, I am amazed that the post office was able to route it.  The zip code
had only one digit right (54762).  The city and street names were mangled as
well.  Apparently their data entry operator damaged the record when entering
the change of address.

My guess is that Columbia House attempted to send their bulk-class mailings to
this mangled address and never got them routed (or a proper response to the
"Address Correction Requested" notation).  I don't suppose the Post Office
spends a lot of time trying to route misaddressed bulk mail.  Rather than
trying to send me anything by 1st class mail, they turned it over to a
collection agency to make this attempt.  Seems pretty inefficient, since the
cost of the collection agency has to be more than a 1st class letter.

Finally, I called Columbia House's 1-800 (toll-free) number to clear this up.
The operator corrected the address on-line, but made the comment that he had
to make sure that the change 'took'.  Apparently they have experienced regular
problems with entering an address change, only to have the system not actually
make the change to the database record.  They either have a software or
training problem there.

The simple change of two zip code digits led to far more chaos than it should.

   By JOE ABERNATHY
   Houston Chronicle Staff Writer

   The specters of class struggle and international economic warfare are
casting a shadow over administration hearings on how to build a sophisticated
national computer network.  Billed as an engine of job growth, a central
concern is emerging that the ``data superhighway'' promised by Vice President
Al Gore and President Bill Clinton during the campaign could produce a large
underclass of ``information have-nots.''

   Based on an emerging global computer network known as the Internet, which
links up to 12 million people in more than 30 nations, the National Research
and Education Network (NREN) is a decade-long project of former Sen. Gore.
Gore envisions a future in which oceans of data, including libraries of
movies, books and other creative works, would be readily avail able to every
home.  In selling a $5 billion spending plan focused on the network in 1992,
Gore held forth the image of classrooms without walls, sophisticated medical
collaborations, and globally competitive small businesses.  ``The NREN is at
all odds the most important and lucrative marketplace of the 21st century,''
he said in a recent statement.

   But in trying to make it work, it has become apparent that the NREN remains
in many ways a captive of its privileged institutional heritage.  Some
Americans don't even have telephone service, and many still don't have
computers with which to access the net.

     Two congressional hearings were held in late March concerning the
National Information Infrastructure, and a bill has been introduced that would
take up where Gore's 1992 High-Performance Computing Act left off _ bringing
the net to classrooms, small business and other potentially disenfranchised
Americans. Clinton's budget includes an additional $489 million over six years
for the network.  And while the regional Bells, newspapers and other
information giants have been struggling for years over the future of the
medium, congressional insiders say that with the in creased attention, a
resolution seems likely to be found during the current session of Congress.

    ``What I think is really getting squeezed out is that there hasn't been a
genuine, public interest, bottom-up grass roots voice. It's a huge, huge
issue,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington offices of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, the primary champion of civil rights
in the new electronic medium.  ``It's about people, it's about institutions,
it's about who gets to connect and on what terms.''

    Observers also fear that the rush to wield the network as an economic
weapon could produce dramatic incursions into free speech and other civil
liberties.

   ``I'm very concerned that the rhetoric about national competitiveness is
transforming itself into a new cold war,'' said Gary Chapman, director of
CPSR's 21st Century Project in Cambridge, Mass. ``The concerns of intelligence
and other federal agencies including NASA has been to look at technology
resources that are not related to military security but to economic benefits
as being things that have to be protected by Draconian measures of security.''

   Recent disciplinary actions at NASA Ames Research Center in Northern
California seem to support Chapman's concerns.  Up to eight of the 11
scientists disciplined in December were targeted because of their
participation in politically oriented, international discussion groups hosted
on the Internet computer network, according to documents ob tained by the
Houston Chronicle under the Freedom of Information Act, along with subsequent
interviews of NASA Ames personnel.

   ``Some people there were accused of dealing with foreign nationals about
non-classified technology issues,'' said Chapman, whose organization also has
made inquiries into the matter.  ``NASA said the U.S. has to protect its
technology assets because of the global environment of competitiveness.''

   The issues are even simpler for Raymond Luh, a subcontracting engineer
fired by NASA.  Luh, an American of Chinese ancestry, feels that his career
was destroyed simply because he joined in one of the thousands of political
discussions aired each day over the Internet.  ``I feel I have been gravely
wronged by NASA,'' Luh said. ``I cannot possibly seek employment elsewhere. My
reputation as a law- abiding citizen and a hard-working researcher has been
tarnished almost beyond repair.''  NASA refused to comment on the matter.

    According to FOIA documents provided by NASA's Office of the Inspector
General, Luh was fired when ``a document containing Chinese writing was found
in (Luh's computer). ... Investigation determined that Luh's office computer
held a large volume of files relating to his efforts to promote Most Favored
Nation trade status for the People's Republic of China. ... Luh was not
authorized to use his computer for this activity.''

   To Luh, however, he was only one of the chorus of voices that joined in a
fiery debate surrounding fallout from the Tiananmen Square massacre. He wasn't
trying to make policy _ he was exercising intellectual freedom, in his spare
time.

    ``That's a very dangerous and disturbing kind of trend,'' said Chapman.
``The parallel is with the Cold War and transforming the modes of thinking and
the practices of these agencies into new forms of control, even in the absence
of militarily significant enemies. We'll start think ing about the Japanese or
whatever Pacific Rim country you want to pick as being `enemies,' and
intellectual commerce with these people will be a matter of economic security.
``The freedom of expression aspect of that is very critical. We want to make
sure that this is a system in which people can express themselves freely
without repercussions.''

     Observers fear that Luh may be only the first such casualty as federal
agencies and special interest groups reshape the Internet into their own
model, carving up a pie estimated to be worth $3.5 trillion.

    While Gore's vision implies the construction of a high-speed, high-tech
fiber optic network, a number of counter-proposals are being floated.

   The Electronic Frontier Foundation -- which earlier made a name for itself
with a successful court challenge to the conduct of the Secret Service in a
hacker crackdown -- is focusing on building a less powerful, less costly
network that could reach more people, more quickly.  ``Our central concern is
that we get from debate to doing something,'' said Jerry Berman, EFF director.

   EFF's approach _ endorsed by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. _ is to build
an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) service atop the telephone
network, making a modest level of digital computer transmission available
quickly to every home. The more sophisticated fiber optic approach implied by
Gore's NREN could be implemented as time and money allow.  But few voices have
been heard backing ISDN.

   ``The current state of the discussion is turmoil and chaos,'' said the
CPSR's Rotenberg. ``It's a mistake to place too much emphasis on any
technological configuration. A lot of that energy and those resources would be
better spent talking about users and institutions rather than technology and
standards.  This is like trying to explain railroads in the 18th century or
cars in the 19th century. Here we are in the 20th century, and we know
something big is happening right under our feet and we know it has something
to do with these new telecommunications technologies.
     ``None of us knows where this is going to take us, but I think people
should have some sensitivity to the prospect that the future world we're going
to live in is going to be shaped in many ways by the decisions we make today
about the information infrastructure.''

Can you see the irony in this situation?  Here, the intelhouse usenet list, a
group interested in "intelligent" houses, and automated process control cannot
even get the net traffic automated and must return to a human tended process!
How can we rely on the intelligent houses we build?  More like a house of
cards....

Jerry Bakin.

&gt; Bone-weary from travel and working 150 hours in two and a half weeks,
&gt; the intelhouse mailing list administration wizard comes back into his
&gt; office, blows the dust off of his aged keyboard, and urges his fingers
&gt; back to their less-exhausted nimble selves. Quickly invoking mail, he soon
&gt; discovers that in his absence wicked site administrators and fools in
&gt; charge of Usenet mail maps have wrecked havoc on his precious mailing
&gt; list. Yes, after all the spells, incantations, and perl scripts, a few
&gt; site administrators had managed to bounce mail in a fashion not only
&gt; non-RFC-compliant, but also so dastardly as to have never before been
&gt; inflicted on his system. If only he hadn't spent the weekends working on
&gt; excising an evil hardware demon from a large justice system computer, and
&gt; his weekdays trying to promote his company's talents to a large maker of
&gt; plastic money, he could have countermanded the errant mail going to
&gt; hundreds of innocent mailing list readers. He could have eliminated the
&gt; terror and confusion and misery needlessly inflicted on those people,
&gt; after all, it was he that the wicked site administrators were after.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevermore, he swore. Instead, he would personally see to it that his
&gt; forwarding scripts would not inadvertently pass on these bounce messages
&gt; to innocent bystanders. He lamented that it meant less timely delivery of
&gt; mail, in that he would personally read each item and post only those of
&gt; utility to all readers. Yes, he would become one of those dreaded wizards
&gt; with incredible power at his fingertips. He would become ... a
&gt; MODERATOR!
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, readers of this mailing list, mail will cease to flow as quickly as
&gt; it has in the past. It will pass a human's (??) eyes before being sped
&gt; on its way. But for a worthy cause ... truth, justice, and the intelligent
&gt; way!

Saw this in the first quarter 1993 issue of "Miracles in Trust" the newsletter
of the Perham Foundation.  In a lengthy chronology of West Coast wireless
developments there is this item.

   July 1911: In Los Angeles, teenaged radio amateur operators, trained
   at Los Angeles Polytechnic High School, intercept and disclose
   collusion over the Catalina wireless circuit involving the Hearst
   newspapers, with much attendant publicity and a criminal prosecution
   later dismissed.  The Wireless Association of Southern California,
   of over 200 young Los Angeles amateurs, forms as a result of the
   incident.  It operates a 2kW spark transmitter using the call sign ALA.

I don't know the name of the law, but in England, yes, it is an offence. There
is no assumed right here to listen to anything on the radio waves. So if you
realise that what you're listening to is not either a broadcast, licensed
amateur or CB operator, you must stop listening.

Not a lawyer etc.etc.etc.

I don't know about Britain, but in Germany it has been in fact illegal to
listen, using whichever device, into frequencies not assigned to broadcasting
services. This rule was overturned by the German Supreme Court about two years
ago.

For every piece of telco equipment that is operated in Germany, a permission
has to be obtained (usually by the manufacturer) from a telco authority. This
permission could be granted with the provision to obey certain rules, whose
violation constituted a criminal offence in itself. (One of the rules on every
permission for radio equipment has been not to listen into non-broadcast
waves.) The latter rule was turned down for the reason that the telco
authority could in effect determine what was illegal and punishable, a power
that rests exclusively with the Parliament. But the fact that even a pocket
receiver has to be "licenced" remains.

I encountered a similar problem whilst attending Uni. New X.25 concentrators
had been installed to speed up terminal access to the H*neywell mainframe in
the central computer room. Every so often, all terminals would crash.  After
experiencing it a few times, I realised that they were crashing at a
particular point in _my_ session. I was reading one of the online manuals.

I eventually narrowed it down to a simple sequence of 4 lowercase 'n's ...
just like nnnn nnnn ... the gateway could NOT send or receive this sequence in
a single packet. Unfortunately, nobody told that to the author of the online
manual.

The concentrators were eventually replaced with Ungermann-Bass terminal
servers. No further gotchas have been reported.

Sounds more like the the modem was skating the HAYES patent by using the 
TIES (time-independent escape sequence) promoted by a competitor.  This
eliminates the "guard time" of 1 second that is an essential part of the
patent.  TIES proponents state that accidental triggering is statistically

ps Turning off the "in band" sequence &amp; using DTR I can understand, but

My university department (Brunel - computer science) gets around some problems
in what I regard as a devious way.  They do not wish for students to see what
their exam marks (ie percentages) are (grades are ok).  By law, any data
holder has 40 days to provide data on request.  The department only keeps
electronic copies of the records for 40 days, hence preventing any student
from seeing them.

Quite what the ethics and reasoning behind all this are, I'll leave to others.

It might be interesting to note that in another article in the 'Volkskrant'
the designer of the new Dutch Computer Crime Law was quoted as saying:

   [The fact that this hacker's custody was prolonged with 30 days]
   requires the judicial order to be severely shocked.  Hacking a
   university computer does not fulfill that requirement.

Prof. Dr. H. Franken, who designed the law, also said that the law was not
meant to be used against students who where merely playing around with
computer systems, but was targeted for organised crime, and big-time fraud.
Franken himself is an honorary member of the 'Time-Wasters' a hackers-club
based in Eindhoven.

University officials have said that damages to their systems are small, but
it is also said that he used their computer so hack other systems. We'll just
have to wait and see what happens.....

INTERNIC REGISTRATION SERVICES SECURITY COMPROMISED

April 2, 1993

In what must be a great embarrassment to NSI officials, security at the
Internic host for Registration Services was compromised on the second
day of official service to the Internet community.  Through a series
of accidents, a user of their ftp service was able to access directories
normally off-limits to anonymous ftp services.

As a result of this access, the user was able to obtain a copy of the system's
/etc/passwd file that could be used to decode passwords of users on the system
through the use of a password cracking program.  The user was also able to
access system logs, including a log of anonymous ftp transactions by users
around the world.

In the course of this investigation the user was able to find numerous other
security holes including world-mountable filesystems.  Although no further
action was taken, these holes would enable a malicious hacker to easily
penetrate the system.

An Internic admin was in the process of fixing the security holes at the
time of this release.

The Internic Registration Services is funded by NSF to administer registration
of network numbers, domain names, autonomous system numbers, and other
functions crucial to the operation of the global Internet.

Note: This is NOT an April Fool's Joke.

		Technological Systems and Processes

   		         March 20-24, 1994
              San Diego Hilton Beach and Tennis Resort


The purpose of PSAM is to provide a forum for the presentation of scientific
papers covering both methodology and applications of system-based approaches
to the design and effective, safe operations of technological systems and
processes. These include nuclear plants, chemical and petroleum facilities,
defense systems, aerospace systems, and the treatment and disposal of hazard
wastes. The objective is to share experience to the benefit of all industries.
Some of the topics within the scope of the meeting are:

Just after 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, April 6, a San Francisco Municipal
Railway car (1228) was headed for the car barns when it crashed into the rear
of another car (1304) that had stalled in the Twin Peaks Tunnel.  15 people
wound up in the hospital.  It took all night to clear the wreckage, and full
service began again only on Monday morning.  The causes of the stall and of
the crash were still unknown.

The signal system and the safety controls are as follows:

 * An `automatic' speed-control system has three speeds, 10, 27, and 50 mph.
   [Apparently ZERO is not considered a speed.]
 
 * A cab-signalling system informs the operator of the maximum permissible
   speed, red for 10, yellow for 27, green for 50.  

The controls were thought to be `foolproof', because the car automatically
slows or stops if the operator exceeds the maximum indicated speed.  There are
also impedance bonds in the tracks that are supposed to determine whether the
track ahead is clear.

The operator of car 1228 is named Johnny Wong.  Three possible scenarios were
suggested:

 1. Wong or someone else had disconnected the cab-signalling system,
    which would bypass the speed controls.  [This is allegedly not easy 
    to do, and has various voice protocols associated with it.]
    
 2. There might have been a failure of the track-signal system, which 
    would have made car 1304 invisible to the control systems.

 3. Human failure was also mentioned, although in the absence of the 
    first two scenarios, that does not seem to make much sense.

[Source: An article by Carl Nolte in the San Francisco Chronicle, 6 Apr 1993,
pA1, following up on the previous day's reportage.]

Well, the next day's report begins with this paragraph:  The crash

  ``... was the result  of the operator deliberately disabling the
  safety system so that he could speed up his train, sources close to the
  investigation said''.

The investigation continues.  Stay tuned for any further revelations.

       [By the way, the "Another" in the subject line is because I was
       reminded of the Ghost trains that plagued the Muni Metro repeatedly
       beginning about ten years ago.  PGN]

On 22 March, Columbia's main engines were shut down three seconds before
lift-off, because of a leaky valve.

On 5 April, Discovery's launch (STS-56) was aborted eleven seconds before
lift-off.  Early indications pointed to a valve in the main propulsion system.
In this case, the engines had not yet been ignited.  (There had been an
earlier one-hour delay at nine minutes before launch, due to high winds and a
temperature sensor problem.)

[Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 6 Apr 1993, p.A2]

A computer glitch is now being blamed for the 5 April delay.  Computer data
had indicated that the valve had not closed.  ``However, engineers believe
that the valve closed properly and a bad circuit might be to blame.``  That 
is, the computer was in error in reporting the valve status.

[...]
  The real reason for sending this is that the reporter said "since it is a
bug in the computer software it will be easy to fix and the shuttle will be
able to launch in the next 24 hours". Seems the expectations of fixing
something as 'simple' as software are set way to high. I understand the idea
behind the statement: If the problem was in the valve the shuttle could be
delayed for more then 24 hours, while all you need to do to fix software is
fix the code and reload the 'application' (possibly by floppy disk (-8 ).

The risk has to do with people having a little knowledge. Not to long ago
software was a big and nebulous idea to most reporters.  Now everyone has
certain ideas about how software actually works, which in most cases is
actually wrong (heck I know people who still have trouble understanding the
difference between ram space and disk space).

&lt;&lt; this was originally posted on sci.space.shuttle by Ken Hollis of
the Kennedy Space Center &gt;&gt;  [...]

STS-56 abort at T-20 seconds (or thereabouts, maybe 16 seconds per my GLS DD?)
was called today because of the GLS (Ground Launch Sequencer).  It detected
that the MPS (Main Propulsion System) High Point Bleed valve (PV22)  closed
indicator did not come on as expected.

PV22 is a monostable, normally closed, helium pneumatically actuated valve on a
line attached to the LH2 17" manifold.  This 17" manifold is the line that goes
between the ET (External Tank) and the main engines to supply LH2 to the
engines.  The high point bleed line is situated in the Orbiter at the "high
Point" of that manifold.  The LH2 manifold between the ET and the Orbiter looks
like an inverted "U".  One end of this manifold goes down to the bottom of the
LH2 section of the ET (as opposed to the LO2 section at the top of the tank),
the other end goes down towards the engines.  Since LH2 is very cold, just
about any temperature rise will tend to let it gas off.  The high point bleed
allows any gasses / bi-phase liquid that may accumulate at the top of this U to
be siphoned off overboard, where it is sent to the flare stack &amp; burned.  It
only takes a couple of seconds for this valve to be closed before a gas pocket
forms in this section of line, so the valve must be open as close to lighting
the engines as possible so that the engines don't ingest a hydrogen bubble. 
Believe it or not, this still simplifies the operation of the LH2 system with
the engines &amp; loading the tank.  The lines in the aft for the MPS / SSME system
are commonly referred to as "a plumbers nightmare".

During the "terminal count" at about T-20 seconds, the open command is removed.
 Since this is a "monostable" valve, if there is no helium supply or no power
to the solenoid that lets helium to the valve, the valve will close.  GLS then
verified at about 16 seconds (per my last DD) it is closed and everything is
fine.  Today the Open indicator went from ON to OFF (indicating it cycled) but
the Closed indicator never went from OFF to ON (indicating it did indeed close)
thus causing the abort.  A downstream temperature transducer went from cold to
very warm also indicating that the valve closed, but GLS does not check that
temp ducer.  A 48 hour scrub-turnaround has been called contingent on relying
on the temp ducer rather than the Close indicator.  Last I saw the indicator
was not still working.  It would be easy to say the it is a microswitch failure
on the valve, but it could be quite a few things wrong (as always on the
Orbiter) and further troubleshooting will have to be performed in the aft to
figure out exactly what the problem is.

Any problems after T-31 seconds is an abort for the day.  No more holds are
available.

A new survey by John Haugh's Telecommunications Advisors, Inc., claims that
technically sophisticated organized-crime rings are annually defrauding U.S.
businesses and telephone companies of $4 billion in long-distance calls.  70.3
percent of the almost 700 companies surveyed reported they had been hit by
toll fraud at least once in the past five years, with an average loss of
$125,000 [inferentially, I conclude, per company rather than per hit].  Haugh
predicted that 35,000 companies will be victimized this year.  [That
multiplies out to $4.375 billion for the year if the past average holds true.]

If you look in the manual for "at" you will see that one of the 
recommended ways of using it is to have each at job schedule a new
one a day or a week or a month later.  Some find this easier than 
editing the /cron file or they may not have authority to do that.

I regularly use this trick to schedule a daily backup of my files onto a tape
that I always leave in my tape unit.  Last year in April it stopped working.
I thought perhaps there had been some kind of outage or bug and simply
restarted it.

This year I noticed that when it ran (early this morning) and try to schedule
tomorrow morning's backup, at gave the message "too late".  I thought it might
have been some problem caused by a series of power outages we had yesterday
but then I noticed it was also happening on two other machines.

I did some experimenting and found that at would not schedule any jobs from
0200 to 0259.  A few hours later I understood.

Tomorrow morning there is no 0202 (the time that schedule my backup)
because of the switch to EDT.  We will go directly from 0159 to 0300.

I read the manual and there is no indication in the manual that any
such check is made.  It says you can use any time between 0000 and 2359.
This is clearly a case of incomplete documentation.

Is it a case of the author of at being too clever, or me being too stupid?

I think it a nice example of how subtle can be the error that leads to a
failure.  It never occurred to me that they would be checking for that missing
hour.  They probably never thought of someone having a regularly scheduled
call for 0202.

However, there is something even nicer.  If it skips the run in the spring,
shouldn't it run it twice in the Fall?  I checked my records and it doesn't do
that.  Even though the clock is going to drop back it schedules the run for
the next day.  Now, is that a bug?  If so whose?

A question of documentation!

Yesterday I went down to the local Babbages for a copy of DOS 6.0 with
expectation of a similar experience as when 5.0 was purchased. Well the
box was the same size but that was about it. (What do you expect for
US50.00 anyway).

It seems that MS-DOS now comes much like an automobile or cable television:
the base price doesn't include the options.

Inside the two-inch-thick box was a slim volume (321 pages vs 668 pages
in the DOS 5.0 manual) mostly on the new "features" (as in "that's not
a bug, its a feature" 8*) and three high density disks (and a coupon for
low density - one of many coupons).

Well, I can say this much, its not really for monochrome laptops, its not
really for XTs, the commands are not consistent, and it has its share of bugs,
but seems ok otherwise.

Towards the end of the book you find a set of coupons: the first asks you
to send in US24.95 + US5.00 for shipping + tax. This gets you the "Microsoft
MS-DOS 6.0 Resource Kit" which includes the "MS-DOS 6.0 Technical Reference",
and a set of "supplemental disks" which include things like COMP, EDLIN,
EXE2BIN, and LCD.CPI which were left out of 6.0 (everyone in Redmond must 
like to wait on EDIT and has an active matrix laptop in their Porche).

If you are using STACKER, for US5.00 you can get a conversion utility for
DBLSPACE &amp; possibly repeat my experience (on my venerable but 100% compatible
XT clone, WD controller, &amp; ST-225, attempting to use DBLSPACE resulted in a
"Divide Overflow" half-way through the conversion &amp; left the machine
unbootable even from floppy - had to reboot with a lesser DOS version and
clean off all of the DBLSPACE files to recover - happened more than once so no
fluke).

Speaking of DBLSPACE, when formatting a 360k floppy with /S, you now get three
hidden files and have only 180k free: seems DOS 6.0 grew a bit and now puts
50+k of hidden DBLSPACE.BIN on the floppies too.

There is an anti-virus tool from Central Point but by now every virus-writer
in the world knows how to turn it off with a high function of Int 10, 16,
or 21h (haven't tried it but was told by a reputable source). Even so there 
is yet another coupon at the end of the book requesting another US19.90 for 
two updates, one "now" (they knew it was obsolete already ?) and one in 
3-4 months. Actually cheap compared to the (pounds)29.90 they expect from 
UK residents (includes VAT).

What really got me is the lack of a simple environmental variable to turn
of the color in the utilities for a monochrome display. I told SETUP to
use monochrome but this ended when SETUP (which also informed me that
an "incompatible disk compression" was present - nope) was done. For EDIT, 
/B is the switch and /NOHI helps. DEFRAG wants /BW, MSAV allows /BW but 
/MONO works better (you can go out for lunch while the memory scan runs 
on an XT).

Now there are alternatives to cubic money. You can download the supplemental
file (DOS6SUPP.EXE) from the MS BBS in Washington (206.936.6735), all 480+k 
of it &amp; the BBS does support 9600 baud but do not confuse it with v42, 
v42bis, or MNP. 33 bad blocks (a record) during the download but my 
trusty Supra, 16550 chips, and Procomm+/Zmodem (plugs) handled it ok.

The Anti-Virus update can be downloaded from 503.531.8100 - not on the 
coupon but on page 277 - probably Central Point.

In short, the product has the feel of "not ready for prime time" but it
did appear in the first quarter '93 (last day actually - well Egghead
had it the day before).

A final note: I did try to call Microsoft tech support about things
encountered (90 days "free" support is available starting with the first
call). I got through to the lady who took serial numbers (and started the 90
day timer) quickly enough only to be informed after that I was 86th in line &amp;
could expect a 90+ minute wait. Not an 800 call. From Florida to Washington.
No thank you. (At least they told me 8*).

At present, companies have the right to require their employees to use
company computers, including E-mail access, only for company business.
Employees who participate in the Internet discussion groups may violate
this restriction.  Then they incur the risk of harassment if they ever
fall out of favor and/or hold unconventional political beliefs.

The remedy?
Next time you accept a job, negotiate (along with your salary and fringe
benefits) the right to use your company's E-mail also for private purposes,
subject to reasonable limits (which are based ONLY upon quantity of mail
send and received) and the understanding that the time you spend on
private E-mail is your time, not company time.

Companies have the right to control the use of computers which belong to
them.  On the other hand, they are required to compensate you for your
work in their behalf (in the form of salary etc.).  So considering E-mail
access to be another fringe benefit will solve the problem.

On &lt; Mon, 29 Mar 1993 13:24:37 (PST) &gt; In Comp Privacy 2-11, 
Steven Hodas &lt;hhll@u.washington.edu&gt;

&gt; If I send a personal letter to someone do they have the right to 
&gt; disclose it to others without my consent? 

No.  The Copyright act of 1978 and later amendments gave statutory
protection at the federal level for the first time to unpublished works.

&gt; Does this vary state by state?  

No.  Prior to the 1978 law, an unpublished work was subject to the
protection of the common law of the state in question.  The new law
expressly excludes states from having any jurisdiction over unpublished
works and voids any "common law copyright" which might have existed. 
All works are automatically protected under federal law.

&gt; If it's prohibited, is it a civil or a criminal issue? 

Civil.

&gt; If it is permitted doesn't that suggest that we have greater privacy
&gt; protection for electronic communciation because the ECPA would prohibit
&gt; that kind of disclosure?
 
I think you are confusing things.  The ECPA gives to Electronic mail the
same protections which are available for telephone conversations - the
protection against interception by third parties or the use of intercepted
E-Mail by law enforcement personnel without a warrant, i.e. what the laws
against wiretapping and recording of telephone calls, the ECPA provides to
the same extent to E-Mail.

The ECPA does not apply to the sender or  recipient of the message.  It only
applies to anyone who may see a message prior to its delivery to the
designated mailbox or delivery point.  It applies to the E-Mail providers
who carry the message and to anyone who delivers it.

I am also posting this to the Risks Digest for a reason which has to do
with another issue which almost no one has noticed.  As of April 1, 1988,
the United States became a member of the Berne Union for the Protection of
Literary Works.  This treaty is most famous as the reason companies would
simultaneously publish a book in Canada in order to obtain protection
under the Berne Convention.

As of four years ago, that process was no longer necessary because the
U.S. is now a member of the Berne Union.  The most significant issue under
Berne (I refer to this as "It Berne's me up") is that there are no
formalities or requirements of notification in order for a work to
obtain copyright protection.

What this means is that copyright notices became totally optional after
April 1, 1988 for all works first published on or after that date.  In
theory, if you obtained a computer program from someone which simply had
his name and address on it, and wanted to use it, you would have to find
out if the person who wrote it wanted anything to license it.   You can be
sued, and lose, and the other party can collect damages, even though the
work has no indication of copyright notice.  

I live just outside of Washington, DC and the Copyright office is just a
20 minute train ride away.   A frightening fact is that despite the treaty
having been around for more than four years, the Copyright office still 
does not have copies of the text of the treaty.  They have copies of the
Phonolog Convention (for protection of sound recordings) and they have 
copies of the Universal Copyright Convention (which instituted the C in
a circle copyright notice.)  But Berne is conspicuously absent.  It makes
me wonder what things are stated in this treaty that are so bad that 
nobody wants people to know what it says.  (The last time I tried to get
a copy was about a year ago, but that still was 3 years after
implementation and the Copyright Office STILL did not have copies of the
text of the treaty.  It makes me wonder why.

Just remember this little piece of information.  A treaty, once ratified
by the Senate, has the force and effect of an amendment to the
Constitution of the United States and can override its provisions.  Think
about that some time.

This is a pointer to a basenote and discussion pertaining to computer
pointing device injuries (mouse, trackballs, puck, stylus, etc.) in
sci.med.occupational.  For convenence I have included a copy of the
basenote below.  To follow net etiquette, please direct all responses to
the basenote below in sci.med.occupational notesgroup ONLY.


                      (Copy of Basenote)

This note (which is being posted monthly) is for anyone that has been injured
using a computer pointing device (mouse, trackball, puck, tablet, etc.).  I
have been assisting computer operators who have been injured using pointing
devices for the past 4 years.  I am now presently doing research at the
University of California's (San Francisco and Berkeley's) Ergonomics Lab on
the design of computer pointing devices with the goal of reducing injuries
associated with their use.  In order to do this, I need to collect information
on pointing device design characteristics (button design, button force, device
size, device shape, etc.) that are important in minimizing and/or reducing the
physical stresses operators are subjected to.  Some of this information will
be collected through my laboratory research, but a major and important source
of information has to come from operators like yourself.  I need to collect
all the information I can from computer operators that have been injured as a
result of pointing device use.

In order to do this, I need your help.  If you have been injured using a
pointing device, I would appreciate it if you would send me a note with
information pertaining to your injury.  I would like the information e-mailed
directly to me (petej@garnet.berkeley.edu).  The format I would like the
information sent to me is as follows, fill in as much as you can:

 1) NAME: (optional)
 2) COMPANY: (optional)
 3) PHONE #: (optional)
 4) NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER PER DAY:
 5) PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT USING A POINTING DEVICE:
 6) MANUFACTURER OF COMPUTER AND MODEL NUMBER:
 7) POINTING DEVICE USED AT TIME OF INJURY: (Please be specific)
      a) MANUFACTURER
      b) MODEL OR PART NUMBER
      c) DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE
 8) PRIMARY SOFTWARE APPLICATION USED AT THE TIME OF YOUR INJURY
 9) TYPE OF INJURY
10) WHAT YOU THINK CAUSED YOUR INJURY
11) IF INJURY IS RESOLVED OR YOUR CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED, WHAT CHANGES
    WERE MADE (This is probably the most beneficial information)

My intent is to enter this information into a database in order to gather
information and look for trends.  Each month I will share relevant information
by posting a monthly summary in sci.med.occupational similar to what has been
done with keyboard information.  If you are presently experiencing problems,
feel free to call me (510/231-9405) and I will share with you what I know.  I
am also open for suggestions, please post responses to this basenote or e-mail
me if you have any further suggestions or input.

If your company has internal bulletin boards, please post this note or provide
a pointer telling your co-workers about this basenote in the
sci.med.occupational newsgroup.  I will be also be posting a pointer to this
basenote in comp.risks, comp.human-factors, and sci.med as well.

Finally, if you have any opinions or inputs on a particular pointing device or
pointing device design in general, send me a note or call me.  Our lab is
assisting some of the major pointing device manufacturers with the design of
their pointing devices. If you have some inputs for a particular company, I
will be happy to direct them to the appropriate person.

Thanks for your help.

     [The full announcement is also in the CRVAX.SRI.COM RISKS archives 
     CD RISKS: with the file name RISKS-14.FTC .  PGN]

FTCS is the world's most important forum for the presentation and discussion
of state of the art developments in dependable computing systems. This year's
program features 60 regular papers, 5 practical experience reports, 6 software
demonstrations and one panel. This program is the result of a very stringent
selection process carried out by the international Program Committee on more
than 300 submissions. The regular paper sessions cover a breadth of topics
from concurrent error detection to software-implemented and application-based
fault-tolerance, from theoretical issues in modeling to field measurement of
fault- tolerant system dependability, from testing to fault injection. The
opening plenary session will be devoted to practical experience reports on two
safety-critical, software intensive systems currently in operation: the
digital fly-by-wire systems of the Airbus family of airliners, and the speed
control system of the Paris subway. The panel will discuss the limits in
dependability, and the software demonstrations will encompass tools for
hardware and software dependability evaluation.

Exhibitors from both industrial and academic communities will present
commercially available products, advanced prototypes and tools relating to the
conference theme. An exhitors' forum will offer technical presentations
relating to the exhibited products, prototypes and tools.

The symposium participants will be given the opportunity to attend a
pre-symposium review of the research conducted at LAAS-CNRS, as well as
joining post-symposium technical visits of Aerospatiale, CNES and Matra
Marconi Space.

On Monday June 21, a welcome reception will be organized at Hotel Capoul.  On
Tuesday June 22, the Mayor of Toulouse will give a reception in the famous
"Salle des Illustres", followed by a concert at the Jacobins Cloister.  On
Wednesday June 23, the traditional excursion will be to Albi, home town of the
famous painter Toulouse-Lautrec, followed by a banquet.

From all the information on the shuttle delay, the situation seems to be:
A faulty sensor or broken wire that monitors that status of a valve.

So far, I have heard that the problem is still a computer glitch.  This is
not correct.  The software performed as required.  The solution to the
problem is:

1) find and fix the problem  -- I would speculate a very $$$ option

2) update the software to override the situation -- quick and easiy, but
	very risky if the problem is the valve.

It looks like people are fixing hardware problems in software again.  There is
a classic risk of overriding hardware problems with software while introducing
the ability to do the override correctly, or by a nasty side effect by the
program (oops -- I was using that variable to turn on the engines!)

I hope at NASA, they are willing to assume the risk of correcting hardware
problems in software.  (NASA does have some good brains so I think they are
taking a very educated guess from the telemetry.)  I would hate to see another
shuttle go up in flames (sorry about the pun).

  [Brian noted that his reason for sending this to RISKS was that, unlike
  the previous postings, this one is AUTHORITATIVE.  He also wanted to give a
  clear impression of the scope and level of detail of the computer-related
  parts of the report, and of how they fitted into the report as a whole.
  PGN]

I have today managed to obtain a copy of the actual 80-page "Report of the
Inquiry into the London Ambulance Service, February 1993". 

The terms of reference of the Inquiry were "To examine the operation of the
CAD [Computer-Aided Dispatch] system, including:

   a) the circumstances surrounding its failures on Monday and Tuesday 26 and
      27 November 1992

   b) the process of its procurement

and to identify the lessons to be learned for the operation and management
of the London ambulance Service against the imperatives of delivering
service at the required standard, demonstrating good working relationships
and restoring public confidence."

The Inquiry Team membership is listed as 

- Don Page, Chief Executive of South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance and
Paramedic Service NHS Trust

- Paul Williams, senior computer audit partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn

- Dennis Boyd, former Chief Conciliation Officer of the Advisory
Conciliation and arbitration Service (ACAS)

The principal background facts given about the LAS in the report are that
the service "covers a geographical area of about 600 square miles. It is
the largest ambulance service in the world. It covers a resident population
of some 6.8 million, but its daytime population is larger particularly in
Central London. LAS carries over 5,000 patients every day. It receives
between 2,000 and 2,500 calls daily; this includes between 1,300 and 1,600
999 calls."

The Inquiry's Report carries no copyright notice, and is freely available
(see end of this message). Here are the scanned-in Table of Contents, and

COMPUTER AIDED DESPATCH SUMMARY

1001 What is clear from the Inquiry Team's investigations is that neither
the Computer Aided Despatch (CAD) system itself, nor its users, were ready
for full implementation on 26 October 1992. The CAD software was not
complete, not properly tuned, and not fully tested. The resilience of the
hardware under a full load had not been tested. The fall back option to the
second file server had certainly not been tested. There were outstanding
problems with data transmission to and from the mobile data terminals.
There was some scepticism over the accuracy record of the Automatic Vehicle
Location System (AVLS). Staff, both within Central Ambulance Control (CAC)
and ambulance crews, had no confidence in the system and were not all fully
trained. The physical changes to the layout of the control room on 26
October 1992 meant that CAC staff were working in unfamiliar positions,
without paper backup, and were less able to work with colleagues with whom
they had jointly solved problems before. There had been no attempt to
foresee fully the effect of inaccurate or incomplete data available to the
system (late status reporting/vehicle locations etc.). These imperfections
led to an increase in the number of exception messages that would have to
be dealt with and which in turn would lead to more call backs and
enquiries. In particular the decision on that day to use only the computer
generated resource allocations (which were proven to be less than 100%
reliable) was a high risk move.

1002 Whilst understanding fully the pressures that the project team were
under to achieve a quick and successful implementation it is difficult to
understand why the final decision was made, knowing that there were so many
potential imperfections in the system.

1003 The development of a strategy for the future of computer aided
despatch within the London Ambulance Service (LAS) must involve a full
process of consultation between management, staff, trade union
representatives and the Service's information technology advisers. It may
also be appropriate to establish a wider consultative panel involving
experts in CAD from other ambulance services, the police and fire brigade.
Consequently the recommendations from the Inquiry Team should be regarded
as suggestions and options for the future rather than as definitive
recommendations on the way forward. What is certain is that the next CAD
system must be made to fit the Service's current or future organisational
structure and agreed operational procedures. This was not the case with the
current CAD.

     -----------------

COMPUTER AIDED DESPATCH RECOMMENDATIONS

1009 These are the main recommendations drawn by the Inquiry Team from its
investigations into the CAD system, each of which is covered fully in the
main text. We recommend: 

a) that LAS continues to plan the implementation of a CAD system [3009];

b) that the standing financial instructions should be extended to provide
more qualitative guidance for future major IT procurements [3032]; 

c) that any future CAD system must conform to the following imperatives: 

i. it must be fully reliable and resilient with fully tested levels of back-up;

ii. it must have total ownership by management and staff, both within CAC
and the ambulance crews;

iii. it must be developed and introduced in a timescale which, whilst
recognising the need for earliest introduction, must allow fully for
consultation, quality assurance, testing, and training;

iv. management and staff must have total, demonstrable, confidence in the
reliability of the system;

v. the new system must contribute to improving the level and quality of the
provision of ambulance services in the capital;

vi. any new system should be introduced in a stepwise approach, with, where
possible, the steps giving maximum benefit being introduced first;

vii. any investment in the current system should be protected and carried
forward to the new system only if it results in no compromises to the above
objectives [5004];

d) re-training of CAC staff be carried out on the system to ensure that
they are familiar with its features and that they are operating the system
in a totally consistent way [5025];

e) a suitably qualified and experienced project manager be appointed
immediately to coordinate and control the implementation of the proposed
first stage of CAD [50271;

f) that a specialist review be undertaken of communications in the light of
the final objectives of CAD and that any recommendations arising are
actioned as part of the proposed second phase of CAD [5033]; g) the
establishment of a Project Subcommittee of the LAS Board [5040]; h) that
LAS recruit an IT Director, who will have direct access to the LAS Board
[5041].

KEY SYSTEM PROBLEMS

4007 As detailed earlier there were a number of basic flaws in the CAD
system and its supporting infrastructure. In summary, the system and its
concept has several major problems:

a) a need for near perfect input information in an imperfect world;

b) poor interface between crews, MDTs [Mobile Data Terminals] and the system;

c) unreliability, slowness and operator interface.

**Need for near perfect information**


4008 The system relied on near perfect information of vehicle location and
crew/vehicle status. Without accurate knowledge of vehicle locations and
status the system could not allocate the optimum resource to an incident.
Although some poor allocations may be attributable to errors in the
allocation routine, it is believed that the majority of allocation errors
were due to the system not knowing the correct vehicle location or status
of vehicles that may have proved more appropriate.

**Poor interface between crews, MDTs and the system**


4009 Given that the system required almost perfect information on vehicle
location and status, each of the component parts of the chain from crews to
despatch system must operate well. This was not the case. From our
investigations, possible reasons for the despatch system not knowing the
correct vehicle location or status of vehicles that may have proved more
appropriate:

a) a failure of the system to catch all of the data;

b) a genuine failure of crews to press the correct status button owing to
the nature and pressure of certain incidents;

c) poor coverage of the radio system, i.e. black spots;

d) crews failing to press status buttons as they became frustrated with
re-transmission problems;

e) a radio communications bottle neck, e.g. when crews commence duty and
try to log on via their vehicle's MDT or during other busy periods; 

f) missing or swapped callsigns;

g) faults in the "hand shaking" routines between MDTs and the despatch
system, eg MDTs showing Green and OK, but system screens showing them in a
different status;

h) crews intentionally not pressing the correct status buttons or pressing
them in an incorrect order;

i) crews taking a different vehicle to that which they have logged on to,
or a different vehicle/crew responding to that allocated by the system; 

j) incorrect or missing vehicle locations; 

k) too few call takers.

4010 The above reasons are often interconnected. 

**Unreliability, Slowness and Operator Interface**

4011 It is reported that the system "fell over" a few times before 26
October 1992. More common was the frequent "locking up" of screens. Staff
had been instructed to re-boot their screens if they locked up. The system
also slowed up when under load and whilst it was doing its "house keeping"
at 02:00 hours each morning.

4012 General imperfections include: 

a) failure to identify all duplicated calls; 

b) lack of prioritisation of exception messages;

c) exception messages and awaiting attention queues scrolling off the top
of the allocators'/exception rectifiers' screens; 

d) software resource allocation errors; 

e) general robustness of the system (workstation and MDT "lockups"); 

f) slow response times for certain screen based activities.

     -----------------

CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF BREAKDOWN ON 26 AND 27 OCTOBER 1992

4016 On 26 and 27 October 1992 the computer system itself did not fail in a
technical sense. Response times did on occasions become unacceptable, but
overall the system did what it had been designed to do. However, much of
the design had fatal flaws that would, and did, cumulatively lead to all of
the symptoms of systems failure.

4017 In order to work effectively the system needed near perfect
information all of the time. Without this the system could not be expected
to propose the optimum resource to be allocated to an incident. There were
many imperfections in this information which individually may not be
serious, but which cumulatively were to lead to system "failure".

4018 The changes to CAC operation on 26 and 27 October 1992 made it
extremely difficult for staff to intervene and correct the system.
Consequently, the system rapidly knew the correct location and status of
fewer and fewer vehicles. The knock on effects were:

a) poor, duplicated and delayed allocations;

b) a build up of exception messages and the awaiting attention list; 

c) a slow up of the system as the messages and lists built up;

d) an increased number of call backs and hence delays in telephone answering.

4019 Each effect quickly reinforced the others leading to severe
lengthening of response times. A more detailed explanation follows.

4020 A cause and effect diagram is shown opposite, Diagram 4.5, for the
operation of the system on 26 and 27 October 1992. As the number of
incidents increases there are several naturally reinforcing loops which
escalate the problems. A description of the course of events and
interactions follows.

4021 When the system was fully implemented at 07:00 hours 26 October 1992
the system was lightly loaded. Staff and system could cope with the various
problems (left hand side of the diagram) which caused the despatch system
to have imperfect information on the fleet and its status. As the number of
incidents increased, incorrect vehicle location or status information
received by the system increased. With the new room configuration and
method of operation, allocators were less able to spot and correct errors.

4022 The amount of incorrect location and status information in the system
increased with four direct effects:

a) the system made incorrect allocations: multiple vehicles sent to same
incident, or not the closest vehicle sent; 

b) the system had fewer resources to allocate, increasing the problems of
effect a);

c) as previously allocated incidents fed through the system and suffered
from the problems on the left hand side of the diagram which resulted in
the system not having the resource's correct status, the system placed
covered calls that had not gone through the amber, red, green status cycle,
back on the attention waiting list;

d) failures because of the problems on the left hand side of the diagram
caused the system to generate exception messages.

4023 Starting with effect 4022 d), the number of exception messages
increased rapidly to such an extent that staff were unable to clear the
queue. As the exception message queue grew the system slowed. The situation
was made worse as unrectified exception messages generated more exception
messages. With the increasing number of "awaiting attention" and exception
messages it became increasingly easy to fail to attend to messages that had
scrolled off the top of the screen. Failing to attend to these messages
arguably would have been less likely in a "paper-based" environment.

4024 Effects 4022 b) and c). With fewer resources to allocate the system
would recommend what it saw as the closest vehicle. This was often an
incorrect allocation as a closer vehicle was actually available. It took
longer to allocate resources for three reasons:

a) the allocator had to spend more time finding and confirming suitable
resources; 

b) incidents were held until a suitable resource became available;

c) resource proposal software took longer to process as resources became
more distant.

4025 There was a re-enforcing effect in that as allocators tried to contact
a resource, that resource was unavailable for allocation to another
incident. Once an allocator "clicked onto" a resource its status turned to
dark green thus preventing it from being allocated elsewhere. It is
reported that one allocator was allocating resources, but not mobilising
them. Any delay in allocation or mobilisation was a delay to a patient.

4026 It also took longer to allocate resources as more two line summaries
fed through the system. Standard two line summaries of incidents awaiting
resource allocation included those that had previously been covered, but
were not seen by the system as complete. As this queue built up it caused
the system to slow.

4027 At one stage two line summaries were scrolling onto the screen so fast
that in trying to stop summaries moving off the screen, allocators were
further slowed in their tasks.

4028 In summary, effects 4022 b) and c) contributed to incorrect
allocations, a slowing of the system and uncovered incidents all leading to
delays to patients. The number of uncovered incidents was probably
increased when at one stage the exception report queue was cleared in an
effort to increase the speed of the system.

4029 Effect 4022 a), incorrect allocations, led directly to patient delays
and crew frustration. Crew frustration was further increased by delays in
arriving at the scene and the reaction from the public.

4030 Crew frustration may have been responsible for:

a) increasing the instances when crews didn't press the status buttons in
the correct sequence;

b) the allocated crew taking a different vehicle, or a different crew and
vehicle responding to the incident.

4031 In the month preceding 26 and 27 October 1992 crew frustration also
led to an increase in radio traffic which, owing to the potential for radio
bottlenecks, increased the number of failed data mobilisations and voice
communication delays. In turn, and completing the loop, failed data
mobilisations and voice communications delays lead to further increased
voice communications and crew frustration. On 26 October instruction was
for minimum voice communication. Statistics show that the number of
successful data mobilisations increased. However, with no voice
communications, wrong or multiple allocations were not corrected thus
negating the beneficial effect of increase data mobilisations.

4032 Turning to telephone communications between the public and CAC, delays
to patients and uncovered incidents greatly increased the number of call
backs, thus increasing the total number of calls handled. An increased call
volume, together with a slow system and too few call takers caused
significant delays in telephone answering, thereby further increasing
delays to patients.

     --------------

FAILURE OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. 4 NOVEMBER 1992

4033 Following the CAD problems of 26 and 27 October 1992, CAC had reverted
to a semi manual method of operation, identical to that which had operated
with a variable degree of success before 26 October.

4034 This method of working comprised:

a) calls being taken on the CAD system (including use of gazetteer);

b) incident details being printed out in CAC;

c) optimum vehicle resource identified through contact with nearest station
to incident;

d) mobilisation of the resource via CAD, direct to the station printer or
to the MDT.

4035 In general CAC staff were comfortable with operating this system as
they found the computer based call taking and the gazetteer for the most
part reliable. There were known inadequacies with the gazetteer and
occasional "lock-up" problems with workstations, but overall the benefits
outweighed the disadvantages. The vehicle crews were also more comfortable
as the stations still had local flexibility in deciding which resource to
allocate to an incident. The radio voice channels were available to help
clear up any mobilisation misunderstandings. Largely as a result of the
problems of the previous week, additional call taking staff had been
allocated to each shift thus reducing significantly the average call
waiting time.

4036 This system operated with reasonable success from the afternoon of 27
October 1992 up to the early hours of 4 November.

4037 However, shortly after 2am on 4 November the system slowed
significantly and, shortly after this, locked up altogether. Attempts were
made to re-boot (switch off and restart workstations) in the manner that
CAC staff had previously been instructed by Systems Options to do in these
circumstances. This re-booting failed to overcome the problem with the
result that calls in the system could not be printed out and mobilisations
via CAD from incident summaries could not take place. CAC management and
staff, having assured themselves that all calls had been accounted for by
listening to the voice tapes, and having taken advice from senior
management, reverted fully to a manual, paper-based system with voice or
telephone mobilisation. As these problems occurred in the early hours when
the system was not stretched the operational disruption was minimised.

4038 SO [Systems Options Ltd.] were called in immediately to investigate
the reasons for the failure. In particular LAS required an explanation as
to why the specified fallback to the standby system had not worked.

4039 The Inquiry Team has concluded that the system crash was caused by a
minor programming error. In carrying out some work on the system some three
weeks previously the SO programmer had inadvertently left in the system a
piece of program code that caused a small amount of memory within the file
server to be used up and not released every time a vehicle mobilisation was
generated by the system. Over a three week period these activities had
gradually used up all available memory thus causing the system to crash.
This programming error should not have occurred and was caused by
carelessness and lack of quality assurance of program code changes. Given
the nature of the fault it is unlikely that it would have been detected
through conventional programmer or user testing.

4040 The failure of the fallback procedures arises as a consequence of what
was believed at the time to be only a temporary addition of printers. The
concept of the system was that it would operate on a totally paperless
basis. Printers were only added, as a short term expedient, in order to
implement at least a partial system at the originally planned
implementation date of 8 January 1992.

4041 The fallback to the second server was never implemented by SO as an
integral part of this level of CAD implementation. It was always specified,
and indeed implemented, as part of the complete paperless system and thus
arguably would have activated had the system actually crashed on 26 and 27
October 1992. However, there is no record of this having been tested and
there can be no doubt that the effects of server failure on the
printer-based system had not been tested. This was a serious oversight on
the part of both LAS IT staff and SO and reflects, at least in part, the
dangers of LAS not having their own network manager.

	Today, WHO radio in Des Moines, Iowa ran a story on STS-56 in their
newscast.  The "fix" is to bypass the sensor, fooling the computer into
thinking the valve is properly closed.  What's the risk?  I somehow doubt
totally bypassing a sensor can be any safer than fixing the problem, and the
cost of delays might be contrasted with the cost of Challenger.

	Beware that of quick kludge, particularly when there are lives
literally riding on its working correctly.

I just found a bounced risk in an old mailbox. When it bounced expired locally
on some machine, I decided not to pursue it; but in light of the recent
"Massive Tax Fraud" claims by the Canadian government, I resubmit it with an
update.

Update:

In an earlier unposted risk I mentioned:

&gt; I recently went to one of these services and was appalled at the (relative)
&gt; incompetence of the prepaper and the fact that he sends the data to
&gt; Vancouver over an insecure line (I only found out after it was not
&gt; done in the promised time frame and he explained the delays).

Although the risk I cited was security, the incompetence of the preparer
made him over-calculate my refund by $1600.  I wonder if the recent
"Massive Tax Fraud" (headline of the Kitchener-Waterloo Record,
Thursday, April 8) reported by the government is partly due to such
incompetent preparers.

On the CTV news last night (Wed. April 7, 11pm), they reported that a
financial analyst said that the "Massive Tax Fraud" (in the headlines
of the Kitchener-Waterloo Record, Thursday, April 8) was more likely a
scare tactic by the Canadian Government since the numbers quoted by the
government don't add up and the filing deadline April 31 is approaching.

They said most of the blame is on "fraudulent tax preparers" who are
trying to taking advantage of the electronic filing system since the
return is not accompanied by receipts.

I suppose the specific "risk" is the one the government
took by allowing anybody to become an EFILE tax preparer.

Previous risk submission (bounced):

Subject: Canadian EFILE tax return confidentiality measures (NOT!)
To: comp.risks
Date: Mon, 1 Mar 93 10:57:28 EST

Canada now has a nationwide program to facilitate the electronic
submission of tax forms, called the EFILE Electronic Filing program.

&gt;From the Applicant's kit:

  What is EFILE -- understanding the service

  The service or combination of services that you choose to provide to
  your clients determines what type of electronic filer you are.  There
  are two basic services, and therefore two types of electronic
  filers: preparers and transmitters.  ...

  Communications system  ...

  Contact, using a modem, with our EFILE receiving system will have to
  come through a "packet switch" network.  You can buy access to this
  network directly,  from either Telecom Canada (DataPac) or Unitel
  (FasPac).  In order to protect the confidentiality of income tax
  information,  minimum security requirements for data sent over one
  of these packet switch networks are that the data must be
  transmitted over secure lines (ie a dedicated line together with
  membership in RCT's closed user group).

  In the near future, an alternative will be available whereby
  encrypted data is transferred without the need for a dedicated line
  by "dialing-in" to the network. 	...

The risk is that the government's "minimum security" policy only covers
transmission to the government computer.  Before that, there is the freedom
for the preparer to transmit the form anywhere by any means.

This in fact happens since a dedicated line represents a significant cost
(approx. $300 installation, $250/month) which means that there are
"transmitter centers" to which preparers send their data via modem or
diskette.  Since tax preparers in Ontario are connecting via modem to centers
as far away as Vancouver illustrates that such centers facilitate the task of
mass interception if one is really intent on doing so.  In any case, it should
be clear that the current policy does not adequately protect the
confidentiality of the information.

I recently went to one of these services and was appalled at the (relative)
incompetence of the prepaper and the fact that he sends the data to Vancouver
over an insecure line (I only found out after it was not done in the promised
time frame and he explained the delays).

I was recently contacted by someone from Dick Clark Productions, asking me to
help them develop an NBC TV special called CAUGHT IN THE ACT. This will be a
one-hour special in May featuring real-life videotapes of criminals from
surveillance (security) cameras, covert camera installations, and in-car
cameras.

The producers contacted me to see if I had any tapes or could help them to
locate some.  They said that they are looking for solid, dramatic footage--and
are especially interested in "dramatic incidents, unsolved crimes, and
bungling crooks".

Here is the RISK issue.  "We are looking for interesting footage, especially
that which will help educate the public about the necessity for video
surveillance, and to illustrate how effective cameras can be in preventing and
solving crimes."

Recently, there has been a flood of cheap-to-produce programs, where viewers
contribute their (sometimes staged only for tv) videos.  Many of these
programs contain shocking sequences, guaranteed to attract a wide consumer
audience.  Some social scientists and other killjoys have suggested that these
programs add to a sense of doom and danger that is found today, especially
among those who gain their newscoverage or sense of the world mainly from tv.
While at least one of these programs has led to the capture of wanted
criminals, the heightened view of continual violence and the ineffectiveness
of law enforcement adds to social tension without resolution, except for more
use of surveillance.

Thank you, Dick Clark, but I would rather not have you educate the public
about the necessity for video surveillance.  That necessity is filled with
danger for us all.  And it is not even so certain how effective cameras have
really been in preventing and solving crimes, with certain well known
exceptions.

I'll not be watching the program when it airs.  In the meanwhile, I hope
readers of RISKS and others interested in contributing to more quality tv and
curbing this attempt to glorify surveillance will contact Dick Clark
Productions and NBC to let them know that we are being entertained to death.

control the use of their computers and can therefore limit private use for,
say, E-mail. The solution is to consider E-mail access as a fringe benefit.

I have worked with traffic flow equations.  The ones I dealt with were
subject to shock waves and had some very stiff regions.  In fact they
are very similar to adiabatic supersonic fluid flow.  I suppose one
could argue that this is chaotic in the sense that I read into this
comment.  But they did not have strange attractors.

The following line from the report on the London Ambulance Service
reminded me of some early experience.

&gt;The resilience of the hardware under a full load had not been tested.

In the late sixties I worked on IBM's "Advanced Administrative System."  This
was a very large system for its day.  It was expected to have 5000 users and,
at its peak, 300 developers.  The system was very successful and we learned a
great deal.

The success of the system was due in large part to the experience of its
management.  Some of the management team had worked on the American Airlines
Sabre System.  Their experience was reflected in part by a collection of
system lore, stories that were told and retold.

One of the stories was about the behavior of systems under load.  It recounted
the conversion of the New York Reservation Center of AA to Sabre.  The
conversion had gone very well.  The NY center was the last of many to be
converted and no problems were expected.

However, the NY center was also the biggest and represented the largest load.
After it was converted, response time, which had been relatively short, flat,
and stable, suddenly went up dramatically until the system essentially
stopped.  There was no plan to back off the load, i.e., de-convert from Sabre
back to the manual system.  It took three weeks to get the system back on
line.

While response time had not appeared to be sensitive to load, at some critical
point the system began to spend so much time managing its queues that it did
not have time to take anything off of them.  The queues grew until the system
fell over.

The story may well be apocryphal but the lesson was valid and important and
our management was very sensitive to it.

&gt;  * An `automatic' speed-control system has three speeds, 10, 27, and 50 mph.
&gt;   [Apparently ZERO is not considered a speed.]

These three speeds are recognizable to railfans as the typical of a
DC-motor system.  The speeds are approximate.  The speed is determined
simply by the current running through the motors, which is controlled
by passing the current through resistors and by feeding the current
through pairs of motors in series or parallel.  50 would be full
parallel, 27 (about half speed) full series.  Those are the only two
running speeds, and intermediate speeds are accomplished mainly by
coasting, as powered running at intermediate speeds would heat up the
resistors, which are meant to be used just to reach a running speed.

The 10 mph speed calls for further explanation.  Apparently the system
uses "permissive" signalling, meaning the driver does not have to stop
at red.  Bear in mind that the Muni cars run in streets "by sight"
where the drivers have to be trusted to run at a speed appropriate to
conditions and not other hit Muni cars or automobiles on the tracks.
Because of the limited sight distance in the subway, they're not given
free rein as they are in the street, but are held to 10 mph or less.
Running at 10 would of course require using the resistors, so what is
really done is to apply power briefly and then coast.  This should
work if the drivers can be trusted.  If the drivers cannot be trusted,
they shouldn't be allowed in the street either.

&gt; The controls were thought to be `foolproof', because the car
&gt; automatically slows or stops if the operator exceeds the maximum
&gt; indicated speed.  There are also impedance bonds in the tracks that
&gt; are supposed to determine whether the track ahead is clear.

The signal system must include timers to detect speed, and some kind
of feedback device that controls the car.  The simplest, old-fashioned
device is a trip, a little arm that rises from track level and hits
a "trip cock" hanging from the train, and applies the emergency brake.
Since this says "slows or stops" I take it something a little more
electronic must be used.  

Likewise the signal system detects presence of a car in a section of
track, that is, what's known as block signals.  I believe this is also
is a permissive system, where cars are allowed to approach right up to
each other as long as they run dead slow, the 10 mph limit.  ("Heavy"
subways and mainline railroads would typically have absolute block,
where a second train is not allowed at all in the same block.)

&gt;  ``... was the result  of the operator deliberately disabling the
&gt; safety system so that he could speed up his train, sources close to the
&gt; investigation said''.

This is extremely bad, not only that the operator did it, but that he
-could- do it.  I doubt he has the same car every day, so he had to be
able to prepare this fairly quickly.  I wonder whether disabling it
is meant to be done en route under some conditions? --probably not.
If even one signal failed, for example, it would be safer to make
everyone pass it at 10 than at any higher speed.

BKSYSLAW.RVW   930402

PC Information Group, Inc.,. 1126 East Broadway, Winona, MN   55987
Syslaw, 2nd ed., Lance Rose and Jonathan Wallace, 1992

The introduction to "Syslaw" states that although the title implies the
existence of a new kind of law relating to electronic bulletin board systems,
in reality it is simply and extension of existing laws, mores and practices.
In the same way, although the book states itself to be aimed at the BBS
community, and particularly sysops, there is much here of interest and moment
to anyone involved with sharing information through computer systems.

The book also starts with a "disclaimer": the authors suggest that any
significant concerns with legal affairs be taken to a lawyer.  Parts of the
book may give concern to experts in the specific fields: I was disappointed by
the coverage of viral programs (and rather intrigued by a somewhat
idiosyncratic definition of "worm").  That aside, the book is an excellent
overview of the legal situation and considerations with regard to computer
communications systems.

Chapter one is entitled "Your rights as a sysop", although "First Amendment"
(the first amendment to the American constitution deals with "free speech")
arguments seem to comprise the bulk of it.  Chapter two discusses contracts,
and the advisability to have a formal contract so that there is an express
understanding between caller and sysop.  Chapter three deals with copyright
and other "intellectual property" issues.  Chapter four deals with "injurious
materials": it is somewhat surprising that it is not more closely related with
chapters eight ("Viruses and other dangerous code") and nine ("Sexually
explicit material).  chapters five, six and seven deal with privacy, crime
directly related to BBS operation and search and seizure, respectively.  All
of them rely quite heavily on examination of the existing American statutes.

A number of appendices are included.  B through H are copies of various
related American legislation: I is a list of various state computer crime laws
(although the table of contents makes reference to "Sexual Exploitation of
Children").  Appendix J is an annotated bibliography of sources for further
study.  Interestingly, for a book supposedly targeted at BBS sysops, none of
the materials are cited in "online" form.

Appendix A, however, is probably of greatest interest: it is a sample "caller
contract"; an agreement between the "users" and "owners" of computer systems. 
Written in a "folksy" style, and intended as a understanding between sysops and
their "members", it is still a valuable template for any organization with
online information systems and general "communications" functions such as email
(and, these days, voice mail).

A recommendation that I would make to the authors for the third edition is to
make the book less "American".  On the face of it, this might seem like a
strange request.  Laws vary from country to country, and it is impossible to
write a book covering all possible laws.  However, there are many legal
precepts which are common to almost all legal systems.  Chapter two of
"Syslaw", for example, deals with contracts.  It does so in a very general
way, applicable to almost all situations.  Chapter one, on the other hand,
deals with the "First Amendment" to the American Constitution, and is
therefore of little use to anyone in any other country.  Chapter three falls
into the range between: it deals with copyright and other related concepts,
but from an American perspective and with specific and extensive reference to
American laws.  Most of the book falls somewhere into the middle ranges.

Most systems managers and computer operators tend to see "systems law"
primarily in relation to "pirate software".  Syslaw is a valuable guide in
opening discussions of many related topics which are all too often either
neglected, or pass over as being of little importance.

I don't know why they don't have a copy of the U.S. treaty agreeing
to abide by the Berne Convention. The Convention itself is a bit
more than 4 years old, though :-). Perhaps you've been looking in
the wrong place?

At any rate, as a member of the information elite, the text of the Berne 
Convention is readily available to you.

The following was clipped from a file available from the gopher server
run by Cornell's Law School (fatty.law.cornell.edu). It is one of the
historical documents provided to them by the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy, Tufts University.

I assume that the first line refers to a UN publication series. You might 
want to check to see if the Copyright Office carries that. Presumably 
the Library of Congress does.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I send a personal letter to someone do they have the right to 
&gt;&gt; disclose it to others without my consent? 
&gt;
&gt;No.  The Copyright act of 1978 and later amendments gave statutory
&gt;protection at the federal level for the first time to unpublished works.

To a lawyer like me, this doesn't sound right. True, copyright protection
extends to unpublished works, and, since the U.S. became signatory to the
Berne Convention, to unregistered unpublished works.

But this has not yet been interpreted to mean that the recipient of a
letter cannot *disclose* it without the author's permission--only that the
recipient cannot *publish* it. Now, in this medium the distinction between
between disclosure and publication is a lot muddier than it is elsewhere,
but it seems likely to me that the mere disclosure of e-mail by a
recipient is not going to lead to copyright-infringement case unless the
recipient takes money for disclosing it. The normal measure of damages in
a copyright action is based on the amount of lost profits to the author
and/or the amount of profits earned by the publisher. Statutory damages
require that the author register the letter with the Copyright Office.

If someone sent me flaming e-mail, and I felt like reposting it to the
Net, I certainly wouldn't hesitate for fear of an infringement lawsuit.

(I'd hesitate because I think it's bad manners, but that's about it.)

&gt;&gt; If it is permitted doesn't that suggest that we have greater privacy
&gt;&gt; protection for electronic communication because the ECPA would prohibit
&gt;&gt; that kind of disclosure?
&gt; 
&gt;I think you are confusing things.  The ECPA gives to Electronic mail the
&gt;same protections which are available for telephone conversations - the
&gt;protection against interception by third parties or the use of intercepted
&gt;E-Mail by law enforcement personnel without a warrant, i.e. what the laws
&gt;against wiretapping and recording of telephone calls, the ECPA provides to
&gt;the same extent to E-Mail.

ECPA explicitly does not prohibit recipients from disclosing the contents
of their communications.

Sadly, ECPA also does not provide any protection against "the use of
intercepted E-Mail by law enforcement personnel without a warrant."
An attempt to exclude illegally seized e-mail would have to be based
solely on the Fourth Amendment (a slim reed, IMHO).

&gt;... there are no formalities or requirements of notification in order for
&gt;a work to obtain copyright protection.

Not quite true. As I understand the current Copyright Act, statutory damages,
for example, still require registration of copyright.

[Paul's message] is a mix of truth and irrelevancies.  I checked with a friend
who is an intellectual properly lawyer, and he looked in one of the standard
books on copyright protection (Zimmer).  However, the following is MY GLOSS on
rather complex (and not completely settled) area of law.

It is true that under the Berne convention copyright notices are optional.
This is not a big a change as you might think: Under common-law copyright,
they were always optional *until publication*.  If someone stole an
unpublished work - say, a program sitting in someone's account - and posted it
on a bulletin board, copyright protection would still apply, and the original
author could come after, not just the person who stole the work, but any party
who made a copy from the bulletin board.

There would be a difference in what the copyright owner could come after the
various parties *for*, however.  He could go for major damages against the
thief, but someone who copied the program off the bulletin board could claim
that they were an innocent infringer who had no way of knowing the material
was protected by copyright.  If successful in that claim, about all that could
happen would be that the innocent infringer would be required to return or
destroy all copies of the material.

Berne changed nothing in this scenario, EXCEPT that the same rights now apply
even if the ORIGINAL AUTHOR published the material without a copyright notice.
The "innocent infringer" defense is still available.  Under Berne, the main
effect of INCLUDING a copyright notice - and the authorities on the subject
strong recommend that you do - is that it absolutely blocks any attempt at an
"innocent infringer" defense.  (Of course, if a thief removed the copyright
notice and passed the material on to someone who had no reason to suspect that
the copyright was claimed on the material, that's another story - just as
someone who buys a car from a used car dealer cannot be charged with theft (or
even, generally, made to return the car) if it turns out to have been stolen.
Buy the same car from some guy in the street who claims to have "lost" the
paperwork and you will be treated very differently.)

Mr. Robinson's mention of "licensing" is irrelevant.  There is no such thing
as licensing in copyright law, which has to do with copying.  It is pretty
well established that RUNNING a program does not constitute copying it, any
more than reading a book constitutes copying it into your brain cells.  (There
were attempts early on to claim that running a program was like performing a
piece of music, but that theory didn't make much sense and went nowhere.  If
it had, you would have had to receive a "right to copy" of some bizarre
limited sort every time you bought a program.  The closest analogy now made is
that running a program is like playing a recording - permission of the
copyright owner is needed to MAKE the recording, but anyone can PLAY the
recording as many times as they like, at least for themselves.)

As for the damages, if you are an innocent infringer, you are not liable for
any.  Of course, you'd better be damn sure of your "innocent infringer"
status.  If you got the program off a pirate bulletin board that specializes
in stolen software, you could be in trouble, copyright notice or no.

Stepping back a bit to look at the ethical issues, I find Mr. Robinson's whole
approach most disturbing.  I was brought up under the injunction that one
should not use someone else's property without permission.  If I don't have
good reason to believe something is in the public domain, I won't use it
without permission.  It doesn't matter if the author has gone to the trouble
of attaching a legal copyright notice:  *The stuff isn't mine.*

The law generally takes as its basis this same moral stand.  I don't need to
put a sign a my car to tell others that I claim it as mine.  Even if I leave
it running, with the keys in it, you have no right to use it.  If you want to
use it, ask me.

For whatever historical reasons in the United States, copyright law has
required notice.  Trespassing requires notice, too, but that's because in
unmarked countryside it's difficult for anyone to know where the boundaries
are:  If you want to keep people off your land, you have to make it clear
where your land starts.  You don't need to put a "No trespassing" sign on
your front door to tell people to stay out of your house.  The Berne
convention simply recognizes that it's simple to tell when you are using
someone else's words, music - or computer program.  There's no ambiguity
about it.  So why should advance notice be required?

If you want to use the fruit of someone else's work, simple morality says you
should get permission - whether blanket permission in the form of a release to
the public domain on the work itself, or specific, personal permission.  If
that inconveniences you, well, just what makes YOUR time and effort so damned
important when SOMEONE ELSE did the work?

Head-on train collision in Berlin

At 14:23 on Good Friday an Intercity train leaving Berlin collided head on
with a train approaching Berlin just outside the city limits near Wannsee.
This is a portion of track that is being electrified "under pressure", as the
German Bundesbahn wants to run its ICE trains on the line from May 23. During
the week only one track is used so that workers can work on the other track.
On weekends and holidays both tracks are available. The approaching train was
a "special train" that is added to the timetable for holidays to cope with the
traffic.

The trains were only going at 30 kmh because of the construction, and at least
one of the engineers saw the collision coming: he pulled the brake and jumped
the train, his co-engineer ran towards the back of the train and was severely
injured. Both engineers in the other train and a passenger were killed, over
20 were wounded, 7 remain in the hospital this morning.

There was much finger-pointing at first: both trains appeared to have proper
signals, as they were assumed to be on different tracks; the "Stellwerk" (is
that the switch controller?) was said to have been misoperated; each train
company (Wannsee is on the border between the DR and the DB train authority:
after 3 1/2 years of reunification they still haven't got the trains sorted
out) accused the other; workers were said to have inadvertently capped an
important cable. A blanket of silence has been imposed, the officials will
neither confirm nor deny anything at the moment.

The preliminary results of the train crash in Berlin on Good Friday were
published in the "Tagespiegel" this morning.
 
It seems that the computerized signals worked perfectly: the
"Fahrdienstleiter", the person in charge of setting the switches and the
overseeing the signals set the switch wrong - to one-way traffic (workday)
instead of two-way traffic (holiday). The computer reacted by setting the
outbound signal correctly to "halt".  The overseer believed that this was a
defect in the system, and overrode the signal by setting the temporary extra
signal (which is just for when the track is under construction) to "proceed"
without telephoning anyone to investigate the supposed signal error. The
overseer overlooked [PGN would say: oversaw] the fact that a non-regularly
scheduled train was approaching the switch, he believed that the track was
free.

The risks question: How easy should it be for a person to override such a
system?  Or is this just a question of human error, to be accepted as
"Schicksal", fate?

The current Discovery mission is monitoring ozone and several dozen other
atmospheric gases.  However, the on-board recorder does not have enough
storage for the full mission's data, and the data is supposed to be
transmitted back to earth.  Unfortunately, there is a high-rate data channel
problem on the shuttle antenna that is blocking transmission; NASA has been
unable to overcome that problem thus far.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

   [Abstracted by PGN from a UPI item forwarded by ARM from 
   clarinews@clarinet.com, datelined Anaheim, California]

An unidentified employee of the Anaheim Police Department apparently misused
his access to the DMV computer system to obtain the home address of a man who
had been targeted by anti-abortionists.  This led to Chris Criner's house in
Tustin CA being picketed in February 1993.

  ``It taught me I can't trust anyone,'' Criner said. ``When you find
  out the perpetrators of harassment were helped by the Anaheim Police
  Department, you wonder where does it stop.''

Under state law, unauthorized disclosure of DMV records is a misdemeanor with
penalties up to one year in jail plus a fine of $5,000.

It's that time of year, and I have just got my tax return back from the
accountant.  During 1992 I had to pay estimated tax on a capital gain from
selling stock.  The program my accountant used to calculate the amount had TWO
major bugs.

Firstly, it did not deduct the amount of state tax I was estimating I should
pay before estimating the federal.  Secondly, it ignored a foreign tax credit
when calculating alternative minimum tax.  The net result of this was a $36.8K
overpayment!  This was a well known PC-based commercial package used by many
accountants across the country.

Luckily for me, they changed the program before running the 1992 return and
found the mistake -- so I am out some $700 in interest for the period.

However it brings home that the tax code is now so complex that in many cases
advisors treat the output of their programs as beyond question.  Had the error
been the other way and not been found, the consequences in penalties, etc.,
could have been very worrying.

  [ For the non-US reader, the US tax code is a gothic monstrosity that nobody
    would believe if they had not seen it.  Being English, I thought the 
    Inland Revenue was bad, but the US system is mind boggling in it's 
    complexity and stupidity. ]

  [ For the tax-minded, I had a very complex foreign source and foreign
    capital gain transaction with UK tax credits, the total returns (Fed and
    California) are over half an inch thick. ]

There has been a considerable amount of traffic on the net concerning
Seagate's new 3.5Gb drives that came out a few months ago.  As it turns out,
SunOS (presumably the Berkeley file system) can't handle partitions over 2 Gb
(2^31 - 1), so one is forced to install the drive in two partitions.  Didn't
MS-DOS have a similar problem only yesterday...

What went wrong?  I can't imagine it is more difficult to design, build, and
market a 3.5Gb drive than it is to write/fix a file-system implementation to
support current hardware.

I just hope this happens before we hit the secondary limit of 8 partitions
per drive, or the tertiary limit of 8 LUNs (logical units) per SCSI device!

As a "software dude" i'm somewhat embarrassed to once again have been
outdone by the "hardware dudes"!

&gt;&gt;  ``... was the result  of the operator deliberately disabling the
&gt;&gt; safety system so that he could speed up his train, sources close to the
&gt;&gt; investigation said''.

&gt;This is extremely bad, not only that the operator did it, but that he
&gt;-could- do it.

Yes and No.  A safety system that cannot be disabled is, in itself, a risk, if
the system were to malfunction.

Far better is a safety system that, when disabled, leaves unmistakable
evidence that it has been meddled with, thus allowing responsibility to be
assigned, and providing a powerful incentive NOT to disable it without
justification.

A classic example would be to put the disabling mechanism behind a pane of
glass, with a hammer nearby, and a policy that "if the glass gets broken,
you'd better be able to explain why."

&gt;&gt; ... The "fix" is to bypass the sensor, fooling the computer into
&gt;&gt; thinking the valve is properly closed.  

In all fairness, they had alternate sources of information.

As was mentioned in sci.space and in RISKS a couple of days ago, they had
telemetry to monitor the temperature of the vent pipe that was downstream of
the valve and would have remained cold had the valve not in fact closed.

I don't know whether the software was told to worry about the vent pipe
temperature before the rewrite that got them off the ground, but i sincerely
hope that when they decided not to check for a valve closure indication they
also decided to check for this vent pipe temperature.  By now they should know
how this pipe temperature normally behaves.

And if the temperature doesn't rise fast enough, either the valve didn't close
or it's too cold for the %$#%&amp;$#&amp;^$*^ O-rings, anyway ;-) .

The problem with "nnnn" in a gateway reminds me of the use of such sequences
as Telex end of message and as delimiters. I remember MMMM and LLLL so I
wouldn't be surprised at NNNN having a special significance. Perhaps they only
worked at the beginning of a line to reduce the likelihood of seeing them
during normal transmissions.

                  Office of the Press Secretary

     _________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993

                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY

The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal
Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the
security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate
needs of law enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the
development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and
wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector
and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic
vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use
technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic
growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government
against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect
electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail
and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect
business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also
can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has been developed
by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption
technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices
that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone
communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many
in commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information,
protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized
release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology
preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.

A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the "Clipper Chip" is
used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing
the chip will have two unique "keys," numbers that will be needed by
authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When
the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two
"key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.
Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal
authorization to conduct a wiretap.

The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities
to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General
will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition,
respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the
confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly
report their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's
dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and
industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the
"Clipper Chip" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens
with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to
hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and
explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has
directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption
that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.

The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the
development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new
telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented
access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming,
and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that
infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent,
comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to
policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions
of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also
available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE

Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

</i><PRE>

Note:     The following was released by the White House today in
          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip
          encryption technology.

                           FACT SHEET
                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The President has approved a directive on "Public Encryption Management."  The
directive provides for the following:

Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of
a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products
scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by
preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use
digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of
communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information
age.

Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful
government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this
effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart
foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the
past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and
national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and
civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so
will require new, innovative approaches.

In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a
microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is
substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also
permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for
the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted
information only with appropriate legal authorization.

To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and
decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I
hereby direct the following action to be taken:

INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS

The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall
request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption
to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their
products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be
concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are
made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers,
consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In
making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from
developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or
algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure
key-escrow system.

KEY-ESCROW

The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney
General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate
U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive. 

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.

I suppose we should have expected something after all of the sound and
fury of the last few years. The announcement does not really give
enough information though.

My first thought involves conventional compromise: what happens if the 
keys are captured through theft *and you know about it* - how difficult 
is it to change the keys ? What do you do between the time the loss is
detected and the time a new key set is approved. How difficult is it
to program the chip or do you need a new one ? (and if the chip can
be reprogrammed, how do you prevent covert changes that will not be
discovered until authorization to tap is received and the agency finds 
out that it cannot ?). Potentially this must occur every time a trusted
employee leaves.

For some time, I have been playing with dynamic access cards ("tokens")
as seeds for full session encryption rather than just for password devices.
Since the encryption requires three parts (PIN, challenge, and token)
which are only physically together at the secure system, and since only
the challenge passes on the net, and since once encryption starts you
have not only provided protection to the session, you have also authenticated
both ends simultaneously (by the fact that you can communicate), it seems
ideal. *And everything necessary already exists*. From several US companies.
It just has not been put together as a commercial product (FUD at work 8*(.

Since key generation is on-the-fly at the onset of the session, obviously
what the gov needs is not the key but the "key to the key" (of course
computers, even a PC, are really good at this.

The real question is "Why a new chip ?"  The technology to do this has been
around for years and several DES chips are available commercially today.
The BCC laptop (I like Beaver better 8*) 007 provides this internally
today with (I believe) the LSI-Logic chip and Enigma-Logic's PC-SAFE (plugs) 
does the same with software alone. As indicated in the announcement,
financial institutions have been using encrypted transmissions for years
without any great outcry.

IMHO the real hold-up has been $$$ - cheap error-correcting modem 
technology to prevent synch losses rather than a lack of good crypto 
algorithms. Today this is a done deal (actually we have known how to keep 
in synch since the sixties but you couldn't buy 56kb for under $300.00 at 
BizMart - now part of K-Mart ! - then).

True, there are a lot of questions yet to be answered, but again IMHO 
most center on the exception cases and not the encryption technology itself.

I have just read with considerable interest the "White House Crypto
Statement" posted to comp.society.

Briefly, it announces a "Clipper Chip" that will provide voice and data
encryption.  Every chip will have two keys kept in two separate "key escrow"
banks.  Law enforcement officers needing to conduct a wire tap will get a
court order, go to the key escrow banks, and then decrypt the messages.

The encryption algorithm is secret, but a panel of cryptologists could be
invited to inspect it.

For more details, call Mat Heyman, NIST, (301) 975-2758

In the "Questions and Answers" section of the statement, the following
text appears:

&gt; Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
&gt;      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
&gt;      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
&gt;      powerful encryption devices?
&gt; 
&gt; A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
&gt;      considered during the broad policy review.   [...]
&gt;      ... Rather, both concerns can be,
&gt;      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
&gt;      balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
&gt;      Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

This is not entirely clear.  Does it mean that the Administration might
ban all encryption except for the Clipper Chip?  If not, how would
they stop criminals and terrorists from using something else?

The Administration might sell these chips abroad.  How will the Key
Escrow system work then?

How will the Administration handle free-trade issues?  How can a non-US
manufacturer export Clipper devices to the US without getting a look at the
algorithm (which is secret).  How would key escrow work with a non-US
manufacturer?

How will the algorithm be kept secret?  What is to stop someone prying the
device apart and examining the chip circuitry?

*Why* is the algorithm secret?  RSA is public and seems unbreakable.  Ditto
DES apart from a few known weaknesses.  This smells of a hidden agenda.  Could
it be trade?  Could it be part of a strategy to ban "bootleg" Clipper
technology where foreign chips conform to the standard but do not have the
keys in escrow.

How will law enforcers match keys to chips?  They won't have access to the
chip serial number.  Maybe the chip transmits its serial number every few
seconds of transmission.  If so then we have a nice way of doing traffic
analysis and tracking on suspects (or anyone else) without needing the keys.

As soon as the official press release on the Clipper chip was posted a barrage
of posts concerned with the safety and RISKS of said chip smothered the net.
Nearly all of them were negative. For those of you who missed it, the Clipper
Chip is purported to be the 'Officially Sanctioned' cryptographic cypher chip.
The feature that everyone is getting upset about is that the FBI will have the
only general de-cypher box. Furthermore, the algorithm for encryption is
secret.

My concern about this whole scheme is greater than I can express here.  I'm
sure the next couple of RISKS forums will be filled with messages concerning
the Clipper Chip, but for what it's worth, here's my $0.02:

I am concerned that this is the first step towards banning any other
encryption device that does not use the CC.  I am concerned that if there
*exists* a general de-cypher box, it can be stolen/hacked/duplicated/captured
by aliens.  I am concerned about the fact that the encryption algorithm is
secret. There is no way we can be sure the algorithm is sufficiently secure.
Key length is not the only factor in telling how secure an algorithm is. An
encryption scheme should be secure even if the algorithm is known.  I am
concerned that if this thing takes off in the States, other countries will not
follow, making international communications no more secure. And is other
countries do follow, there will be more than one decrypt-box, which in turn
will multiply the risks of one of these boxes being stolen hacked/corrupted in
any other way. This box will be become a *hot* item for organised crime. (Why
do I keep seeing scenes from 'Sneakers'?)

In short: I think this whole CC thing is an ungood idea, and I hope for
everyone who values his privacy that it will never lift-off.

In the light of the recent Clipper announcement, forum readers may wish
to revisit the discussions of "Who Holds the Keys?".  A good place to
start, in addition to some of the material in CACM of March 1993 (which
relates mainly to the FBI's digital telephony initiative), is Proceedings

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised, April 21, 1993

INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&amp;T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC 
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

	Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called
for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's
newly-announced "Public Encryption Management" initiative.  The new
cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the
National Security Agency (NSA), the super-secret military intelligence agency,
had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new
initiative is built.

	According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential
directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to
public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National
Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.
The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act,
which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military
computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the
creation of such standards.

	CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the
so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a communications authentication
technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR
sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the
first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  NSA is
due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of
records concerning its creation of the DSS.

	David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent
commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in
today's official statement, "a step in the right direction."  But he
questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy
that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  "At
a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information
infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal
privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not
appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and
opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the
development process."

	CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry
professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.
CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in Palo Alto,
California, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional

If all of the privacy concerns about the Clipper chip magically disappeared,
the chip will still encounter widespread economic resistance.  Why? Because
almost everything can be done cheaper in software and the secrecy surrounding
the algorithm effectively prohibits software implementations.

Why would a computer designer add a high-speed encryption chip to the machine?
Even if the chips cost about $25 in large quantities, they could still add
about $100 to the final cost after everyone takes their markups.  The computer
designer must ask whether people are willing to spend extra to buy a box when
the clone manufacturer in the garage down the street isn't going to be putting
one in.

Adding encryption in software is a different proposition.  There is a one-time
cost of engineering and a small extra cost for increased support.  Once the
code is written, the manufacturing costs do not increase.  Also, software can
retrofit machines for no extra cost and add widespread compatibility after the
update is finished.  This is why Novell, Apple and Microsoft choose to add
encryption software in their latest rev of the system software.

It is not even clear that the standard has much of a chance in the phone
system.  DSP chips and digital designs are becoming more and more part of
cellular standards.  Why pay extra for another chip if it can be done in the
DSP? Weight and power consumption are important considerations for these
applications.

I'm sure that the algorithm designers and NSA committee considered the RISKS
of exposing the algorithm.  Scrutiny weakens the code because it makes it
easier for people to attack the system.  It is obvious that the committee
tried to consider some of the economic RISKS involved in promulgating a "Big
Brother" standard.  That is why they arranged for the chips to be presented as
a fait accompli as part of AT&amp;T's latest phones.  But they face an uphill
battle against the forces of economics.

I mailed the following letter to the President today:

To: 0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)
Subject: Second thoughts about your encryption proposal

						17 April 1993

Dear Mr. President --

Since writing my initial reaction I have given considerable second thought to
your encryption proposal, announced yesterday.  I must withdraw my initial
partial support for your plan, pending the release of further details.

My initial assumption was that you were mandating the replacement of every
telephone handset in the USA with one which would digitize the person's voice
and encrypt it.  I assumed that this replacement would start with cellular
handsets and proceed through wireless and wired -- in order of severity of
vulnerability.  Given that the government would mandate such a change and that
that change would interfere with the FBI's current ability to tap voice
telephone calls on the public networks, it made sense to propose an encryption
method which would allow the FBI to continue in court-ordered wiretaps --
specifically via key escrow.

While it would be beneficial from the point of view of improving the
privacy and security of citizens from illegal eavesdropping, I now believe
that this proposal is far too costly to undertake at this time.  The
federal government is facing a huge debt and deficit and the private sector
is far from thriving.  The proposal to pay for some of this equipment with
funds from civil forfeiture adds insult to injury, since abuses of civil
forfeiture have led me to conclude that law enforcement's right to such
funds should be severely restricted if not removed.

If this proposal is only for limited use of such encryption, then it does
little to advance the cause of citizen's privacy and it is in direct
competition with existing products which already service the small market
of citizens who are aware of their vulnerability and who are willing to pay
for assurance of their privacy.  It is especially disturbing that the press
release suggests that this proposal is not merely a call for action but an
already designed implementation which some agency of the administration is
attempting to impose upon the American people.  The talent exists in the
private sector to address these security concerns.

Meanwhile, there is a danger that the key escrow provision is intended to
imply that all cryptosystems used by citizens in the lawful course of their
daily personal and business lives must include key registration.  This
would be an unacceptable erosion of our current rights, especially of the
fundamental right of privacy which you supported so strongly during your
campaign.  Legislation to this effect would be unenforceable.  It would be
easily and frequently broken -- leading to the danger that some law
enforcement officer with a private grudge would have an easy method of
filing a criminal complaint against the innocent victim of his grudge.  A
requirement for key registration would also come directly into conflict
with certain uses of cryptography in advanced computer system design.  In
those cases, both key registration and use of some government-designed chip
are unacceptable.

Meanwhile, there is the additional danger that this proposal would serve as
a vehicle for advancing the FBI's wiretap proposal which was rejected by
Congress last year and which I oppose on several grounds.

I look forward to full technical details of your proposal and to a public
debate on its merits.

Sincerely,

Sometime last week, electronic sign boards along Interstate 95 in Connecticut
were hacked to say "You all suck." These boards are normally used to announce
construction, fog, and whatnot.  Apparently it was several hours before State
Police and the Highway Department were able to clear the messages. Well, it
happened again a day or two ago, with a different message attacking the
Governer. A teenager has been caught; he said that there was no password on
the Highway Department's computer system.

I originally heard this on a short news blurb on WHJY, a rock station in
Providence RI, so I'm sure the accuracy is all you would expect it to be.
Confirming reports welcomed!

I'm just waiting for the day that the speed limit signs go electronic.
They'll probably only allow two digits, though...

In RISKS 14:50, dww@math.fu-berlin.de (Debora Weber-Wulff) writes:

DWW&gt; ...The computer reacted by setting the outbound signal
DWW&gt; correctly to "halt".  The overseer believed that this 
DWW&gt; was a defect in the system, and overrode the signal...
DWW&gt; without telephoning anyone to investigate the supposed error.

The last line, of course, explain the proximate cause and points a flashing
red arrow toward the root cause.  I read RISKS 14:50 just a couple of days
after a lessons-learned article on "lockout/ tagout" in Occupational Safety
OBSERVER, a newsletter from the Department of Energy's Office of Safety and
Quality Assurance.  (Lockout/tagout is a set of rules and procedures meant to
keep electricians and others who work with stored energy from releasing it
through themselves.)

The article pointed out, strenuously, that the cardinal rule of lockout/tagout
is, "*never* remove a tag affixed by someone else."  When you have virtual
"tags" affixed by a computer, and operators who perhaps were not exposed to
the subset of technical endeavors where the lockout/tagout discipline is used,
you have a risk added to another risk!

The irony, of course, is that the computer system took the right action but
was subverted by its user.  I doubt that there will ever be a system so
sophisticated that some dumb bunny can't cause a disaster.  The lesson:
designers of man-in-the-loop systems have to understand operator psychology,
and owners of such systems have to provide appropriate training that accounts
for such risks and then maintain a culture that places importance on avoiding
them.

In this morning's (4/15) Minneapolis Star-Tribune was a small blurb on a new
problem discovered on the recent Discovery shuttle mission.  Apparently, the
crew that goes out to pickup the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) after they come
back down to the ocean via parachute, noted a pair of pliers still "attached"
to one of the SRBs.  They did not say if they were "jammed" in to some spot or
if they were in fact holding on to something.  If the latter, one would have
to assume that they are probably "Vise-Grips" or a generic version of them.  I
can see the commercial advertisements now....  "The pliers that grip so tight,
they will keep holding on even through the G-Forces of a space shuttle
launch".

Apparently NASA is scrambling to figure out what went wrong.  One would
think so given the sensitivity to another possible failure of the SRBs.

I work for a large company with badge entry systems for all buildings
and all internal labs.  This is normally great, because I can get into
my building any time I want, day or night, and I can get into the labs
that I need to use, but it keeps me out of places I don't belong.  It
also does the same for others.

About once a year, however, I forget my badge.  This is not a problem
for the normal person who comes in after 8:00 in the morning when the
building is open and there is a receptionist, but I carpool from quite
a distance away, before traffic gets heavy, and I get in about 6:45.

This morning was one of those rare occasions when I forgot my badge.
No problem, each building has a phone at the front door that rings
through directly to security.  I picked it up and told them that I
needed to get into the building.  They asked me a few questions, like
what is my name, my badge number, my phone extension and two or three
other such pieces of information, then they opened the door remotely
and I was let into the building.

As I was walking to my office, I realized that all of the information I
was required to give them is contained on-line in our computer network
and anyone with access to a workstation could get this information
about anyone in the company in just a few seconds.  I'm not recommending
that the database be changed, because it is a great aid to employee
intercommunication.  However, I expect that I could easily get into
some building where I don't belong by gathering this information about
someone who works in that building.  I don't even need to know a name
to get this information, the database allows searches by building.

Not too long ago, when I needed to be let in a building, someone from
security would come by, check a photo ID, such as a drivers license,
then let me in with a key.  Even though my company has become much more
security conscious during the 5 years I've worked here, I believe it is
a security risk to allow building entry based solely on information
given over the phone that is contained in a computer database readily
accessible to anyone who can access the network.  I'm going to
recommend a change to this procedure.

Summary: Hanging up on the Clipper Chip?

Dorothy Denning's summary on the clipper chip was very helpful, but it
leaves a good deal up in the air.  Fortunately, if you are willing to
work on the assumption that the NSA is good at what they do, you can
fill in a fair number of details by reading between the lines.

To begin with, based on what she has written, it is trivial to prevent law
enforcement from decrypting your messages.  I'll explain what I mean by that,
and then I'll make a guess at what prevents you from doing so.

Once a session key K is agreed upon by the users, the chip computes
two values which are transmitted over the telephone line:

(1) Message stream:   E[M ; K]              (Where M is the message)
(2) Escrow field:     E[{E[K ; U],N}; F]    (Where F is the Family Key,
                                                   N is the Serial Number,
                                               and U is the Unit Key)

Law enforcement uses F to obtain N, which points to U in a two-part database.
Knowing U allows Law enforcement to obtain K, and then to decrypt M.

Users simply compute M = D[E[M; K]; K] to decrypt the message.

The summary isn't very specific, but it sounds like the message stream is
transmitted first, followed by the escrow field.  Surely this can't be the
case, because all one needs to do is hang up at the appropriate point in the
call and prevent the transmission of the escrow field.  The other user doesn't
need the escrow field to do the decryption, but law enforcement has no other
way of obtaining K, even if they already know N,U, and F.

Now, I have enough faith in the NSA's skills to trust that you can't pass the
message to the user without also passing the escrow field, but I'd like to see
that in writing.  My guess is that the protocol requires the escrow field to
be transmitted first, and then the chaining mechanisms in the algorithm
prevent the receiver from decoding the message without first having fed the
escrow field into their chip.  On the other hand, if the protocol is up to the
end user, then I'll just send the escrow last, and ..oops.. ran out of
quarters, have to hang up now.  As is so often the case in cryptography, the
protocol is as important as the algorithm, and so far we know even less about
the protocol than we do about the algorithm.

Following on this line of thinking (ie that NSA is good at what they do),
we can deduce a few more things about how wiretaps are handled.

First, who knows F? If the cop on the street knows F then it quickly 
becomes so widely known that everyone knows it and you might as well send
the serial number in the clear.  Ergo only the escrow agents know F.

Second, what information does law enforcement get from the escrow agents?
Ideally, law enforcement only gets K, the session key governing the
conversation for which they have a court order.  Unfortunately, in order for
law enforcement to get *only* K (and not U), the escrow agents must get
together and secretly combine U1 and U2 so that they can unwrap K and give it
to law enforcement.  But then the escrow agents would also know K, and they
would be able to decrypt messages themselves.  That's just a very short step
away from the omniscient big-brother which the multiple-escrower scheme was
designed to prevent.  The escrow agents must not allowed to exchange keys with
each other.  Ergo, law enforcement must assemble U itself in order to find out
K.  This means that law enforcement now knows the key to unlock every session
key ever used on this phone.

Things are starting to look bad, but what about F?  We never really figured
out what F was for, we just said that only the escrow agents know F.  Well,
now we know what F is for.  Even if law enforcement knows U, they still can't
read messages without court orders, because they can't obtain E[K;U] without
knowing F, and only escrow knows F.

Something (probably the chaining) keeps users honest.  F keeps law enforcement
honest.  What keeps the escrow agents honest?  That's still a good question,
and hopefully the answer is something other than "Their strong moral
character."  I suspect, however, that their strong moral character is all
we'll have to work with.

&gt;Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
&gt;encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
&gt;telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
&gt;values:

&gt;   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
&gt;   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

Note that if the chip or the user were to choose random numbers K1..Kn
and compute

     K = K1 xor K2 xor ... xor Kn

the chip could transmit

   E[E[K1; U1] + N; F], a law enforcement field for escrow agency 1 , 
   E[E[K2; U2] + N; F], a law enforcement field for escrow agency 2 , 
   . . .
   E[E[Kn; Un] + N; F], a law enforcement field for escrow agency n ,

(where U1 .. Un are the individual escrow keys)

then the wiretapper would have to show the court order for each message key,
not just once.  As designed, however, once the LE agent has acquired U, she
has access to all messages, past and future, using that chip.  She can even
sell U to any outfit willing to pay for it, if she is so inclined.  The NSA
can't be less bright in cryptographic protocol design than I am.  I must
assume that this security bug was intended as a feature.

There could also be more than 2 escrow agencies -- so that, for example, the
New York Times, the Washington Post, the Democratic National Committee and the
Republican National Committee could all be escrow agencies -- could all see
the choice of wiretap targets (both through warrant and through so-called
"national security" grounds) -- could notice any patterns (like Nixon's enemy
list) and could blow the whistle if the government were abusing its wiretap
ability.  In this case, global use of encryption and key escrow would give us
a marginal amount of increased citizen rights (while taking away a large
right).

Of course, this is a moot point, intended for those of us who like to think
about cryptographic protocols.  The real point is that cryptography has always
been created and used by private individuals, whether or not governments also
use it.  It is not used primarily by lawbreakers -- and those criminals who do
use it will continue to and will ignore key registration.  It has legitimate
users, predominantly, and they have legitimate reasons to keep a key as secret
as they know how, even if the government doesn't like it.  Since the
government has no right to read all our files and communications (eg., e-mail
love letters I might write), this shouldn't matter to it.

Key registration is a totally new idea in cryptography, is a major erosion of
our rights and must not be tolerated, even on a voluntary basis.  The RISK
here is that after enough years of partial voluntary registration, the FBI
would go to Congress with an example (perhaps even made up) of some drug
selling, snuff movie making operator of a BBS who lets minors view pornography
-- who uses cryptography without key registration -- and will call for key
registration to be made law, citing examples of voluntary cooperation in order
to claim that "law abiding citizens don't believe that secrecy of keys is a
fundamental right".


With the coming rise both of distributed systems and of wireless computer
components, cryptography is about to move from a cute toy which some of us
play with to an absolute necessity.  If we give away the right to privacy
in crypto keys, now while there are only a few of us affected, we will soon
discover that everyone is affected and Orwell's society is that much closer.

I don't claim to be up on crypto, but it seems to me that once the
"authorized tap" has been performed once, the agency in question now
has a copy of the desired keys. They can use these keys at ANY time in the 
future to decrypt communications between these two parties (without having 
to go through the discomfort of obtaining a new court order). So a new,
parallel database of key pairs will gradually evolve.

Dorothy Denning writes a good coherent summary of the clipper chip.  Thanks.

Dorothy writes:
&gt; The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
&gt; an authorized wiretap has been installed.

I have one outstanding question that I haven't seen asked yet.  Is there a
time component in the encryption key?  Since wiretaps are presumably
authorized for certain time periods with both start and end dates, it should
not be possible to decrypt an illegally monitored message.

This also suggests a way to subvert the law enforcement decryption: Would it
not be possible fake the encryption device's sense of time?  If this were the
case, and time is in fact a part of the encryption key, then the message would
still be impossible for the law to decrypt.  On the other hand, if time is not
part of the key, perhaps a defendant could argue that the tapped and decrypted
message was tapped before the wiretap was authorized.  How could the police
prove otherwise?  This problem exists without encryption so I suppose it has
been addressed.  But my understanding of U.S.  law is that even if evidence is
incriminating, if it is illegally obtained, it will be considered
inadmissible.  (I don't think that this is the case in Canada for example.)

A second, unrelated question is this: How difficult is it monitor a
high-capacity trunk, (say a fibre cable), for encrypted messages.  I can just
see, using my special Sneakers-influenced "Eyes of Paranoia", some nameless
agency looking for work monitoring 10,000 lines just to see who was encrypting
stuff.  Heck, if it is encrypted, it must be interesting right?

Some of the debate here on the Clipper Chip has focused on the secrecy
surrounding the encryption algorithm.  I'd like to point out that not only
must the algorithm be secure, but so must its implementation.  I suspect that
most contributors to RISKS are less than familiar with the various ways that
VLSI chips are validated---that probably goes for many (non-NSA) cryptography
experts as well.  It seems entirely possible to me that an intentional or
unintentional back door could be left in the silicon.  For example, if the
chip is scan-testable, then it might be possible to scan the keys out through
the test path---potentially yielding U, "an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all
messages encrypted with the chip"!  (Or maybe the chip's not testable---why
doesn't that make me feel any better?)  The point is not the particular
details of a possible attack; rather it is the distinction between an
algorithm and a circuit.  I conduct research on the formal verification of
digital circuits, and I am sure that algorithms and circuits are separated by
a large gap---who knows what lurks therein?

(And personally, was the name chosen to try to catch our moderator off guard?)

I don't know if I would feel comfortable entrusting sensitive data to

If the algorithm was made public, any weaknesses would be discovered
in time. If it is classified, weaknesses may never be known, or known

Also, if you are the paranoid kind: How do you know that the algorithm

I just wonder one thing: why would _anyone_ prefer to use Clipper Chip
encryption over other alternatives, when all it buys you, compared to the
alternatives, is that it allows the authorities to tap your conversations
(whether they need appropriate court order to do so or not) ??

I fear the only solution to that may be the outlawing of all other
encryption alternatives that do not include the same "feature".

So, at this point the law enforcement agency (LEA) has U1 and U2?
Presumably, then, at any point subsequent to this and without benefit of
contact with the key escrow agents, the LEA can tap and decode the phone
line, providing the tappee doesn't get a new clipper chip.

I would think one of the first things the LEA would do would be to build
up a database of known U1 and U2 values; also, the U1 and U2 values
received from the key escrow agents are likely to be stored [recorded]
somewhere other than the original secure FAX paper -- given the
pervasiveness of our friend the computer, it is as likely to be on a
computer as not, and then a short hop to a computer attached to a
network, mix and match a few crackers and presto! a pirate BBS with U1
and U2 values for anyone from Joe Blow to your neighbor down the block.

Or is this an overreaction?

Perhaps a mandatory "You've been tapped, change your keys" scheme could
be implemented along with this; after the authorization for the tap is
canceled, the tappee would automatically receive new keys? chips? to
ensure secure communication once again.

I'll preface this by saying that encryption has never been a big problem in
my particular line of software, so I'm slightly hazy on this.  However,
scanning through the discussions on the Clipper Chip, I came across a general
description of how a session works.  It appears (and someone please correct me
if I'm off the wall here) that two encryption devices, when they initiate a
session, must exchange keys in order to decrypt each others messages.  Great,
but here's my question...what's to stop someone at machine B (who's talking
to machine A) from "recording" the key from machine A when the session is 
started?  Since it appears that the key is constant for each chip, machine B
can now _always_ decrypt machine A's messages.

If this is the case, does encryption over a cellular link become worthless?
Already, the phone ID is transmitted, with an enormous black market in the
stolen ID's.  Why not capture that encryption key as it goes out?

Or is there something I'm missing?

  Like everyone else, I feel I must add my 2 cents on the data encryption
chip.  first, how will this be implemented.  Will everyone get a knock on the
door next tuesday from the telephone company installing our chip?  If not,
then the slow increase in user base will make the technology as useful as
video-phones.  Sure some will get in on the ground floor, but who will they
talk too?  Reminds me of the scene in Repo Man.  The security does no good if
you can't use it.  Second, math.  How many phones in the U.S.A.?  Hundreds of
millions?  Billions?  If 300 chips are made in a run, and a run is say, eight
hours, that is hmmm 500,000,000 phones/300 chips = (about) 1,300,000.  Now for
an average work week, (1,300,000chipruns*2persons)/(40hrs*52weeks) = 1250
person/years of work.  So, we cannot expect this to occur overnight.  So, who
gets to have first dibbs on the technology?  The rich, the powerful, the
government?  If so, not very democratic to me.  
  Next, where in the line will the chip be?  I assume the handset which again
kicks up the number of chips needed.  Also the complexity.  I assume that more
bandwidth will be needed to get the data to the handset.  Fiber-optics?  Yeah,
in another ten years.  Data compression?  That can only get you so far.  If you
place the chip elsewhere, the risk exists that someone can tap illegally in
the home.  No messy decryption needed there. 
  To me, knowing that the encryption sceme can be broken at will (by the "right
people") does not make me feel secure in using it.  The general public would
most likely use the logic--if this person can decypher this message, why can't
anyone else?  Then wrongly or rightly conclude anyone else can.  
  Next, NSA.  Why should I trust them to make the thing secure?  They want
to listen in, that is part of their job.
  Finally, as a chip, it can break.  Burn out.  Well where are you then.  And
where is the government?  Do they need a warrant for every phone you could use,
and have to get new warrants for any new phone you get.  Imagine a criminal
that continually buys phones so that the warrants can't get through in time to
listen in on the conversations.  Do they record all the unintelligible
conversations prior to getting the key?  How much data would this be?  What if
another encryption is found embedded in the first?  How do you prove it is not
a compressed abstract picture for the computer?  I could see a big new news
group forming for abstract art that could be used as a wonderful cover for
secret messages.  Try decyphering that Jackson Pollack.
  The questions just keep coming, and I personally don't like the answers.

By virtue of its secrecy, the Clipper fails these tests.

(At the risk of redundancy (with other contributors)):

1. Although gov't press releases and gov't surrogates like Dorothy Denning
keep talking about warrants (actually, they say "proper authorization") for
Clipper keys, the government has never abandoned (and does not even deny) the
practice of conducting warrantless wiretaps for "national security" reasons.
How will keys be obtained to decrypt such intercepts?  My guess--the security
of the "escrow" agencies will be secretly compromised.  And then, the time
will come when the NSA turns over political or criminal information with
little or no "national security/foreign/military intelligence" content to the
FBI, etc.  My fallback guess is that the Skipjack algorithm will have a back
door.

2. The key escrow scheme is a pottery container of fecal matter.  Right now in
California we are enjoying two scandals involving the release, to unauthorized
persons, of "secret" data, by employees of government and private
organizations, in violation of: their employers' policies, their own terms of
employment, state criminal law, and common (civil) law.  These (Anaheim PD
employee release of DMV address info to anti-abortion terrorists; various
people including police employees giving info to an ADL investigator) are
representative, not exhaustive of the problem.  Does anybody remember the
Walker (U.S. Navy) spy scandal of a few years ago?  Walker ring members,
despite vetting by the military (perhaps inefficient, but more thorough than
likely in civilian agencies), exposure to the most severe legal sanctions, and
even the cultural pressures of their military communities, sold out Navy
cipher secrets and keys to actual enemies for fairly small amounts of money.
N.B.: the Walker ring had no ideological motivations.  Anyone who says that
the key escrow scheme will protect the privacy of Clipper users is naive,
stupid, or wicked.  Of course, as someone will point out: "the Walker ring got
caught!"--but catching malefactors will not prevent the harm they do before
they are detected.

3. The assertion that the government should, by rights, be able to decrypt
private communications for "law enforcement" purposes should be challenged.
Privacy advocates should not concede this important debate-framing assumption.
Advances in digital computing have made it possible for ordinary people to use
powerful machine cipher techniques.  But such systems will not prevent police
agents from eavesdropping directly or by various bugging methods.  It may be
(I suspect it is so) that depriving the police of convenient wiretapping might
have little effect over, say, ten years, on their (police) ability to detect
and interfere with criminals.

F is embedded in every Clipper Chip, but like other chip keys, unknown to the

the law enforcement field to be decrypted. Initially, there will be just one
box, and it will be operated by the FBI.

	court order.  Unfortunately, in order for law enforcement to
	get *only* K (and not U), the escrow agents must get together
	and secretly combine U1 and U2 so that they can unwrap K and
	give it to law enforcement.  But then the escrow agents would
	also know K, and they would be able to decrypt messages
	themselves.  That's just a very short step away from the
	omniscient big-brother which the multiple-escrower scheme was

	exchange keys with each other.  Ergo, law enforcement must
	assemble U itself in order to find out K.  This means that law
	enforcement now knows the key to unlock every session key ever
	used on this phone.

It is imperative that law enforcement get U.  If they are tapping a line,
there may be dozens of calls on that line per day.  It would be totally
impractical to have to go to the escrow agents to get the session key for each
call.  It would be impossible to do real-time decryption under that
constraint.

	Things are starting to look bad, but what about F?  We never
	really figured out what F was for, we just said that only the
	escrow agents know F.  Well, now we know what F is for.  Even
	if law enforcement knows U, they still can't read messages
	without court orders, because they can't obtain E[K;U] without
	knowing F, and only escrow knows F.

For the same reason as above, it is imperative that law enforcement be able to
decode the law enforcement field in order to obtain E[K; U] and then decrypt
this to get K.  It is completely impractical to go the escrow agents for each
conversation.

  I have one outstanding question that I haven't seen asked yet.  Is there a
  time component in the encryption key? Since wiretaps are presumably
  authorized for certain time periods with both start and end dates, it should
  not be possible to decrypt an illegally monitored message.
 
I am unaware of any time component.  Current wiretap laws protect against
this.  Evidence collected after the warrant has expired can be thrown out in
court.  In addition, it is illegal for the service provider to implement an
intercept after a warrant has expired.  With the new technologies, law
enforcers will be incapable of executing a tap without the assistance of the
service provider.

It is possible for both ends to negotiate a session key K without transmitting
any secret information at all, including K.  One way of doing this is with a
public-key distribution method. The Diffie-Hellman method works as follows.
Machine A picks a secret value xa, and machine B picks xb.  A sends the public
value ya = g^xa mod p to B and B sends yb = g^xb mod p to A, where p is a huge
prime and g is a global constant.  Then A computes the session key K = yb^xa
mod p = g^xbxa mod p, and B computes K = ya^xb mod p = g^xaxb mod p.  Both K's
are the same.  An eavesdropper sees ya and yb, but since xa and xb are not
known, cannot compute K.  For more information about key exchange, see for
example my book "Cryptography and Data Security" or some other crypto text.

Mr. President:

I am concerned that your proposal fails to address the following issues,
among others:

1.  Will American companies have to manufacture different lines of
products according to the market (US vs. foreign--assuming that they
wouldn't be allowed to export the Clipper Chip) ?

2.  Will foreign companies be excluded from the American market since
they won't have access to the Clipper Chip ?

3.  If the technology is ever sold to other countries (foreign
governments), how will the US be sure that no foreign government
develops the ability to tap American communications, and how will
international communications be secure (remember that the two escrow
"agencies" are to be located in the US, a seemingly unacceptable
proposition for non-American entities) ?

4.  What guarantee is there that other encryption schemes will not be
outlawed in the future?  In particular, what guarantee is there that
the right retained by the people to privacy will not be ever more
violated by the US government in the future?  Will use of other,
private, secret encryption become a crime?

5.  What guarantee is there that criminals will use the Clipper Chip,
knowing that the US government has the ability to decrypt their
communications?  Isn't it probable that such criminals will resort to
publically available encryption systems that they would know are secure
from the US government?

6.  Since the secrecy of the algorithm seems to be essential, how does
your proposal compare to the strength of currently available non-secret
algorithms?  It is well known in Computer Science that reliance on the
ignorance of an enemy party is the worst protection imaginable, since
it is a very weak link in the chain of safety.

7.  An American hero once said something to the effect that those who
are willing to trade liberty for safety deserve neither.  Don't you
think you are asking the American people to trade liberty (their right
to privacy) in exchange for an elusive safety (listening to suspected
criminals, if these criminals buy the government's chip)?

8.  How is it justifiable to ask the American people that they spend
money (for the Clipper Chip) in order to let the government listen on
them?  Given the current state of the economy, is it even possible?

9.  Finally, what constitutional article gives you the power to violate
the privacy of the American people?  Didn't you swear to uphold the US
constitution?

Sincerely,

   The summary isn't very specific, but it sounds like the message stream is
   transmitted first, followed by the escrow field.  Surely this can't be the
   case, because all one needs to do is hang up at the appropriate point in the
   call and prevent the transmission of the escrow field...

One way of solving this "problem" is to have the escrow block consist of:

  E[{E[K ; U],N,SHA[{E[K ; U],N}]} ; F]

Where SHA[] represents the Secure Hash Algorithm (in the Capstone
Chip), though frankly a CRC32 would probably do just as well. The
receiving Clipper can then decrypt each received law enforcement block
and verify that the SHA hash of the contents match the supplied hash.
If they fail, the chip ceases to perform any decryption operations on
behalf of the user.  Perhaps other information could be included in
the encryption under "F" to make it difficult to supply a law
enforcement block from another prior conversation. This could well be
a detail that was left out of the explanation given to Dorothy.

Btw. I will go on record as being opposed to this entire proposal. My
interpretation of the Constitution (and the Bill of Rights) on this issue is
that the 4th amendment (no search and seizure without a warrant) was intended
to place limitations on the right of the government to interfere with the
people. It is being twisted around by some to imply that we the people never
had the right to privacy in the first place, when a warrant was issued. As
others have mentioned here, I have a real concern that a VOLUNTARY program
today will turn into a mandatory program tomorrow. In my nightmares I envision
an agent of (pick your favorite large, secretive, government agency) telling
Congress:

"Yes Senator, but we gave the American Public privacy five year's ago with the
Clipper program. They still have that privacy today. However some miscreants
in our society... drug dealers and whatnot are still using non-Clipper
unbreakable encryption and we must put a stop to this..."

A few things have occurred to me as I've read the announcements and the
initial reactions. 

Each chip contains and broadcasts the serial number.  To be frank, if they
don't use a lot of different family keys, then that number is going to be
rather public, rather quickly. 

Legally, what is this going to do to wiretaps?  If I have recorded a
conversation, have I tapped it?  Or have I only tapped it when I decrypt it?
This could lead to recording lots of conversations, and then only getting the
keys and actually "tapping" once I get someone for something criminal.  A
change to the law or court ruling could establish this. For now, they need
permission up front (with exceptions, noted below), but I could see that
changing.

Doesn't the manufacturer need to give the keys to the escrow agencies? With the
serial number?  Am I missing something, or is there a RISK of the manufacturer
becoming compromised?  

The other thing is that companies are going to be using this for international
calls.  And, calls in other countries.  I'm sure most of you have noticed that
agencies of the US Government tend not to follow the procedural niceties that
they at least have to give lip service to here when dealing with communications
elsewhere.  If the CIA or NSA decides they want a tap, can they get the keys
for a unit in another country without a court order, by saying "it's for
national security" three times and throwing a rock in the air?  Besides, the
NSA gets really itchy if they can't just monitor international calls whenever
they want.  So, what are they going to do -- record the call data and decrypt
it later if they need to?  They don't need specific authorization now to tap
and record international calls.  I can't see that changing.

What I read in one of the gov't documents implied that the A.G. was responsible
for defining some sort of reasonable authorization.  Why do I have a feeling
that "national security" is going to come up a lot?  Especially since there has
been an increase in cold-war style rhetoric in reference to *economic*
competition?  Regarding profitable technologies as national security concerns
for the sake of economic competition is a scary thing. And this chip plays
right into that desire for control.  As other people have pointed out, once
they've got your key, they've got your key.  If someone gets it for national
security reasons, then you might just be out of luck.

Thoughts on the Clipper Chip:

1) One of the selling points of the Clipper chip is that US companies will be
able to use it to effect secure communication between their home offices and
branches in foreign countries.  In particular, it is implied that it is the
governments of those foreign countries that will be thwarted in their attempts
to listen in to the corporate secrets of America.

Now why would any "friendly" foreign government (e.g. Canada, France,
New Zealand) imaginably permit Clipper to be used on its territory
unless it too has access to the keys for "law enforcement purposes" ?

So if XYZ Corp. wants to talk in private with its French subsidiary XYZ
France, SA., the French government will want access to the escrow agents so
that it too can present a court order (according to French law, of course) and
be given XYZ's key, if it suspects wrongdoing on the part of XYZ France.  But
this clearly won't do.  The US escrow agents will presumably be subject to US
law and might be able to refuse a French court order on some US constitutional
grounds.  So the French will have to have their own pair of agents, and -
since there is no advance control of which chips will end up in France - these
French agents will have to have the complete list of all keys.  Now multiply
this by a dozen or so friendly countries, with an equal number of different
legal systems and constitutions...

2) Presumably the reason for keeping the algorithms secret is to prevent
competitive manufacture of chips (or software) that can communicate with
Clippers from being produced.  (Such competitors might somehow forget to send
their key lists to the escrow agents.)

I know almost nothing of the technology, but it seems far fetched to me that a
chip can be manufactured that *absolutely, positively* cannot be reverse
engineered, or at least satisfies something analogous to being computationally
infeasible to reverse engineer.

There was no mention of quantum effects, but I know of no other way to even
begin to make something that can't be examined with appropriate probes.  I
hope some hardware experts will say something on this topic.  Or is it that
the hardware design can be reverse engineered, but the algorithms themselves
are one-way encrypted ?

3) It is not clear to me how tapping of bidirectional communications
works.  If the police have a court order to tap the phone of suspected
criminal X, and they find that he is holding a Clipper-encrypted
conversation with previously unknown person Y, will they be able to
decrypt only what X says if they have only X's key from escrow ?
Or will they automatically apply for Y's key too, on the grounds
that he is an associate of X ?

Ordinary analogue phones (and networks) echo a small amount of the received
signal to the sender, but an encrypting phone will have digitized and
encrypted the signal before it gets echoed (even if there is a modem and
analogue circuit in the loop).

With all of the sound and fury surrounding the announcement, I think a few
things have been missed. First, no-one has said that Clipper is going to
replace the STU-III or the Lockheed Encrypting Modem (just passed up an
opportunity to buy a couple for $25 - only 1200 baud) or all of the other
devices that exist. Elements of the Norton Utilities and PKZIP would also have
to be outlawed.  The "user selected table" in UUENCODE would be right out.

Second, prohibition of double encryption using Clipper as one stage would be 
impossible to enforce through sheer mass. Comes under the same category
as strict enforcement of the speed limit.

So what is Clipper ? IMHO it will be a low-cost way to provide *reasonable*
protection for routine traffic that up until now has been unprotected.
Cellular telephony is the obvious first use to reduce the billion-dollar
fraud situation. Transmittal of medical records, legal records, credit
reports is another. Privacy laws state that these must be protected.
Clipper provides a legal remedy that has been lacking.

Telecommuting is another major problem for most companies who have been back
through fear of unautorized interception. Clipper will provide a "warm and
fuzzy" feeling with low-cost encrypting modems.

IMHO, Clipper must meet the "good enough" test. Clipper *will* meet the "good
enough" test because the designers are not stupid and it would be a major
*political* embarrassment should it prove to be easily broken, we just do not
know all of the facts yet.

Technically, I can make a guess and say that little of what we have seen
as yet is correct. For instance if the Message Key (K) is only 30 bits
long and the message is encrypted  E(M;K) as mentioned several times,
a massive attack with existing technology that is not particularly
expen$ive would yield a solution in under a minute. (Hint: check out
DSPs). Therefore the message is not encrypted E(M;K).

Further, there is a Family Key (F) and a Unit Key (U) in each chip. The
only link to these is the serial number therefore I *suspect* that the
serial number will be sent en clair as part of the header. It would be
possible to use only selected Family Keys and create E(s/n;F) such that 
it would easily yield the s/n but why (more later).

So most likely we will have a message key that will be a predetermined
function of K,U,&amp;F (FN1). The header might consist of the serial number,
followed by an encrypted function of K,U,&amp; F (FN2) that is different from
(MK), then the message encrypted with MK.

Before engaging Clipper, both FN1 and FN2 would have to be exchanged.

On starting communication, the header would consist of the serial number,
followed by FN2, followed by E(M;FN1). To the receiving Clipper, the
serial number would act as a "wake up". Since the chip would have K,U, &amp; F
it would then reverse FN2 and create FN1 and decode the message. A longer
header could accommodate conference calling. This removes any incentive
to spoof the s/n since the receiving chip will assume it is for someone
else. (Exercise is left to the student). 

A "promiscuous" chip might be designed but it would have to have all 
U and F keys (of course the total number issued is probably going to be 
less than the number of ZIP codes so this *is* a danger point...).

The "key master" would hold one element say the s/n,U function, the 
"gatekeeper" s/n,F. On proper application each would contribute its part
but the requesting authority would receive only FN1, not the means to 
recreate it. Alternately, the requesting authority might receive a
duplicate Clipper chip but not the Keys - this protects the keys from
disclosure *and* provides physical traceability of the duplicate Clipper.
On completion of the tap authorization, the duplicate must be destroyed.

Certainly, there are still some things to be worked out but these are 
technical details. IMHO we *need* a cheap means of "good enough" encryption,
something that can be built into modems and cell phones at a disposable
cost. We *need* a workable Clipper, and the government has more to lose
in providing a flawed product than we do.

One thing (among several) that disturbs me about the Clipper Chip is the
release of the decryption key to law enforcement bodies, who have various
legal maneuverings to circumvent ever notifying the tappee, after the wiretap
has completed, that their key has been compromised.

The key, originally safeguarded by the key escrow bank, is now additionally
held by unknown and unaudited persons within law enforcement.

History has shown that the law enforcement community has not been above
using information gained during illegal wiretaps...  Once they have the
key, they have access forever to your conversations.

And, supposing that one is actually notified that they were being
wiretapped, and thus need a new key.  Will the agency responsible for
the tap pay any costs for obtaining new keys?

Further, the information packet provided by Mat Heyman's office fails to
address the question of using non-clipper chip encryption.  They call their
technology "more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily
available" -- admitting that more secure systems are available.  Why should
anyone believe they do not intend to make illegal competing methods of
encryption?

In some of the recent comments on the RISKS of Clipper, it would seem that the
commentators are ignoring the results of including omnivorous recording.  It
is well known that it is possible to record a substantial amount of traffic
for archival storage and later analysis.  Such recording is not prevented by
any encryption scheme, whether keys are escrowed or not.

The resulting RISK of this assumption is that we may erode away the notion
that pure recording is a violation of privacy (today's wiretap law prevents
recording conversations without a warrant).  What could be wrong with law
enforcers or others recording everything, now that it is masked by encryption?
Surely this is NOT a violation of privacy because you can't read it.  I'd bet
that such recordings and archival would be authorized by most governmental
lawyers as NOT violating privacy on this basis.  But in fact, with key escrow,
someone on a fishing expedition could in principle recover all past history
from an archival database.

I think that the design of Clipper protocols is actually more suitable for
ex-post-facto decryption of recorded conversations, rather than for getting
access to not-yet-happening transactions.  So the notion that we might be
moving to a world where recording is real would make sense.

I also notice that the protocol for selecting conversation keys requires an
online conversation -- thus one cannot use Clipper for leaving secure voice
mail in a voice mail box, as far as I can tell.  Similarly, conference
calling, etc. need to be considered in the design of secure phones.  If
conference calling services (such as AT&amp;T's service) require that the security
devices be turned off or compromised, there is a risk that users will be
deceived about their level of security.

My point, then, is that issues related to recording seem to have been
poorly considered in this proposal.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd like to
understand this better, in the context of societal impacts that may result.

An amazing amount of discussion and speculation has been generated by the
clipper chip announcement.  Special thanks to Dorothy Denning for her summary,
and kudos to Don Alvarez for asking good questions.  But I have yet to see
anyone ask (or answer) the obvious question:

Will the various government agencies be using the clipper chip?

If so, I heartily endorse the policy.  It guarantees that government messages
cannot be ultimately secret from the governed.  It seems to me that the private
sector will continue to use whatever encryption is appropriate for their needs,
(even should laws to the contrary be passed,) and that the only agencies
obliged live with the consequences are those of the government itself.

        As you may recall, last November at a shopping mall outside of
Washington, DC, a group of people affiliated with the computer magazine "2600"
was confronted by mall security personnel, local police officers and several
unidentified individuals.  The group members were ordered to identify
themselves and to submit to searches of their personal property.  Their names
were recorded by mall security personnel and some of their property was
confiscated.  However, no charges were ever brought against any of the
individuals at the meeting.
 
        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ("CPSR") filed suit
under the Freedom of Information Act and today received the Secret Service's
response to the FOIA lawsuit, in which we are seeking agency records
concerning the break-up of the meeting.  I think it's safe to say that our
suspicions have now been confirmed -- the Secret Service *did* obtain a list
of names from mall security identifying the people in attendance at the
meeting.
 
        There are three main points contained in the Secret Service's
court papers that are significant:
 
        1) The agency states that the information it possesses concerning the
incident was obtained "in the course of a criminal investigation that is being
conducted pursuant to the Secret Service's authority to investigate access
device and computer fraud."
 
        2) The agency possesses two relevant documents and the information in
those documents "consists solely of information identifying individuals."
 
        3) The information was obtained from a "confidential source," and the
agency emphasizes that the FOIA's definition of such a source includes "any
private institution which provided information on a confidential basis."
 
        Taken together, these facts seem to prove that the Secret Service
wanted names, they had the mall security people collect them, and they came
away from the incident with the list they wanted.
 
        The agency asserts that "[t]he premature release of the identities of
the individual(s) at issue could easily result in interference to the Secret
Service's investigation by alerting these individual(s) that they are under
investigation and thus allowing the individual(s) to alter their behavior
and/or evidence."
 
        CPSR, in conjunction with EFF and the ACLU, is planning to challenge
the actions of the mall security personnel, the local police and the Secret
Service on the ground that the incident amounted to a warrantless search and
seizure conducted at the behest of the Secret Service.

	       Hacker Accused of Rigging Radio Contests
		 [By Don Clark Chronicle staff writer]
                 [San Francisco Chronicle 22 Apr 1993]

	A notorious hacker was charged yesterday with using computers to
	rig promotional contest at three Los Angeles radio stations, in
	a scheme that allegedly netted two Porsches, $20,000 in cash and
	at least two trips to Hawaii.

    Kevin Lee Poulsen, now awaiting trial on earlier federal charges, is
accused of conspiring with two other hackers to seize control of incoming
phone lines at the radio stations.  By making sure that only their calls got
through, the conspirators were assured of winning the contests, federal
prosecutors said.  A new 19-count federal indictment filed in Los Angeles
charges that Poulsen also set up his own wire taps and hacked into computers
owned by California Department of Motor Vehicles and Pacific Bell.  Through
the latter, he obtained information about the undercover businesses and
wiretaps run by the FBI, the indictment states.
    Poulsen, 27, is accused of committing the crimes during 17 months on the
lam from earlier charges of telecommunications and computers fraud filed in
San Jose.  He was arrested in April 1991 and is now in the federal
Correctional Institution in Dublin.  In December, prosecutors added an
espionage charge against him for his alleged theft of a classified military
document.  The indictment announced yesterday adds additional charges of
computer and mail fraud, money laundering, interception of wire communications
and obstruction of justice.
    Ronald Mark Austin and Justin Tanner Peterson have pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and violating computer crime laws and have agreed to help against
Poulsen.  Both are Los Angeles residents.  Poulsen and Austin have made
headlines together before.  As teenagers in Los Angeles, the two computer
prodigies allegedly broke into a Pentagon-organized computer network that
links researchers and defense contractors around the country.
    Between 1985 and 1988, after taking a job at Menlo Park-based SRI
International, Poulsen allegedly burglarized or used phony identification to
sneak into several Pacific Bell offices to steal equipment and confidential
access codes that helped him change records and monitor calls.  After being
indicted on these charges in 1989, Poulsen skipped bail and fled to Los
Angeles where he was eventually arrested at a suburban grocery store.
    One of the unanswered mysteries about the case is how he supported himself
as a fugitive.  The new indictment suggests that radio stations KIIS-FM,
KRTH-FM and KPWR-FM unwittingly helped out.
    Poulsen and his conspirators are accused of hacking into Pacific Bell
computers to block out other callers seeking to respond to contests at the
stations.  The conspirators allegedly used the scheme to let Poulsen and
Austin win Porsches from KIIS and let a confederate win $20,000 from KPWR.
Poulsen created aliases and phony identification to retrieve and sell one of
his Porsches and launder the proceeds of the sale, the indictment states.  In
February 1989, they arranged for Poulsen's sister to win a trip to Hawaii and
$1,000 from KRTH, the indictment states.

Our office recently acquired a new photocopier.  A sophisticated onboard
computer constantly monitors and controls all aspects of the photocopiers
operation, and maintenance.

The sorter trays on this machine are driven up and down by servo motors to
collate the output.  Under normal operation the tray would never be directed
by the computer to raise beyond a certain height; however, should there be a
problem, two sensors were placed at both limits of the tray's movement to
detect a possible over-run.  In keeping with the integrated nature of this
copier,  sensors were of course not wired directly into the servo-motors, but
instead were monitored by the main computer.

Today I watched the copier attempt to recover from an interrupted print job:
In error, it failed to note the starting position of the sorter tray, and
directed the servo-motors to move the tray upwards.  unfortunately there did
not appear to be a software check in the 'recover' routine to check the
over-run sensors.  The tray crashed upwards off its rails damaging several
components.

In today's St. Louis Post Dispatch there was an article about a local man who
had been convicted of growing marijuana for resale.  His defense was primarily
related to using it to treat his asthma, but what was far more interesting was
the way that he was originally arrested.  According to the story, he first
came to the attention of the authorities because he was using substantially
more electricity than his neighbors.   They then utilized an airborne infrared
detector to infer that he had a substantial number of growlamps in his attic.
Based on this they were able to obtain a search warrant and discovered his
crop of 150 plants.

It would be interesting to know if the utilities actually have routines that
identify "unusual" customers and routinely report this to the authorities or
if there was some other reason that this man came to the attention of the
authorities.

The latest "Feedback" (the newsletter of the confidential human factors
incident reporting programme, run by the RAF institute of aviation medicine
for the UK civil aviation community) contains two reports relevant to this
forum. I copy them without editing - I can't translate the abbreviations.
[Comments in square brackets are mine]

[First report]

	A Question: It is now accepted practice to "clear" the many spurious
	(?) messages which seem to occur for random reasons ("tyre pressure
	indicators" when the Reversers were locked out AD wise) by pulling
	and resetting the breaker, often after speaking to Tech. Control.
	These are "non events" and few are reported, but ought not each one
	to be MOR/ASR'd with full details so that the software engineers can
	at least attempt to trace the bugs?

[Feedback replies:]

	The question is really: "When does "just a bug" in the software
	constitute a broken bit of equipment?" With automatic recording and
	testing of faults this information should not be lost to the
	software engineers. There is currently no way of knowing
	what interrelated combinations of switching have been built up.
	These could be waiting for one further critical selection to provide
	a major problem.

[... and the power reset presumably clears these latent problems back to a
known state - but it all seems rather arbitrary for important systems. I
wonder if the incidents are really logged by the software. If so, someone
must know how common they are.

Second report:]

Foreign airline look-alike Boeing twin (glass cockpit) lined up on westerly
runway. 2+ aircraft positioning downwind, right hand, for duty runway.
Subject aircraft instructed "When airborne, disregard standard instrument
departure (which turns right) after noise, turn left, radar heading 190
degrees climbing to flight level 60". Expected readback was verbatim, in
fairly un-accented English.

When aircraft observed to turn right the pilot was reminded of previous
instruction and responded - "We want to turn left and you want us to turn
left but the aeroplane, she wants to turn right, so we are turning right. I
sorry (sic)".

At the time, the humour was lost on us. Is the Flight Management System
really the boss, or is there the rumoured cut-out/override switch?

[Feedback replied:]

Even if this pilot had taken the autopilot out the flight director was going
to take him the same way, which shows how much re-programming skill is
needed in the Glass Cockpit.

[... and the accident report would say "pilot error", but surely the system

Much has been said about Clipper and Capstone (the term Clipper will be used
to describe both) recently.  Essentially, Clipper is a government-sponsored
tamper-resistant chip that employs a classified algorithm and a key escrow
facility that allows law enforcement, with the cooperation of two other
parties, to decipher Clipper-encrypted traffic.  The stated purpose of the
program is to offer telecommunications privacy to individuals, businesses, and
government, while protecting the ability of law enforcement to conduct
court-authorized wiretapping.

The announcement said, among other things, that there is currently no plan to
attempt to legislate Clipper as the only legal means to protect
telecommunications.  Many have speculated that Clipper, since it is only
effective in achieving its stated objectives if everyone uses it, will be
followed by legislative attempts to make it the only legal telecommunications
protection allowed. This remains to be seen.

The proposal, taken at face value, still raises a number of serious questions.

What is the smallest number of people who are in a position to compromise the
security of the system? This would include people employed at a number of
places such as Mikotronyx, VSLI, NSA, FBI, and at the trustee facilities.  Is
there an available study on the cost and security risks of the escrow process?

How were the vendors participating in the program chosen? Was the process
open?

A significant percentage of US companies are or have been the subject of an
investigation by the FBI, IRS, SEC, EPA, FTC, and other government agencies.
Since records are routinely subpoenaed, shouldn't these companies now assume
that all their communications are likely compromised if they find themselves
the subject of an investigation by a government agency?  If not, why not?

What companies or individuals in industry were consulted (as stated in the
announcement) on this program prior to its announcement? (This question seeks
to identify those who may have been involved at the policy level; certainly
ATT, Mikotronyx and VLSI are part of industry, and surely they were involved
in some way.)

Is there a study available that estimates the cost to the US government of the
Clipper program?

There are a number of companies that employ non-escrowed cryptography in their
products today.  These products range from secure voice, data, and fax to
secure email, electronic forms, and software distribution, to name but a few.
With over a million such products in use today, what does the Clipper program
envision for the future of these products and the many corporations and
individuals that have invested in and use them?  Will the investment made by
the vendors in encryption-enhanced products be protected? If so, how?

Since Clipper, as currently defined, cannot be implemented in software, what
options are available to those who can benefit from cryptography in software?
Was a study of the impact on these vendors or of the potential cost to the
software industry conducted?  (Much of the use of cryptography by software
companies, particularly those in the entertainment industry, is for the
protection of their intellectual property. Using hardware is not economically
feasible for most of them.)
 
Banking and finance (as well as general commerce) are truly global today. Most
European financial institutions use technology described in standards such as
ISO 9796.  Many innovative new financial products and services will employ the
reversible cryptography described in these standards.  Clipper does not comply
with these standards. Will US financial institutions be able to export
Clipper?  If so, will their overseas customers find Clipper acceptable?  Was a
study of the potential impact of Clipper on US competitiveness conducted? If
so, is it available? If not, why not?

I realize they are probably still trying to assess the impact of Clipper, but
it would be interesting to hear from some major US financial institutions on
this issue.

Did the administration ask these questions (and get acceptable answers) before
supporting this program? If so, can they share the answers with us? If not,
can we seek answers before the program is launched?

I've been browsing through as much as I could this morning on comp.risks and
comp.security.misc about the Cripple Chip.  Personally, I will boycott any
products that incorporate this insidious device, as well as encouraging any
within my own circle of influence to do the same.  Unfortunately, these
newsgroups are read primarily by individuals who understand well the risks of
the chip and its attendant policy.  We are "preaching to the choir".  After a
brief discussion, I offer an idea for how to address a broader audience.

        ======== The Real Risk of the Clipper Chip ========

Proponents/apologists for the chip make, as I see it, one (and only one)
valid point: use of the chip will protect me against the casual
eavesdropper better than no encryption at all.

I fear, however, that unless something high-profile is done (and done quickly)
the real risk associated with this technology-policy will be borne to
fruition.  To wit, the American public is by and large profoundly ignorant of
technical "stuff", and often very indifferent about protecting their own
Constitutional rights.  This same gullible public may very easily be convinced
by the government that not only is their privacy protected from their nosy
neighbor, but also from unlawful invasion by law enforcement and/or other more
determined individuals and organizations.  This is what I see as the real risk
of Clipper.

There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of commercial, criminal and governmental
entities with access to government resources who would not hesitate for a
moment to violate my rights if they found it expedient to do so.  These
individuals and organizations have demonstrated beyond question that they are
not constrained by legal or ethical considerations, and as has been suggested
in a number of other postings, the technology employed by Clipper (including
the dual escrow sham) will probably not even pose so much as an inconvenience
to a determined adversary.  To suggest otherwise is, at best, profoundly
naive.

I believe that as a society we have at least two challenges with respect to
addressing this public gullibility/naivete:

1) we need to find some way to dispel the assumption held by many that the
government ultimately acts with the best interests of the public in mind.
This is unmitigated hogwash.  Government by its very nature is a consumer, not
a producer.  Left to its own, government will progressively consume more and
more of a nation's productivity until the nation finally collapses under the
weight of its inevitably oppressive and corrupt government, as in the Soviet
Union.  This can only be prevented by an informed and active citizenry.
	 
2) we need to find a way to effectively educate the public about _specific_
threats to our freedom and prosperity from government action (such as the
Cripple Chip) as they arise.

                              ==========

The average person's capacity for self-delusion makes #1 an unlikely candidate
for solution, but I have an idea for #2: does anyone out there have a personal
acquaintance with, say, Tom "Red October" Clancy, or Michael "Jurassic Park"
Crichton?  It occurs to me that a best-selling techno-thriller about a
government "sponsored" cryptology initiative gone awry might be a very
effective method for raising the awareness of the general public.  There have
already been a number of highly plausible scenarios suggested in both
comp.risks and comp.security.misc, that could probably be developed into a
story line.

Cui bono?

Who stands to gain from the Clipper Chip encryption system, and what
do they stand to gain?  From the reports, it seems pretty clear that
the users gain very little - the government is providing them with a
less secure system at marginally less cost than a more secure one.

So, why would the government go to all this trouble to do badly what
the market is already doing quite well?  As other have pointed out,
one obvious motive is to maintain, and indeed extend, the supposed
"right" of the authorities to snoop on private conversations.

However, that won't work.  Why should anyone worried about snoopers
use an encryption scheme designed to allow snooping?  In this, as in
much else, Gresham's Law will drive the Clipper from the market.

The answer, of course, is indeed that all other encryption schemes
must be outlawed.  Given the intense devotion to freedom and individual
rights in this country, it is very doubtful whether this could be done
directly, by legislative fiat.  Hence what I believe to be a deliberate
ruse by the government to finesse away this freedom.

You see, friends, if the Clipper becomes the normal, standard, or accepted
means of encryption, then *the use of any other encryption scheme can of
itself be considered "probable cause" for search and seizure*.  And thereby
could be lost in the courts what was won at such great cost.

For which reason, I believe the Clipper proposal warrants our united,
vocal, and implacable opposition.

Amazing how diversified the discussion has become with people deciding
just what Clipper will do and taking stands against it.

I'm taking the opposite approach. The people who designed it are talented and
dedicated. The criteria for design may not be exactly what we might like but
it must be *Good Enough* (C). Therefore a few postulates are submitted for
consideration. (Haven't been briefed so am free to think out loud 8*).

1) There will be many family keys. There may be only one *right now* but
   a single key makes no sense. I expect that corporations may be able to
   buy groups of Clipper chips with a single family key just as I expect
   corporations to be able to monitor their chips (owner's rights have
   nothing to do with wiretaps). See the court cases in California
   concerning monitoring if you doubt this.

2) Once a key is released for a wiretap, there is no way to protect the
   key and the future use of the chip would be invalidated. Therefore,
   keys will not be released. When a tap is authorized, the requesting
   authority will receive a duplicate Clipper chip. A physical device is 
   much easier to account for and a duplicate can process anything the
   original can. If the plaintext is available, who cares what the key
   was ?

3) There will be several varieties of Clipper chips, some will allow key 
   programming (Master Clippers ?) but the ones for the general public will 
   be fixed. 

4) (Stretching a bit) The algorithm will be kept secret simply because
   there is no one true algorithm. Reverse engineer two chips and they will
   not be alike. There are many different ways to say the same thing (and
   confuse engineers e.g. polymorphic viruses). If so can lay claim to prior
   art c.a. 1984, 1981 nee IBM 1957 8*).

5) Further suspect there might be some *traps* in the Clipper that will
   render chip useless if given the wrong inputs ("China Clippers" ?) -
   see #4.

Like I said, both the government and corporate America *need* Clipper, the
designers are some of the best in the world, and the administration has more
to lose than we do. Given that, Clipper will work as advertised.

Again, pure conjecture but phun ;*)	Padgett  [Usual disclaimers apply]

I'm wondering how the Clipper Chip (actually, the entire genre of encrypted
telephone technology) impacts the rules of evidence presented in a court of
law.  I believe that current rules of evidence require that, when a phone is
being tapped, that a person be listening in on the phone at the time that it
is being recorded (tapped).  A tape recording by itself is not admissible;
there must be a person who will testify that he (she), indeed, listened in on
the phone line and that the tape recording is an accurate representation of
what was said.

With encrypted (digital) telephony and POST-HOC decryption, it is not possible
to have a human listen in on the live conversation in order to testify to the
authenticity of the tape.  The only way for this to work is to get the keys in
advance and decrypt the conversation in real time.

(Of course, this assumes that federal agents will not purjure themselves
regarding evidence.  It also does not rule out "fishing expeditions" in which
phones are tapped to gather information (never intended to be used as
evidence), perhaps as a "pointer" to other hard evidence...

...naww -- it can't happen here!)   jp

The RISKS, weaknesses and anti-constitutional aspects of the Clipper scheme
are becoming more and more apparent.  For instance, Dorothy Denning writes:

: Only law enforcement will have a decoder box that allows the law
: enforcement field to be decrypted. Initially, there will be just one
                                     ^^^^^^^^^
: box, and it will be operated by the FBI.

Who else is going to receive/develop such boxes?  I see many possibilities:
the IRS/EPA/DEA, criminals, enemy dictatorships, etc.

: After a tap has been completed [...] the subjects are certainly free
: to purchase a new device with a new chip [...]

Wonderful.  The feudal "subjects" are _free_ to spend their own money
to purchase a new device.  It is quite interesting that the protection
offered by the Constitution (no taking without compensation) is simply
disregarded.  A reminder seems in order: We are not subjects--we are freemen.

Even a suspect is under the protection of the Bill of Rights.
In particular, property that is taken away must be compensated
(the disclosure of the secret key destroys the value of the chip),
especially when _no_evidence_of_crime_ is found.  I would have
thought it was an essential aspect of the government's proposal:
respect and uphold the U.S.  Constitution--including the Bill of
Rights.

: With the new technologies, law enforcers will be incapable of executing
: a tap without the assistance of the service provider.

This is an irresponsible promise, not a fact.  The new technologies
increasingly rely on radio transmissions.  Listening (i.e. tapping)
radio transmissions is the easiest thing in the world, whether the
listener is a bureaucrat, a criminal, a spook, or a competitor.

: The NSA has a long record of success with crypto, far better than any
: individual or organization in the public community.

The question is: what _kind_ of success?  universal _de_cryption?

Clearly, the prime mover of the Clipper scheme is not to protect the
people, but to make it easier for the government (and any government
in the future) to monitor the people.  The highest RISK is that the
government should some day take advantage of the new power it could
acquire given the precedent established by this proposal.

I can't wait for government mandated holes in our doors and walls in
order to make it possible for the FBI to listen to and watch "criminal
activities at home".  Where is the difference?

An item from a Boeing News Digest:

 Washington, D.C. Office Morning Report - Volume 19 Number 81  April 26, 1993

1.  WALL STREET JOURNAL - After an incident in which an Evergreen
International Airlines 747 went into a slow roll, lost lift and went into a
dive, dropping from 31,000 feet to 19,000 feet, the Federal Aviation
Administration began an investigation.  It found 30 similar incidents the FAA
believes were caused by a broad variety of autopilot faults.  The incidents,
both fast and slow rolls, showed up on 747s at several airlines over a 22-year
period.  Many occurred in daylight with a horizon visible, enabling pilots to
regain control more quickly -- and postponing the day when the seriousness of
the problem would be widely recognized.  Among carriers whose 747 autopilots
went into rolls are British Airways, TWA, Air Canada and Lufthansa.  Boeing,
the airlines and aviation regulators are in a quandary.  After more than a
year of intense investigation following Evergreen's near-disaster, engineers
can't agree on whether the fault lies in the autopilot or elsewhere, or on
what the remedy should be.  Boeing says pilots should pay close attention to
their job so they can quickly right the plane should the autopilot throw it
into a roll.  Autopilots "are designed to assist and supplement the pilot's
capabilities and not replace them," a company statement says.  "This means our
airplanes are designed so pilots are the final control authority and it means
that a well trained crew is the first line of safety."

From The Guardian, Friday April 16th 1993, tabloid supplement, p3, 
article: ``Down to Earth with a bump'', by Tim Radford:- 

        ------------------Begin extract---------------------- 

[Astronaut Mike] Collins once compared Apollo's flight to a half a million 
mile daisy chain, draped round the Moon. A Nasa safety engineer on an 
earlier voyage put it more graphically. ``Apollo 8 has 5,600,000 moving 
parts. Even if all functioned with 99.9 per cent reliability, we could 
expect 5,600 defects.'' On Apollo 11 something did go wrong, but no one 
now remembers it. When Armstrong and Aldrin climbed back into the module 
and began the checklist in preparation for blast-off, they discovered that 
a plastic pin which acted as a circuit breaker for the launch engine had 
snapped off. They decided it was because a backpack must have bumped it as 
they left the tiny lunar module. For a few appalling moments it must have 
seemed as though the nightmare had begun: marooned on the Moon, with only a 
day's oxygen and no way home. Aldrin poked around, and found a felt-tipped 
pen, and shoved it in the slot. It worked. A charge of electricity could 
then start the launch engine. Man had a proper place in the scheme after all. 
``Where else,'' said one test pilot in the programme, ``would you get a 
non-linear computer weighing only 160lbs, having a billion binary decision 
elements, that can be mass-produced by unskilled labour?'' 

The classic argument of the what's-the-point lobby, which includes space 
administrators and big business as well as governments and scientists, and 
for which Lewis Mumford spoke so eloquently, is that humans in space can't 
do without computers, but computers can do without humans. This is almost 
but not quite true, and Aldrin's felt-tipped pen has written one tiny answer 
to that, and the same point will be made again and again: the history of 
unmanned space is a history of of technical flaws as well as technical 
triumphs. Man may not be going to Mars just yet, but he'll get there. 
He'll be wanted on the voyage. 

But that isn't quite the point either. A manned Mars mission would be an 
awfully big adventure, and not just for the men who set out on it. 
Does anyone now think the pyramids were really a waste of money?

During 1991 and 1992, many things happened in Spain related with computer
risks.  Some of them went to the Court, and many others remain in an unhealthy
silence.  Data stolen from banks, cryptology used by terrorist organizations,
hacking, piracy, personal dossiers and blackmailing have been studied by the
police, lawyers, journalists and professional technicians.
 
Moreover, a deep crisis in Spanish economy does not help to recover any
investment in data processing.  There are too many unpaid bills and half
performed projects in computing.  At the same time, politicians at the
Parliament approved a new Law on Data Protection, and a Data Protection
Agency, a Computer Police that is not clear enough who can control and how can
it work.
 
Computer victimization is very high in Spain due to knowledge lack and
technical dependency from equipment and service sellers.  In an increasingly
complex and critical environments, there is almost no local technology
industry, and multinationals are very disconcerted because lack of expertise,
expensive commercial nets, counter-productive promotional efforts, and
political corruption on almost every local big business.
 
Since December 1992, there is an Association, APEDANICA, that can help to
discover sensible troubles related with computers and communications, and its
markets.  Members of this non-profitable organization acts like expert
witness, cryptologist, lawyers, and even as Sherlock Holmes in computer
environments.
 
APEDANICA (ASOCIACION PARA LA PREVENCION Y ESTUDIO DE DELITOS ABUSOS Y
NEGLIGENCIAS EN INFORMATICA Y COMUNICACIONES AVANZADAS), Spanish Legal
Advanced Communications and Computer Crime Association, is very interested in
developing relationships with any other organization with similar goals, all
over the World.

Subject: Crypto-Schemes and Mobile Digital Services

At CFP'93, there was considerable debate about whether cryptographic
schemes should be designed to be 'crackable' by national security and law
enforcement agencies.  The Australian situation is that the licences issued
for mobile digital telephone services all require the cryptography to be
crackable.  Now read on ...

New digital phones on line despite objections
By BERNARD LAGAN and ANNE DAVIES
The Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday 28 April, 1993

CANBERRA: The Federal government has over-ridden the objections of law
enforcement agencies and allowed Telecom and Optus to start new digital
mobile phone networks which are so secure that conversations can escape
officially authorised telephone bugging.     	
	While law enforcement agencies can still intercept calls from mobile
phones to an ordinary phone, calls from one digital mobile phone to another
cannot be tapped.              
	The Government agreed to waive the bugging requirement, originally a
condition of Telecom and Optus's mobile phone network licences, late last week
after strong pressure from both carriers to begin their services without
providing technology to allow law enforcement agencies to listen into
conversations.
	The changes to the system to allow official bugging will take up to
two years to complete and will cost more than $25 million, a cost which the
Government has agreed to bear.
	The Government's waiving of the bugging requirement was made despite
strong opposition from law enforcement agencies, who wanted the start of the
new digital mobile phone networks delayed until there was technology available
to allow conversations conducted on these networks to be intercepted.
	The law enforcement agencies argued that once criminals and others who
had reason to avoid officially authorised interceptions of their telephone
conversations became aware of the loopholes in the new system, they would
exploit it.
	The exemption was given by the Minister for Communications, Mr Beddall
after talks held last week with the acting Attorney-General, Mr Kerr.
	It enabled Telecom to launch the country's first digital mobile phone
network yesterday.
	The Federal Government is reticent about the decision to let the new
network go ahead.  A spokesman would only say that the Attorney-General was
"satisfied" with the operational aspects of the new system.
	A spokesman for Minister for Communications, Mr Beddall, said that
"the matter had been resolved", and any further queries should be addressed to
Telecom and Optus.
	General manager of Telecom, MobileNet, Mr John Dearn, refused to
confirm or deny that calls made from the new GSM (General System
Mobile),mobile phones to other GSM mobile phones could not be intercepted, or
that an exemption had been sought from the Government to allow the new GSM
service to begin.
	"We have an agreement with the Department of Communications that we
will not discuss the licence conditions," he said.
	Referring to the fact that most mobile phone calls are to fixed phones
attached to the ordinary telephone network, Optus chief operating officer, Mr
Ian Boatman said that most calls carried on Optus's GSM network would be
interceptable by the security agencies.
	Optus is understood to have met with the Attorney General last
Thursday, and has been given similar exemptions to its licence conditions.
	A third licensed operator is Vodaphone. Managing director, Mr Phillip
Cornish, said: "These are Government and security matters and Vodaphone had no
comment". Vodaphone is not likely to begin its service until late this year.
	The three mobile licensees Telecom MobileNet, Optus and Vodaphone
Australia - are 'required by their licences to introduce the new digital
mobile system, or GSM, as soon as the standard is available.
	However it became clear that the formula used to encode the new
service, known as the A5 algorithm, was so secure that not even the police or
security agencies could listen in.
	The dilemma for the Government was that having insisted on the the
early introduction of GSM, it faced the prospect of substantial delays if it
did not waive the licence condition. Because the standard was so secure,
nobody anticipated the difficulty of re-coding and re-encrypting the algorithm
to give access to law enforcement agencies.
	The Telecom system, costing in excess of $10O million to establish,
covers more than 55 per cent of Australian consumers in Sydney, Melbourne,
Canberra, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, the Gold Coast, Newcastle, Geelong and
the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria.
	Its high security - compared to the existing 018 mobile telephone
network - together with greater clarity is being used by Telecom to attract
new customers.
	Under the 018 radio phone network, people using sophisticated scanners
could pick up private conversations. But the digital technology ensures the
telephone transmissions are scrambled and cannot be understood by people with
scanners.

How to rob a bank the cashcard way

An article in the UK Sunday Telegrapph on 25 Apr 1993, p. 5, by Barbara Lewis,
deals with the current argument that banks in the UK deny that "phantom"
withdrawals happen, and all such things from ATMs are because the cashcard
owner has let the PIN be revealed.  The card used was a free gift from a Total
garage (Total - a French petrol company), for use in a money saving offer.
The PIN belonged to someone's account.  By bringing the two together, and
programming the card with a genuine account number taken from a discarded till
receipt, Mr Clough was able to fool the machine into paying out.

The requirements included specialised computer knowledge and basic technology.
A magnetic card reader and programmer costing as little as 500 pounds (750
dollars) which is capable of turning worthless blanks into cashcards.  By
using the details of the discard receipt, which contained the full account
number, plus the details off a valid card, they were able to "break" the
system.  They used a machine which could not check the validity of the card
with the banks central computer, and so forced validation by the information
of the card itself.

From the article, the area of danger is the number of printouts with numbers
of cards on them and the ability to find ATMs which are not on-line to the
banks computer.  They also demonstrated that a careful watcher of users of
ATMs can "see" what PIN is used, pick up a receipt discarded by the same
person who they watched, and then can make a usable card.  The particular ATM
still prints all the account number, and not all UK ATMs may work the way this
banks one did, but they believe that it is a major loophole.

The banks deny that they are finding lots of "white" cards, and a spokesman
for the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APCS) insisted that hat was
done was impossible.  It seems as usual that the banks are hiding their
collective heads in the sand.

I will substantiate the article by J. Phillip Miller.  The same circumstances
occurred in Holt, Michigan, last year (1992) in the house next to my parents'
(address and date available upon request): a search warrant was issued because
of higher-than-neighborhood-average electric bills, a sweep by helicopter with
infrared camera confirmed thermal hot spots, search of the house turned up
marijuana cultivation. Evidently this is a known routine for the electric
utilities, but I don't know if there is a chi-square or similar statistic they
use to determine what is "substantially" higher usage.

A similar situation occurred locally a few months back.  From memory, the
local police (don't remember which city) had reason to believe that an
individual was cultivating marijuana in his basement, but they had
insufficient grounds for a search warrant.  I believe what happened is that
they got a PG&amp;E guy to read the suspect's meter, which told them that he was
using a *lot* of energy.  And that got them a search warrant.  The issue that
arises, of course, was the legality of the procedure, because the PG&amp;E guy was
technically acting as a law enforcement agent, and therefore he violated
"unlawful search and seizure" laws.

Again, I'm fuzzy on the details, so take this with a grain of salt.  Jim

This is purely speculative, but I would imagine that many utilities now may
have routines which flag any unusually high billing amounts and request human
confirmation of the accuracy of the figures.  We've all heard the stories of
Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Q. Public who received an electrical/gas/etc. bill for a
couple hundred thousand dollars for their two-bedroom home and had to fight
tooth-and-nail with the utility company to get them to realize that they had
made a mistake.  Such publicity is probably embarrassing enough for is
probably embarrassing enough for the company to make a simple double-check
routine worth the effort.

I knew someone who this happened to in the late 70s.  He seemed to think that
such monitoring of electricity was not uncommon; he was, however, not taken to
court, since the police or prosecutor apparently was worried that their search
was not legal.  They made a verbal agreement with him that he would just stop
growing pot in his house and they wouldn't press the matter.

He did mention another interesting variation on this theme.  He said that in
winter if the police notice that part of your roof (e.g., the attic) has no
snow on it then they can (and will) legally search your house, presumably
after getting a warrant.  I would think that this would hold up in court.

I'm not sure how RISKy this whole subject is, however, unless the electricity
monitoring was done by computer...

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.55.html">RISKS-14.55</A>, J. Philip Miller (phil@wubios.wustl.edu) wondered if utilities
detect "unusual" customers.  I know the water company for New Haven,
Connecticut asked my mother-in-law why her water usage trebled from one
billing period to the next.  I think that utility companies are generally
expected to monitor "average" or "normal" use for when somebody protests that
$1000.00 dollar gas/electric/phone/water bill.

I would be surprised if the St. Louis police could get a warrant just on the
basis of high electricity use and an "unusually warm" attic.  These may have
been used to support statements made by an informant--say a neighbor wondering
why this guy had so many visitors at 3:00am.  Or the warrant may have been
instigated by concerns for violations of local building codes or zoning
ordinances.  If the fire marshall saw marijuana plants growing in the attic
while executing a warrant searching for potential fire code violations would
another warrant be needed to arrest the occupant for drug violations?

In California, PG&amp;E (the electric utility in many parts of Northern California)
issues press releases which indicate that they do this.

Can Wiretaps Remain Cost-Effective?

U.S. Phone companies spend more than 4000 times as much running the phone
system ($126b) as police spend on legal domestic phone wiretaps ($31m), to
listen to phone conversations without the consent of either party.  So if
wiretaps are worth at most a few times what police spend on them, we can
justify only the slightest modification of our phone system to accommodate
wiretaps.  Yet the new wiretap chip, and last year's FBI digital telephony
bill, both threaten to raise our phone bills by far more than they reduce our
taxes for police.

Dorothy Denning claims that wiretaps are worth "billions of dollars per year",
based on amounts fined, recovered, etc.  But this is just the wrong way to
estimate the value of police services, according to standard texts on law
enforcement economics.  Instead, the value of each wiretap should be not far
from how much police would be willing to pay extra for that wiretap.  Given
alternatives to use hidden microphones, informants, offer immunity,
investigate someone else, or to raise the punishment for some crimes, it seems
hard to imagine that most wiretaps would still be done if they cost police
four times as much as they do now.  And even if wiretaps were on average worth
four times what police now pay, the option to wiretap the average phone line
would be worth only six cents a month.

Yet phone companies must even now perceive substantial costs to supporting
wiretaps, even relative to wanting to stay on the good side of police; why
else would police be complaining about lack of support?  Government policies
attempting to preserve wiretaps in the face of technological change would
discourage a full global market for phone systems, while government decree
would displace marketplace evolution of standards for representing,
encrypting, and exchanging voice.  Do you think these factors would raise the
average $76 monthly phone bill by more than six cents?  Even the wiretap chip
itself, sold for $30 each while private chips without wiretap support sell for
$10, would cost people who buy a new phone every five years an extra 30 cents
per month.

The central question is this: would police agencies still be willing to pay
for each wiretap, if each wiretapping agency were charged its share of the
full cost, to phone users, of forcing phones to support wiretaps?  And why not
let the market decide the answer?  Currently, police must pay phone company
"expenses" to support wiretaps.  Let us interpret this to mean that phone
companies may sell to police the option to perform legal wiretaps on given
sets of phone lines, at whatever price the two parties can negotiate.  Phone
companies could then offer discounts to customers who use phones with wiretap
chips, and each person could decide if the extra cost and risk of privacy
invasion was worth the price to make life easier for the police.

If it turns out wiretaps aren't worth their cost, so be it; no big deal.  Less
than one part in a thousand of police budgets is spent on wiretaps, and
wiretaps weren't even legal before 1968.

There is an enormous amount of pending mail on the Clipper Chip.  However,
much of it is now third- or fourth-order incrementalism.  Please excuse me if
I arbitrarily cut off the discussion rather than try to cull through
everything looking for a few gems.  I am delighted that this issue raised such
a response, and hope that the discussion in RISKS has been helpful.  The last
words have obviously not yet been said, but it seems silly to continue a
discussion that includes considerable misinterpretations of already misleading

A student told this quite believable tale about a German steel-producer last
week:

The steel production line is completely automated, with the molten ingots
having to cool a certain number of minutes/hours before force is applied to
flatten them out. It appears the programmers of the system didn't want to
construct their own clock, and so from a security point of view they used the
German radio signal put out from Braunschweig (Funkuhr) that gives the exact
time. This was used to calculate cooling times. In April, though, there was
the day we switched to summer time, and a day with just 23 hours. 3:00 am
followed 1:59 am, and the mill controller thought that the cooling time was
up, and applied force - splattering still-molten steel around the place and
breaking this part of the mill.

Any confirmation of this from sources other than a friend of a friend?

On Friday 29 April 93 the Los Angeles Times reported on page D1 in a story by
Robert A. Rosenblatt that the U.S. Treasury department will implement a new
computerized government securities auction system even though the General
Accounting Office (GAO) says it is "deeply flawed."  [Paraphrasing and
elisions by Mark Seecof.]  The purpose of the new system is to prevent fraud
and bid-rigging such as Salomon Bros. engaged in during 1990 and 1991.

"The automated network proved highly unreliable during tests of simulated
auctions...  In one test, five dealers 'were disconnected from the
mainframe'...  If this happened during an actual auction, the bids would have
been lost.

"Another threat comes from the computer clock..., which 'drifts and has to be
manually readjusted...  This poses a potential problem for those dealers who
submit bids seconds before an auction closes... For instance, should the
computer clock gain time, dealers could transmit timely bids that are rejected
as late.' [NNTP, anyone?]

"Because of these uncertainties, the Treasury is allowing dealers to maintain
the old [paper] method of bidding despite the GAO warning that this defeats
the purpose of the new network, known as the Treasury Automated Auction
Processing System.

"The GAO recommended that the computer effort be delayed while a better system
is devised to detect fraud and collusion...  The Treasury defended its
decision to proceed...  'Our position is that TAAPS has been thoroughly tested
and is ready to be put into production,' a Treasury spokeswoman said.
'Treasury considers this TAAPS program an important first step...  We
deliberately chose to introduce automation to the auction process
incrementally and believe this to be a prudent approach.'"

[Mark Seecof says:]
"Prudent incrementalism."  Note that this is (a) not a lie, (b) not a response
to the charge that TAAPS is "deeply flawed," and (c) not very satisfying to
the reader.  Okay, so bureaucrats will "brazen it out," and implement even
"deeply flawed" systems rather than admit to development failures.  Perhaps we
should start rewarding managers for NOT implementing bogus systems?  Could we
devise a suitable bureaucratic scheme for doing so?  On another note, could an
unethical trader with a copy of the GAO report find a way to gain some
advantage by exploiting TAAPS' flaws?

A local TV news program had a story about a new type of phone sex
service.  A teenage boy evaded the long distance blocking on his
parents' phone by calling a free 1-800 number and leaving his phone
number.  The phone sex service called him back, collect.

The people interviewed on the show acted very shocked that this could happen,
even though the phone company said it wouldn't charge for the calls.  In
particular they pointed out that the boy was not required to prove his age.
No suggestions were offered as to how he might do so over the phone.

In my opinion, they were trying to blame technology for a social problem.  The
phone company is an easy target.  Certainly it's easier to blame them than to
ask controversial questions like "why can't you take responsibility for your
son's actions?" or "what's wrong with talking about sex?".

I was a bit surprised that the report included the free phone number to call.
I wonder how many people will call the service after learning about it from
the news.

The Kyodo News Agency, in a story datelined Tokyo, warns of a new strain of
computer virus that is to strike computers operating under MS-DOS on the
Japanese Children's Holiday, May 5 (May 4 on this side of the International
Dateline).

Kyoto quotes the Information Technology Promotion Agency, which it
describes as "a government-backed computer institute." as identifying the
new virus as DApdm-13.  This virus, when activated displays the English
sentence, "Hey boy, do you know hide-and-seek?  Play with me."  The virus
will then, according to Kyoto, overwrite all data and programs.

Without further elaboration, the news agency says that the virus can be
removed by programs already on the market.

[RE a note saying that the Clinton administration seems to be leaning toward
making the SSN the national health ID]

There is a thriving business in stolen SSN's so that illegal aliens can
get work.  The checking is now good enough that the alien needs the name
that matches the SSN for the I-9 form to pass, under the bureaucratic rule
of thumb that anyone who presents your name and SSN must be you.

This means that people all over the country are now being hassled by the
IRS for not reporting income, typically from some place in Southern
California or Texas that they've never heard of where the alien was
working.  There was a sidebar in the Boston Globe yesterday about a local
woman who was hounded by the IRS for five years with this problem.

Until now, SSN theft could cause considerable financial pain, but it
couldn't kill you.  If the national health number is the SSN, this means
that when someone steals your SSN and they go to the doctor, their health
records will become mixed in with yours.  If someone is already fairly
sick, it is easy to imagine how a system depending on computerized records
could misprescribe drugs or other treatment with fatal effects.

It is interesting Lord Wodehouse's contribution was published here.  I had
considered sending details myself, but I remembered that my similar
submission last autumn was not published, (describing a report on the BBC
Newsnight television programme and New Scientist magazine).

&gt; An article in the UK Sunday Telegrapph on 25 Apr 1993, p. 5, by Barbara
&gt; Lewis, ...

Barbara is the journalist, the deceit of the Automated Teller Machines
(ATMs) was performed by Bryan Clough, and an unnamed computer expert.


The banks call this "white card fraud" because up to now most attempts
have been with the plain white plastic cards supplied by vendors of the
card read/write equipment.  The banks only find the white cards if they
are retained by the ATMs.  To my knowledge all ATMs operated in the UK
allow three attempts to enter the correct 4 digit PIN.  If the third
attempt is not validated the ATM retains the card, but after the first
or second attempt you can select "cancel" or "error" and have the card
returned.  If you reinsert the card into the ATM it does not remember
your previously failed attempts.  Summary: a fraudster has to be very
incompetent to let the ATM retain the card.


I spoke to Bryan Clough on Monday about this.  He clarified a few of the
technical aspects for me, which I hesitate to post here.  A brief outline
of one of the events described should be enough to worry:
1   The journalist used her cashcard to withdraw money at an ATM.
2   She placed the receipt in the bin provided.
3   Bryan Clough retrieved the receipt.
4   Bryan, and his colleague, took the receipt to a portable computer and
    card read/write unit, (in their car I think).  They programmed 3
    cards using information from other cards and the receipt.
5   Presenting each of the 3 cards to an ATM, (not at the bank that issued
    the card), gave these results:
    1.  10 pounds was withdrawn, debited to the journalist's account.
    2.  10 pounds was withdrawn, the journalist's account was debited
        with 10 pounds and 3 pence!
    3.  The card was rejected as invalid, Mr Clough recovered the card
        by selecting "cancel".

Note, in this case the PIN was derived from the known card - only the
journalist's account number was needed, not her PIN.

In a further conversation with Bryan today he told me that the (UK) Sun
newspaper had a short item on this yesterday, and that he was expecting
them to do another one on Saturday.


I suspect that the banks insist that this is impossible simply because
the managers lack a technical understanding of the technology.

A contribution to RISKS (14.56) once again repeats the propaganda that it is
only through human cleverness and ingenuity that complex space missions are
saved. That is sheer propaganda. Oh yes, it is true, but the stories neglect
the fact that if it weren't for the requirement to keep the humans healthy and
alive, the mission would be dramatically less complex and the reliability would
be dramatically greater (and the cost correspondingly less). And if a space
launch or two failed, it wouldn't much matter.
 
Reread that RISKS quote: "For a few appalling moments it must have seemed as
though the nightmare had begun: marooned on the Moon, with only a day's oxygen
and no way home. Aldrin poked around, and found a felt-tipped pen, and shoved
it in the slot. It worked. ... Man had a proper place in the scheme after all."
 
Notice that the felt-tipped pen prevented the humans from being marooned. But
if there were no humans on board, it wouldn't have mattered. What is all this
about "Man had a proper place in the scheme after all"?
 
And then RISKS repeats the old joke: ``Where else,'' said one test pilot in the
programme, ``would you get a non-linear computer weighing only 160 lbs, having
a billion binary decision elements, that can be mass-produced by unskilled
labour?''  (Actually, it is hundreds of billions of elements, and a lot more
complex than binary).  The problem with this old joke is not the inaccuracy of
the numbers (for the correct numbers make the point of the joke even more
impressive) but rather the neglect of the twenty to thirty years of training by
*very highly skilled* personnel necessary to produce test pilots and the rest
of us, to say nothing of the infrastructure and costs required to keep us alive
during that period.
 
Look, folks, the main justification of humans in space is that it is a neat
thing to do, that it provides new opportunities for growth, exploration, and
colonization. It is probably inevitable, given human curiosity and love of new
adventures. I want to do it too.  But let us be honest: if you want people in
space, then admit it. Justify it on those grounds. Don't lie and say that
humans are needed to keep the spacecraft going -- the only reason they are
needed for that purpose is because humans are on board in the first place.
 
There is a NASA report floating about somewhere (the old "Carl Sagan committee"
-- of which I was a member -- that performed an expensive several year study of
the problem and concluded just that. But the report violated NASA's goals of
"man in space" and seems to have been lost in the filing cabinets.

Page 365 of Murray and Cox's, "Apollo: The Race to the Moon", (Simon and
Schuster 1989) gives a very different account.  According to their version of
the story, Armstrong bumped into the circuit breaker with his backpack, and
the astronauts reported the damage before going out on their moon walk.
During the moon walk, folks on Earth figured how to rewire some of the
switches in the LEM to bypass the circuit breaker and arm the ascent engine.

So the astronauts were superfluous...  :-)

While not disagreeing with Peter Mellor's point about humans having a place in
space (that is, on manned space missions), I would like to point out that his
example would seem to argue for the opposite.  The error that Buzz Aldrin
fixed was caused by a misplaced backpack.  A computer probably wouldn't do
this, not because computers do not misplace things, but because in an unmanned
flight there would not be any backpacks--or any switches either.  In other
words, the error corrected was in the user interface of the lunar module, and
the correction was done by the user.

I probably have a bias in this matter working for a laboratory tasked with the
robotic exploration of the solar system.  Let me reiterate that I cannot speak
for JPL (and that they probably disagree with at least some of this.)

It strikes me that the case cited illustrates the advantages of unmanned
exploration as well as the advantages of manned exploration.  If Armstrong and
Aldrin hadn't been on board the module, some mission capabilities would have
been lost.  However, there would not have been the "nightmare" scenario in
which human beings are at risk.

Given that losing humans is considered far worse than any other failure in our
space program, the cost of sending humans into space is much higher than the
cost of robotic exploration.  This limits the number of missions flown.
Moreover, the cost to the space program any time an astronaut is lost is
tremendous both in terms of money and time lost to the program.

Thus, because of the costs of additional systems and redundancies to support
humans and the additional weight (which adds further costs), I believe we need
to very carefully choose those situations in which it is worthwhile to send
humans versus those situations where sending several robots will produce wider
results.

In all fairness, it should be noted that the circuit breaker would not have
failed if a human had not been present to brush the plastic pin with his
backpack.  Further, the increased complexity of *manned* spacecraft greatly
increases the number of things which can fail.

The pyramids are a poor example to bring into the argument about manned space
exploration.  They cost more than just money.

After reading the initial announcement of Clinton's support of the Clipper
Chip I thought that the idea was insane!  Upon reading more about the chip and
following the discussions here I have to express some concern over this
technology and the cost of pursuing the implementation of it in government
systems.  One concern that was raised was the problem that once an entity had
been given the escrow key to effect a tap that they could then continue to tap
any and all conversations in the future.  Dorothy Denning suggested that the
purchase of a new unit could be effected, or a simple chip relacement could be
done to rectify this situation.  I have to suggest that now hardware
replacement is "simple" and I have to wonder at the cost and logistics of
effecting such a replacement.

Padgett suggests that this is a sound technology whose time has come and which
will offer a "good enough" encryption service.  Well, I would suggest that 
"good enough" technology already exists, so why invest in technology which has
a built in trap door?  It makes no sense!

Also, I am somewhat concerned that we are already ramping up for this effort.
NIST is already beginning to allocate resources to this project, as has NSA.
How much is this going to cost?  It seems to me that we have embarked on a
trip but forgotten the map.  Why would Clinton set up such a standard before
trying to get some consensus from the effected parties?  Or is this just a
trial balloon?

I think there are many valid questions which have been raised such as who will
be the consumers of this technology?  What is the point of providing such a
chip if criminals are unlikely to use it, or if additional layers of
encryption are placed on the communications?  Tapping would seem useless if
this were the case, unless, as others have pointed out, other forms of
encryption were made illegal.  But what is the possibility of this?  I'd say
nil.  Such a requirement would be so onerous that it would never be supported.
In addition, there is no way that current vendors of encryption software and
hardware would lay down while this occurred.  Plus, it might not even be
constitutional (potentially violating privacy, freedom of press, and
expression).  So I doubt that doing away with other forms of encryption is
being contemplated.

So then what is the use of this chip?  It may have some use as a technology, 
but not in the way currently described.  For example, I could think of a use
within a corporation.  If all computers in a corporation used the encryption
provided by such a chip to encrypt sensitive information and an employee
left, then the escrow key could be used to get back the information which would
otherwise be lost to the company.  But this is not the way that is currently
being pursued.  And since other forms of encryption can be used to thwart 
tapping attempts, what is the point?

It seems to be an interesting intellectual exercise, and it may indeed have
uses in corporations requiring encryption, but the idea that you would provide
the "keys to the kingdom" to some currently undefined escrow authority such as
the FBI or NSA or the local police will never be supported by security experts
or commercial entities.

Let's all agree that we don't want to waste our tax dollars on this project and
contact our congresspeople and senators to nip this project in the bud before
it becomes the next government sponsored boondoggle.

Robert Firth, &lt;firth@SEI.CMU.EDU&gt;, asks

&gt;Why should anyone worried about snoopers
&gt;use an encryption scheme designed to allow snooping?  

Answering his own question, he says

&gt;The answer, of course, is indeed that all other encryption schemes
&gt;must be outlawed.

When private use of end-to-end encryption is outlawed, how will it be
enforced?  How will the agents of the Crypto Enforcement Agency (CEA) know
that two end-users are sending encrypted traffic and not just random bit
streams?  Will they mis-interpret binary file transfer as unauthorized use of
encrypted data?  Will every kermit user be subject to search of his/her
premises by CEA agents, bashing in the door under authority of search warrant?
Where will it all end?

	In a case several years ago in the desert north of Los Angles
"excessive" electricity use was the "Probable Cause" for a search warrant.
The police did find pot cultivation in an underground garden.  The excessive
use was determined by a bill found during a raid in Bullhead City Arizona.

	The part never mentioned by the press was the bill was while the house
and barn were being constructed.  Power for the garden was provided by a
generator.

Abstracted from an AP item in the Buffalo News, May 2, 1993:

Two women accused of selling confidential information about adoptions have
pleaded innocent to computer trespass, grand larceny, and other charges.
State police and Department of Health officials allege that one of the women,
a departmental employee, looked up confidential adoption records in state
computers, then passed them onto the other defendant.  The other defendant,
who ran an adoption group called Birth Parents Network, then allegedly sold
the information for $800 a listing to people seeking their birth parents or
children.

  Comment: It is notoriously difficult to break the sealed records in adoption
  cases. Many people use private detectives to find out what the court doesn't
  want them to know. Why not an end run around the records, and, at $800, it's
  probably cheaper than the detective.

The other evening, I received a number from an upset woman.  It appears that
her caller-id box told her she had just received a call from my number.  The
only call I had made that evening yielded me a pizza, and the number did not
resemble hers.  I did not ask her to described the call, because she seemed
upset.  But I gather I would not have wanted to be accused of making it.

Anybody know whether this happens often?  Does the caller-id report include an
error check?  Are all boxes required to verify the check?

Appended to the end of this message is an announcement I received today.
There's a new mailing list in town, the Risk Management and Insurance Mailing
list. The new mailing list is named RISK.

Perhaps this is an example of a RISK associated with the growing use of
mailing lists.

I wonder how many people, intending to subscribe to a mailing list version of
the RISKS digest, will accidentally subscribe to the RISK mailing list.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for accuracy, the unit is VERY accurate. Internally the system is
&gt;&gt;&gt; digital and drives a stepper motor to which the needle is attached.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is factory calibrated. The stepper motor mans that the needle
&gt;&gt;&gt; does not bounce around when the driver clips a curb or generally goofs.

&gt;&gt;	Much of this debate is based on opinion only and has little
&gt;&gt; data to back it up.

In the case of a watch it doesn't matter whether it is analogue or digital,
for most people most of the time a quarter hour counter will do.  In fact the
minute hand is really not needed and was omitted from early clocks, the time
between the hours was estimated.

In the case of a speedometer the speeds to which one is driving (eg usually
the limit) do matter.  I was involved in research (yes the evil deed of
getting real data) for Ford in Britain and we found that a digital, numeric
readout, even in poor seven segment characters was uniformly at least as good
and most times better than an analogue display.  We found this effect in
photographic presentations, a simulator and on the road with a $100,000
prototype.  We knew from the "ergonomics" literature that an analogue display
was supposed to be better for check reading and estimation but we failed to
find what we expected even though the tests were sometimes biased to find out
if such an effect occurred.  Furthermore, older people preferred this display
because the numbers were now so large that it was not necessary to focus on
them as much as was necessary to see a needle (especially at night).  The time
taken to interpret the numeric display was "swamped" by the ease of reading it
allowing people to look back at the road during the interpretation time.  When
we presented the results to a conference the German and Japanese auto
researchers rushed back to their labs to do the research which only we had
"bothered" to do.  Never assume that "common sense" is enough when people's
lives may be at stake.

I found this article in the newspaper last week.  It's obvious that the story
describes an attempt to "fish for information" on us, but I would like to know
what questions you netters think these "census takers" might be asking.  The
simplest answer is that they are casing the joint to find out how many VCR's
and how much jewelry people own, when they are at home, etc.  But is there any
other data that would have less tangible risks?  SSNs, for example?

  Census imposters invading Cary, by Beverly Brown, Staff writer
  The News and Observer, Saturday, May 1, 1993, Page 7B [Abstracted by PGN]

Cary [NC] - Beware of nosy people at your door claiming to be census workers.
They probably aren't.  Police Chief David Fortson said several residents have
complained about people identifying themselves as census employees and
proceeding to ask questions.

Eighty legitimate census workers - carrying red, white and blue identification
cards - won't start going door-to-door until May 20, when the town begins
conducting a special census.  Cary, at odds with the Census Bureau over the
town's 1990 census, commissioned a special head-count last year.  The latest
census says the fast-growing town has a few more than 43,000 residents.  But
the town estimates that at least 48,000 people call Cary home.  At stake are
millions of dollars in state funding, allocated on the basis of population.
For a new count, which will involve a week-long canvass, census workers will
limit their questions to name, age, race, sex, national origin and
relationship to the homeowner.

Fortson said the imposters most likely are opportunists, using public
knowledge about the town's forthcoming count as a chance to fish for
information.  "There are all kinds of things going on in terms of scams," he
said.  "Perhaps this is another way for folks to pull off a scam.  I just
don't know."

Subject: Computer Problem reveals tax details

"The Scotsman", 6th May, reports an incident affecting possibly as many
as "a couple of thousand" households in East Kilbride, near Glasgow.
Residents have received information on council tax rebates (for low 
income and invalidity benefit claimants) relating to their neighbours.

Apparently, the computer "broke down" midway through printing the 900,000
bills being issued, and after the computer was restarted, the problem
occurred. Apparently, the rebate information on the FRONT of the bill was
correct, but that the calculation on the BACK related to the next
household (apparently the bills are issued in order of address). 

Presumably, when the computer crashed, it ejected one half-printed bill, and
proceeded to pair the front and back pages wrongly for the remainder of the
run.

A council official said that most families would not be directly
identified [though if you know that they live next door....]. The only 
names in bills would be those of "non-dependents" such as lodgers.

In the April 1993 issue of the MIT Information Systems magazine there is a
description of a videoconferencing system.  Apparently, in a multi-site
conference, each site must call a bridge, or hub, which then acts as the
traffic controller for transmission to and from the participating sites. The
risk is in the bridge design:

  The bridge relies on voice activation to determine which site to show
  more or less on the principle that whoever talks the loudest gets seen"

Does this system contravene the Americans with Disabilities Act? I never
knew that lung power would some day make me more visible.

This text was forwarded to me by a friend and professional colleague in the
UK. I am dismayed that this type of activity is being condoned by an American
Governmental Agency. I can only hope that this operation is shut down and the
responsible parties are reprimanded.  I am extremely disturbed by the thought
that my tax money is being used for, what I consider, unethical, immoral and

AIS BBS Capture log.
 
To:  all interested parties, especially Americans who may wish to ask
relevant questions of relevant people.
 
Capture log from a BBS that claims to be run by the US Treasury Department,
Bureau of the Public Debt. Notice - I have not verified that the US government
is actually running this BBS, only that the BBS claims that it is.
 
The capture was made live. I have cut out parts where the same area was
visited twice, and the information is identical. Also cut out, is any
information that could lead to the caller being identified, as the caller
wishes to retain privacy. If indeed this is being run by the US Government,
the caller would not wish to be harassed by that organisation.
 
Also omitted are the "More" prompts for paging the display. And, after the
first few displays of the main menu, some of those have also been omitted for
brevity.
 
The file 27-ASM.ZIP was downloaded, to check that there really were source
codes. In fact, there were mostly recompilable disassemblies, some good, some
bad. I've included, at the end of this file, the beginning of 512.ASM, a
disassembly of Number of the Beast. But I've only included the header, the
first couple of instructions (discover Dos version) and the end (the '666').
All the meat of the code, I've omitted for brevity, and because this capture
is likely to become publicly available.

: The pyramids are a poor example to bring into the argument about manned 
: space exploration.  They cost more than just money.

It's not just cost.  After all, manned space exploration costs more than just
money, too.  It's that, with a few thousand years of hindsight, pyramids
*were* a remarkably stupid thing to do with those resources.  If I thought
that manned space flight was "like" building the pyramids, I'd immediately say
"flush it".  I mean, was it *really* sensible to build those structures, when
the only thing that the heirs of all this effort find practical to do with it
is to mine the dressing stones from the surface, recover the burial goods, and
promote tourism income?

Hmmmmmm.  Do you suppose there were those who said "well, just look at the
technological spinoffs!  We now can pile large stone slabs up with joints you
can't fit a knife into!  We can build structures of enormous size with
incredibly accurate right angles!"?

Bogus then.  Bogus now.

Don't get me wrong, I don't suppose that there are no adequate justifications
for manned space exploration.  It's just that the argument that "it'll turn
out to be just as good an investment as the pyramids" is a remarkably poor
one, roughly like saying that "He's evewy bit as good a wabbit hunter as Elmer
Fudd."

So what's the computer risk here?  Perhaps the oldest of them all.  The risk
of being impressed by spinning tape drives or blinking lights or neat rows of
numbers on printout.  Which is, after all, a variant of the very human risk of
being impressed by appearance rather than substance.

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological (esp.
neurological) conditions induced by playing video games (e.g., Nintendo).
Apparently, there have been reported several cases of "photosensitive
epilepsy", due to the flashing of some patterns and the strong attention of
the (young) players.  One poster to comp.risks reported some action from the
British Government.

A quick search in a database reported the following two published
references:

1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473
2. TK Daneshmend et al., Dark Warrior epilepsy, BMJ 1982; 284:1751-2.

I would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail) any reference to
(preferably published) further work on the subject.  Any pointer to other
information and/or to possible technical tools (if any) for reducing the risks
are appreciated.

Many thanks,

&gt;A contribution to RISKS (14.56) once again repeats the propaganda that it is
&gt;only through human cleverness and ingenuity that complex space missions are
&gt;saved. That is sheer propaganda.

Even though I'm personally in favor of sending men into space, I don't
think they are required or desirable for every mission, and this recent
example just cited, if anything, is hardly a strong case in favor of manned
missions.  Think: if you hadn't had the men there to bump the plastic part
and break it in the first place, you wouldn't have had any problem that
needed a man to fix.  You also need to be careful not to read too much
into the "cleverness/ingenuity" issues: a man on the ground could have
been just as clever and directed a fairly simple robot arm to insert
the felt tip pen.  There are examples where having a man there saved the
mission, but this wasn't one of them, and economically you'd be a lot
farther ahead if you had twice as many unmanned missions (costing half
as much) even if 25% of them did fail.

If you want some hard facts, consider the amount that we have spent
recently trying to get a working toilet, and how much time was spent
trying to fix it.  Without men there, you don't need toilets.

Direct mail marketers are, of course, interested in "targeting" their mailings
to recipients in known categories such as Porsche owners or toad collectors.
I have long felt that if you request that the Direct Marketing Association put
your name on the "no unsolicited material" database, you would eventually be
categorized as a person interested in privacy issues and mailbox pollution.

From the front page of "Computing", a weekly UK newspaper, 6 May 1993:

  China executes hacker over #122,000 [UK pounds] theft

  The Chinese government said this week it had executed convicted hacker
  Shi Biao as a warning to others that computer crime does not pay.
  Biao, who worked as an accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China,
  embezzled more that #122,000 [UK pounds] over three months in 1991 by
  forging bank-deposit slips.  He was caught when he and an accomplice tried
  to transfer some of the money to the province of Shenzhen in southern China.

I think that if the owner of a phone line wanted to communicate with sexually
explicit services (whether 900 numbers or anything else), he or she should be
required to request, in writing, that those services be enabled.  (Hey, the
phone company could charge for the service!)  If you've got kids and don't
want to talk dirty on the phone yourself, you do nothing.  If you don't have
kids, then you can sign up.  If you have kids and sign up, then it is up to
you to deal with keeping your kids out of it.  But the bottom line would be
that services would be obligated to reject calls from any line that had not
explicitly requested access to such services.

&gt;In my opinion, they were trying to blame technology for a social problem...

There are technological issues here.  My own son got involved with
one of these "services" recently, and am glad to hear that others are
upset about it.  A couple of points:

(1) When you call this supposedly free 800-number, you don't have
    to "leave your phone number", the company gets it automatically
    when you call.  You get a recorded number telling you to hang up.
    You then get an automatic, collect callback.

(2) The callback apparently doesn't require any explicit response to
    enable the collect call.  If you stay on the line for more than
    a few seconds, you are charged.  There is no mention of
    how much the call will cost.

To answer your last question:

(1) There is nothing wrong with "talking about sex."  However, I
    do think that there is something wrong with adults describing
    explicit sex acts to a preteen child.  We do discuss sex with our
    kids, and assume that they discuss it with their friends (in terms
    rather different than we do with them :-) ), but I certainly
    wouldn't take any of them to a hardcore porno movie.

(2) There is pretty much a consensus in our society that children should
    not have free access to sexually explicit materials.  I may be
    overstating this, but consider what would happen to an "adult"
    bookstore owner who sold materials to minors (or at least young
    minors).  I feel that anyone distributing such materials, whether
    in a store, by mail, or electronically, has the obligation to take
    reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient is of "reasonable" age.

(3) We will take responsibility for what our son knew he was doing.
    called, that we (and he) will take responsibility for.  (He called some
    other, regular long distance numbers with recorded messages, and has
    repaid us for them.) However, I am not happy about this end run around
    900-number blocking that turns a supposedly-free phone call into a
    charged call. 

(The company in question did eliminate the charge, by the way, when
informed that they had made a collect, obscene phone call to a minor
child.  I kind of wish that they hadn't been so accommodating.  I was
ready to make a very big stink.)

An interesting side effect to all of this.  Since our little incident, I
have been getting some very unusual mail, not even in a "pain brown
wrapper."  I had never realized that calling a 1-800 number could put
you onto a mailing list!

According to the "Newstrack" in CACM (2/93; p.13), IFIP has adopted a
resolution condemning the production, distribution, and use of computer games
that demean human beings and advocate malicious behavior by the players.  The
resolution points to the growth of brutal war games, sexist games, and games
based on themes of racial, ethnic, or religious hatred.  The document states:
"IFIP appeals to everybody worldwide to censure harmful games, to raise
awareness of the issues involved, and to support only computer games that
respect human dignity."

(Does anyone know the origin of the issue within IFIP or whether a more
complete description exists.)

Everyone knows you're supposed to be VERY careful about not revealing your PIN
number for your ATM card.  How are you supposed to stop this new trick???  At
the Buckland Hills Mall, in Manchester CT, last week, some scam artists
installed a fake ATM machine.  They had negotiated with the Mall officers,
pretending to be Bank officials, and had gotten permission.  Apparently, they
even got the phone company to come in and lay down some lines.  Then, they
installed an ATM machine they had stolen.

It was programmed to read off the account numbers, remember the PIN as it was
typed, then claim some kind of error and refuse to give out money.  They left
the machine in the mall for a WEEK, collecting PINs, then they came back, took
it machine back to "repair", and have since printed up new cards, and have
been using the PINs to siphon off money.....

Why didn't I think of that??

  [New trick?  This is one of the oldest scams going, but it still recurs. PGN]

Any of you that use an automated telephone transaction system to do your
banking (or to make balance inquiries, etc.) may be interested in an
experience I had today.

I dialed in and was connected to a session in progress that belonged to
another user (who probably hung up after receiving whatever information he/she
requested). I immediately transferred all their money into my account...no
just kidding :) I would hate to think that might happen to me, especially
since some of these services allow you to move money around.

I would like to suggest to anyone using these type of services (including
voice-mail services) to back all the way out of the system before hanging up.
Some systems (like Aerospace voice-mail) allow you to disconnect via a
command, before hanging up, but many do not. My banking system does not allow
me to disconnect without hanging up, but it does allow me to back out of the
menus until I reach the main menu which prompts for user password before
proceeding. From now on I'm going to make sure I back out to that level before
hanging up.

Signed,

Could-have-been-rich.

   [Another old classic.  The TENEX undetected-hangup problem years ago had
   similar properties, leaving a dial-up port still active, waiting for the 
   next dial-up to randomly stumble upon a logged-in user session.  PGN]

Thu, 6 May 1993 19:24:06 EST
</i><PRE>

        Less than three weeks after the White House announced a controversial
initiative to secure the nation's electronic communications with
government-approved cryptography, newly released documents raise serious
questions about the process that gave rise to the administration's proposal.
The documents, released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, suggest that the
super-secret National Security Agency (NSA) dominates the process of
establishing security standards for civilian computer systems in contravention
of the intent of legislation Congress enacted in 1987.

        The released material concerns the development of the Digital
Signature Standard (DSS), a cryptographic method for authenticating the
identity of the sender of an electronic communication and for authenticating
the integrity of the data in that communication.  NIST publicly proposed the
DSS in August 1991 and initially made no mention of any NSA role in developing
the standard, which was intended for use in unclassified, civilian
communications systems.  NIST finally conceded that NSA had, in fact,
developed the technology after Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) filed suit against the agency for withholding relevant
documents.  The proposed DSS was widely criticized within the computer
industry for its perceived weak security and inferiority to an existing
authentication technology known as the RSA algorithm.  Many observers have
speculated that the RSA technique was disfavored by NSA because it was, in
fact, more secure than the NSA-proposed algorithm and because the RSA
technique could also be used to encrypt data very securely.

        The newly-disclosed documents -- released in heavily censored form at
the insistence of NSA -- suggest that NSA was not merely involved in the
development process, but dominated it.  NIST and NSA worked together on the
DSS through an intra-agency Technical Working Group (TWG).  The documents
suggest that the NIST-NSA relationship was contentious, with NSA insisting
upon secrecy throughout the deliberations.  A NIST report dated January 31,
1990, states that

     The members of the TWG acknowledged that the efforts
     expended to date in the determination of a public key
     algorithm which would be publicly known have not been
     successful.  It's increasingly evident that it is
     difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the concerns
     and requirements of NSA, NIST and the general public
     through using this approach.

        The civilian agency's frustration is also apparent in a July 21, 1990,
memo from the NIST members of the TWG to NIST director John W. Lyons.  The
memo suggests that "national security" concerns hampered efforts to develop a
standard:

     THE NIST/NSA Technical Working Group (TWG) has held 18
     meetings over the past 13 months.  A part of every
     meeting has focused on the NIST intent to develop a
     Public Key Standard Algorithm Standard.  We are
     convinced that the TWG process has reached a point where
     continuing discussions of the public key issue will
     yield only marginal results.  Simply stated, we believe
     that over the past 13 months we have explored the
     technical and national security equity issues to the
     point where a decision is required on the future
     direction of digital signature standards.

An October 19, 1990, NIST memo discussing possible patent issues surrounding
DSS noted that those questions would need to be addressed "if we ever get our
NSA problem settled."

        Although much of the material remains classified and withheld from
disclosure, the "NSA problem" was apparently the intelligence agency's demand
that perceived "national security" considerations take precedence in the
development of the DSS.  From the outset, NSA cloaked the deliberations in
secrecy.  For instance, at the March 22, 1990, meeting of the TWG, NSA
representatives presented NIST with NSA's classified proposal for a DSS
algorithm.  NIST's report of the meeting notes that

     The second document, classified TOP SECRET CODEWORD, was
     a position paper which discussed reasons for the
     selection of the algorithms identified in the first
     document.  This document is available at NSA for review
     by properly cleared senior NIST officials.

In other words, NSA presented highly classified material to NIST justifying
NSA's selection of the proposed algorithm -- an algorithm intended to protect
and authenticate unclassified information in civilian computer systems.  The
material was so highly classified that "properly cleared senior NIST
officials" were required to view the material at NSA's facilities.

        These disclosures are disturbing for two reasons.  First, the process
as revealed in the documents contravenes the intent of Congress embodied in
the Computer Security Act of 1987.  Through that legislation, Congress
intended to remove NSA from the process of developing civilian computer
security standards and to place that responsibility with NIST, a civilian
agency.  Congress expressed a particular concern that NSA, a military
intelligence agency, would improperly limit public access to information in a
manner incompatible with civilian standard setting.  The House Report on the
legislation noted that NSA's

     natural tendency to restrict and even deny access to
     information that it deems important would disqualify
     that agency from being put in charge of the protection
     of non-national security information in the view of many
     officials in the civilian agencies and the private
     sector.

While the Computer Security Act contemplated that NSA would provide NIST with
"technical assistance" in the development of civilian standards, the newly
released documents demonstrate that NSA has crossed that line and dominates
the development process.

        The second reason why this material is significant is because of what
it reveals about the process that gave rise to the so- called "Clipper" chip
proposed by the administration earlier this month.  Once again, NIST was
identified as the agency actually proposing the new encryption technology,
with "technical assistance" from NSA.  Once again, the underlying information
concerning the development process is classified.  DSS was the first test of
the Computer Security Act's division of labor between NIST and NSA.  Clipper
comes out of the same "collaborative" process.  The newly released documents
suggest that NSA continues to dominate the government's work on computer
security and to cloak the process in secrecy, contrary to the clear intent of
Congress.

        On the day the Clipper initiative was announced, CPSR submitted FOIA
requests to key agencies -- including NIST and NSA -- for information
concerning the proposal.  CPSR will pursue those requests, as well as the
pending litigation concerning NSA involvement in the development of the
Digital Signature Standard.  Before any meaningful debate can occur on the
direction of cryptography policy, essential government information must be
made public -- as Congress intended when it passed the Computer Security Act.
CPSR is committed to that goal.

In Risks V14, No 58, an anonymous person submitted a claim from another
person, who also wished to remain anonymous, that a bulletin board calling
itself AIS BBS and claiming to be an official activity of the US Treasury
Department, exists and makes virus code available for downloads.  Our
anonymous poster apparently believes this -

&gt;I am dismayed that this type of activity is being condoned by an American
&gt;Governmental Agency. I can only hope that this operation is shut down and the
&gt;responsible parties are reprimanded.  I am extremely disturbed by the thought
&gt;that my tax money is being used for, what I consider, unethical, immoral and
&gt;possibly illegal activities.

I know that most of the people reading this list are a little paranoid about
risks, but this is ridiculous.  The anonymous submitter did not provide the
phone number of the BBS so there is no way we can check the claims, but, even
if it exists, does anyone seriously believe that it is being run by the
Treasury Department?  I fully believe that our government sometimes does
things that are stupid, immoral, and illegal, but this isn't the kind of
stupidity that they do.

In short, we need to be critical thinkers.  In addition, we need to think
about the way in which anonymous posting lets things like this get widely
disseminated without exposing the original poster to embarrassment and
ridicule.  The next hoax, lie, or distortion from an anonymous source may not
be this obvious.  Is the ability to anonymously make this kind of claim a
risk?

ACM Council issued the following statement on computer games a couple of
years ago.  I believe that, unfortunately, there has been no follow-up.

Barbara

  The pool of potential female and minority scientists and engineers
  remains virtually untapped, despite demographic trends pointing to the
  urgent need to train substantial new talent from these sectors.  There are
  products, such as computer games, which are the first significant
  introduction to technology for most young people.  Many girls and minority
  children do not identify with most of these products which are currently on
  the market.

  It is in society's best interest that these products attract and be
  accessible to these children.

  Through the appropriate mechanisms, ACM will form a proactive
  interest group which will address these concerns.

In regard to the questions about the value of space travel and pyramids,
nobody has mentioned the definitive words of the great engineer ( graphite and
pencil manufacturing) and philosopher H. Thoreau. They are:

	As for the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much
	as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend
	their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it
	would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and
	then given his body to the dogs. (from Walden)

In fact, the whole chapter called "Economy" is filled with such gems. One
more I just have to quote:
	Many are concerned about the monuments of the West and the East, -
	to know who built them. For my part, I should like to know who in
	those days did not build them, - who were above such trifling. But
	to proceed with my statistics.

[An ATM Trojan Horse of a Different Feather.  More on the fragmentary
report of Eric's...  PGN]

Excerpted from the Boston _Globe_ 12May93.  Yankee 24 is a New England ATM
network.  

                  "Fake ATM plays gotcha with users"

[AP] MANCHESTER, Conn. -- Some computer-literate thieves stole thousands of
dollars by setting up a bogus automatic teller machine in a mall and using it
to make counterfeit bank cards, authorities said.  The mobile machine, rolled
into the Buckland Hills Mall about two weeks ago dispensed money for a time,
but eventually ran out, said Manchester police spokesman Gary Wood.

While customers were using the machine, the ATM recorded their account numbers
and personal identification codes, authorities said.  The thieves then made
counterfeit band cards encoded with account information and used them to
withdraw money from ATMs in New York City operated by Citibank and Chemical
Bank.

About $3,000 in fraudulent withdrawals from the ATMs were discovered by late
Monday, said Richard L. Yanak, president of the Yankee 23 ATM network.  The
withdrawals were made from accounts based at three Hartford area banks.  ...

The bogus machine was once an authentic ATM that the thieves either stole of
acquired on the used market, Yanak said.  Unsuspecting customers were forced
to use the 5-foot machine after at least one of the mall's two legitimate ATMs
was sabotaged with glue-covered plastic cards.

The scam was uncovered when a local bank found that someone had tried seven or
eight times to use one of its bank cards at a New York ATM -- either because
of a problem with the card or because the thief tried to withdraw more than
the account's limit, Yanak said.

Officials never gave their direct permission to install the machine,
[Margaret] Steeves [Yankee 24's marketing director] said.  Police believe the
thieves returned to the mall on Sunday night or early Monday morning to
retrieve the machine.  Steeves said ATM customers are protected under federal
banking regulations, which limit their liability to $50 if their loss is
reported within 48 hours.

The new twist on the scam was that this "ATM machine" dispensed money.
According to the radio news report I heard yesterday, it gave out
"some cash to forestall suspicion that something was wrong."

Antonella Dalessandro asks for recent citations on pathological conditions
induced by playing video games.  Most of the articles I found in a Medline
search were about the use of video games as therapy (e.g. for schizophrenics
or the developmentally disabled) or in experimental use (e.g. assessing
reaction time or attention).  However, I did find two major articles on
video game pathology from 1990, and some followups and letters since.

TI  - Reflex seizures induced by calculation, card or board games, and
      spatial tasks: a review of 25 patients and delineation of the
      epileptic syndrome.
SO  - Neurology 1990 Aug;40(8):1171-6
AB  - Nine patients had reflex activation of seizures by calculation,
      card and board games, or spatial tasks. The common denominator
      for these and the 16 others reported in the literature appears to
      be activity related to function of the parietal lobe. The
      clinical and EEG findings in all 25 patients support the
      diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy. Seizures usually start
      during adolescence and consist of myoclonus, absences, and
      generalized convulsions. Specific inquiry about reflex activation
      should be carried out in patients with generalized epilepsy since
      this is rarely provided spontaneously. Attacks could be
      controlled satisfactorily in 89% of our patients. The genetic
      features are those of a primary generalized epileptic disorder
      without evidence for a specific inheritance of reflex
      sensitivity. Neuropsychological analysis of the stimuli points to
      parietal cortical dysfunction. These stimuli lead to activation
      of a generalized epileptic process analogous to the occipital
      cortical participation in the activation of generalized epileptic
      abnormality occurring in patients with photosensitive epilepsy.

TI  - Electroclinical study of video-game epilepsy.
SO  - Dev Med Child Neurol 1990 Jun;32(6):493-500
AB  - Seven patients (five boys, two girls) with video-game epilepsy
      (VGE) are reported, which reflects the fact that these games have
      increased in popularity recently among Japanese children. Their
      ages at onset ranged from four to 13 years. The seizure phenomena
      were of three types: generalised tonic-clonic, partial seizure
      and headache. Interictal physical and neurological examinations
      were within normal limits. EEGs taken while they played
      video-games confirmed the diagnosis of VGE and revealed three
      triggers of seizures: flashing lights, special figure patterns
      and scene-changing. They were recommended to avoid playing
      video-games, but sodium valproate was effective if seizures
      persisted even after such avoidance.

Stimulated by the "Cripple Clipper" Chip discussions, I invested some time to
investigate the European approach in this area. Mobile communication security
is practically available, since some time, in Western Europe based on some
technology which will now alsp be applied in Australia [see Roger Clarke: Risk
Forum 14.56). In contacts with people from producers, carriers and Telecom
research, I collected the following facts:

     - Dominated by Western European telecommunications enterprises, a
       CCITT subsidiary (CEPT=Conference Europeenne des Administrations des
       Postes et des Telecommunications; founded 1959, presently 26 European
       countries, mainly from Western/Northern Europe) formed a subgroup 
       (ETSI=European Telecommunications Standards Institute) which specified,
       in a special Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) the GSM standard (=Groupe
       Special Mobile). Presently, ETSI (planned as EEC's Standardisation
       Institute in this area) has 250 members from industry (63%), carrier
       (14%), government (10%), appliers and research (together 10%). Research
       here means essentially Telecom and related "research" institutes.

     - GSM documents specify roughly the functional characteristics including
       secure encryption of transmitted digital messages (see "European digital
       cellular telecommunication system (phase 2): Security Related Network 
       Functions"). Apart from protocols, details of algorithms are secret.

     - GSM contains 3 secret algorithms (only given to experts with established
       need-to-know, esp. carriers or manufacturers): 
           Algorithm A3: Authentication algorithm,  
           Algorithm A8: Cipher Key Generator (essentially a 1-way function), 
                         and 
           Algorithm A5: Ciphering/Deciphering algorithm (presently A5/1,A5/2).
       Used in proper sequence, this set of algorithms shall guarantee that
       NOBODY can break the encrypted communication.

     - Mobile stations are equipped with a chipcard containing A3 and A8, plus 
       an ASIC containing A5; the (non-mobile) base stations (from where the
       communication flows into the land-based lines) is equipped with an ASIC
       realising A5 encryption, and it is connected with an "authentication
       center" using (ASIC, potentially software based) A3 and A8 algorithms to
       authenticate the mobile participant and generate a session key.

     - When a secure communication is started (with the chipcard inserted in
       the mobile station), authentication of the mobile participant is 
       performed by encrypting the individual subscriber key Ki (and some
       random seed exchanged between the mobile and base station) with A3 and
       sending this to the base station where it is checked against the stored
       identity.  Length of Ki: 128 bit.
       
     - If authenticated, the individual subscriber key Ki (plus some random
       seed exchanged between mobile and basis station) is used to generate a
       session key Kc; length of Kc: 64 bit. Different from Clipper, a session 
       key may be used for more than one session, dependent on the setting of 
       a flag at generation time; evidently, this feature allows to minimize
       communication delays from the authentication process.

     - Using session key (Kc), the data stream (e.g. digitized voice) is en-
       crypted using the A5 algorithm and properly decrypted at base station.

     - A more complex authentication procedure including exchange of IMSI 
       (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) may be used to authenticate
       the subscriber and at the same time to generate the session key (using
       a combined "A38" algorithm) and transmit it back to the mobile station.

Comparing the European A5 approach with US' "Cripple Clipper Chip", I find
some surprising basic similarities (apart from minor technical differences,
such as key lengths and using ASICs only versus Chipcard in the mobile
station):

    1) Both approaches apply the "SbO Principle" (Security by Obscurity): "what
       outsiders don't know, is secure!" Or formulated differently: only 
       insiders can know whether it contains built-in trapdoors or whether it 
       is really secure!

    2) Both approaches aim at protecting their hemisphere (in the European
       case, including some interest spheres such as "down-under", to serve 
       the distinguished British taste:-) from other hemispheres' competition.

The most significant differences are:

    A) that US government tries to masquerade the economic arguments with some
       legalistic phrases ("protect citizen's privacy AND protect them against
       criminal misuse") whereas Western Europeans must not argue as everybody
       knows the dominance of EEC's economic arguments (and the sad situation
       of privacy in most EEC countries :-)

    B) that US government must produce the rather complex "escrow agencies"
       where European law enforcers must only deal with ETSI (manufacturers and
       carriers!) about reduced safety in "A5/n" algorithms (n=1,2,...).

Presently, different "A5/n" algorithms are discussed. Apart from the "secure"
original algorithm A5 (now labeled A5/1), a "less secure, export oriented
A5/2" has been specified (according to my source which may not be fully
informed, this will go to "down-under" :-). One argument for such "A5/n"
multiplicity is that availability of more A5/n algorithms may even allow to
select, during authentication, one algorithm from the set thus improving
security of communication; at the same time, as these algorithms are secret,
the secret automatic selection (e.g. triggered by some obscure function
similar to the random exchange in the authentication process) may allow to
crack the encrypted message.

My (contemporary) conclusion is that security of both A5 and CC is
questionable as long as their security cannot be assessed by independent
experts. In both cases, economic interests seem to play a dominant role; there
are clear indications of forthcoming economic "competition", and I wonder
which side Japan will take (maybe they decide to start their own crippled
SecureCom standard?)

       SECURITY AND CONTROL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
       An IFIP WG 9.6 Working Conference to explore the issues:
                          August 12 - 17, 1993
                                         
Venue: the conference ship M/S Ilich between Stockholm and St.Petersburg

Dependence on information technology (IT) is widespread. IT is used for the
option and control of a range of social, industrial, commercial, governmental
and regulatory processes, yet it introduces new potential threats to personal
privacy and freedom, and new opportunities for criminal activity.  These
dangers have to be countered and controlled in a manner that balances the
benefits of IT. Therefore careful consideration has to be given to determine
what constitutes the most effective control and regulation of IT.  Such topics
should be high on national agendas.
       
IFIP's Working Group on Information Technology Misuse and the Law (WG 9.6) is
holding a working conference to explore these issues, from 12 to 17 August,
aboard the conference ship M/S Ilich between Stockholm and St.Petersburg. On
the Saturday of the conference week the conference will convene in
St.Petersburg for meetings with Russian representatives, providing a valuable
opportunity to discuss some of the problems of IT in an emerging capitalist
economy.

The conference, Security and Control of Information Technology, will explore
major issues, including particular reference to Eastern European Economies.
The organisers are keen to attract people representing a wide range of
interests, including central government, regulatory bodies, information system
users, relevant public interest groups, the legal profession, and academics.
Participants from all parts of Europe and beyond will be welcome. In addition
to full conference papers there will be discussion groups and shorter
presentations.

Eur. Ing. Richard Sizer (UK), chairman of WG 9.6, is conference chairman, Dr.
Louise Yngstrom (Sweden) is in charge of local organisation and Prof. Martin
Wasik is chairman of the International Programme Committee.  The proceedings
will be published by Elsevier North Holland and edited by Ing. Sizer, Prof. M.
Wasik and Prof. R. Kaspersen (Netherlands).

Those desiring  to  attend  the  conference  and  requiring  further

Title: Digital Woes
Subtitle: Why we should not depend on software 
Author: Lauren Ruth Wiener
Publisher: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company 
ISBN: 0-201-62609-8 
Price: US $22.95 
245 pages, hardback

This is a highly entertaining and easily readable book on a subject which is
dear to all our hearts. Without stretching the technical knowledge of the
average reader in the slightest, the author has managed to present a
comprehensive account of the problems that beset modern software-based
systems.

She sets the scene in "Attack of the Killer Software", by presenting 13
incidents in which disaster was caused, or nearly caused, by the misbehaviour
of software, including Mariner 1, Apollo 11, the Patriot's Scud-chasing
problems, the Bank of New York glitch, Therac-25, the ozone-layer fiasco, and
a few others.

If these sound familiar to readers of RISKS, this is no coincidence. The
majority of the raw material was taken from its archives, so providing a handy
counter-example of the sensible use of computing equipment.

Chapter 2 "Why Does Software Have Bugs?" describes the basic causes of the
"Software Crisis" (except that the author points out in her conclusions that
there is really no such thing: it is simply in the nature of software to
contain bugs). I had a strong feeling of "deja vu" reading this chapter,
mainly because it would make a good set of revision notes for the 1st-year
undergraduates on the Software Engineering course that I teach. The author
describes very well the discontinuity of behaviour that makes digital systems
so treacherous compared to more conventional analogue systems. She makes the
points that software is always part of a larger system, and so subject to the
vagaries of the system environment, that it suffers from complex execution
paths, timing problems (which make it truly non-deterministic), and unforeseen
interactions due to its high level of connectivity in distributed systems.
(These latter problems are well illustrated with reference to the AT&amp;T
collapse of 1990.) The problems of novelty of design and the lack of
engineering discipline as applied to software (at least until recently) could
possibly have been given more attention, and it would have been good to see
the concept of programming as a subtractive exercise developed at greater
length.

The problem of resources is the subject of Chapter 3. This kicks off with the
classic 1979 US GAO study of 9 Federal Projects, and then goes on to
demonstrate that not much has changed, using a table of remarks quoted from a
1967 article in Fortune magazine set against similar statements from later
papers and articles from 1971 to 1991. Problems arising from the development
organisation (corporate hierarchies are not ideal organisational structures
for creating software), from the development process (getting the requirements
right, design, development, testing, "gutless estimation" of effort and
schedule and the resulting overruns), what passes for "maintenance" of
software, etc., are well covered, along with the value of prototyping, and an
account of the kind of "warranties" traditionally offered by software vendors
(i.e., disclaimers!).

Safety-critical systems are the subject of Chapter 4, with an account of the
applicable software engineering techniques, including the use of software
standards, formal specification and mathematical verification. The author is
not hopeful that any of these methods can "deliver the goods". Software
standards are more honoured in the breach than in the observance. There is the
eternal problem of whether to mandating aspects of the development process or
the resulting product. There is on evidence that the stipulated techniques
actually result in safer systems. (Indeed, some standards may be
counter-productive.) Formal specifications are difficult to write and usually
the domain experts cannot understand them. These problems have led (for
example) to Boeing specifying the 777 flight control system in English. Proof
of correctness is even more arduous and expensive, and may not detect
specification faults. The author cites the classic paper by De Millo, Lipton
and Perlis in support of these arguments, as well as the unhappy experience of
Ontario Hydro in attempting to prove one of their reactor shut-down systems
correct. Several formal methods specialists are quoted to the effect that
formalism alone is insufficient.

Certifying software engineers to work on safety-critical systems offers no
easy solution either, due largely to the lack of consensus on what core
curriculum should be studied in order to qualify. The main effect of requiring
certified personnel will be increased cost of software (and it will still have
bugs!).

The rest of the chapter introduces the basic concepts of risk analysis, 
including HAZOP, FMEA, FTA, etc., and discusses the use of redundancy and 
planned failure paths in fault-tolerant systems, so that they can "fail-safe" 
or "fail-soft". The author points out that, paradoxically, it is often the 
"safety" features of a system that lead to disaster. 

The author next deals with something that probably does not get the attention
it deserves as a topic in its own right in the average Software Engineering
course. This is the temptation to "think big" where software systems are
concerned, partly due to their ease of connection (since they are all
digital). Chapter 5 discusses the issues of connectivity at length, the use of
communications networks of various kinds (particularly multi-media), "data as
a commodity" and the attendant risks to privacy (e.g., from the misuse of
distributed databases) and other social implications of digital technology.
Distribution is cheap - security is expensive. The fact that digital
information is volatile raises various questions of authenticity.  What is the
value of a digitised signature? Which version of an electronic book is an
author's genuine work? How can electronic voting affect the democratic
process? (Answer: badly!) Is a digitally recorded video admissible as evidence
in court, or could it have been skilfully forged? How do computer generated
simulations of an accident influence a jury?

The tendency to do everything-"by-wire" is well covered (fly-, sail-, drive-,
etc.) and the opportunity this provides for the introduction of massive
control systems, such as GPS navigation, the Advanced Automation System for
air traffic control, and the proposals for even more radical Advanced Vehicle
Control Systems running "platoons" of cars at 90mph with 10 inches separation
between the bumpers. Needless to say, the author is less than enthusiastic
about most of these proposals. In the meantime, Thailand is setting up a
central database to record all essential information about all of its 55
million inhabitants, and has received an award from the Smithsonian for its
efforts.

In the final chapter the author summarises her argument and proposes seven
questions that we should ask about any proposed system, starting with "Do we
need it?". We should counterbalance the enthusiasm for big technical projects
by asking: "Is it the right system?", "What is at risk when (not if) it goes
wrong?", "How big and complex will it have to be?", "How will it fit in with
what already exists?", "What will it require of its users?", "Will it require
extensive security?", "Is there a back-up?".

She also makes two "modest proposals" for projects which would be a sensible
use of resources: the "Educational Software Foundation" and "Congress
On-line". The first would inject funds into the exploitation of computing
power to educate children, taking advantage of the possibilities of
interactive graphical systems and virtual reality. The second would
decentralise Congress, so that the lawmakers could live among their
constituents, and conduct business by computer bulletin board.  Washington,
D.C., would be redundant: no more big expenses, no crowds of fat-cats lobbying
for big corporations! (The only slight objection I had here was that lobbying
by e-mail would be just as easy as law-making by e-mail.)

I do not know how much computers are already available in US schools, but
certainly many schools in the UK are making good use of them at all levels of
primary and secondary education, thanks largely to the imaginative initiative
by the BBC in conjunction with Acorn. There is also the Nuffield mathematics
project. Of course, the use of computers is uneven, as is funding for other
aspects of education.

Trying to place the second proposal in a UK context, I was unable to imagine 
many British MPs being willing to give up their perks (not to mention the 
opportunity for a bit of toe-sucking on the quiet! :-) for a life in front 
of a computer terminal in the Orkneys. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal would 
presumably have to find another way of justifying their daily attendance 
allowance, and I doubt that logging in to read their e-mail would suffice. 
Precisely how the Queen's speech would be handled, and what the electronic 
equivalent of Black Rod would be, I leave to more imaginative readers! :-) 

As will be seen from this synopsis, the author's tone is sceptical throughout.
She has little patience with misplaced enthusiasm for grandiose schemes in the
field of IT. One by one, they all take a hammering; in some cases, such as the
Strategic Defence Initiative, several hammerings. Most of the well-known
software disasters of recent years make their appearance at some point. The
author's message is that we have choices about what systems we implement, that
these choices will fundamentally affect the quality of our lives, and should
be made with our eyes open to the disadvantages as well as the potential
gains.

As a step in educating the lay public in the social issues of information 
technology, the book is excellent, and should be required reading in any 
foundation course on software engineering, or any course with a title such 
as "Computers and Society". 

The level of difficulty is just about right for the non-technical reader.  The
style is witty and the pace is maintained. At the same time, the book is
scholarly, and all technical points or disaster stories in the text are
supported by notes and references at the end of each chapter. The specialist
reader will find it useful as a source of references to more technical
descriptions.

There is a glossary of computing terms with some good explanations. 
The definition of a "system" as a "set of systems ..." in order to emphasise 
its recursive nature struck me as being particularly neat. The remark in 
the definition of "natural language" that (because of the difficulty of 
teaching natural language to a computer) "It is hard to avoid the conclusion 
that children have special wiring." is a nice example of the humour of the 
book. 

As far as I could judge, the descriptions of disasters are accurate. The
author avoids urban myths (e.g., she gives a good account of the loss of
Mariner, on which misleading information is extremely persistent). There are
technical inaccuracies, however.

The author is wrong in several places about my favourite aeroplane. For
example (p.17), the Airbus which was downed as a result of the Vincennes'
crew's inability to read a timetable fast enough, and Aegis' inability to
report whether it was climbing or descending, was either an A300 or an A310,
but definitely not an A320. Software (p.25) does *not* take the place of the
hydraulics on the A320 and other aircraft of its generation. The control
surfaces are still (mostly) moved hydraulically, although the signals to the
hydraulic actuators are electrical, and are output by the computers in the
Electrical Flight Control System (EFCS). (This mistake is repeated on p.87.)
She also confuses the functions of the EFCS and the Flight Management and
Guidance System in the same paragraph.

The end-of-chapter note states that on the A320, there is one small control
surface on each wing under the pilot's direct control. This might have come
from the reference cited (Stix, Gary: "Along for the Ride?", Scientific
American, July 1991, pp. 94-106), but in any case it is wrong. The "manual
back-up" in the event of total EFCS failure consists of pitch control by
movement of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer using the trim wheels, and
control of direction using the rudder, which can be moved directly by pedals.

In some places, the need to address a lay audience has led to
oversimplification of a technical point. For example, in the discussion of
fly-by-wire (p.88), it is stated that the "safe flight envelope" is defined as
"the limits of structural integrity of the aircraft". There is lot more to it
than that.

The description of the Shuttle computer architecture on p.30 is a bit
confusing, and is not helped by the use of "operational" where what is meant
is obviously "fail-operational". Also, I was left wondering if "fail-safe" and
"fail-operational" had been applied correctly.

The description of digital representation on p.44 is confused by the fact that
the binary pattern "0100011" is mistakenly described as the representation of
the number "67" instead of "35".

Analogue images (p.154), like digital images, possess only finite resolution.

Just to be really pedantic, I doubt that Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of
Lovelace, ever referred to herself as "Ada Lovelace" (p.16)! :-)

I found myself objecting to one or two of the definitions. I have always
understood a "patch" to be a modification to executable code, not a hasty
modification to source code. Also a "bug" is defined as "Behaviour on the part
of a computer program ..." and "failure" as "An inability of some part of a
system ...". The standard usage is that a "bug" is a "latent fault", i.e., a
*state* of the system, and a "failure" is an *event* in which a system does
not perform a required function (one of the causes of which may be the
"activation" of a bug).

A glossary of acronyms would be a useful addition. I could only guess from the
context that "UPS" is a parcel delivery service, and the only words I could
attach to "VPL" were "Visible Panty Line", though this might have been due to
the proximity of a passage describing the potential pornographic uses of
virtual reality! :-)

These minor criticisms do not detract from the overall value of the book. 

To the author's two "modest proposals" in Chapter 6, I would like to add a
third of my own. Before the number of safety-critical software-based systems
exceeds the number of inhabitants of Thailand, could we not set up a central
database (either one international one, or several national ones) on which to
register these and record their dependability in service? To those who object
to the effort involved, I would say: how much effort did it take to register
every computer in the UK which holds confidential personal information, as
required by the Data Protection Act? Are we prepared to do as much to protect
our safety as to protect our privacy?

"Terminal Compromise" was first published in 1991, and was enthusiastically
promoted by some among the security community as the first fictional work to
deal realistically with many aspects of data communications and security.
Although still available in that form, recently is has been "re-issued" in a
softcopy "shareware" version on the net.  (It is available for ftp at such
sites as ftp.uu.net, ftp.netsys.com, soda.berkeley.edu and
wuarchive.wustl.edu.  Use archie to look for TERMCOMP.)  Some new material has
been added, and some of the original sections updated.  Again, it has been
lauded in postings on security related newsgroups and distribution lists.
 
Some of you may be old enough to recall that the characters current in
"Outland" sprang from a previous Berke Breathed cartoon strip called "Bloom
County".  Opus, at one point, held the post of movie reviewer for the "Bloom
County Picayune".  I remember that one of his reviews started out, "This movie
is bad, really bad, abominably bad, bad, bad, bad!"  He considers this for a
moment, and then adds, "Well, maybe not *that* bad, but Lord! it wasn't good!"
 
A fairly large audience will probably enjoy it, if such trivialities as
language, characterization and plot can be ignored.  For once the "nerds"
don't get beat on; indeed, they are the heroes (maybe).  The use of computers
is much more realistic than in most such works, and many ideas that should
have greater currency are presented.  The book will also appeal to paranoiacs,
especially those who believe the US federal government is out to get them.
 
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds -- but it does make for a
smoother "read".  "Terminal Compromise" would benefit from a run through a
style checker ... and a grammar checker ... and a spelling checker.
Constructions such as "which was to be the hypocenter of the blast if the
Enola Gay hadn't missed its target" and "National Bureau of Standards which
sets standards" are understandable, although awkward.  In other places it
appears words might be missing, and you have to read over sentences several
times to puzzle out the meaning.  (The softcopy/shareware version comes off a
little worse here, with fragments of formatting codes left in the text.)
 
On second thought, forget the spelling checker.  Most of the words are spelled
correctly: they are simply *used* incorrectly.  A reference to an "itinerant
professional" has nothing to do with travelling.  (Maybe he meant
"consummate": I couldn't think of a synonym starting with "i".)  The "heroine"
trade was probably intended to refer to white powder rather than white
slavery.  There are two automobile "wreak"s.  "Umbrage" is used twice.  An
obscure seventeenth century usage did once refer to shelter given by islands
to a harbour, but it's stretching the language a bit to make it refer to a
covering for the naughty bits.  Umbrage usually refers to offence, suspicion,
doubt or rage, as in "I take umbrage at what I suspect is a doubtful use of
the language".
 
Characterization?  There isn't any.  The major characters are all supposed to
be in their forties: they all, including the President of the United States,
speak like unimaginative teenage boys whose vocabulary contains no adjectives
other than obscenities.  This makes it difficult at times to follow the
dialogue, since there are no distinctives between speakers.  (The one
exception is the president of a software firm who makes a successful, although
surprising, translation from "beard" to "suit", and is in the midst of the
most moving and forceful speech in the book, dealing with our relationship to
computers, when the author has him assassinated.)
 
The book is particularly hard on women.  There are no significant female
characters.  None.  In the initial introduction and background of the hero
there is no mention of a significant other.  It is something of a shock later
to discover he is married, then that he is divorced.  Almost all of the
females are simply bedroom furniture.  The portrayals remind one of the
descriptions in "Don Quixote" of women "so gay, striking and beautiful that
the sight of her impressed them all; so vividly that, if they had not already
seen [the others], they would have doubted whether she had her match for
beauty".
 
Which raises another point.  All of the hackers, except some of the Amsterdam
crew, are fit, athletic and extremely attractive to the female of the species.
Even among the I-Hack crowd, while there may be some certifiable lunatics,
nobody is unkempt or unclean.  These urbane sophisticates drink "Glen Fetitch"
and "Chevas" while lounging in "Louis Boston" suits on "elegant ... PVC
furniture".  Given that the hackers save the day (and ignoring, for the
moment, that they caused the trouble in the first place) there seems to be
more than a touch of wish fulfillment involved.
 
(Schwartau tries to reiterate the "hackers aren't evil" point at every
opportunity.  However, he throws away opportunities to make any distinctions
between different types of activities.  Although the different terms of
phreaks, hackers and crackers are sprinkled throughout the story they are not
well defined as used by the online community.  At one point the statement is
made that "cracking is taking the machine to its limit".  There is no
indication of the divisions between phreaks, hackers and crackers within their
various specialties, nor the utter disdain that all three have for virus
writers.  Cliff Stoll's "Hanover (sic) Hacker", Markus Hess, is described as a
"well positioned and seemingly upstanding individual".  This doesn't jibe with
Stoll's own description of a "round faced, slightly overweight ... balding ...
chain smoking" individual who was "never a central figure" with the Chaos
Computer Club, and who, with a drug addict and a fast buck artist for partners
"knew that he'd screwed up and was squirming to escape".)
 
What little character is built during the story is unsteady.  The author seems
unable to decide whether the chief computer genius is one of the good guys or
the bad.  At times he is mercenary and self-centred; at others he is poetic,
eloquent and visionary; in yet other scenes he is mentally unbalanced.  (He
also appropriates the persona and handle of another hacker.  We are never told
why, nor are we ever informed of what happened to the original.)  Following
the characters isn't made any easier by the inconsistency of naming: in the
space of five paragraphs we find that our hero, Scott Byron Mason (maybe) is
the son of Marie Elizabeth Mason and Louis Horace Mason.  Or possibly Evelyn
Mason and Horace Stipton Mason.  The main academic studying viral programs is
Dr. Les (or Arnold) Brown (or Sternman) who is a professor at Sheffield (or
MIT).  (Interestingly, there is an obvious attempt to correct this in the
later "softcopy" version of the book.  At times the "corrections" make the
problem worse.)
 
For a "thriller", there is very little tension in the story.  The unveiling of
the plot takes place on a regular step by step basis.  There is never any hint
that the hero is in the slightest personal danger: the worst that happens is
that one of his stories is quashed.  Indeed, at the end of the book the
computer attacks seem basically all to have succeeded, credit card companies
are bankrupt, banks are in a mess, airlines are restricted, phone systems are
unreliable and the bad guys are in charge.  Yet our heroes end up rich and
happy on an island in the sun.  The author seems to be constantly sounding the
alarm over the possibility of this disaster, but is unwilling, himself, to
face the tremendous personal suffering that would be generated.
 
Leaving literary values aside, let us examine the technical contents.  The
data security literate will find here a lot of accurate information.  Much of
the material is based on undisputed fact; much of the rest brings to light
some important controversies.  We are presented with a thinly disguised
"Windows", a thinly disguised Fred Cohen (maybe two?), a severely twisted
Electronic Freedom Foundation, and a heavily mutated John Markoff.  However,
we are also presented with a great deal of speculation, fabrication and
technical improbabilities.  For the technically adept this would be
automatically disregarded.  For the masses, however (and this book seems to
see itself in an educational light), dividing the wheat from the chaff would
be difficult if not impossible.
 
As with names, the author appears to have problems with the consistency of
numbers.  In the same paragraph, the softcopy version has the same number
quoted as "over 5000", "almost 5000" and "three thousand".  (It appears to
have been "corrected" or updated from the original version without reading the
context).  A calculation of the number of hackers seems to be based upon
numbers pulled out of the air, and a computer population an order of magnitude
larger than really exists.  The "network", seemingly referring to the
Internet, has a population two orders of magnitude too large.  Four million
legal copies, with an equal number of pirate copies, of a virus infected
program apparently result in only "between 1 and 5 million" infections.  (I
*knew* a lot of people had bought Windows but never used it!)  Not the most
prolific virus we've ever seen.
 
Schwartau seems uncertain as to whether he wants to advertise real software or
hide it.  At various times the characters, incessantly typing to each other
across the (long distance) phone lines use "xtalk" (the actual filename for
Crosstalk), "ProCom" (ProComm, perhaps?), "ComPro" and "Protalk".  They also
make "4800 BAUD" connections (technically unlikely over voice grade lines, and
even if he meant "bits per second" 4800 is rather an odd speed) and
communicate with "7 bits, no parity, no stop bits" parameter settings.  (The
more common parameter settings are either 8 bits, no parity or 7 bits, even
parity.  You *must* have stop bits, usually one.  And to forestall the obvious
criticism, there is no indication in the book that a "non-standard" setting is
being used for security reasons.)
 
We are, at places in the text, given detailed descriptions of the operations
of some of the purported viral programs.  One hides in "Video RAM".  Rather a
stupid place to hide since any extensive video activity will overwrite it.
(As I recall, the Proto-T hoax, which was supposed to use this same mechanism,
started in 1991.  Hmmm.)  Another would erase the disk the first time the
computer was turned on, which leads one to wonder how it was supposed to
reproduce.  (This same program was supposed to be able to burn out the printer
port circuitry.  Although certain very specific pieces of hardware may fail
under certain software instructions, no printer port has ever been numbered
among them.)  One "hidden file" is supposed to hide itself by looking like a
"bad cluster" to the system.  "Hidden" is an attribute in MS-DOS, and
assignable to any file.  A "bad cluster" would not be assigned a file name and
therefore would never, by itself, be executed by any computer system.  We also
have a report of MS-DOS viri wiping out a whole town full of Apple computers.
 
Schwartau is not averse to making up his own virus terminology, if necessary.
("Stealth" is also reported as a specific virus.)  At one point the book
acknowledges that viral programs are almost invariably detected within weeks
of release, yet the plot relies upon thousands of viri remaining undetected
for years.  At another point the use of "radio broadcasts" of viral programs
to enemy systems is advocated, ignoring the fact that the simplest error
checking for cleaning "noise" from digital radio transmissions would eliminate
such activity.
 
A number of respected security experts have expressed approval of "Terminal
Compromise".  This approbation is likely given on the basis that this book is
so much better than other fictional works whose authors have obviously had no
technical background.  As such the enthusiasm is merited: "Terminal
Compromise" raises many important points and issues which are currently lost
on the general public.
 
Unfortunately, the problems of the book, as a book, and the technical excesses
will likely restrict its circulation and impact.  As a fictional work the lack
of literary values are going to restrict both its appeal and longevity.  As an
exhortative or tutorial work, the inability to distinguish between fact and
fiction will reduce its value and effectiveness in promoting the cause of data
security.

From the Boston Globe of Friday, 3 Dec 1993:

What "The Who's Tommy" needed yesterday was a computer wizard, not a pinball
wizard.  Last night's opening Boston performance of the high-tech musical was
canceled because several computers required to stage the show suffered
technical difficulties as a result of being shipped to the Colonial Theatre
from Louisville, where the production completed a one-week run on Sunday. ...
"Touring is apparently being more funky on the computers than anyone
anticipated," David Balsom, the show's local press representative, lamented
last night.  ...

The attached article is from The Independent, 9 Dec 1993.  This is the first I
have heard of such a scheme here in the UK, but would not be at all surprised
if similar schemes already exist elsewhere (you would not expect to find such
information from a press conference!).

I was particularly "interested" in the paragraph:

  The key to the card's security lies in the Japanese-developed technology
  and microchip. NatWest and Midland said that a technical breakthrough had
  made it impossible to counterfeit cards.

and look forward to the reactions of RISKS' readers.

TIME FOR A TOP-UP: MONDEX FACES A YEAR-LONG TRIAL, BEGINNING IN SWINDON IN
1995.

NATWEST IS RUNNING THE PROJECT IN CONJUNCTION WITH MIDLAND AND
BRITISH TELECOM.

BANKS STEP UP WAR ON CASH WITH PLASTIC CARD THAT CAN BE TOPPED UP BY PHONE 

EVEN STREET VENDORS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE NEW ELECTRONIC MONEY, SAY ITS
MAKERS. 

Nicholas Bannister reports on Mondex

NATIONAL Westminster Bank has developed an alternative to cash - a plastic
card with a microchip which stores "electronic money" and can be topped up
over the phone.  Yesterday it revealed plans for a year-long trial of Mondex,
its electronic money system, starting in Swindon in 1995. The pilot project,
in conjunction with Midland Bank and British Telecom is likely to involve
about 10,000 people, mainly bank customers and retailers.

The system lets customers add money to their card by using adapted cash
dispensers or phones to access their accounts. Once charged with money, the
card becomes the equivalent of cash.  Payments are made by slipping the card
into a retailer's terminal. The sum is transferred from the card to the
retailer without need for time-consuming authorisations or signatures.
Provided there is enough money on the card, the transaction will take place.

Payments between individuals are carried out by inserting the card into a
pocket-sized electronic wallet and making six keystrokes. Both customers and
retailers can deposit electronic money into their bank accounts over the
phone.

Bert Morris, NatWest's deputy group chief executive, said that cash was still
used for 90 per cent of all transactions in the United Kingdom, and that
handling cash cost the banks more than #4.5 billion a year. He claimed that
widespread use of Mondex would not lead to staff cuts and branch closures.  Mr
Morris, who is also on the Department of Social Security board, said that
social security fraud could be reduced if the Mondex system was used for
payments.

Tim Jones, one of the two NatWest executives who came up with the Mondex
concept, said the card was not intended to replace traditional debit and
credit cards. The system was designed for small and large payments. Small
traders, for example a newspaper vendor, could have a battery-powered
terminal.  He claimed that it was safer, quicker and more convenient to handle
electronic rather than physical money. But if a Mondex card was lost or
stolen, the money on it would be lost in the same way as money in a missing
wallet.

However, cards could be locked to prevent unauthorised use by tapping in a
four-digit personal code. Once locked, the money could not be spent without
re-entering the code.  He said initially cash dispensers would be adapted to
give customers the choice between drawing physical or electronic money. But
the telephone would be the most important access point.

BT was planning to adapt its pay phones, and special phones for home use were
being designed. Customers would insert the card into the phone triggering an
automatic call to the bank's computer system. After a prompt, the customer
would tap in his personal identification number and transfer money from his
account to the card or vice-versa.  "Our strategy is that in 10 to 15 years
time, we will see the phone as the dominant way in which electronic money is
drawn and deposited," Mr Jones said.

Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said: "Although Mondex will be
launched in the UK, it is a major commercial, opportunity for banks
everywhere. Mondex is a multi-currency product, capable of holding five
separate currencies on a card simultaneously."  He said that other British and
foreign banks would be invited to join Mondex in due course to create a "truly
global payment scheme".  The British Retail Consortium said that the
convenience, security, flexibility and potential for development should ensure
customer acceptance of Mondex. Its director general, James May, said: "If
successful, the Mondex trial should give UK shoppers a better way of paying,
and provide retailers with benefits in this first step towards a cashless
society."

The key to the card's security lies in the Japanese-developed technology and
microchip. NatWest and Midland said that a technical breakthrough had made it
impossible to counterfeit cards.  But Mr Jones said that Mondex would have a
research budget "for ever" to keep ahead of the counterfeiters.

Notes From the Financial Sector of Cyberspace: How To Profit by Faking Out the
Market.

A good deal has been written lately on the ease, dangers, and risks of
spoofing (or counterfeiting) mail on the net. Stories of practical jokes and
character assassination abound. A similar but much more serious risk exists in
financial information networks.

My consulting work brings me in touch with some very large mutual fund
companies. Many of them have extensive network infrastructure to support
systems to quickly distribute news items from a variety of sources: Comtex,
Dow-Jones, Standard&amp;Poors, and others.

The delivery end of these systems work like a cross between rn and a
mail-reader: Story headlines are displayed (like mail "Subject:" lines), most
recent to least, with the body of the news story available on demand. The
headlines are constantly updated with fresh stories.

The news service is used by a variety of people: traders, portfolio managers,
commercial brokers, to name a few. Trading (sometimes very high-volume
trading) is quickly initiated based on the incoming news. Often the body of
the stories is never read; hot stories contain only a headline - if you take
the time to read the story, you've lost some or all of your opportunity.

The time-dependence of the incoming news is striking. The traders act
immediately on the incoming information; their 'edge' is the timeliness of the
news. It enables them to exploit short-lived opportunities. In that business,
information goes stale and becomes useless very quickly, sometimes in a matter
of minutes.  The news source is trusted. Verifying stories is not a top
priority.
 
With the proper access to the hub machines and a little understanding, news
stories can be faked. Just as email can be spoofed with the popular port 25
Unix hack, a story which didn't originate at a legitimate news source can be
injected into the flow. Given that the news wire is the trader's primary
window into the marketplace, one could create a phantom in that window, one
with predictable effects: "Bill Gates Dies of Heart Attack"... (perhaps just
prior to selling short on Microsoft).

Now the risky part: my experience to date is that many of the hub machines,
servers, and subnets involved are no more secure than any on the Internet, and
in some cases much less so. Any Unix site administrator connected to the
Internet should be shivering in his/her boots at this point...

on Compuserve:

Study says database breaches costly and increasing, by Robb Stewart
   TORONTO (UPI, 2 Dec 1993) - A Canadian study released Thursday says one
quarter of North American companies have suffered data base breaches, at a
cost of up to $1,000,000 per incident.  The study by the Ernst and Young
financial consulting firm and Information Week magazine said the problem is
growing and that companies need to put greater emphasis on protecting their
computer systems."

Key points:

o    30% of losses caused by employees.
     
o    Half of these criminals are greedy, the rest disgruntled.
     
o    Organizations "must integrate system and date security into their basic 
     information technology strategies" to reduce fraud.
     
o    80% of all employees surveyed have access to computers.
     
o    Additional problems are caused by hackers and by natural disasters.
     
o    "...senior managers need to send a message to employees that this is a
     serious issue," according to the author, John Kearns.  

o    The author emphasized the importance of employee awareness training,
     security policies, and especially the example set by senior managers.
     According to Kearns, "employees react to the attitude of senior
     managers, leaving PCs on, or leaving documents on their desk or
     sharing their password."

&lt;&lt;end of summary&gt;&gt;

Hohum, another confirmation of what we already knew--but very important to
provide management with a continuing stream of such confirmations.  I was
surprised that the employee involvement was as low as 30%; the consensus in the
field seems to me to have been more like 75-85%.

In this Sunday's NEW YORK TIMES (Dec. 12, 1993) the cover story on the
business section is about Apple's Newton handheld computer project:

MARKETER'S DREAM, ENGINEER'S NIGHTMARE
Apple's chief promised too much on the Newton, and the design team
paid a heavy price.  by John Markoff

... The pressure to finish, exhilarating at first, eventually overwhelmed some
of the young designers.  After 18-hour days, some engineers went home and
cried.  Some quit.  One had a breakdown and ended up in jail.  One took a
pistol and killed himself.

(The story provides more detail on each of these.)

Earlier this year in the School of Ocean &amp; Earth Science &amp; Technology at the
University of Hawaii we replaced our large centralized NFS servers (all in one
building with a large-capacity uninterruptible power system) with small,
distributed mini-servers on each subnet in each building.

This noticeably improved NFS performance, did away with a substantial amount
inter-subnet network traffic, and reduced traffic significantly on the subnet
the centralized servers were previously on.  Economical, too, since the small
servers were cheap.  We didn't even bother to install UPS systems for the new
mini-servers, though we did put the small server that replaced the large one
in the original building on the old UPS.  Which seemed like a good idea at the
time...

Of course most of the services were duplicated on all servers and we crafted
the NFS maps such that systems within a particular building mounted from their
in-building NFS server if possible, but could use a server in another building
if their local server was down.

Everything worked well until we had a series of power outages last week.
After each outage, more and more individual computers would lock onto the
small server in the original building (alway ups, thanks to its UPS) in
preference to their local mini-server (with no UPS, those went down--and
typically were slower to reboot than their former clients).

NFS mounts are remarkably tenacious.  We finally had to shut down the
UPS-protected mini-server for several hours and reboot a variety of systems in
several buildings to relieve the single overloaded server.

Fascinating article in the November 1993 issue of MIT Information Systems  
journal.  "When Call Forwarding Goes Awry."

"Have you ever heard from people who tried to dial you directly at your MIT
number, but got the MIT operator instead?  Or the operator at the Whitehead
Institute?  Or someone with no connection with your department?"

Turns out that, at MIT, you can initiate a call-forwarding command by dialing
78-&lt;number to forward to&gt;.  To dial an outside number, you must dial 9-&lt;phone
number&gt;.  Well, you guessed it, people are dialing outside numbers like
788-5000 (BayBanks main number) and forgetting to dial the "9", and the lovely
phone system is taking this as a command to call forward your extension to
8-5000 (main number at Whitehead Institute).

Lovely.  You know, we've got these zillion-button digital phone sets at MIT.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was a special button to turn call forwarding on
or off, or if they used the # or * keys, or at least SOMETHING that doesn't
look a phone number?

Nah.

After a recent move, I decided to fill out a change-of-address form at the US
Post Office to have my mail forwarded for me as my personal name, me as my
sole proprietorship, both of the names of the little informal "businesses" I
and each of two friends have formed (to be on better terms with larger
companies), and, since each of my friends occasionally sends mail from our
hobby/ventures to my place, for them as well (for a grand total of five
forwarding orders).

I expected the large number of forwarding orders to be questioned; it wasn't.
And I was not pleased to learn that just anyone can walk in and fill out one
of these things for me. How did I come do that conclusion?  I was not asked
for any ID at all. Finally, when I asked if it "was ok" for me to fill out a
change of address for someone else (i.e., the ones with my friends' names on
them and my signature ;-&lt;), the mail clerk responded "as long as they don't
mind."

Has anyone ever tried to have 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE forwarded?

&gt; o    Thieves monitor external mailboxes on homes for weeks in wealthy
&gt;      neighbourhoods to steal credit cards and new cheques arriving in the
&gt;      mail.

A minor point here is that the theft requires the existence of *external* 
mailboxes, which are virtually unknown in the UK. (The only reason that UK 
e-mailers understand the "Mailbox" icon on the Sun windows interface is 
because they've read Li'l Abner! :-) 

All "letterboxes" in the UK are slots in the front door with metal hinged 
flaps over them. The mail drops down inside and lands on the doormat. 
(One exception to this is that blocks of flats *sometimes* have downstairs 
mailboxes for all occupants, but these are usually opened only by the owner's 
key, and are usually in an internal foyer, with at least some protection from 
casual theft. I live in a high-rise block of flats, and the postman delivers 
mail to each individual flat.) 

Risks here? Well, some terrorist or vandal could drop something nasty through 
it. (I will leave it to readers' imaginations what sort of "nasty" this could 
be!) Alternatively, the family dog could rip the mail to shreds. (This is a 
surprisingly common habit of dogs in the UK. I remember that the letterbox 
in my childhood home was backed by an internal mailbox to stop our otherwise 
sweet-tempered black labrador from doing just that.) Otherwise, the only 
problem is that delivery boys and postmen do not push the stuff right through 
the slot, so that a wedge of protruding paper advertises to the passing 
burglar that there is no-one at home, as well as leaving the mail itself 
once more vulnerable. 

Given that the two problems above can be solved by simple devices or by 
training (of dogs and delivery boys!) there is a possible low-tech solution 
to high-tech crime (or aren't US postmen allowed to walk up garden paths? :-)

Saul Tannenbaum in <A HREF="/Risks/15.32.html">RISKS-15.32</A> explains how an uninvited software applet can
unintentionally cause RISK to a user of certain Apple distribution software.
This is not the first time that Apple software has violated the usual
distinction between user hard disk data and its corporate interest.

In 1991 as part of their developer's CDROM, an Apple application automatically
gathered information about your Macintosh system configuration, names of
Inits, Cdevs, and Extensions (applets associated with the operating system and
generally available to all applications).

Without assuring proper authorization, it then automagically e-mailed the
information in real-time to Apple developer support. The RISK here is obvious:
particular system configurations, code names of applications and system
applets, and other gathered information could be used for significant
competitive intelligence: knowing that the name of an application under
development is, for example, NewApp version 1.0b32 gives a significant clue
that the NewApp software is almost ready to go to market; knowing that a
developer has installed a driver for a unique piece of hardware might very
well tip off Apple that a new software product using that hardware is
imminent.

Subsequent issues of the Developer's CDROM with he offending Hypercard stack
were changed to make more explicit the default behavior of the
intelligence-gathering trojan.

The RISK moral?  A company has to give thought on how to obtain proper,
informed authorization before a customer's privacy is invaded.   :w

Quoting Rebecca Mercuri, Corrupted Polling, Inside Risks, Comm. ACM,
vol 36, no 11, November 1993, p. 122.

&gt;Technology alone does not eliminate the possibility of corruption and
&gt;incompetence in elections; it merely changes the platform on which they may
&gt;occur. The voters and the Election Boards who serve them must be made aware
&gt;of the risks of adopting electronic vote-tallying systems, insisting that
&gt;the checks and balances inherent to our democracy be maintained.

This comment reminds me of a fascinating book I read some years ago:

  R.S. Brumbaugh.  Ancient Greek gadgets and machines, New York, Crowell,
  1966. (Reprinted 1975 by Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn.)

From memory, the author is a Professor of Classics, and puts forward the
thesis that the Ancient Greeks tended to trust gadgets, i.e., physical
devices, more than each other. He explains that this is why they devised and
used, for example, means of trying to ensure that voting was carried out
fairly, and that speeches were of equal length.

(Unfortunately the book is not readily available to me, otherwise I'd quote
chapter and verse.)

I just started this book, and it caused me to open my desk drawer where I had
an old memo. This is a certificate of commendation for my participation and
support on the BMDSTP Software Project during 1972-1979. If I may quote Jack
Distaso:

  Because of the expertise and dedication provided by the individuals who
  contributed to this project, STP established a record of outstanding
  performances which culminated with the complete success of the key
  demonstration mission for the Army. All milestones were completed on time,
  the software met 100 percent of its performance objectives, and the project
  generated a substantial cost underrun on our incentive contract.'

My question is: why does this record remain nearly unique? My experience on
the project seemed to show that software management was proactive and
thorough. Since that time, I've never seen its like. The people on the
project, while typically good-quality, were no better (for the most part) than
many I've met since. What made the difference?

                  CALL FOR PAPERS, COMPASS '94 

9th Annual IEEE Conference                   June 27-30, 1994 
on COMPuter ASSurance                        Gaithersburg, MD 
 
The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers, developers,
and evaluators who work on problems related to specifying, building, and
certifying high-assurance computer systems. What distinguishes COMPASS from
similar conferences is its emphasis on bridging the gap between research and
practice.  Researchers are provided an opportunity to present results, new
theories, and new technologies to both other researchers and practitioners who
can put them to practice. They can also learn from practitioners of new
research problem domains and of problems encountered in building real systems.
Practitioners have an opportunity to share lessons learned, to learn of new
research, and to influence future research.
 
Papers should present advances in the theory, design, implementation,
evaluation, or application of high-assurance systems, or report on
experiments, evaluations, and open problems in the use of new technologies for
computer assurance. Special consideration will be given to presentations
(either single papers or paper pairs) by practitioners and researchers who
have worked on the same problem. There will also be a tools fair. Papers,
panel session proposals, tutorial proposals, and tools fair proposals are
solicited in the following areas:
 
Software Reliability     Software Safety     Computer Security 
Formal Methods           Tools               Process Models 
Real-Time Systems        Networks            Embedded Systems 
V&amp;V Practices            Certification       Standards 
 
INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS: 

Send five copies of your paper, panel session proposal, tutorial proposal, or
tools fair proposal to John McLean, Program Chair, at the address given below.
Abstracts, electronic submissions, late submissions, and papers that cannot be
published in the proceedings will not be accepted. Papers submitted from
outside North America should be sent via overnight courier service.
 
Papers must be received by January 15, 1994 and must not exceed 7500 words.
Authors are responsible for obtaining prior to acceptance any and all
necessary clearances for publication.  Authors will be notified of acceptance
by March 11, 1994.  Camera-ready copies are due not later than April 22, 1994.
 
Papers that use technology presented at a previous COMPASS conference are
eligible for a special award. Papers of exceptional quality and appropriate
subject matter are eligible for inclusion in a special issue of the Journal of
High Integrity Systems or the Journal of Computer Security.

Limited financial assistance will be available for student authors.

Airport Security, By JAMES H. RUBIN (Associated Press Writer)

    WASHINGTON (AP, 11 Dec 1993) -- Security is so poor at some of the
  nation's airports considered vulnerable to terrorists that federal
  investigators easily slipped past checkpoints and wandered around
  unchallenged.

The article goes on to state that investigators were rarely challenged as they
walked through restricted areas even though they dressed informally and tried
to draw attention to themselves.  One agent successfully brought a grenade
through metal detectors and inspection procedures.  The inspectors often saw
other unauthorized people in restricted zones.

Apparently security regulations are not taken seriously at many airports; there
are few if any consequences for breaches of security.


Although this story has nothing to do with computer security, I cite it as yet
another example of how important human factors are to security in general.
Management must take security (including information security) seriously and
apply rewards for compliance and punishment for failures.  Employees need
security awareness training and security drills.  I would like to see
intrusions as a normal part of security testing.

Woman indicted in CD-ROM scam

    SAN JOSE, Calif. (UPI, 10 Dec 1993) -- Federal officials said Friday a
  grand jury has indicted a San Jose woman for allegedly importing more than
  900 counterfeit CD-ROMs from Hong Kong with the intent to sell them in the
  United States.  U.S. Attorney Mike Yamaguchi said an indictment for software
  piracy had been handed down against Clare Waioi Sham, 29, of San Jose, and
  her company, C-88 International Corp.

The article mentions that this is the first software theft indictment
involving CD-ROMs.

Personally, I think the best part of this story is that the person accused of
preparing to sell counterfeit CD-ROMs is named "Sham."

  Smart Car 54, Where Are You?; Washington's Latest Billion Dollar Boondoggle:
  Does Anyone Care?  (By Marcia D. Lowe) 

    COMPUTER-EQUIPPED cars driving themselves on automated highways. A scene
  out of "The Jetsons?" Not exactly. Smart cars and highways have quietly
  emerged as the latest and most expensive proposal to solve the nation's
  traffic problems. Government spending on the little-known Intelligent
  Vehicle and Highway Systems (IVHS) program is expected to exceed $40 billion
  over the next 20 years. (By comparison, in the first 10 years of the
  Strategic Defense Initiative, Washington spent $30 billion.) Even more
  astonishing is the total lack of organized opposition to the idea, despite
  evidence that smart cars and highways may well exacerbate the very problems
  they are supposed to solve.
    IVHS would put computers in charge of everything from timing the traffic
  signals to deciding which route each car should take - and, eventually, to
  doing the actual driving. In the early stages, a dashboard screen would
  display maps while a synthesized voice would purr directions to the driver.
  Later would come the crowning glory of IVHS, the Automated Highway System.
  Once commuters keyed in their destination, they could just sit back and
  enjoy the ride - maybe even take a nap. Cars would hurtle along, bumper to
  bumper, at speeds measured in miles per minute.

The article continues with the following key points:

o $218 million of federal funding in 1993
o claims of improved safety are unproven
o central computer failures could lead to massive accidents
o proponents concerned with limiting liability for failures
o proposed fuel savings from smoother driving could be lost through higher
  speeds
o main proponent of scheme is IVHS America, supported by 500 organizations
  including IBM, AT&amp;T, Rockwell, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford
o minor attention given to smart public transport, priorities for
  high-occupancy vehicles

Participants in RISKS will shudder at the thought of testing computer programs
design to control thousands of cars in lockstep at 200 kph.  I wouldn't enjoy
being part of the beta-test population.  I wonder how much attention will be
paid to deliberate or accidental interference?

o Presumably information will be transmitted through radio-frequency modems.
  What will the unique identifiers be for each car.  What happens if two cars
  have the same identifier?

o How will partial or total breakdown of the control systems be handled?
  Car-to-car signalling?

o What methods will be put into place to prevent spurious instructions from
  being accepted by car controllers?

I find the concern with legal liability an alarming indication of where we're
headed.

Good fun for those interested in reliability and security; not so good fun for
early users, I fear.

I received an interesting thing in the mail yesterday. It was an unsolicited
advertisement/demo for a mail system to run on a Novel PC LAN. It came with a
disk that included the instructions: 1) Log into your server as SUPERVISOR, 2)
Create a directory for the mail software (In SYS:PUBLIC), 3) copy the contents
of the floppy to the new directory, and 4) Run the install program.

There is also a postcard that you can send in to receive a free t-shirt. All
you have to do is provide your Name, Title, Company, Address, Telephone, Fax,
Signature, and your "unique code number" (which presumably the software will
provide you.)

To sweeten the offer there is another card you can send in to enter to win a
Jeep and other prizes. This card asks for similar information.

If you run the demo and follow the instructions, you will have executed
unknown software from a fully privileged account, and told this company where
to find you and your computers.

Sounds like an great opportunity for a Trojan Horse. The "unique code number"
could also easily contain information that indicates what else is on your
system that may be of interest to this company.

LOOPHOLE ON STOLEN PHONES ATTACKED, 
Patricia Wynn Davies, Political Correspondent

BRITAIN'S latest crime wave - the reprogramming of hundreds of thousands of
stolen mobile telephones - is legal, while the necessary technology is openly
advertised in newspapers and magazines.  Telephones automatically barred from
networks when a theft is reported are re-entering the system in their
thousands after being "rechipped" by people the law does not treat as
criminals.

Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, has written to
Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, urging the closure of the legal loophole.
Organised rings of mobile phone thieves were getting "easy pickings" amounting
to about 350M pounds a year, Mr Maclellan said.

The rechipping process, involving the reprogramming of serial numbers so that
the network no longer recognises the phone as the stolen original, can be
easily accomplished using equipment that can be plugged into an ordinary home
computer.

Chipping services offered by dealers and openly advertised in trade magazines
and newspapers have been defended as a necessary facility for honest customers
buying second-hand telephones from previous owners who have run up bad debts
during the recession. But the biggest beneficiaries appear to be criminals.

The reprogramming racket has provided a ready outlet for small and big-time
thieves - the black market price of up to (pounds) 150 for a stolen cellphone
easily outstrips that of a stolen car stereo - while spawning a mini-industry
of "phone chippers" turning out new sets of chipping software each time a new
model is launched.

Thefts are estimated by the industry to be running at 10,000 a month, more
than 400 each day, while police forces around the country believe they account
for 40 per cent of city-centre car break-ins.

Mr Maclennan has told Mr Howard that the loophole could be easily closed with
a minor amendment to the 1984 Telecommunications Act in the forthcoming
Criminal Justice Bill.

"This is straightforward counterfeit, but astonishingly it is not illegal," he
said. "The police know who many of the crooks are, but cannot touch them."

A similar process of "cloning" a subscribers' serial and telephone numbers
into another person's phone results in innocent subscribers being billed for
fraudulent calls.  Both processes render the phone untraceable.

On UK television last night, a regular evening programme, "The Late Show" was
concerned with forthcoming developments in television. This centred around the
potential for high bandwidth and bidirectional communications offered by the
use of optical fibre for cable TV services.

This increase in the number of channels, some with an interactive content 
(shopping channels, databases, computer games) would promote the concept of
configurable TV ("MeTV" was the name they chose) which allows the user to 
decide what kind of things they wish to watch, and thus they will largely use
only one channel: the one they have configured.

Interestingly, one of the contributors raised the privacy issues: if you know
exactly what TV programmes someone likes watching, then you (or your computer
system) can tailor direct mail (and even TV adverts) to have the maximum 
impact. The difference between this and standard audience research is that the
*viewer* builds a profile for the advertiser, when they configure the system.

Also in the programme, an executive for CBS raised the point that if everyone 
only subscribes to compilation services, where does the original material
come from? If people select what they view in advance, will they miss out on
things that might entertain and enlighten them. The suggestion was made that
people will retreat much more into their own pursuits and that "community" will
suffer. What happens to people who are too poor to have cable, either because
their neighbourhood isn't cabled, or because they can't afford to subscribe. 
They also touched on electronic democracy in this context: if you can't afford
to subscribe, will you have a voice on an equal footing with others?

Finally, a contributor from the EFF suggested that the Internet be used as a 
model: the idea of providing these services to form communities controlled by
users rather than by large companies or governments. Sadly, it seems as if the
commercial attractions to advertisers and corporations will win out.

In the Usenet newsgroup rec.puzzles, there has been a little discussion
recently of place names with unusual characters.  It was suggested
that Westward Ho!, England, was unique for containing the punctuation
mark "!", but then somebody topped this by calling attention to
Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec, Canada.

At this point I decided to look these places up in atlases to see
where exactly they are.  The one I found Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! in
was the Rand McNally Road Atlas, 1991 edition.

In the index, the place is spelled... "St.-Louis-du-Ha90 Ha90".

(P.S.: Westward Ho! is on the north coast of Devon, more or less
straight north of Plymouth.  Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! is about halfway
between Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec, and Edmundston, New Brunswick.)

Mexico's earthquake warning system has been turned off after failing at least
twice since it went into operation in August.  In October a quake measuring
6.8 on the Richter scale hit but the alarm didn't sound.  In November a false
alarm went out on a calm Tuesday evening.  Technologically, the system is
fairly simple.  Solar powered seismic detectors signal a desktop Olivetti.
Radio stations receive signal directly from the Olivetti system and broadcast
warbling tones like something from a science fiction movie.  Professor of
Engineering Juan Manuel Espinosa Aranda, head of the warning system, said it
was tested for two years before going into operation.  He said the two
failures resulted from simple, though lamentable, errors adding that it is
better to have a warning - even if it might be false - than simply to let
nature take its course.  Not all share his view.  Cinna Lomnitz, a seismology
professor, said: "Basically, this is an experimental system that should not be
broadcast to the public right off the bat.  Indirectly, these people have
damaged our reputation as seismologists."  Luis Abraham Villa, an office
assistant, said: "It creates collective hysteria.  It really affects the older
people.  They go crazy."

I just saw a blurb on "The Computer Chronicles" about the last Comdex show,
which focussed on portables, laptops, notebooks, and accessories for them. One
new product, whose name I didn't catch ("AirLink"?) was a wireless device that
automatically downloads all of your modified files as soon as you get within
30 meters of your PC. There is no user interface at all. It even works through
walls.

The possibilities for data theft are endless. Apparently, there is not even a
warning that downloading is occurring. It seems that once these are common, an
industrial spy could wander O'Hare airport and download a lot of files if
he/she were so inclined.

Does anyone have more information on this product?

I was certainly interested to read Mr. Erwin's contribution.  "Digital Woes"
is intended to highlight a widespread problem to an audience that is
essentially oblivious to such matters (certainly not the RISKS audience!).
While the problem of unreliable and overly costly software is undeniably
widespread, it would be simple-minded to insist that it is universal.
Categories are ordinarily fuzzy; exceptions make life interesting, after all.
(I myself am having the pleasure, at present, of working for folks who write
specs!)

It is entirely possible that the project Mr. Erwin describes is such an
exception.  If so, let me add my congratulations to Mr. Distaso's.  However, I
am curious to learn more about this project -- especially if it *was*
exceptional.  In particular, I am curious to learn:

* What was the purpose of the software?  

* What was it supposed to do?

* Was the product actually used in real-world situations, as opposed to
  testing?

* Were the acceptance tests specified in advance?  Were they available to the
  developers to use as they developed the software?

* If the product was used beyond testing, did it satisfy the real-world
  requirements as well as the tests?  

* If the project was a contract with the U. S. gov't, was it in the interests
  of both the subcontractor and the government to declare the project a
  success?  Did this equate to a big career win for all the parties involved?
  (Unfortunately, the incentives are often such that it is in the interests of
  neither party to point out weaknesses in the product.  This kind of
  arrangement can make such congratulatory letters sound a bit hollow.)

It is entirely possible, of course, that the project Mr. Erwin describes had
none of these weaknesses, and was in fact a true and marvelous success.  All
the more reason to learn more about it, if possible.  It would be wonderful to
isolate even one factor that could help the rest of us.

The Syracuse Herald-Journal reported in January that its telephone hotline,
featuring excerpts of the presidential debates last fall, was succeesful
except for one glitch: Ross Perot's voice sometimes hit a pitch that mimicked
a certain telephone tone that automatically shut down the whole system.

I wonder if there are any protocols in place or even proposed for
"quarantining" signals detected by SETI programs against the possibility of
viral infections in software? If Turing machines are a universal feature of
mathematics, might not a malicious or possibly just careless civilization be
transmitting open or disguised programs that could conceivably wreak havoc
among our delicate infosystems? Has anyone thought of this possibility and its
implications? Or has this subject been done to death already and I've missed
it? If so any pointers to the info at any archive site gratefully appreciated.
If not, surely it merits some serious discussion? After all, we were so afraid
of biological contamination the first few Apollo crews were in isolation for
days until we determined that there was no danger. We should have the same
concern for informational "contamination" today, since so much of our
civilization depends on Turing machines.....

   ["Just careless" would seem unlikely if they were an advanced civilization.
   There is always a possibility that an unanticipated signal might do
   something strange to a system.  There are lots of cases of electromagnetic
   interference in the RISKS archives, for example.  But if everything in
   SETI is interpreted properly as pure DATA, you don't need to worry.
   BTW, if we had tapes long enough for the Turing machines, they might be
   able to reach to distant planets.  PGN]

Flight International, 22/12/93-4/1/94 p11 contains an article on the report of
the commission of inquiry into the Jan 1992 Strasbourg A320 crash. Details and
comments on the preliminary findings have appeared in RISKS before. E.g. see
<A HREF="/Risks/14.01.html">RISKS-14.01</A> (Mellor) on a rumor of a possible transient fault in the FMGS.
The crew set up an unusually high rate of descent (3,300 ft/min) instead of
the usual 800 ft/min (the final approach fix is only at 1,500 ft above ground
level).  FI's report focuses on the crew training and the interface problems
highlighted by the report.

"The commission concluded that the crew's "below-average" performance
contributed to the accident and that the low combined time on type of the two
pilots (162h captain/61h co-pilot) caused a lack of familiarity with the
equipment on the A320's flightdeck, which has "...increased the risk factor".
[...]
	From the moment of descent until impact, says the report, the
aircraft's high descent rate was adopted and maintained. The commission
observed that the "vertical navigation" was left entirely to the automatic
systems and the crew appeared to ignore all the clues available to them about
their abnormally high descent rate.
	The commission says that the reason for the crew's descent mode
selection is not proved beyond all doubt, but that the most probable
explanations are a confusion as to which descent mode - vertical-speed (VS) or
flight-path-angle (FPA) - was set, having either forgotten to set it or having
set it incorrectly.
	The ergonomic design of the descent-more selector is criticised for
being too easy to misread or mis-set. Airbus states that a design improvement
[..] has already been certificated and incorporated into all new A320s since
November 1993. A retrofit package will be available for fitting from January
1994.
	The many recommendations in the report concentrate heavily on the need
for regulation to ensure pilot training and procedures improvements, together
with a need to monitor and standardise symbology development in modern
flightdeck displays."

"Dangerous overheating in an Airbus Industrie A320 engine-starter unit led to
complete in-flight engine-control failure [..].
	The starboard [engine ....] suddenly wound down to idle power at
4,000ft (1,200m) in the climb from London Heathrow on 13 December, 1992.
	Reversion to manual control had no effect because the circuit breakers
for the full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) and engine-interface
unti had tripped and would not reset. THe aircraft returned safely to
Heathrow.  [...] Temperatures reached 400\degC inside the engine cowl,
damaging the FADEC wiring. The AAIB says that the engine wind-down was
probably caused by short-circuiting, which gave false signals about
thrust-reverser position.
	In October 1989 a similar [..] event led to the issue of the 1991
Service Bulletin. A Bulletin issued after the incident was not applied to the
[aircraft in this report]. The AAIB recommends making it mandatory."

Of course, another take on this situation (and equally applicable to the 
computer world) is that the security culture mainly benefits its vendors and
overseeing bureaucracy: that the slipshod techniques are merely there to 
reassure a naive public that the airlines and their government are doing 
something with respect to an issue that gravely concerns many: but evidence
had repeatedly shown--even at the peak of "red scares"--that these measures
tend not to deter the high-risk attackers (or even catch very many of the 
low-risk attackers, as the estimated ~30,000 security violations/year 
testifies).  EVEN when conducted according to specification.

Metal detectors are manned by poorly trained, low-cost personnel, and provide 
a single point of entry that is easily subverted.  Similarly, badges are 
ineffective, and door combination locks are easily compromised.  But they do 
show the public that "something is being done."  So when hijackings to 
Cuba became embarrassing, checkpoints appeared; when bombings occur, the 
call for outrageously expensive explosives detectors goes up; when an airline 
employee kills the flight crew of an airplane, the employees are treated 
like criminals (every airline pilot in the United States must pass through
the same security checkpoints as the passengers, for instance: in Russia, 
they ARM their pilots :-)).

This is all visible to the public, and may provide (as with computer security)
some level of deterrence for *honest* individuals, but overall, the results 
are mixed, at best.  Countries that do security right (such as Israel) do it 
very slowly, and very expensively; countries that want their cake and be 
able to eat it too (profitable security; the closest analog may be network 
security), resort to symbolic measures, largely ineffective--but which help
sell a notion that "something is being done."

So, as with computer security, perhaps the real question to ask is whether 
the symbolism--for all its faults--is really worth it.  I don't particularly
relish the prospects of living in a police state, myself.  Actually, I *did*
live in one, for over ten years.  Sure, you can go to sleep with the front
door wide open, but such societies take their toll in much more profound, 
disturbing ways than petty violence.

I have had a keen interest in this problem since my portable was stolen
from my car.  This is what I have since learnt:

Re-Chipping is a misnomer.  All modern cellphones can have *soft* Electronic
Serial Numbers (ESNs) and phone numbers.  On my NEC P3, these can be changed
without even removing the cover.

The real thief is the airtime company.  They leave me with two choices:

   1) Pay UKP137.00 to get out of my airtime contract.  (3 months line rental,
   plus UKP50.00 disconnection +tax)

   2) Buy a new phone.  They have a whole department to sell theft-replacement
   phones.  The prices for phones sold without a new airtime contract are *much*
   higher than those sold with a contract.

The reality is that people generally only upgrade their phones when they get
stolen, so it is in the interest of the airtime providers to sell phones
with a high "black" value.

The entire trade in stolen phones could be stopped by the simple expedient
of using *hard* ESNs and dipping the circuitry in epoxy.

The rechipping is a service provided even by the Taiwan government, at
about NT$4000 (about US$160) a pop.  Lots of people who are legally
registered and paying customers buy cell phones from the US and rechip
them to use in Taiwan.  The reason is quite legitimate -- the cost of
buying a cell phone in Taiwan is exceedingly high.  Presumably, by
providing this service, the Taiwan government gets fees that would
have gone into phone dealers' pockets.

I was a little surprised my comment got posted, since I was basically
interested in the moderator's opinion on why software typically had so many
problems.  BMDSTP project was unusual in being successful, and I was looking
for some comparably successful projects. Lauren Wiener asks some sharp
questions:

1. What was the purpose of the software?
This was the Site Defense Program, which was to build software for the
ballistic missile defense system that followed Safeguard. It was also the
testbed for Modern Programming Practices, and Barry Boehm was involved.
ALTHOUGH the management was good, it was not particularly better than 
management I've worked with since. The BMDSTP managers did take a
proactive stance, trying not to be blindsided by problems, and they were
always willing to listen to their engineers.

This program was redirected in midstream in response to the ABM pact, and
instead went to Kwajalein as a tracking and data collection tool for the
phased array radar out there. It ran on a pair of CYBER 7000 machines. It
worked, and it worked well.

2. Was the product actually used in real-world situations, as opposed to
testing?

Hard to answer. It ended up a component of a test system, but it was not
under test there. It certainly met its requirements.

3. Were the acceptance tests specified in advance?  Were they available to
the developers to use as they developed the software?

Yes, we were very careful to get the required performance envelope and
functional requirements defined in detail, and we ran off-nominal stress tests
against those requirements. The real-time operating system was specified
top-down, with performance requirements as well as functional requirements,
and we built an automatic testing system that validated the RTOS and DMS for
each delivery. I've not seen anything since like the way that process was
managed. Most programs address performance and reliability late, if ever, and
we addressed it from the beginning. As Tom Bell puts it: "Pay me now or pay me
later. It'll cost more later." We paid up front.

I'm very interested in why this one program worked so well. I've been
observing the FAA Advanced Automation Program for the last three years and
trying to understand the difference between my experience on the BMDSTP and
their current experience. My impression is that there is a non-linear
relationship between the effectiveness of technical management and the success
or failure of a software project. If the software is just slightly too hard
for the management team, they fall behind and spend their time playing
catch-up and responding to surprises. If they are able to get their arms
around the system early, on the other hand, they can keep ahead of the
problems and control things much more effectively. There's not that much of a
difference between most managers and engineers that I can identify, so I
suspect it's the nature of the software development problem to be like that.

Does that help?

The Guardian (21st December, 1993) reports the conviction of a male
nurse who hacked into a hospital's computer system and modified
entries, including prescriptions.  The hacker:

    - prescribed drugs normally used to treat heart disease and high
      blood pressure to a 9 year old with meningitis.
      This change was spotted by a ward sister;

    - prescribed antibiotics to a patient in a geriatric ward.
      These drugs were administered to the patient, with no apparent
      adverse reaction;

    - "scheduled" an unnecessary X-ray for a patient;

    - "recommended" a discharge for another patient.

The hacker gained access to the computer system after learning the
password through observing a locum doctor having trouble logging in.

He qualified as a nurse in 1989.  He is reported to have undergone a
considerable personality change as the result of a road accident in
1984.  As well as developing a fascination for computers and other
hi-tec equipment, he had apparently developed a "lack of sensitivity
to the consequences of his actions".

He had been sacked for unprofessional behaviour in 1990, but was
re-employed in 1992 at the same hospital.

He pleaded guilty to unauthorised modification of computer records.
He offered no explanation for his actions, but denied any malicious
intent.  He was jailed for 12 months.

on CompuServe:

  Customs-Whistleblower, By Michael White, Associated Press Writer 
  SAN DIEGO (AP, 30 Dec 1993) -- Some of what Mike Horner regards as his best
  work ultimately destroyed his career as a U.S. Customs Service inspector on
  the Mexican border.  Horner left the service after alleging that
  intelligence reports he filed identifying suspected drug smugglers and their
  vehicles were deleted from Customs' computer network."

This article and another by the same author detail the apparent data diddling
that resulted in first deleting, then re-introducing, Mr Horner's records of
smuggling across the US/Mexican border.

Horner's allegations of malfeasance were ignored by his superiors.

No one can explain how his deleted entries could have re-appeared after he
left the U.S. Customers Service.

White's next story is

  Customs Smuggling, By Michael White, Associated Press Writer 
  LOS ANGELES (AP, 30 Dec 1993) -- Weaknesses in U.S. Customs' cargo tracking
  system may have opened a door for smugglers of drugs and other contraband
  and cost taxpayers millions of tariff dollars, according to sources and
  Customs records.

   Among the problems: False inspectors' names are showing up on cargo entry
records, passing containers without inspection; and seals placed on containers
bound for distant destinations are breached in transit, allowing contraband to
be removed or contents stolen between the dock and inspection points."

This article deals with irregularities in the computer system used to
monitor the Port of Los Angeles.

Key points of the article:

o some bonded cargos appear to be opened illegally, allowing contraband
  to be removed.

o some inspection records online include names of nonexistent officials;

o records of suspicious shipments which should have initiated followups
  have been overridden with false names.

o 200-400 records of in-bond cargo containers are purged each month because
  the Customs Service cannot trace the containers; an indendent study by the
  Treasury Department estimated data destruction in the thousands per month.

o Some employees say that the computer system fools inspectors into relying on
  electronic records instead of their own initiatives when deciding which
  shipments to inspect.

  Britons Charged with Europe-Wide Credit Card Fraud

  LONDON (Reuter, 30 Dec 1993) - Three Britons have been charged with
  conspiracy in a 2.5 million pound ($3.7 million) Europe-wide credit card
  fraud, police said on Thursday."

The article says that the Birmingham men are accused of having used fake
credit cards and stole expensive products in France, Britain, Belgium and the
Netherlands.  Apparently other arrests are promised.

Once again we see that one of the world's most frequently used

IRS Charges Tax Preparer With $1.1 Million Fraud,  By Christopher B. Daly
 Special to The Washington Post

   BOSTON, Dec. 16 - The president of a nationwide tax-preparation service was
indicted today on charges that he used computers to cheat the Internal Revenue
Service out of more than $1 million in one of the biggest electronic tax fraud
cases on record, officials said.
   Richard M. Hersch, 56, of Ardmore, Pa., was accused of using his company,
Quik Tax Dollars Inc. of Bryn Mawr, Pa., to file 431 false tax claims and
launder $1.1 million..."

The article provides details of the case.  Key points:

o 12 million returns were filed electronically in the 1992 tax year.

o Hersch is accused of making up "145 false tax returns using
  fictitious names and Social Security numbers."

o He then allegedly used an intermediary company, Drake Enterprises,
  which is not accused of wrong-doing, to forward the tax returns to the IRS.

o Hersch received cheques from a local bank which assumed that the bogus
  returns were OK, based preliminary info from the IRS which simply certified
  that there were no obvious errors.  Since there were no real filers,
  Hersch appears to have kept all the money himself.

o Incidentally, Hersch has been indicted in Philadelphia on charges of
  stealing $262,865 from Provident Bank by passing bad cheques.  He has also
   been indicted on charges of using other people's AmEx cards for more than
   $1000 in unauthorized purchases.

o Mr Hersch is currently under house arrest.

Comment:  how did this man get to run a tax-preparation service at all? 
Aren't there any background checks for people in this kind of position? 
And how about some kind of verification of the fake Social Security
Numbers?  Is it not possible to check that the SSN is assigned to the
person for whom the fake return was made?

The sci-fi classic "A is for Andromeda" by Fred Hoyle is the story
of a SETI signal which is exactly the plans for, and a program for,
a very large computer.  The excitement begins, of course, when 
(against the advice of one scientist) the computer is built ...

Not sure if this has been treated seriously by industry or academia, but
in Vernor Vinge's (marvelous and Hugo-winning) _A_Fire_Upon_The_Deep_, this
very method was used by a malicious intelligence to take over remote systems.
(In the book, one main method of communication is by a cosic equivalent of 
Usenet (called either the Known Net or (frequently, and accurately) the Net of
a Million Lies).  The Blight (abovementioned intelligence) transmitted
intelligent packets to take over the remote system).

Personally, I don't think that this is going to be much of a problem right now.
In order for the information to wreak any real damage (unless you overload the
front end with a powerful signal), the virii would need to run, and unless
the evil LGMs at the other end somehow know the architecture of the system
doing the decoding, I can't see that this is a serious problem.

I can't help but think you've been reading "Snow Crash" :-)

The relevance is that, in the course of the narrative, it is discovered the
antagonist can cause a biological "crash" of the minds of programmers who have
"firmwired the binary code in the deep structures of their brain."  He picked
this data stream from stellar emissions recorded via a SETI-like antenna
network.

A bit esoteric, but it made an amusing read.

(The antagonist also vaguely reminded me of H. Ross Perot; odd.)

For those of you interested, the author is Neal Stephenson and the publisher
is Bantam Spectra.

"When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One", Gerrold, 1972/1988
 
HARLIE is not a virus.  He/it is an experiment in artificial intelligence.
For the purposes of the book the experiment is a success and HARLIE is alive:
is a person.  The plot revolves (slowly) around the efforts of corporate
management to kill the project (and HARLIE) and the efforts of the computer
(program) and its creators to stave this off.  As in most of Gerrold's books,
the plot is primarily there to set up dialogues in which he can expound his
philosophies.  (The most blatant example of this is in "A Rage for Revenge"
most of which takes place in a seminar, the largest chunk of which is devoted
to an illustration of the standard five-stage model of grieving.)
 
In both versions, the "virus" is a mere diversion.  It has nothing to do with
the story at all, and is a discussion point between two characters, never
referred to again.  Indeed, in the first version it is introduced as a science
fiction story, "but the thing had been around a long time before that."  Make
of this latter statement what you will.  My resident science fiction expert
can't think of what the prior story might be and ventures that this might be
Asimovian self-citation.
 
Statements have been made that the virus aspect was downplayed in the second
version.  This is rather ironic.  The virus story gets roughly the same amount
of ink in both versions, but the early one is definitely superior.  HARLIE72
gives a fairly simple and straightforward account of a self-propagating
program.  In fact, aside from the dependence upon dial-up links, the parallels
between the HARLIE72 virus and the actual CHRISTMA infestation fifteen years
later are uncanny.  Specifics include the use of an information source for
valid contacts, and a mutation which loses the self-deletion characteristic.
 
The HARLIE88 discussion is much more convoluted, bringing in malaria, spores,
phages and parasites.  The are even two separate invocations of the worm, one
lower case and one capitalized, both with different definitions.  (One refers
to a logic bomb, and the other to a virus directed at a specific target. 
Neither definition is so used by anyone else.)  The end result is a completely
iconoclastic set of terminology bearing almost no relation to anything seen in
real life.
 
To further the irony, HARLIE88 could have been viral.  HARLIE72 could not: 
part of the system was advanced hardware which did not exist in other
computers.  Therefore, while HARLIE72 had the ability to program other
computers, such programming could never have resulted in a reproduction without
the additional hardware.  HARLIE88, however, was software only.  To be sure,
the environment included "2k channel, multi-gated, soft-lased, hyper-state"
processors, roughly a million times more powerful than the home user's "Mac-
9000", but still, as one character has it, just chips.  HARLIE88 *could*
survive, albeit running more slowly, on other computers.  However, while one
character realizes that HARLIE could be "infectious" the discussion dies out
without realizing that the primary tension of the story has just been
eliminated.

My bank has installed one of those bank-by-phone services.  You call up,
give your 10-digit account number, password is the last 4 digits of your
SSN, and off you go.  At the moment the transactions available are purely
informational (get balance, get last 5 checks that cleared, etc.), but they
say they plan to allow operational transactions (e.g. pay bills, transfer
money) soon.

The problems of this kind of system have been well-covered here in the past;
what I need help with is also a known problem, but in this case it appears
to be particularly severe.  To wit:

In this system, if you time out too often or enter incorrect information
twice, you are transferred to a human being who is supposed to help you
figure out the system.  In my case I encountered this human twice.  The
first time I had misunderstood which subset of the account digits they
wanted.  When I got to the human, he could apparently see the digits I had
typed and he told me the correct digits to use for my account (how helpful,
I thought).

I then called back and tried the new digit set, and it still failed twice.
I talked to another human being who revealed that not only did he have on
his screen my account #, but also he had the 4-digit password I had typed
*and* the correct password.  It turns out that there was a data
transcription error in my account and they had a wrong SSN for me; thus the
password was different than I expected.

The helpful gentleman -- with NO confirmation of who I was -- provided the
correct four digits to me!!  ARGH!  And I wasn't even *trying* to do social
engineering.

Now, what I would like help from RISKS readers on is how I should draft my
letter of protest/alarm.  To whom within the bank/government/BBB/SEC/etc
should it be sent?  How do I explain to them that (a) they have to guard
this information at least as closely as bank-card PINs; (b) they should
provide some way for me to change my password; (c) they have to train their
people a whole lot better!  At the moment I'm tempted to rant and rave at
them, but I know a calm, well-thought-out, detailed response is more likely
to get the results I want.  Should I start off with a phone call?  Has
anyone on this list dealt successfully with similar problems?

Please send suggestions directly to me; I will summarize back to RISKS and
let y'all know if there is any change in the future.

A UPI story today says that a Canadian teenager defrauded a cellular phone
network out of $500,000 worth of long distance calls by changing greetings in
voice mail boxes so that they would approve calls billed to the Rogers Cantel,
Inc. network.  Cantel blames Bell Canada's automated long-distance billing
service.

Apparently Cantel has started offering customers a service that will keep
their cellular phones from accepting third-party calls.

The 6 Jan 1994 New York Times carries an article (business section, pages C1
and C4) by John Markoff about General Magic's Telescript language.  The
article likens software agents to viruses and worms and concentrates on the
liability issues associated with a developing "ecology" of bits of software
moving around through networks.  My first reaction was that the folks at
General Magic can't be too happy about the NYT putting this spin on its new
product.  After all, the problem with viruses and worms is not precisely that
they travel but that they multiply, and few applications of agents, at least
the ones most commonly envisioned, require unbounded replication.  But then I
wondered, how safe are we in a world that includes a widely distributed
programming language in which a ten-year-old can write a heavy-duty worm?  And
Risks readers will guffaw at the following sentence in the article's last
paragraph: "In an effort to lock the doors against potential vandals, General
Magic has designed Telescript so that many of the most common computer
security loopholes are impossible".  It goes on to mention that General Magic
has licensed encryption technology from RSA Data Security.  I'm looking
forward to the first few reverse-engineered Telescript products.

Best wishes to General Magic.

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif.  The Clinton administration's newly articulated
information technology policy of persuasion, rather than dictation, is getting
an early test.
   At an industry conference in Redwood City this week, computer hardware,
software and telecommunications companies as well as a major bank, are saying
they intend to adopt an industry coding standard for protecting the privacy of
electronic communications, rather than support a standard being pushed by the
administration.
   Unlike the administration-backed standard, the technology, which has been
commercialized by RSA Data Security Inc., does not provide an electronic
``trapdoor'' that would enable law-enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on
digital communications.
   The administration, whose standard is known as the Clipper chip, contends
that a trapdoor is necessary to detect criminal activity or espionage because
sophisticated encryption techniques can make digital phone calls or computer
communications nearly impervious to wiretaps.
   Wednesday, Hewlett Packard Co. became the last of the leading United States
computer companies to license the RSA software, joining Apple Computer, IBM,
Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Unisys.
   Several companies announced at the conference that they planned to begin
selling products that embed RSA's software. Among them are General Magic, a
software developer; National Semiconductor; a consortium of five cellular data
companies, and Bankers Trust Co.
   The conference was sponsored by RSA, which is based in Redwood City, and
attracted many of the nation's best non-government cryptographers a group of
code makers and code breakers who have generally been hostile to any form of
government restrictions on their technology.
   They have sparred for more than a decade with the National Security Agency,
the main proponent of the Clipper chip. The agency is responsible for
monitoring electronic communications worldwide for the government, in the name
of national security.
   In addition to opposition from the cryptographers, the government's Clipper
chip proposal has already stirred bitter opposition from civil liberties
organizations and computer user groups, who fear the Clipper chip would make
electronic communications too easy for anyone to eavesdrop.
   Now the industry's rush to embrace an encryption standard that does not
provide a way for the government to listen to data or voice conversations is
certain to put new pressure on the Clinton administration, which is now in the
final stages of a classified review of its Clipper standard.
   ``It's clear that what is going on here today is contrary to the way the
NSA wants the world to move,'' said Lynn McNulty, associate director for
computer security at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, a
Commerce Department agency. The institute proposed the Clipper standard last
April, although most of its technical development was done by NSA researchers.
   Despite their defiance, researchers attending the conference worried that
the government might still have the means to enforce its vision of a coding
standard.
   ``They have the trump card that we don't have,'' said Bruce Schneier, a
former government cryptography researcher, who is the author of a textbook
titled ``Applied Cryptography.'' ``They could make it a law that it's
mandatory to use their standard.''

  was extended from 2 Jan!  But you may want to respond anyway.  Besides,
  the Cantwell Bill is included below, and it may be of interest to many
  RISKS readers.  PGN]

This is an invitation to join members of the security community,
Administration officials, and members of Congress in a discussion of security
on the National Information Infrastructure and encryption export controls.

The meeting will be held at the Washington Convention Center on January the
25th, 1994. The meeting will begin at 8 a.m. and will adjourn at 3 p.m.

The purpose of this meeting is in response to a request from Secretary of
Commerce Ron Brown at the recent 1993 Technology Summit in San Francisco.
Secretary Brown asked that a meeting be held to bring together industry and
government to start an open dialog, which will help shape information security
policy as the United States moves forward into a more global economy. Everyone
will have a chance to express their opinions and concerns.

During this meeting individual committees will be formed to study and make
recommendations on specific areas of information security as it relates to the
NII ( this will also become known as the International Information
Infrastructure).

R.S.V.P.'s are required NO LATER THAN January 2, 1994 [apparently extended to
10 Jan.  PGN]. Please call Paul Gates at the National Computer Security
Association (717) 258-1816. All attendees will be sent an agenda, a copy of
the NII, the Clinton Administration's Technology Policy and a copy of the
Cantwell Bill which deals with encryption export controls.

NOTE: If you cannot attend in person but would still like to participate we
will be offering on-line opportunities.

Re: Encryption Export Bill (Cantwell)
Bob -

Here are some of the comments that we passed along to Maria Cantwell's office
regarding the Bill on the export of encryption technologies. I hope you find
it useful.

I understood the purpose of this Bill was to reduce export controls and
restrictions of software that is either based on encryption or that contained
encryption. As I read the Bill everything was fine until paragraph (3) -( You
understand that I am reading this from a laypersons point of view and if you
can clear up any misinterpretations I would appreciate it).

 In paragraph (3) the Bill states software containing encryption can be
exported freely "unless there is substantial evidence that such software will
be:

(A) diverted to a military end-use or end-use supporting international
terrorism:

(B) modified for military or terrorist end user or

(C) re-exported without requisite United States Authorization."

or that software which is

"... specifically designed or modified for

(A) military use, including command, control, and intelligence applications;
or

(B) cryptanalytic functions

I think that before I or others from the security side decide to support or
not to support this Bill we have some questions that need answers.

1. Who will be asked to determine whether such restrictions are appropriate?
The NSA? The CIA? The FBI? Does it remain the same as under the current law?
Assuming that the technical overview of military applications for encryption
remains the NSA - what makes it in their interest to let ANY encryption out of
the country that will make their job more difficult? (A little like letting
the fox guard the chickens)

2. What constitutes substantial evidence 'of or 'designed for' military use?
Is it measured by the relative strength of the algorithm or key management
system or by the mere fact it is longer than the DES which is 56 bits? I feel
that some sort of definition needs to be included. What can and what cannot be
exported? A list of commercially available encryption software algorithms that
are pre-approved - (i.e. DES, RSA, PGP, RC4, DSS, etc.) would be nice. Is
selling an encryption product to a foreign military contractor the same as
selling to the military itself, and who makes the judgment call?

3. Will export licenses be required - will denials be explained so that the
exporter and the public understand the reasons for the denial?

4. If a denial is issued, will the exporter have any forum for appeal?

Since Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown has exclusive control over the export
rules, it is obvious that the intelligence community can have a single,
important, point of focus for influence. (Yes I an slightly suspicious). In
theory, the intelligence overseers could disapprove any license to a FRIENDLY
Government or customer on the assumption that their military would use it just
because its within their borders. It is unlikely that German forces will
revert to DES, but their interest in RSA or PGP or triple DES may have such
applications.  It would still be in the NSA's best interest to limit the
export of such software.

My major objection to the Bill as I have understood it is that Commerce, based
on advice from the intelligence community (i.e.  NSA), still has arbitrary
control over what encryption may be exported or not. How is this that much
different from what we have today?

This version of the Bill would still permit the Secretary to arbitrarily
restrict export of some algorithms with no technical benchmarks in place (i.e.
length of key, number of bits). There will be some algorithms that the U.S.
would want to restrict it would be a great help to all to compile a list of
accepted algorithms for export such as is done with computer exports which are
measured in MIPS.

In general, I like the Bill - we NEED it ! - but I feel that it leaves a lot
of room for confusion.

Let me know what your thoughts are on this - thanks.

Sharon Webb, President
National Computer Security Association Encryption Export Control Survey

The purpose of this survey is to quantify the business opportunities lost
because of the U.S. policy on the exportation of encryption algorithms such as
DES, RSA, etc. If we are to make ANY impact AT ALL, the security community
needs to let Congress that economic HARM is being done due to the export
control on encryption technologies.

Please take the time to fill this out and return it to NCSA NO
LATER THAN FRIDAY JANUARY 7, 1994.         NCSA FAX (717)
243-8642.

The results will be presented to Congress in order to further efforts to
release export controls on certain encryption technologies.

In the message below, I try to be careful to use "allegedly", "claimed", etc.,
to indicate information that I have been lead to believe was correct but that
I have not checked up on myself.  By using these words, I do not mean that the
statements are incorrect or correct, only that I am not sure of their
veracity.

On Friday, 8-Jan-1994, I received a message (apparently originally sent on
Tuesday) that discussed a certain company that was (allegedly) advertising
"free Internet access" but required you to Fax them a credit card number.
This message was from someone who claimed to be in a position of knowing all
the service providers in that area and had checked up on that company.  The
message indicated that the "Suite" address was just a P.O. Box at a non-US
Postal Service provider and the phone number just got you to voice mail.  The
message also indicated that the Internet address you would get was not
registered with the INTERNIC and was not in a couple of (milnet) hosts tables.

I took the message at face-value (I still have no reason to doubt the sender
or his intent) and sent a message to another very large and wide-spread
mailing list that was a warning about giving your credit card number out to
receive Internet access without checking out the company.  Thankfully, I chose
not to give the name of the company.

A few hours later, David Oppenheimer pointed out in a reply to that same
mailing list that the Internet address did in fact exist and was registered to
a company of the same name.  The addresses were different (different states)
but at this point, I suspect that it is the same company.

I received the original message as a private one from a friend and also saw it
distributed on a largish mailing list (to which it had been forwarded from
another mailing list).

(On Saturday, I informed the list I saw it on of the corrections that
Oppenheimer pointed out.)


I wonder how many people saw the original message that contained some
apparently incorrect information.  This kind of misinformation can spread so
quickly.  The corrections may not reach all the people who saw the first
message.

(I've just now learned of 8 other mailing lists it was forwarded to.)


There are some lessons to be learned:
        1.  Don't give your credit card number to anyone without checking
                them out.
        2.  Don't presume that the info in a message is correct just because
                someone sent it.
        3.  Don't be too quick to spread information that you haven't
                checked out personally.
                Misinformation can spread like wildfire.  Furthermore, for all
                I know (not being a lawyer), you might be held legally
                responsible for spreading it.
        4.  Don't presume that the sender of a message is who he says
                he is.  (NOTE:  The sender of the original message may
                really be who he says he is.  However, *I* haven't checked
                on that.)
        5.  After reading the above, how do you know I am who I say I am?

   [I know Mabry and he would never play tricks.  He's very reliable.  
   I also checked out the original offer.  It was indeed genuine, although
   somewhat misleading.  The Internet connections may have been free, but
   the users are still going to get stuck for higher-than-usual telephone
   charges.  PGN.]

Aerospace Daily carried some articles recently that may be able to shed some
light on the problems of software development. On 1/6/94, there was an article
on how rigid management appeared to have had a role in the Mars Observer
failure. On 1/7/94, there was a similar article on problems with the C-17. The
1/6/94 article was particularly interesting, as it suggested that the failure
of the Mars Observer had to do with the use of fuel system parts that had not
been qualified for deep space missions. This may have occurred due to
management turmoil, leading to the departure of technically-qualified middle
management. Without that layer of technical management, the risks of using
unqualified parts were not recognized during design reviews. The 1/7/94
article suggests that the C-17 problems were similarly due to a TQM program
that eliminated the echelon of technical management that was usually
responsible for ensuring a successful system integration.

These two data points are consistent with my experience on the BMDSTP program
(discussed in an earlier RISKS). Although, as I indicated, the middle-echelon
technical managers on that program were not markedly better than managers I've
met since then, they did possess the necessary expertise in their areas to
ensure a successful integration of that system. This suggests that the usual
management approach to the development of complex computer systems all too
often lacks an echelon of technical management necessary to the successful
integration of those systems. And it suggests TQM has exacerbated this by
eliminating that echelon in some organizations that had previously avoided
this problem.

Today's (Wednesday) San Jose Mercury News reports a hidden effect of the
LA quake this week. THe main electric feed to the LA area was knocked
out by the quake, darkening the whole basin. However, interdependencies
in the grid meant that power supplies went out as far away as Wyoming
and Alberta. 150,000 people were without power for three hours in Idaho.

It all goes to show just how interconnected things all are.

Associated Press writer David Reed reports that an out-of-work janitor pleaded
guilty to giving false radio commands to pilots around Roanoke Regional
Airport in Virginia. The phony controller, Rodney Eugene Bocook, called the
``Roanoke Phantom'' by legitimate controllers, would tell pilots to abort
landings, change altitudes and direction.  Although some pilots followed his
instructions, no serious incidents resulted. The phony instructions were sent
for six weeks last fall until FAA agents with transmitter-tracking equipment
found the source.  Bobcook pleaded guilty to giving pilots false information
and using profane language over the radio. His attorney claimed that Bobcook
was not fully able to understand the gravity of his actions or of
distinguishing right and wrong.  Under federal sentencing guidelines, it is
estimated that he will serve two years.

This raises interesting questions of authentication. Wouldn't it be possible
to add to air traffic messages some kind of ``signature'' that would help
receivers distinguish between legitimate and bogus messages?

&gt;From the United Press Intl newswire via Executive News Service (GO ENS) on
CompuServe:

  Hacker to ask charges be dropped

  SAN JOSE, Calif. (UPI, 04 Jan 1994) -- An attorney for a former Silicon
  Valley computer expert accused of raiding confidential electronic government
  files said Tuesday he will ask to have charges dismissed now that a federal
  judge has thrown out the government's chief evidence.
    Attorney Peter Leeming said the government's case against Kevin L. Poulsen
  is in disarray following a ruling suppressing computer tapes and other
  evidence seized from a rented storage locker in 1988.'

The article continues with the following key points:

o    Judge ruled that material taken from Poulsen's locker is inadmissable;

o    Poulson charged with espionage after alleged hacking into military and
     PacBell computers;

o    allegedly used phone phreaking techniques to interfere with radio
     station call-in lines, allowing him and his confederates to win
     thousands of dollars of prizes in contests, including cars;

o    maximum penalties up to 100 years imprisonment.

Defense To Halt Milnet Hackers
   NEW YORK--US defense officials, fearing computer hackers could invade their
data networks, are moving to limit military links to Internet -- the backbone
of the emerging information superhighway, a computer magazine said today.
Network World said a plan to add a protective gateway or relay to the
worldwide Defense Data Network--also known as Milnet--has touched off an
uproar among computer users both in and out of the Pentagon.
   A brief notice from the defense department's network planning group said
introduction of the gateway was due early in 1994, the magazine said.  So far
the plan has not been implemented, and Internet users said today they still
had direct computer links to the Milnet.
  A spokeswoman for the Pentagon had no comment on the report, but said the
department closely monitored computer security. "We are looking at ways to
protect the network against hackers and viruses," she said.
  Network World said critics of the plan argue the security relay can not
handle the volume of electronic mail and data that now flows daily between
Milnet and Internet users around the world.
  And they questioned why less drastic security measures, including so-called
firewalls common to US industry, have apparently been rejected by the
military.

The message below, from managers of wuarchive.wustl.edu, is one with
which readers of RISKS should be familiar.  How many of us are in the
same position?

For those of you who don't know, wuarchive.wustl.edu is one of the
largest and busiest Internet public archive sites, accessible via
anonymous FTP and other means.

----- From /README.NOW in wuarchive.wustl.edu -----
The entire archives were destroyed the afternoon of Thursday, January 13th
due to a bug in the system crash dump routines.  There have been serious
problems restoring backups due to a failed tape drive -- we have gotten a
loaner drive, but there may not be any recent viable backups of the archives.

Translation: everything was lost, the archive maintainers are scrambling
to find copies of all of the missing files -- it's probable that some
files were lost permanently.

Thanks for your patience,

Safety in Telescript

</i><PRE>

Phil Agre's message of January 6th ("Wild agents in Telescript?") brings
up some very good points. In this message I would like to describe some
of the safety features of Telescript that are used to prevent both
ill-intentioned scripts (e.g., worms, viruses) and buggy scripts from
damaging a Telescripted network.

1) The Telescript language is interpreted, rather than compiled. Thus,
Telescript programs cannot directly manipulate the memory, file system or
other resources of the computers on which they execute.

2) Every Telescript agent (i.e, Telescript program that can move around a
Telescript network) is uniquely identified by a telename. A telename
consists of two components: an authority which identifies the "owner" of
the agent (e.g., the Personal Communicator from which it originated) and
an identity which distinguishes that agent from any other agent of the
same authority. The authority component is cryptographically generated
and cannot be forged. Thus, when an agent is transferred from one
Telescript engine to another, it is possible to verify (using
cryptographic techniques) that the agent is indeed of the authority it
claims to represent. (N.B.: a Telescript engine is a program capable of
interpreting and executing Telescript programs).

3) Every Telescript agent has a permit which limits its capabilities.
Permits can be used to protect users from misprogrammed agents (e.g., an
agent that would otherwise "run away" and consume resources for which the
user would have to pay) and to protect Telescript service providers from
malicious agents. Two kinds of capabilities are granted an agent by its
permit. The first kind is the right to use a certain Telescript
instruction, e.g., the right to create clones of itself. The second is
the right to use a particular Telescript resource and by which amount.
For example, an agent is granted a maximum lifetime, a maximum size and a
maximum overall expenditure of resources (called the agent's allowance),
measured in teleclicks. An agent's permit is imposed when the agent is
first created and is renegotiated whenever that agent travels to an
engine controlled by a different administrative authority. If the agent
exceeds any of its quantitative limits, it is immediately destroyed by
the Telescript engine where it is executing.

4) Telescript agents move around a Telescript network by going from one
Telescript place to another. Telescript provides an instruction -- go --
that gives agents this travelling capability (if granted by their permit,
of course). Places are Telescript programs in their own right. Before
accepting an incoming agent, a place can examine the agent's telename,
permit and class (N.B.: an agent represents an instance of a Telescript
class; thus, the class of the agent represents the "program" that the
agent executes. Like authority names, class names cannot be forged).
Based on that information, the place can do any the following:

    a) Do not allow the agent to enter.

    b) Allow the agent to enter but only after imposing upon it a permit
more restrictive than the one it currently holds (e.g., the agent is only
allowed to consume 100 teleclicks while in this place).

    c) Allow the agent to enter and execute under its current permit.

5) When a Telescript process (agent or place) interacts with another
Telescript process, the telename and class of the former is available to
the latter. This enables Telescript applications to control who can
interact with them and in what ways.

I hope this (brief) description of some of the more pertinent security
features of Telescript will help Risks readers understand how we've
addressed the issues raised in the NYT article and in Phil's message.

Folks who are interested in the extent of industrial espionage (and thus the
need for secure networks and secure encryption) will want to check out the
lead story in January 6,1994 edition of the Wall Street Journal.

The details are more arcane than even the best spy novels, but the highlights
are:

* Information brokers would contact companies in the oil business and offer to
"help" them win contracts for a percentage. They provided information gained
through shmoozing and buying off insiders as part of their help.

* Illicit payments reported in the story paid to the industrial spies ranged
from $10,000 to $600,000. The contracts were worth $100 million and up.

* The Swiss government refuses to disclose information about the accounts
where the loot is deposited because it says that this sort of behavior is not
against the law in Switzerland.

At the end of December, after NBC Nightly News announced an address for
Internet email - "nightly@nbc.com" - I wondered if the other US television
networks had also established an Internet presence.  A quick check of the
Domain Name Service revealed the existence of "abc.com", "cbs.com", and
"fox.com".

A search in the InterNIC registration database showed that none of these
represented the organizations I would normally associate with those names.
Instead of TV networks, I found a design firm, a consultant, and an online
service.

The obvious risk is that of mistaken identity.

Less clear is the impact that such "misleading" email addresses may have on
the way people do business.  Increasing numbers of people do much of their
professional interaction via email.  Email addresses are appearing on business
cards and becoming as accepted as postal addresses.  The domain name portion
of an email address is coming to represent an organization.

Domain names are given out on a first-come-first-served basis.  This raises
several questions.  Will large companies consider "misleading" domain names to
violate their trademarks?  Will "misleading" domain names matching those or
large companies be registered with the intent of receiving compensation
for them when the companies eventually come on the Internet?

Not all the networks have been lagging behind, by the way - the Public
Broadcasting Service ("pbs.org") has been on the Internet for over a year.

   [By the way, I chided Matt for having such an amorphous net address.
   The "chron" gets grandfathered because of its early access to the Internet,
   and is actually the Houston Chron.  PGN]

Last night I purchased a Cellular phone.  While reading through the manual I
found a section labeled "Security features" Neat.  The manual talked about two
security codes, a 3 digit number to unlock the phone and a 6 digit number that
is used to change the unlock number and a number of other security features.
The 6 digit number can also be used to unlock the phone.  The 6 digit number
is not easily reprogrammed.

The 3 digit number was included with the documentation; however, I couldn't
find the 6 digit number.  So I called the technical help line.  Their answer
floored me.  "The 6 digit number is '123456', '654321', or all zeros.  Just
give one of them a try."  So much for security.

The manual did state that a different 6 digit number should be chosen
for each phone.  Sigh.

This is dated but worthwhile for readers of RISKS.  The Boston Globe of
December 15 published an column by Alex Beam about an academic battle over the
Harvard Semitic Museum.  The Museum has an outstanding collection but was
recently closed down, leading to very public battles involving many
celebrities. What caught my eye in Beam's description of the controversy is
the following quote:


"Stager (the museum's director) instructed his secretary to remove used fax
cartridges from the trash, unravel the carbonized ribbon and reconstruct the
staff's facsimile transmissions, to monitor surreptitious fund-raising&gt; (This
little trick won't work on modern laser-printed fax machines, in case you're
getting any ideas.)"

"Stager 'talked to the (Harvard) general counsel's office, and asked them if
it was against the law," his assistant, Eileen Caves, told the Harvard
Crimson.  They 'classified the carbon as ''abandoned material that was left in
a public place'' and said it was therefore public information."

Risks?  It may have happened at Harvard, it may be possible to reconstruct
messages, and it may be why lawyers should be buried 35 feet underground
since, deep down, they are very nice people.

Setting "NOMAIL" to leave a LISTSERV keeps open the option of an easy return,
but it may also lead to an unexpectedly full emailbox.  Early in January, I
began receiving regular messages from a LIST that I had set to NOMAIL in 1991;
the LIST owner told me I was set to NOMAIL, but messages only/stopped when I
sent an UNSUBSCRIBE message.  Earlier this week (JAN. 16), I received my first
update from RISKS in several years, under the same conditions, with my
membership set to NOMAIL.  Today, I received 80 messages from a LIST I had
left (through NOMAIL) about four years ago and quickly sent an UNSUBSCRIBE
message (which was acknowledged).

A student of mine has been doing research on a number of lists and a
substantial fraction of the respondents tell about similar phenomena?  Is the
NOMAIL setting really a time bomb that may flood your mail directory
unexpectedly?  (I was fortunate in TELNETing from Berkeley today just as the
avalanche had begun.)  If you have an explanation of this process, I would
appreciate hearing it.

on the conviction of a male nurse who hacked into a hospital's computer system
and modified entries, including prescriptions.

Tow or three weeks back, the Guardian Weekly (probably in its Le Monte
section) reported the widely spread practice (in may parts of the
world) of illegally obtaining human organs for reselling to transplant
patients.  Among the many methods (such as kidnapping), one is to
simulate heart failure on the monitoring machines in hospitals.

Proposal for new newsgroup on safety-critical systems
Comments please, to news.groups.

Proposed name: comp.safety or comp.safety-critical or comp.risks.safety ...

Charter
  A forum for discussion of the engineering and assessment of safety-critical
  systems, with special reference to computing.

Moderated group - Proposed moderator:
  Jonathan Moffett (jdm@minster.york.ac.uk)
  Senior Research Fellow in the High Integrity Systems Engineering Group
  Department of Computer Science, University of York, York YO1 5DD, England
  Tel: +44 (0)904 432788, Fax: +44 (0)904 432767

Discussion

The newsgroup would be a forum for discussions about systems safety which
could afford to be more detailed than comp.risks and more specialised than
comp.software-eng.  It would cover safety requirements and risks, safety
engineering techniques and safety assessment.  Its focus would be on
safety-critical computer systems and computer-supported design and assessment
of general system safety.

There is no newsgroup at present which deals specifically with systems
safety - in a search through the Usenet postings about newsgroups the
string "safe" appears only in rec.pyrotechnics, alt.irc.corruption and
warnings about humor.

There is of course comp.risks, with which the new group would overlap but not
compete; comp.risks is wider in scope than safety, and is not very much used
for technical discussions.  There would also be overlaps with:
comp.software-eng, which is a very high-activity group of which safety issues
are a very low proportion; and comp.specification[.z], because of the indirect
relationship (via high assurance) between formal specification and safety.
Other possible overlaps are comp.realtime and comp.human-factors.

There appear to be a gap in the market which a safety newsgroup could fill.

It should be moderated, because safety is a very sensitive issue, subject
both to flaming :-) and hoaxes.

    [A SAFE bet!  The proposal sounds like a good idea.  Be sure to send
    your comments to jdm and news.groups, but CC: RISKS if you like.  PGN]

Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both
of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in privacy
problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which risks to
privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
  a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
  full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

  as the BODY of a message to "privacy-request@vortex.com"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
  send to "privacy@vortex.com".

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@uwm.edu and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

&gt;This raises interesting questions of authentication. Wouldn't it be possible
&gt;to add to air traffic messages some kind of ``signature'' that would help
&gt;receivers distinguish between legitimate and bogus messages?

If there were to be such a voice authentication system, the information would
need to be readily available to every pilot. This includes not only those who
fly for large commercial airlines, but to every private (even student) pilot.
Any pilot who might use air traffic control (ATC) facilities would need to
know this data, and there are several hundred thousand of them. In addition,
for the same reason that visual flight rules (VFR) pilots must carry
aeronautical charts for the area they fly in, they would need to have the
authentication codes for the whole area. (In an emergency, you might wind up
at ANY airport within the flying radius of your airplane, especially if that
emergency was because you weren't where you thought you were.)

If the information is that readily accessible, the bad guys can get it, too.

An additional concern is that the airport vicinity is often not the place
where you want to require from pilots the extra effort (or time) required to
look up authentication codes before they follow instructions.

Some of this problem may be solved by the use of digital printed data, which
are in use in some aircraft. This will not filter down to the private aircraft
for many years.

Fernando Pereira makes the suggestion of adding a ``signature'' to air traffic
control messages as a means of verifying their authenticity.  This is an
interesting suggestion.  The comments below relate primarily to the Air
Traffic Control (ATC) system in the US.

The present system of air-to-ground communication has two components: VHF
voice and UHF radar transponders.  Currently, aircraft flying under Instrument
Flight Rules (under which all air carriers and many supplemental carriers are
required to operate) carry a transponder which is capable of replying to a
radar sweep with a 12-bit identification code and its altitude.  This is
referred to as a ``Mode C'' transponder.  It would be very difficult to
construct an unspoofable authentication code for either of these systems.

The FAA has plans to upgrade to ``Mode S'' transponders, which would give ATC
a digital uplink capability.  This would make it easier to implement a
verification code, but I have no idea whether this issue has been discussed by
the FAA.

The original date for adoption of the Mode S standard was 1992, but there has
been quite a bit of slippage.  Mode S transponders will be much more
expensive, of course, and smaller aircraft (both personal and corporate) will
probably continue using Mode C transponders and voice communication for some
time.

&gt;1) The Telescript language is interpreted, rather than compiled. Thus,
&gt;Telescript programs cannot directly manipulate the memory, file system or
&gt;other resources of the computers on which they execute.

Don't forget: that's what we all thought about fingerd.  RTM, Jr. showed us to
be wrong.

And even ignoring bugs like this, interpreted vs compiled isn't the real
issue.  Postscript is typically interpreted, but since it has operators that
access files and can manipulate the interpreter's standard dictionaries, virii
can be implemented with it.

Some of the access control features described may prevent these kinds of
intrusions, but until we see more details I think we are be justified in being
concerned.

We had our local unix-support by yesterday helping us out with a putative 
kernel reconfiguration; told me the following job after which he'd had to 
do the sorting out recently:

The two principal departments of Maths here, pure and applied, face each other
around a courtyard.  Someone had bunged an ethernet link out the window of one
and in the window of the other in order to get their PC in one attached to the
ethernet in the other.

When, in due course, we had a thunderstorm, the PC and the ethernet box on the
other end of the link were both totally cooked.  Fortunately, the damage
stopped there.  Let's hope they now stick in a gateway to connect the two
departments so no-one will try that again.

            Electronic Mail Fraud, by Lori Carrig

With the advent of Electronic Mail we have several risks associated with this
modern vehicle of information.  Of these risks one is E-Mail fraud.  Just like
with Mail and Telephone fraud, Electronic Mail fraud has come of age.  Before
I diverge into this problem let me set an example of an incident I worked on:

I received a notice from a user that she received E-Mail promoting computer
chips for sale from a internet address.   She had not received her items
which she paid for and wanted to report it.  She gave the following account:

She had received and responded to this address about the sale of the described
items.  After several exchanges of E-Mail from the culprit the price was
determined and she inquired to the method of payment for the desired items.
The culprit explained that they would only take Money Order.  The culprit
would accept a check, but would not ship the desired items until after the 
check has cleared.  A name and address was given, but no phone number, to send
the check to.  The culprit stated that they would ship the items after 5-7
days.  After 9 days the victim sent an E-Mail message to the culprit and
inquired if they received the check.  A message was sent back stating that
they did receive the check and was awaiting for it to clear the bank.  After
30 days the victim had not received the ordered, and paid for, items from the
culprits.

The risk here is quite apparent.  As with Mail and Telephone Fraud, E-Mail 
fraud can cause extreme losses to users.  What would prevent such an incident?
Well here are some of the ways I have seen:

	1.  Order from known companies like Intel, Microsoft, CompUSA, and so on.

	2.  Pay with an Credit Card.  You have the right to cancel the payment 
	    within 30 days if the items have not been received.  There is other
	    risks associated with giving you Credit Card number out, but I will
	    not address them at this time.

	3.  Request a phone number and call the vendor to confirm the order.  

The best prevention is number 1 above and common sense.  Know who you are
dealing with before any monetary exchange takes place.  Items 2 and 3 above
have other risks involved with them which, in turn, may be another form of 
fraud.

There are other samples of E-Mail fraud, but I will not address them at this
time.  I will leave that for future releases.  With the estimated losses to
Computer crime ranging from $3-6 billion dollars(1) it is cause for alarm.

If you suspect that you are a victim of E-Mail fraud, contact your local 
police department.  Please note that only 11% of computer crimes are ever
reported to law enforcement.(2)


The opinions above are mine only and DO NOT reflect any other parties position.

[Followup on election fraud report from last summer (fall?).]

A state grand jury in Denver has indicted eleven people for voter
fraud in Costella County, Colorado.  In 1990, the census found
2278 adults living in the county, but there were 2536 registered
voters.

Those indicted include:

 o County Clerk Roy David Martinez, charged with falsifying residency
   reports in the 3 November 1992 general election.

 o His wife, deputy clerk and recorder Mariconsuelo Stella Rodriquez,
   charged with allowing Martinez's sister, a non-resident of the county,
   to vote.

 o Costella County Commissioner George Valdez, charged with aiding and
   abetting voter fraud, threatening to withhold a county employee's
   pay unless he voted for Valdez, and enabling a jail inmate to vote
   absentee, all during the August 1992 primary.

 o former County Commissioner Ernest Leo Chavez, charged with helping
   an alien to vote absentee.

Also indicted were former County Commissioner Samuel Gonzales and his
wife Lisaida, Martinez's siter and brother-in-law, two sisters-in-law
of George Valdez and one of the latter's husband.

Lisaida Gonzales was registered to vote in both Costilla and El Paso
[Colorado Springs] counties.  The relatives of George Valdez were
registered in both Colorado and California since the 1940s.

The Schengen agreement stipulates the opening of borders between nine
countries of the European Community (the Twelve minus Great Britain, Ireland
and Denmark).  The agreement's implementation has already been delayed several
times but was now planned for February 1st. A report of the French Senate's
foreign affairs committee states that it won't be operational for another
year.  According to the chairman of the committee, Xavier de Villepin, the
culprit is the computer information system, which is not yet "operational".

[This is a politically charged issue, because of fears regarding security
(read terrorism) as well as illegal immigration from outside the European
Union.  I haven't seen any details about the problems of the "computer

This is from EDUPAGE, the summary service run for free by EDUCOM:

&gt; SATELLITES OUT.  Geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares knocked out
&gt; Canada's two communications satellites within hours of each other.
&gt; Affecting broadcasters, phone and cable companies, and other business
&gt; subscribers, they began to question the reliability of satellite
&gt; communications in the context of the info-highway and examine more
&gt; land-based means of transmission. (Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, 01/22/94 A1).

Does anyone have access to the original Globe &amp; Mail article cited, or more
info from another source?  Did this loss of equipment mean interrupted or
lost service, or did everything just switch to land lines?

When they say "knocked out," does that mean the satellite hardware is
damaged, or just that the software got wiped?

A quick description of dynamic binding: 
When a program is linked (the object files are put together,) certain common
routines (like the I/O calls) are copied from a standard library into
the executable file. This is called static binding. Dynamic binding allows
the library routines to be stored in one place and are joined with the
executable only when it is loaded to run. Dynamic binding saves space and 
allows libraries to be updated without re-linking executables. They also
can be deleted.

The other evening I stumbled upon an interesting single point failure for Sun
Microsystem computers. While working I distroyed the /lib/libc.so.0.15 file.
To my surprise nothing works without it. I already knew that Sun's defaulted
to dynamic binding at link time, I also knew that it was possible to suppress
this option by using the -Bstatic keyword to the link editor, ld(1). What
surprised me was that the static option had not been used when building any of
the user commands. I would have expected some of the most basic commands like
ls, cp, and either tar or dd to be compiled with static linking. If this were
the case repairing the /lib/libc.so.0.15 file would be simple. Instead I was
forced to reboot from tape, install the mini-kernel and then mount the
filesystem and restore the file.

I believe the engineers that developed the dynamic binding system understood
the implications of *every* program depending on a single file and kept the
static binding option to prevent this. However, if the OS designers never 
use the static option and the dynamic library is lost . . .

There's absolutely no RISK in this article, but I thought it might be
interesting to RISKS readers.

The 24 Jan 1994 *Washington Post* has an article about a new museum of
cryptography at NSA.  The author describes the runaround in trying to locate
it, finding the usual problem of NSA phone numbers which answer with
extensions and people who don't have names.  The article then goes on to
describe why cryptography is so important.

The museum contains all sorts of gems of the cryptography trade, including
some old ciphering machines, displays of Civil War use of SIGINT, Enigmas
(including one that can be tried out by museum visitors), and a Cray X-MP.

The museum is located in a building surrounded by barbed wire behind
an old gas station near Baltimore.  According to the author:
	The National Cryptologic Museum, reached by exiting the
	Baltimore-Washington Parkway east on Route 32 and heading
	behind the Shell station, is open from 9am to 3pm Monday
	through Friday.  Some at NSA say you can reach it at
	301-688-5849.  Others at NSA deny that number exists.
I haven't been there (if it in fact exists :-), and would be interested
in hearing from others if it's worth the trip.

Contrary to this gloomy picture, past two decades of research in
distributed computing, especially in naming and authentication, seems
to suggest that (1) naming information can be made globally available
and (2) authentication data can be widely distributed without
compromising security (e.g., using public-key certificate technology).

In Vol 15, issue 40, Jim Wolper stated that it would be difficult to implement
digital signatures into the IFF transponder system.  The military has been
doing this for many years now.  There is an IFF mode in which there is an
encrypted "code of the day" transmitted by the interregator set, to which only
a properly keyed tranponder will reply.  In a very similar way, the military
mode of TACAN can encrypt ident and radial information to deny use of our
TACAN to an enemy.  And of course, the military can encrypt Global Position
System transmissions to deliberately degrade it's use by non military users.

So it's not that difficult, just expensive to implement.

&gt; an out-of-work janitor pleaded guilty to giving false radio commands
&gt; to pilots

On January 25, the Brisbane Courier-Mail reported the following:

  A teenager with a $70 radio in his bedroom intercepted air traffic control
  channels and told two airline pilots to abort landings.  The 17-year-old air
  cadet, obsessed with planes, also gave false reports of planes in distress
  and falsely instructed other aircraft for two weeks in December last year.
  He had learnt how to intercept radio transmissions as a member of the air
  cadets and from his time in the air traffic control tower on work experience
  as a Year 10 student.  The control tower had been aware that someone had
  been abusing the system in the area and had been on extreme alert to make
  sure the pilots received correct instructions.

The lad has pleaded guilty to prejudicing the safe operation of aircraft.  He
is undergoing psychiatric assessment, and will be sentenced on March 28.

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.35.html">RISKS-15.35</A>, Mich Kabay reports on a Washington Post newswire story about
the Government spending on an Intelligent Vehicle and Highway System, which is
intended to provide a variety of advances leading up to the dream of
computer-controlled cars.

The article is sub-titled "Washington's Latest Billion Dollar Boondoggle", so
we know right off how it will be slanted.  The story is the flip side of the
"sales job" articles one too often sees.  Were the director of this program to
write a press release, it would certainly discuss all the great potential,
including the potential of parts of the system no one really has any idea how
to build, and none of the problems.  The Post article discusses all the
problems, including all the problems of versions of the system no one would
consider building, without considering any of the possible advantages.  In
fact, one can look through the article and construct a guide to "how to write
an article about the RISKS of a newly proposed system".  Thus:

1.  Compare to a system everyone loves to hate - no matter how little it has
to do with the issue at hand:

	"Government spending on the little-known Intelligent Vehicle and
	Highway Systems (IVHS) program is expected to exceed $40 billion
	over the next 20 years. (By comparison, in the first 10 years of the
	Strategic Defense Initiative, Washington spent $30 billion.)"

A more relevant comparison might be to the expected outlay of money over the
next ten years on, oh, repaving existing roads, upgrading bridges, and so on.
Also, how much of this cost is for development, and how much for deployment?
SDI was all development costs.  Deployment of almost anything on the scale of
the national highway system - even something as simple as traffic lights to
help control entry at busy on-ramps - quickly runs into the billions.

2.  Demand proof before anything at all can be done:

	"claims of improved safety are unproven"

3.  Assume a system model that is known not to be applicable:

	"central computer failures could lead to massive accidents"

It's hard to imagine any reason for centralized control of such a system.  Has
anyone actually proposed this?

4.  Demand that the system solves problems that are outside of its purview:

	"proposed fuel savings from smoother driving could be lost through
	higher speeds"

	"minor attention given to smart public transport, priorities for
	high-occupancy vehicles"

Even if this is true, so what?  Fuel savings are a social good; so is higher
speed commuting.  A smart highway system would give society the ability to
make tradeoffs between them, to any desired degree.  In what way is this a
negative?

Smart public transport - whatever that might mean - would be a social good if
we could get people to use it, but the fact of the matter is that most of the
population long ago "voted with their feet" in preferring cars - and not
"high-occupancy vehicles" at that - to public transport.  This project does
not attempt to join the long list of failed efforts to convince people that
they really would prefer to be on a bus or train; it attempts to provide a
better implementation of the choice they've already made.  Again, why is this
a negative?

5.  When in doubt, name some big companies that like the idea - that can
always be relied upon to generate uproar:

	"main proponent of scheme is IVHS America, supported by 500
	organizations including IBM, AT&amp;T, Rockwell, General Motors,
	Chrysler, Ford"

6.  Always, always stress the dangers to people, but don't mention the hazards
of existing systems.

	"Participants in RISKS will shudder at the thought of testing computer
	programs design to control thousands of cars in lockstep at 200 kph.
	I wouldn't enjoy being part of the beta-test population."

	"proponents concerned with limiting liability for failures"

	"I find the concern with legal liability an alarming indication of
	where we're headed."

The current "human controlled" highway system kills, what, 50,000 people a
year?  It has no effective mechanism for keeping significant numbers of drunk,
drugged, or otherwise incapable drivers from wreaking havoc.  It has no
effective mechanism for getting drivers to respond rationally to such problems
as inclement weather.  Dealing with the ice on the roads here the last week
or so isn't nearly as scary as dealing with the idiots who think that four-
wheel-drive will magically allow them to steer and stop at high speed no
matter how slick the roads are.

The legal liability issue grows right out of this:  Under the current legal
system, evidence that something is less risky than what it replaced is not
considered relevant; all that's considered relevant is that the system that
actually *is* in effect hasn't prevented some injury.  The current driving
system is tolerated because it spreads the legal risk.  If a new system cut
the risk 100-fold, so that only 500 people a year died because of system
problems, virtually everyone would consider that an unalloyed good - but if
the result were 500 successful, massive lawsuits against whoever created,
installed, and ran the new system, it would quickly collapse.

7.  Make the technical problems appear clearly insoluble:

	"Participants in RISKS will shudder at the thought of testing computer
	programs design to control thousands of cars in lockstep at 200 kph.
	I wouldn't enjoy being part of the beta-test population."

	"I wonder how much attention will be paid to deliberate or accidental
	interference?"

	"How will partial or total breakdown of the control systems be
	handled?  Car-to-car signalling?"

	"Presumably information will be transmitted through radio-frequency
	modems.  What will the unique identifiers be for each car.  What
	happens if two cars have the same identifier?"

	"What methods will be put into place to prevent spurious instructions
	from being accepted by car controllers?"

Sorry, but none of these strike me as particularly difficult problems.  200kph
requires reaction times that are not a problem with even fairly stupid control
systems.  "Thousands of cars" are not a problem unless one visualizes a system
that controls them all from a central location.  In fact, traffic control
is the ultimate distributed problem, since the automobiles involved are
distributed all over the world.  The short-term choices that an automobile
controller must make involve information about at most a few tens of other
automobiles.  Sure, long-term planning of routes and such requires more global
information, but this is not a safety issue, and is not time-critical.

It is easy to design "fail safe" modes for automobiles when there is some kind
of system failure; all that's necessary is to gradually slow to a stop.  In
fact, this is something we handle rather poorly today - consider what happens
when a front tire blows out in heavy, rapid traffic, or the repeated instances
of multi-car collisions when visibility drops.  Almost any reasonable system
would be an improvement, and would probably save lives.

This also relates back to point 3, "Assume a system model that is known not
to be applicable".  While the article didn't happen to address this point,
complaints about the difficulty of creating such systems usually assume that
the most advanced form (full computer control) will exist in parallel with
the current system (full human control, pedestrians, bicyclists) on the same
roads.  That makes the system much, much harder - but why would we wish to
build it that way?  Highways today already assume limited access; why would we
not designate some highways - or perhaps lanes of existing highways isolated
by crash barriers - for computer controlled use only?

Really, I can't believe anyone is concerned about the difficulty of ensuring
that every car has a unique identifier.  If it bothers you, use a 512-bit id
and have the car pick one randomly every time it is turned on.  The chance of
a clash should be comparable to the chance that all the molecules in the car's
gasoline simultaneously happen to break apart in a spectacular fireball.  It
would also make it much harder to track a particular automobile.  Then again,
why does a car need a globally-unique identifier anyway unless you assume the
model of a single, central controller?

That leaves the security issues, which are of course quite real and worthy of
significant concern and careful design.  But do they really look daunting
enough to make the whole project clearly impossible?  One important effect of
almost any technology is that it increases the "leverage" an individual has.
This "leverage" can be used for many purposes, some of them malignant.  What's
important are the tradeoffs.

As an interesting exercise, one can apply the seven techniques outlined
above - there are undoubtedly others, like "argue that the system will
disproportionately injure the poor" - to argue, early this century, that
automobiles should not be developed to replace horses.  For example:

	2.  Demand proof before anything at all can be done:

We know how reliable horses are.  Can you prove that you can build a gas
engine as reliable as a horse?

	3.  Assume a system model that is known not be be applicable:

It's one thing to keep supplies of hay and oats at home, but would you want
everyone to keep a tank of gasoline at home to keep his car filled up?  Think
of the fire hazard!

	5.  When in doubt, name some big companies that like the idea - that
	can always be relied upon to generate uproar:

Actually, you can list some of the same companies....

And so on.

I think the discussion of telescript risks here so far misses the two
most important points:

(1) It doesn't really matter whether telescript agents "directly manipulate the
    memory, file system, or other resources of the computers on which
    they execute"!  If they're going to be useful as "agents", they're
    going to be authorized to use the interfaces of their host systems
    to do some amount of useful work.  Presumably, since users don't want
    to administer authorization on a user-by-user basis when the potential
    user set is "everyone on the worldwide internet", either:

    (a) The telescript agent on most machines is going to be a "somewhat
        privileged" or "highly privileged" trusted program, with access
        to a useful set of system services, utilities, and applications, or

    (b) The telescript agent on most machines isn't going to have access
        to much useful functionality.

    If (b) turns out to be the default, then our worries are limited.
    The worst permutation of (a) is that everyone installs the telescript
    agent on his workstation as the equivalent of a "setuid root" program,
    which allows it to do anything it wants.....  Then it's just a matter
    of the "bad guy" writing a program in the interpreted language which
    invokes the desired functions on the remote machine.....

    The bad guy will *of course* be able to do this -- the whole *point*
    of Telescript is to make it easy to write programs which can invoke
    arbitrary functions on remote machines.

    The point here is that regardless of how much *mechanism* support is
    built into Telescript, the real problem is the complexity of administering
    authorization policy in a network in which:

    (a) There is no central administrative authority (i.e. most machines
        have their own unique security administrators), and

    (b) The people generating requests (i.e. releasing telescript programs
        into the network) have no idea where those requests are going to
        end up.

(2) But of course the really bad problem which isn't addressed by any
    authentication or access control mechanism is the problem of emergent
    behavior in the network.  Nobody knows what the dynamics of a network
    filled with end-user-written, self-routing "semi-intelligent" agents
    is.  My bet is that IP storms are nothing compared with the weather
    we're going to get when substantial numbers of these agents start
    roving around....

Some serious naivete here ...

	"You don't need to worry about spreading viruses if you
	transfer data disks (say, word processing or spreadsheet files)
	between computers."

It's not so.  People can, and do, spread viruses by carrying Macintosh
data disks from one machine to another.  Spreading viruses via PC data
disks is a bit harder, but does happen.

	"Well, hopefully if it comes to that one of our Heroic

I have seen malicious programs whose source was written in such a way
that a careful read wouldn't necessarily betray its malicious
character.

CYBERSPACE SUPERHIGHWAYS: ACCESS, ETHICS and CONTROL

Cyberspace, Information Superhighway, National Information Infrastructure,
Open Platforms, Computer and Communications Revolution, Electronic Networks,
Digital Data Bases and Information Society are words and phrases common to the
rhetoric of our modern era.  The relationships between and among individuals,
society, nations, government entities and business organizations are in
constant flux as new stresses and alliances change the old "rules of the
game."  Today's challenges are to define what is the "game," who owns the
"franchises," who can play, what are the rules and who calls the shots.
Information and communications technology raise new issues for freedom and
privacy in this new era.  Such questions are on the agenda as the participants
in CFP'94 consider the alternatives and seek some solutions.  Come, join in
the dialogue that will help to shape the world's future!

PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS

On Wednesday March 23, the day before the formal conference begins, CFP '94 is
offering a number of in-depth tutorials covering a wide variety of subjects on
five parallel tracks.  These presentations will be interesting, educational,
thought-provoking and often controversial.  The tutorials are available at a
nominal additional registration cost.

CONFERENCE NEWSPAPER

On each of the three days of the conference, a daily newspaper will appear to
highlight what has transpired and announce important coming events.  The staff
of "The Decisive Utterance," The John Marshall Law School's student newspaper,
is providing this service.


CONFERENCE RECEPTION AND TECHNOLOGY DISPLAY

On Wednesday evening, from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m., you are invited to meet new
and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception at the John Marshall
Law School from 6:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. The School is only two blocks from the
conference hotel.  A state-of-the-art computer lab will be used to demonstrate
high-tech applications in academia and registrants will be invited to take
part.

SINGLE-TRACK MAIN PROGRAM

The technological revolution that is driving change in our society has many
facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit together, especially
those parts that lie outside one's own daily experience. An important goal of
CFP '94 is to bring together individuals from disparate disciplines and
backgrounds and engage them in a balanced discussion of CFP issues.  To this
end our main program, starting on Thursday, March 24, is on a single track
enabling registrants to attend all sessions.  The concurrent Birds-
of-a-Feather meetings Thursday after 9:15 p.m. are exceptions.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER SESSIONS (BoF)

CFP '94 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to interested
individuals for informal "Birds of a Feather" sessions after the formal
program Thursday, from 9:15 p.m. - 11:15 p.m.  These sessions will provide an
opportunity for special-interest discussions. For further information or to
request a BoF contact CFP '94 Program Coordinator, Gary Gassman, at the John
Marshall Law School (6gassman@jmls.edu)

MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY GALA

Registrants are invited to a very special reception and buffet at Chicago's
famed Museum of Science and Industry where they also will be treated to a
private showing and demonstration of the MSI's newly-opened Communications and
Imaging Exhibits.  These multi-million dollar presentations occupy 15,000
sq.ft. of museum space and required three years to develop.  "Communications"
is a panoramic display of how technology has transformed our lives by
dissolving distance and and making connections; visitors can even enter the
unreal world of virtual reality. "Imaging" is a mindboggling journey through
modern applications of imaging technology.  Visitors can even play the role of
brain surgeon, using radiosurgery made possible by 3-D imaging, or explore
imaging in forensic science by using MRI, fingerprint enhancement, face aging
and other modern technologies to solve a crime!

REGISTRATION WILL BE LIMITED

CFP '94 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise you to
register early to assure admission and to take advantage of the early
registration discounts.

MEALS AND RECEPTIONS

A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction between the
diverse communities that constitute our audience.  To promote this interaction
CFP '94 provides three luncheons, three receptions and three evening meals

9:00 a.m. - noon

     Cyberspace Law for Non-Lawyers
     This tutorial presents an outline of the law for laymen,
     dealing with Constitutional and legal issues that confront
     those concerned with privacy, crime, and freedom of expression
     in cyberspace. There will be summaries of recent cases,
     legislative proposals and government activities.
          Mike Godwin, Online Counsel, EFF

     Rules of the Road for Network Travelers. (CLE Credit Approved)
     The information superhighway presents a variety of rights and
     risks.  Learn about the legal issues of computer networks,
     services and bulletin boards, including on-line property
     rights; protecting personal privacy and business information;
     electronic publishing and multimedia rights; viruses, adult
     materials and other no-nos.
          Lance Rose, Attorney and Author of "Syslaw."

     Get Mad, Get Motivated, Get Moving!
     The focus of this panel is on citizen action for privacy
     protection: how to reach and organize constituents; support
     legislation or other privacy protection measures; conduct
     public education activities; use the technology in program
     activities, etc.
          Robert Ellis Smith, Privacy Journal

     Exploring Internet: A Guided Tour
     This tutorial gives participants a practical introduction to
     the most popular and powerful applications available via the
     world's largest computer network, the Internet.  There will be
     hands-on demonstrations of communications tools such as e-
     mail, conferencing, Internet Relay Chat and resource discover,
     and navigations aids such as Gopher, WAIS, Archie and World
     Wide Web.  Extensive documentation will be provided.
          Mark Graham, Pandora Systems

     Using the Freedom of Information Act
     The Federal FOIA is the principal focus of this tutorial
     though some attention is given to the use of  state FOIAs.
     The session will cover procedures for making requests,
     identifying the information desired, differences between
     electronic and hard copy responses, and the appeals process
     within agencies and the courts.
     David Sobel, Counsel, Computer Professional for Social
     Responsibility

     2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

     Cryptography: What, and How?
     Data encryption is in the cyberspace limelight as perhaps the
     only technique to ensure digital privacy and security; it is
     also the subject of sharp debate regarding control of the
     development and use of the technology.  This tutorial will
     display what encryption is, how it works, and some of the
     options for its use.  Computer animations and graphic displays
     will be used to help make cryptography comprehensible; the
     audience will engage in some hands-on encryption exercises.
          Mark Hellmann, Pattishall, McAuliffe et.al, Chicago

     Electronic Detectives: Critical Issues for Public and Private
     Investigators.
     Both governmental and private sector investigators have
     unprecedented access to "open" sources that were practically
     inaccessible a few years ago.  This information environment
     poses opportunities and risks that will be the focus of this
     program.  Investigative techniques via networks will be
     demonstrated and the legal, ethical and practical issues will
     be explored.  Actual case-studies will be utilized.
     Michael Moran, CCO; Michael Robertson, CFE

     Hi-Tech Intellectual Property Law Primer (CLE Credit Approved)
     This panel will cover the special problems in patent,
     copyright and tradmark law engendered by computers and digital
     technology, with attention to the impact of recent cases.  The
     differences in European protection will be surveyed as well as
     technology export restrictions.
          Raymond Nimmer, University of Texas Law School
          Leslie A. Bertagnolli, Baker &amp; McKenzie, Chicago

     Transactional Data Analyses: Making FOI Access Useful
     Electronic communication, coupled with federal and state
     Freedom of Information Acts, has made a great deal of data
     available to the public regarding the activities and policies
     of government enforcement and regulatory agencies.  Knowing
     how to evaluate and use this information is critical to
     understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.
     The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of
     Syracuse University uses its various knowledge-bases to
     demonstrate the power of transactional data.  Colorgraphics
     and analytic techniques are combined in demonstrations of how
     otherwise drab statistics can be displayed dramatically to aid
     in policy analyses and advocacy.
          David Burnham, former New York Times Investigative Reporter
          Susan Long, Co-director, TRAC, SUNY-Syracuse

     Election Fraud and Modern Technology
     There has been increasing attention, in the U.S. and abroad,
     to the use of modern technology in the electoral process.
     Buying votes, stealing votes, changing votes -- whether in the
     environment of punch-cards or fully automated voting machines
     -- is the subject of this tutorial.  Mock elections will be
     staged in which the participants have roles in planning to
     perpetrate as well as prevent vote fraud.  Voter registration,
     phone-based voting, cryptography and verification are among
     the strategies and technologies to be considered.
     Russel L. Brand, Reasoning Systems.

SPECIAL EVENTS ON WEDNESDAY, Mar. 23:

Noon - 4:00 p.m.,  Privacy International Business Meeting
     This meeting, at the John Marshall Law School, begins with a

9:00 a.m.  Keynote Address:  Mr. John Podesta, Assistant to the
          President, Washington, D.C.

10:00 a.m. Break

10:30 a.m.  The Information Superhighway: Politics and the Public
           Internet.
     The Administration and Congress propose policies that will
     lead to a digital multimedia highway.  How can the road be
     built at affordable cost while serving the public interest and
     our constitutional values?
     Chair: Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation


12:00 p.m.  Lunch
               Speaker: U.S. Senator Paul Simon (Invited)

1:30 p.m.  Is It Time for a U.S. Data Protection Agency?
     Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, proposals to establish
     an oversight body for data protection have been offered but
     not adopted; another proposal is currently pending in
     Congress.  Against a background of almost twenty years
     experience under the Privacy Act, the panel will consider
     whether the current political, economic and technological
     mileau favors establishment of a data protection agency.
     Chair: Priscilla M. Regan, George Mason University

 2:45 p.m.  Break

 3:00 p.m.  "Owning and Operating the NII: Who, How, When?"
     The National Information Infrastructure is an important
     initiative for the present Administration.  This panel will
     explore policy and technical issues such as equity and access,
     connectivity and standards, funding and regulation, privacy
     and security, ownership and operation.
     Chair: Marc Rotenberg, Computer Professionals for Social

 4:15 p.m.  Break

 4:30 p.m.  Data Encryption: Who Holds The Keys?
     Recent attempts, led by federal law enforcment agencies, to
     control the development and dissemination of strong
     cyptography programs has engendered considerable discussion
     and disagreement.  The interests of law enforcement agencies
     may conflict with the need for data security and personal
     privacy demanded by users of electronic networks.  This panel
     will evaluate proposals to deal with the question.
     Moderator: Willis Ware, Rand Corporation

5:30 p.m. Adjourn

6:00 p.m.  EFF Awards Reception
     Once again, the Electronic Frontier Foundation hosts a

Friday, March 25, 1994.

8:30 a.m.  Keynote: David Flaherty, Data Protection Commissioner,
           Victoria, British Columbia

9:15 a.m.  Health Information Policy
     The Clinton Health Reform Plan, and variations on that theme,
     stress the use of information technology to help the
     efficiency and effectiveness of health care.  Expert
     consultation, improved service delivery through new
     technology, and improvements in the processing of health
     insurance claims bring promise of cost cuts as well as the
     possibilities of threats to personal privacy.  This panel of
     experts will form the "CFP Group" to explore these promises
     and threats.
     Chair: Robert R. Belair, Mullenholz &amp; Brimsek, Wash., D.C.

10:30 a.m.  Break

10:45 a.m.  Can Market Mechanisms Protect Consumer Privacy?
     When does protection of consumer privacy require legal
     standards and government regulation and when can bargains and
     agreements in the market suffice?  What role do new
     technological options for individuals and organizations play
     in facilitating private choice and market transactions?  Is
     "ownership" of personal information a useful concept or a dead
     end for privacy protection in an information age?
     Chair: Dr. Alan F. Westin, Columbia University

Noon      Lunch, Speaker: Philip Zimmerman, PGP

1:30 p.m.  Creating an Ethical Community in Cyberspace
     The fundamental ethical questions posed by the "settlement" of
     cyberspace are not new.  What is new is that the relationship
     between behavior and the ethical conceptions by which we judge
     behavior shift and become more ambiguous and vague.  This
     sessions examines the ethical dilemmas brought about by the
     "colonization" of cyberspace that must be resolved to
     establish and maintain a stable, humane environment.
     Chair: Prof. James Thomas, Northern Ilinois University

2:45 p.m.  Break

3:00 p.m.  Standards for Certifying Computer Professionals
     The subject of licensing of computer professionals is
     receiving increased attention by professional organizations
     and by state legislatures.  Both the ACM and IEEE have
     proposals under study, and perhaps a half-dozen states are
     considering licensing bills.  This panel will consider the
     pros and cons and suggest some standards for certification.
     Chair: Donald Gotterbarn, East Tennessee State Univ.

4:15 p.m.  Break

4:30 p.m.  Hackers and Crackers: Using and Abusing the Networks
     This session will explore issues surrounding the "fringe" of
     network use.  What can and should be exchanged?  Who will
     monitor "appropriate" use?   What's the current difference, if
     any, between "hacker" and "cracker"?  What should be expected
     and accepted regarding the role of law enforcement agencies?

5:30 p.m. Adjourn

5:45 p.m. Buses begin departing for the Chicago Museum of Science
          and Industry for a private reception and demonstration at
          the Communications and Imaging exhibits.

          Chicago's "Loop."

Saturday, March 26, 1994

9:00 a.m.  The Role of Libraries on the Information Superhighway
     As the information landscape changes dramatically the historic
     role of libraries as the "information commons" is challenged.
     How will the Carnegie ideal of free, public access be
     implemented by the library community?  Should it be?  This
     panel will consider policy for an information network in the
     public interest.
     Moderator: Tamara J. Miller, President, Library and
                Information Technology Association

10:15 a.m. Break

10:30 a.m.  International Governance of Cyberspace: New Wine in Old
               Bottles -- Or Is It Time For New Bottles?
     Much discussion transpires between members of the Economic
     Community, the O.E.C.D., the Council of Europe, and the United
     States, regarding data protection, intellectual property
     rights, transborder data flow, the mediation of disputes, etc.
     This panel will consider whether existing mechanisms can solve
     the problems or a new structure for the governance of
     cyberspace is needed.
     Chair:  Ronald L. Plesser, Piper and Marbury

Noon:  Lunch
          Speaker: Simon Davies, Director General, Privacy
          International

1:30 p.m. The Electronic Republic: Delivery of Government Services
        over the Information Superhighway
     State and local governments use computer networks to deliver
     a wide range of services and information to the public;
     electronic "kiosks" are moving to "government by ATM."  How
     will this interaction between government and the people affect
     the process of American government in the future?
     Chair: Dennis McKenna, Publisher, "Government Technology."

2:45 p.m.  Break

3:00 p.m. Education and NREN, K - 12
     Internetworking is a very new technology being rapidly
     deployed to conventional classrooms, a very old technology.
     The panel will explore the clash of contradictory assumptions
     embedded within these systems -- a clash which has profound
     implications for the future of both the network and the
     classrooom.
     Chair: Steven Hodas, NASA NREN Project


4:00 Break

4:15 p.m.  Guarding the Digital Persona
     After this panel has established the threats to personal
     privacy from individual profiling and target marketing, and a
     regime to legally recognize and protect an "electronic
     personality" is put forth, Bruce Sterling will offer to
     explain why much of that worry is misdirected!
     Chair: Roger Clarke, Australian National University

For those of you who think floating point computation is easy, I recommend as
an antidote:

    Jean-Francois Colonna, The Subjectivity of Computers
    Communications of the ACM, v.36,n.8, August 1993

where he demonstrates the five **algebraically equivalent** formulae for
computing x[n] = (R+1)x[n-1] - Rx[n-1]**2 produce wildly different 
results even for fairly innocuous values of R and x[0].

   The trouble began with Telesat's Anik E-1 going down. This caused major
problems for the Canadian Press news agency and its affiliate Broadcast News,
as well as several other organizations. One casualty was telephone service to
the North.
   After eight hours, Anik E-1 was brought back on line but within minutes,
Anik E-2, the country's main broadcast satellite, also went on the fritz.
   This knocked out TV transmission of several specialty channels, including
CBC Newsworld (24 hour news service), to all areas where there are no fibre
optics.  These channels were switched to other satellites and most services
were restored in a couple of days.
   Anik E-2 cost about $350 million to send up, and is not insured.
Montreal-based Telesat says it is working on a possible rescue plan that could
take months. For the time being, the satellite is expensive space junk.
   The coincidence of the two failures sparked all kinds of speculation:
that either someone at Telesat screwed up big time, or a disgruntled grunt
(perhaps from sweeping layoffs recently) sabotaged the bird. There was also
a suggestion Telesat engineers damaged E-2 while trying to get E-1 back in
business. These scenarios have all been denied. The official line is that an
unusually strong magnetic storm did the damage (although other satellites
nearby were not affected).

The Toronto Star, January 27, 1994, p.D2.

OTTAWA (Special [Southam News]) -- Canada's main broadcast satellite may
resume operating within three months, the president of Telesat Canada says.
``It is my firm belief we will restore service", Larry Boisvert told reporters
Tuesday at the company's suburban Ottawa headquarters.  Technicians are trying
to use the satellite's 10 thrusters, normally used only to control major
variations in position, to restore the fine aim needed to offer full service.

As of yesterday morning, Telesat had restored all service lost last week
except for channels used by two broadcast channels and eight channels usd by
Telesat's telephone company owners.  The company is also unable to offer
television news services live feeds for mobile crews.  The current troubles
mean the company will again lose money in 1994, Boisvert said.

Meanwhile, Telesat technicians say there is no way to repair the damage
inflicted last Thursday on the $286 million satellite's stabilization system
by a space energy storm.  The technicians are, however, trying to devise a
novel method of keeping the Anik E-2's antennae pointed at earth, working with
the device's U.S.-based subcontractor.

The damaged satellite is not insured.

This isn't the story as it usually is told.  ;-)

True the two maths departments (applied maths and theoretical physics (DAMTP)
and pure maths and mathematical statistics (DPMMS)) are next door to each
other, and that DAMTP was involved in this, but DPMMS wasn't (to the best of
my knowledge.)  Nice rumour though, blame the pure maths dept.

When I joined DAMTP in September '91 it was the week following the largest
thunderstorm in several years.  Sure enough many machines had got fried by
the storm.  Mainly it was serial lines which had died, though a few other
bits and pieces had also been zapped.

We did however see a large number of giant packet storms on one of our first
floor segments afterwards.  A number of people were involved in the tracking
down of the fault, as it didn't seem to be any of the machines on the
network.  After a while the link going outside and over into manufacturing
Engineering (Eng-Div E), was found and it turned out that the fault was a PC
at the far end of this wire which had lost all sense and was filling the net
with garbage.  The network was terminated before the window in DAMTP and we
were happy.

Later checks showed that this had been installed temporarily (several years
before) as building work was expected to disrupt the area where fibre links
were laid but had never actually happened.

We had the now much shorter segment on the first floor TDR'd and found it
was over a 100M over max length.  How long it was when it ran half way round
Eng-Div E is unknown.

Much later when searching for a fault on the ground floor we found another
cable going out of a window, and cut it back/terminated it.  Noone
complained so we don't know where it had gone in the past.

Before anyone points out just how bad our network is, let me say "WE KNOW" The
ethernet in this building was installed by someone who didn't know what they
were doing.  They worked for the UCS and we can't get funds to replace it.  We
had no records of where cables go, nor their lengths.  As time passes we are
replacing/rewiring sections piecemeal.  As I stare at the 2 30M coils of coax
on the wall behind my desk which stop my feet getting tangled in the ethernet
I wonder how many other networks like this one there are.

All links between DAMTP and DPMMS are done with fibre, and always have been.
DAMTP and DPMMS are MAC level connected so there is/was no need for other
links.  Indeed at the time of the incident DAMTP and DPMMS shared at least 2
machines (though no longer.)

It isn't clear that unix-support had anything to do with this, other
than they got told the story like everyone else who visits us.

The risks are obvious, never believe anything that unix-support tells you!

Something like this happened recently on ECOLOG-L (sci.bio.ecology on 
Internet).  I forget the specifics, but basically a mailed-in submission 
somehow triggered a flood of duplicate messages being sent out.  In order
to stop the replication the list owner set everybody's status to NOMAIL
but there was no record of which users were already in NOMAIL status thus
there was no way to reverse the process once the error was fixed except by 
setting everybody back to MAIL status.

I don't know if this was the listserver in question, but am cc-ing to the
list owner who might be able to explain it more fully.

Setting "NOMAIL" to leave a LISTSERV keeps open the option of an easy return,
but it may also lead to an unexpectedly full emailbox.  Early in January, I
began receiving regular messages from a LIST that I had set to NOMAIL in 1991;
the LIST owner told me I was set to NOMAIL, but messages only/stopped when I
sent an UNSUBSCRIBE message.  Earlier this week (JAN. 16), I received my first
update from RISKS in several years, under the same conditions, with my
membership set to NOMAIL.  Today, I received 80 messages from a LIST I had
left (through NOMAIL) about four years ago and quickly sent an UNSUBSCRIBE
message (which was acknowledged).

A student of mine has been doing research on a number of lists and a
substantial fraction of the respondents tell about similar phenomena?  Is the
NOMAIL setting really a time bomb that may flood your mail directory
unexpectedly?  (I was fortunate in TELNETing from Berkeley today just as the
avalanche had begun.)  If you have an explanation of this process, I would
appreciate hearing it.

List Management is more art than science ... I know, I'm a list-owner
of multiple lists at multiple host locations.  As good as the Revised
LISTSERV software is, the list owners, users, and sysadmins can and
do make mistakes (like the time I accidentally added another college
president to a list that I maintained when I mistyped the userid).
 
One of the features of R-LISTSERV is for the owner to make changes to
recipients' options, using various wild-card techniques ... without asking for
confirmation, or for what the options were before they were set.
 
Also, a user can be subscribed under multiple userids, yet only receive a
single distribution.  Why? so that (s)he can post to a private distribution
list from multiple sending addresses.

We have a practice that once per week we select one file at random and request
that it be restored from backup from the previous week.  It is amazing what
you learn by doing this.  The range of things that fail, problems that arise
from odd causes, automatic systems that mysteriously stop working, is
incredible.  Even when all concerned know that this is the regular practice,
things go wrong.  So everyone who is willing to put in the time and effort to
make backups should also perform at least this rudimentary QC check.  Don't
ever stop.

The note from managers of wuarchive.wustl.edu about loss of archive files
because backups were not usable reminds me of an experience with early DEC
timesharing systems (c. 1968, 4-series PDP-10 operating system).  (Incidently,
why do I so often get the feeling that problems solved in the 1960s will
reappear forever, and that each succeeding group of systems programmers has
less time/talent/interest for attacking them?)

I was system programming director at Computer Center Corp. (C^3), a Seattle
service bureau.  We used 1/2" mag tape for backup of disk files.  Only after
we lost the entire disk did we discover that our sole mag tape unit (the
cheapest we could buy, of course!) could not read all that it wrote, and that
the dump/restore software ignored all tape errors!  (This was the same system
in which the FORTRAN library disk i-o routine did retry for read failure, but
did it on the NEXT disk block instead of the one that had failed.  It was
remarkably successful-- the were NO permanent failures ever logged!)  Our fix
for the backup program was to write checksums on tape.  That way, we could
check the tapes off line, and not slow the dump by doing a real file compare
after the tape was written.  How many dump systems today read back what has
been written for backup (much less check it or do a file compare!) unless
there is a restore request?

                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During the past five years, encryption technology has become easily available
to both individuals and businesses, affording them a level of security
formerly available practically to only military, national security, and law
enforcement agencies. As a result, a debate within the United States about
the proper balance between national security and personal freedom has been
initiated. Law enforcement and national security agencies would like to
maintain tight control over civilian encryption technologies, while industry
and individual and privacy rights advocates fight to expand their ability to
distribute and use cryptographic products as they please.

This report analyzes trends in encryption technology, markets, export
controls, and legislation.  It identifies five trends which will have a
strong influence on cryptography policy in the United States:

     * The continued expansion of the Internet and the progressive
     miniaturization of cryptographic hardware combined with the  increasing
     availability and use of strong cryptographic software means that the
     strongest encryption technologies will  continue to become more easily
     obtainable everywhere in the years ahead.

     * Additional growth in networked and wireless communication will fuel a
     strong demand for encryption hardware and software both domestically and
     abroad, causing the U. S. high-technology industry to be increasingly
     interested in selling encryption products overseas and in modifying
     current export restrictions.

     * Due to the responsibilities and bureaucratic dispositions of key
     Executive Branch agencies, products using strong encryption algorithms
     such as DES will continue to face at least some export  restrictions,
     despite the widespread availability of strong encryption products
     overseas.

     * The American public is likely to become increasingly concerned about
     its privacy and about cryptographic policy as a result of the increased
     amount of personal information available online and the growing number
     of wireless and networked communications.  The development and
     increasingly widespread use of the National Information Infrastructure
     will heighten these concerns.

     * Encryption policy is becoming an important public policy issue that
     will engage the attention of all branches of government.  Congress will
     become increasingly visible in this debate due to its power of agency
     oversight and its role in passing laws accommodating the United States'
     rapid rate of technological change.  Agencies will remain very important
     since they have the implementing and, often, the planning
     responsibilities.  Since individuals and industry have more direct
     influence over Congress than over most other branches of government,
     Congress may place somewhat more emphasis on personal freedom than many
     other government actors.

Four potential scenarios are likely: mandatory escrowed encryption, voluntary
escrowed encryption, complete decontrol of encryption, or domestic decontrol
with strict export regulations.

The 1 Feb 1994 Wall Street Journal's front page center column is about the
metaphors generated by the phrase "information superhighway", which (all are
reported to agree) Al Gore coined by analogy to the US interstate highway
system.  What the article, like the vast majority of recent articles on the
topic, is the whole point of the "highway" metaphor, which is the proposition
that long-distance vehicle/information transfer may well be a natural
monopoly, thus calling for the creation of some kind of public utility.  This
is a fairly spectacular example of the organized forgetting that goes on in
the "agenda setting" process in US politics (and those, no doubt, of other
countries, in their own ways).  The risk here is that these semantical magic
tricks may in the end deprive the public of the information infrastructure
they deserve.

Evidence on this count is readily available, it so happens, in the 2/1/94 New
York Times (business section, page C6), where we are told that investors are
terrified that the Bell Atlantic - TCI merger might actually "lead to a
destructively competitive "two-wire world", where phone and cable companies"
would construct competing networks.  Although the analysts are alarmed, Bell
Atlantic has reassured its investors that it will be doing its best to avoid
that scenario by focusing first on relatively high-profit (i.e.,
uncompetitive) markets.

Heads up.

Phil Agre, UCSD

   [We are going to see all sorts of metaphors springing up on the
   InfoSuperhighway, such as speeding (illicit acts), speedtraps (network
   monitoring to detect misuse), parking lots (traffic congestion), 
   StopAndShop (overload from 300 channels of home shopping), deprogramming
   services (for the compulsive shopper), and designated drivers (the 
   device drivers you can trust).  Maybe even BurmaShave signs scattering
   doggerel poetry along the way for the oldtimers.  PGN]

</i><PRE>

The 1 Feb 1994 New York Times (science section) includes an article by Daniel
Goleman entitled "Hidden rules often distort ideas of risk".  It's about a set
of social psychological ideas about "perceptions" of risk that become
newsworthy about once a year despite never seeming to change.  These include
the following:

 * Risks that are imposed loom larger than those that are voluntary.
 * Risks that seem unfairly shared are also seen as more hazardous.
 * Risks that people can take steps to control are more acceptable
   than those they feel are beyond their means to control.
 * Natural risks are less threatening than man-made ones.
 * Risks that are associated with catastrophes are especially frightening.
 * Risks from exotic technologies cause more dread than do those
   involving familiar ones.

The article reports a spectrum of views about the best explanation of these
results and the best policies to deal with them.  This spectrum might be
categorized as follows:

  Conservative:  People are irrational, so forget 'em.
  Moderate:      People are irrational, but we can persuade them.
  Liberal:       People are irrational, but hey, everyone has faults, 
                 so let's humor them a little.

The common element, of course, is that is a view of ordinary people as
irrational because their rankings of the risks from various technologies are
considerably different from those of the experts.

What somehow never ceases to me is that all three approaches neglect a
perfectly obvious explanation, which is that people distrust the institutions
that seek to reassure them about unfamiliar technologies, having been
repeatedly and egregiously lied to in the past by many of those same
institutions (they were feeding plutonium to *whom*?), and they resent living
in a world dominated by such institutions, so they refuse to acknowledge the
claims of any technological project that has not been organized and evaluated
in a democratic way.  (The article does remark that people don't trust the
numbers, but that's apparently because people irrationally fail to weigh the
nuclear power plants that blow up against all the ones that don't.)  Probably
that's too simple, but it explains the data much more straightforwardly than
the known alternatives.

The interesting sociological question is how this feat of conceptual
constriction actually *works*.  Does this explanation literally never occur to
the people who do this research and write these articles?  How can that be?
Is it a conscious PR thing?  That would be disappointing in a way (too
straightforward), but it's certainly true enough with numerous other issues.

Clearly, as articles on the science pages so often conclude, further research
is needed.

Czech-Computer Fraud

    PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP, 19 Jan 1994) -- A bank employee was sentenced
  to eight years in prison for stealing nearly $1.2 million in the Czech
  Republic's first major computer fraud, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
  Martin Janku, an employee of the Czech Savings Bank in Sokolov, transferred
  money to his own account in the bank with the help of his own computer
  program between September 1991 and April 1992, the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes
  said.

The article continues with a few details:

o    Janku arrested when he tried to withdraw money from a branch where a
     teller recognized him as a programmer she'd met during training;

o    sentenced to 8 years in jail;

o    claims he was testing bank security;

o    returned about $1 million of money he stole; rest, he says, was stolen
     from his car.

     [Moral: never test someone's security systems without written
     authorization from the right people.]

                Electronic Petition to Oppose Clipper  
                      Please Distribute Widely

On January 24, many of the nation's leading experts in cryptography
and computer security wrote President Clinton and asked him to
withdraw the Clipper proposal.
  
The public response to the letter has been extremely favorable,
including coverage in the New York Times and numerous computer and
security trade magazines.

Many people have expressed interest in adding their names to the
letter.  In  response to these requests, CPSR is organizing an
Internet petition drive to oppose the Clipper proposal.  We will
deliver the signed petition to the White House, complete with the
names of all the people who oppose Clipper.

To sign on to the letter, send a message to:

     Clipper.petition@cpsr.org

with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)

You will receive a return message confirming your vote.

Please distribute this announcement so that others may also express
their opposition to the Clipper proposal.

CPSR is a membership-based public interest organization.  For
membership information, please email cpsr@cpsr.org.  For more
information about Clipper, please consult the CPSR Internet Library -

=====================================================================

The President 
The White House 
Washington, DC  20500

Dear Mr. President:

     We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed encryption
proposal now under consideration by the White House.  We wish to express our
concern about this plan and similar technical standards that may be proposed
for the nation's communications infrastructure.

     The current proposal was developed in secret by federal agencies
primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy protection.
Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus beyond public review.

     The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for comments conducted by the
Department of Commerce last year, less than a handful of respondents supported
the plan.  Several hundred opposed it.

     If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop new
products will face extensive government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to
develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be discouraged.  Citizens who
anticipate that the progress of technology will enhance personal privacy will
find their expectations unfulfilled.

     Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary basis and
suggest that other technical approaches will remain viable.  The government,
however, exerts enormous influence in the marketplace, and the likelihood that
competing standards would survive is small.  Few in the user community believe
that the proposal would be truly voluntary.

     The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that if this
proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on a voluntary basis,
privacy protection will be diminished, innovation will be slowed, government
accountability will be lessened, and the openness necessary to ensure the
successful development of the nation's communications infrastructure will be
bthreatened.

     We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper proposal.

Subject: "Digital Woes" by Lauren Wiener
 
Lauren Wiener, "Digital Woes", Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1993, 
0-201-62609-8, U$22.95/C$29.95
 
When reviewing books on technical topics, one quickly learns to dread the work
of those who do not actually practice in the field.  (Yes, we are told that
Wiener is a technical writer.  They may very well be professionals, but the
overwhelming majority are not technical professionals.)  With this prejudice
firmly in place, it came as a delightful surprise to find that "Digital Woes"
is an accurate, well-researched, and thoroughly engaging treatment of the
subject of software risks.
 
Chapter one is a list of specific examples of software failures, large and
small.  The stories are thoroughly documented and well told.  The choice of
examples is careful, and useful as well, covering a variety of problems.  One
could, of course, add to the list.  In the virus field programs are extremely
limited in function and rarely exceed 3000 bytes in length, yet almost every
viral strain shows some programming pathology; most of the damage seems to be
done by mistake.  The user interfaces of antivirals are subject to hot debate,
perhaps more importantly than in other systems because of the risks involved in
misunderstanding.  In regard to decision support, I recall the assumption, on
the part of Excel, that everyone wants to use linear forecasting.  Everyone
involved in technical fields will be able to add other specific examples.  For
those uninvolved, Wiener's work is quite sufficient and convincing.
 
Chapter two is an explanation of why software contains bugs, and why software
errors are so deadly.  Techies will feel somewhat uncomfortable with the lack
of jargon, but persevere.  Initially, I thought she had missed the point of the
difference between analogue and digital systems--until I realized I was in the
middle of a complete and clear explanation that never had to use the word
"analog".  (Technopeasants will, of course, appreciate the lack of jargon. 
Rest assured that the same ease of reading and clarity of language holds
throughout the book.)
 
Chapter three examines the various means used to try to ensure the reliability
of software--usually with a depressing lack of success.  As with all who have
worked in the field, I can relate to the comments regarding the difficulty of
testing.  At one point I uncovered a bug in the third minor variant of the
fourth major release of the fifth generation of a communications program. 
Apparently I was the first person on staff who had ever wanted to keep a
running log between sessions--and the functions I used combined to completely
lock up the computer.
 
Most RISKS-FORUM readers will by now be nodding and muttering, "So what else
is new".  However, Wiener here proves herself capable of some valuable and
original contributions beyond the pronouncements of those working in the
field.  Noting that she is familiar with programmers who have never, in twenty
years of work, had their code incorporated into a delivered product, she
raises the issue of what this type of work environment does to the psyche of
the worker.  My grandfather carved the wooden decorations in our church, and,
fifty years after his death, I can still point that out.  However, in a career
of analysis, training and support, I can point to little beyond an amount of
Internet bandwidth consumed.  (Many would say "wasted".)  To the ephemeral
nature of the craft, though, one must add the legacy of constant failure.
Martin Seligman's "Learned Helplessness" points out the danger quite clearly.
A similar thought was voiced some years ago over the impact on developing
youth of the then new video games, and the fact that you could advance through
levels but never, ultimately, win.  These children are grown now.  You may
know them as "Generation X".
 
Chapter four deals with means to prevent failure.  Actually most of the
material discusses recovery--assuming that the system will eventually fail, how
to ensure that the failure causes the least damage.
 
Chapter five is entitled "Big Plans" and looks at various proposed new
technologies and the risks inherent in them.  In this discussion Wiener warns
against those who are overly thrilled with the promises of the new technology. 
I agree, but I would caution that public debate is also dominated by those
strident with fear.  The arguments of both sides tend to entrench to defeat the
opposition, while the public, itself, sits bemused in the middle without
knowing whom to believe.  It is a major strength of Wiener's work that the
field is explored thoroughly and in an unbiased manner.
 
Many books which try to present an objective view of a controversial problem
tend to trail off into meaningless weasel-words, but the final chapter here
concerns "The Wise Use of Smart Stuff."  Wiener lists a good set of criteria to
use in evaluating a proposed system.  The one item I would recommend be toned
down is the axiom that personal care be excluded.  I keep an old Berke Breathed
"Bloom County" cartoon in my office wherein Opus, the Penguin, berates a
computer for depriving him of his humanity until the bemused machine attempts
to confirm that Opus is human.  The perceived coldness of our institutions is
often illusory.  I once worked in a geriatric hospital and thought it a shame
that our culture did not keep aging parents at home.  Until, that is, I lived
in a culture that did, and found that the "technology" of our hospitals
provided more human contact to the old folks than did the "organic" home care. 
I also note that the belittled ELIZA is the only program to have passed the
Turing test so far.  A limited, unexpected, and hilarious pass, perhaps, but a
pass nonetheless.
 
I note, as I am reviewing this book, a press release by a headhunting agency
that half of all executives are computer illiterate.  The survey method is
extremely suspect, and I assume these figures are so kind as to be ridiculous. 
I would heartily recommend this work to technical and non-technical workers
alike.  Particularly, though, I recommend it to those executives who are the
ones to make the ultimate decisions on major projects.  Please re-read it after
the next vendor demo you attend.

Postscriptum - my wife agrees with Peter Denning that I tend to editorialize in
my reviews.  This is likely true.  "Digital Woes", however, deals with a topic
which has prompted many editorials--and deals with it well.

   NEW YORK Citing computer-security violations of unprecedented scope,
security experts have issued a warning that unknown assailants have been
breaking into scores of government, corporate and university computers
connected to the global Internet communications network.  Saying that it had
been ``flooded'' with reports of computer break-ins in the last week, the
federally supported Computer Emergency Response Team broadcast its warning
late Thursday night over the Internet, a web of computer networks used by an
estimated 15 million people in the United States and abroad.
   Sophisticated software, secretly planted on various computers throughout
the Internet, has allowed unknown intruders to steal passwords and electronic
addresses from legitimate users, computer security experts said Friday.

   [The full article summarizes a situation that by now should be familiar
   to RISKS readers.  See the following CERT Advisory, and a comment
   from Klaus Brunnstein.  See also articles the same day in the 
   Washington Post and elsewhere.  PGN]

CA-94:01                         CERT Advisory
                               February 3, 1994
                      Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks
                                   
In the past week, CERT has observed a dramatic increase in reports of
intruders monitoring network traffic.  Systems of some service providers have
been compromised, and all systems that offer remote access through rlogin,
telnet, and FTP are at risk.  Intruders have already captured access
information for tens of thousands of systems across the Internet.

The current attacks involve a network monitoring tool that uses the
promiscuous mode of a specific network interface, /dev/nit, to capture host
and user authentication information on all newly opened FTP, telnet, and
rlogin sessions.

In the short-term, CERT recommends that all users on sites that offer remote
access change passwords on any network-accessed account. In addition, all
sites having systems that support the /dev/nit interface should disable this
feature if it is not used and attempt to prevent unauthorized access if the
feature is necessary. A procedure for accomplishing this is described in
Section III.B.2 below.  Systems known to support the interface are SunOS 4.x
(Sun3 and Sun4 architectures) and Solbourne systems; there may be others. Sun
Solaris systems do not support the /dev/nit interface. If you have a system
other than Sun or Solbourne, contact your vendor to find if this interface is
supported.

While the current attack is specific to /dev/nit, the short-term workaround
does not constitute a solution.  The best long-term solution currently
available for this attack is to reduce or eliminate the transmission of
reusable passwords in clear-text over the network.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I.   Description

     Root-compromised systems that support a promiscuous network
     interface are being used by intruders to collect host and user
     authentication information visible on the network.

     The intruders first penetrate a system and gain root access
     through an unpatched vulnerability (solutions and workarounds for
     these vulnerabilities have been described in previous CERT
     advisories, which are available anonymous FTP from
     info.cert.org).  

     The intruders then run a network monitoring tool that captures up
     to the first 128 keystrokes of all newly opened FTP, telnet, and
     rlogin sessions visible within the compromised system's domain.
     These keystrokes usually contain host, account, and password
     information for user accounts on other systems; the intruders log
     these for later retrieval.  The intruders typically install
     Trojan horse programs to support subsequent access to the
     compromised system and to hide their network monitoring process.

II.  Impact

     All connected network sites that use the network to access remote
     systems are at risk from this attack.
     
     All user account and password information derived from FTP,
     telnet, and rlogin sessions and passing through the same network
     as the compromised host could be disclosed.


III. Approach

     There are three steps in CERT's recommended approach to the
     problem:

     - Detect if the network monitoring tool is running on any of your
       hosts that support a promiscuous network interface.

     - Protect against this attack either by disabling the network
       interface for those systems that do not use this feature or by
       attempting to prevent unauthorized use of the feature on systems
       where this interface is necessary.

     - Scope the extent of the attack and recover in the event that
       the network monitoring tool is discovered.


     A.  Detection

         The network monitoring tool can be run under a variety of
         process names and log to a variety of filenames.  Thus, the
         best method for detecting the tool is to look for 1) Trojan
         horse programs commonly used in conjunction with this attack,
         2) any suspect processes running on the system, and 3) the
         unauthorized use of /dev/nit.

         1) Trojan horse programs: 

         The intruders have been found to replace one or more of the
         following programs with a Trojan horse version in conjunction
         with this attack:

           /usr/etc/in.telnetd 
           and /bin/login -  Used to provide back-door access for the
                             intruders to retrieve information
           /bin/ps  - Used to disguise the network monitoring process
           
         Because the intruders install Trojan horse variations of
         standard UNIX commands, CERT recommends not using other
         commands such as the standard UNIX sum(1) or cmp(1) commands
         to locate the Trojan horse programs on the system until these
         programs can be restored from distribution media, run from
         read-only media (such as a mounted CD-ROM), or verified using
         cryptographic checksum information.
         
         In addition to the possibility of having the checksum
         programs replaced by the intruders, the Trojan horse programs
         mentioned above may have been engineered to produce the same
         standard checksum and timestamp as the legitimate version.
         Because of this, the standard UNIX sum(1) command and the
         timestamps associated with the programs are not sufficient to
         determine whether the programs have been replaced.

         CERT recommends that you use both the /usr/5bin/sum and
         /bin/sum commands to compare against the distribution media
         and assure that the programs have not been replaced.  The use
         of cmp(1), MD5, Tripwire (only if the baseline checksums were
         created on a distribution system), and other cryptographic
         checksum tools are also sufficient to detect these Trojan
         horse programs, provided these programs were not available
         for modification by the intruder.  If the distribution is
         available on CD-ROM or other read-only device, it may be
         possible to compare against these volumes or run programs off
         these media.

         2) Suspect processes: 

         Although the name of the network monitoring tool can vary
         from attack to attack, it is possible to detect a suspect
         process running as root using ps(1) or other process-listing
         commands.  Until the ps(1) command has been verified against
         distribution media, it should not be relied upon--a Trojan
         horse version is being used by the intruders to hide the
         monitoring process.  Some process names that have been
         observed are sendmail, es, and in.netd.  The arguments to the
         process also provide an indication of where the log file is
         located.  If the "-F" flag is set on the process, the
         filename following indicates the location of the log file
         used for the collection of authentication information for
         later retrieval by the intruders.

         3) Unauthorized use of /dev/nit:

         If the network monitoring tool is currently running on your
         system, it is possible to detect this by checking for
         unauthorized use of the /dev/nit interface.  CERT has created
         a minimal tool for this purpose.  The source code for this
         tool is available via anonymous FTP on info.cert.org in the
         /pub/tools/cpm directory or on ftp.uu.net in the 
         /pub/security/cpm directory as cpm.1.0.tar.Z.  The checksum
         information is:

         Filename                Standard UNIX Sum         System V Sum
        --------------           -----------------         ------------
         cpm.1.0.tar.Z:               11097 6                 24453 12 

         MD5 Checksum
         MD5 (cpm.1.0.tar.Z) = e29d43f3a86e647f7ff2aa453329a155

         This archive contains a readme file, also included as
         Appendix C of this advisory, containing instructions on
         installing and using this detection tool.

     B.  Prevention

         There are two actions that are effective in preventing this
         attack.  A long-term solution requires eliminating
         transmission of clear-text passwords on the network.  For
         this specific attack, however, a short-term workaround
         exists.  Both of these are described below.

         1) Long-term prevention:

         CERT recognizes that the only effective long-term solution to
         prevent these attacks is by not transmitting reusable
         clear-text passwords on the network.  CERT has collected some
         information on relevant technologies.  This information is
         included as Appendix B in this advisory.  Note: These
         solutions will not protect against transient or remote access
         transmission of clear-text passwords through the network.

         Until everyone connected to your network is using the above
         technologies, your policy should allow only authorized users
         and programs access to promiscuous network interfaces.  The
         tool described in Section III.A.3 above may be helpful in
         verifying this restricted access.

         2) Short-term workaround:

         Regardless of whether the network monitoring software is
         detected on your system, CERT recommends that ALL SITES take
         action to prevent unauthorized network monitoring on their
         systems. You can do this either by removing the interface, if
         it is not used on the system or by attempting to prevent the
         misuse of this interface.

         For systems other than Sun and Solbourne, contact your vendor
         to find out if promiscuous mode network access is supported
         and, if so, what is the recommended method to disable or
         monitor this feature.

         For SunOS 4.x and Solbourne systems, the promiscuous
         interface to the network can be eliminated by removing the
         /dev/nit capability from the kernel.  The procedure for doing
         so is outlined below (see your system manuals for more
         details).  Once the procedure is complete, you may remove the
         device file /dev/nit since it is no longer functional.

         Procedure for removing /dev/nit from the kernel:

         1. Become root on the system. 

         2. Apply "method 1" as outlined in the System and Network
         Administration manual, in the section, "Sun System
         Administration Procedures," Chapter 9, "Reconfiguring the
         System Kernel."  Excerpts from the method are reproduced
         below:

         # cd /usr/kvm/sys/sun[3,3x,4,4c]/conf
         # cp CONFIG_FILE SYS_NAME  

         [Note that at this step, you should replace the CONFIG_FILE
         with your system specific configuration file if one exists.]

         # chmod +w SYS_NAME
         # vi SYS_NAME

            #
            # The following are for streams NIT support.  NIT is used by
            # etherfind, traffic, rarpd, and ndbootd.  As a rule of thumb,
            # NIT is almost always needed on a server and almost never
            # needed on a diskless client.
            #
            pseudo-device   snit            # streams NIT
            pseudo-device   pf              # packet filter
            pseudo-device   nbuf            # NIT buffering module
         
         [Comment out the preceding three lines; save and exit the
         editor before proceeding.]

         # config SYS_NAME
         # cd ../SYS_NAME
         # make

         # mv /vmunix /vmunix.old
         # cp vmunix /vmunix

         # /etc/halt
         &gt; b

         [This step will reboot the system with the new kernel.]

         [NOTE that even after the new kernel is installed, you need
         to take care to ensure that the previous vmunix.old , or
         other kernel, is not used to reboot the system.]


     C.  Scope and recovery

         If you detect the network monitoring software at your site,
         CERT recommends following three steps to successfully
         determine the scope of the problem and to recover from this
         attack.

         1. Restore the system that was subjected to the network
         monitoring software.

         The systems on which the network monitoring and/or Trojan
         horse programs are found have been compromised at the root
         level; your system configuration may have been altered.  See
         Appendix A of this advisory for help with recovery.

         2. Consider changing router, server, and privileged account
         passwords due to the wide-spread nature of these attacks.
         
         Since this threat involves monitoring remote connections,
         take care to change these passwords using some mechanism
         other than remote telnet, rlogin, or FTP access.

         3. Urge users to change passwords on local and remote
         accounts.

         Users who access accounts using telnet, rlogin, or FTP either
         to or from systems within the compromised domain should
         change their passwords after the intruder's network monitor
         has been disabled.
         
         4. Notify remote sites connected from or through the local
         domain of the network compromise.

         Encourage the remote sites to check their systems for
         unauthorized activity.  Be aware that if your site routes
         network traffic between external domains, both of these
         domains may have been compromised by the network monitoring
         software.

 Appendix A:  
                    RECOVERING FROM A UNIX ROOT COMPROMISE

A.   Immediate recovery technique

        1) Disconnect from the network or operate the system in
           single- user mode during the recovery.  This will keep users
           and intruders from accessing the system.

        2) Verify system binaries and configuration files against the
           vendor's media (do not rely on timestamp information to
           provide an indication of modification).  Do not trust any
           verification tool such as cmp(1) located on the compromised
           system as it, too, may have been modified by the intruder.
           In addition, do not trust the results of the standard UNIX
           sum(1) program as we have seen intruders modify system
           files in such a way that the checksums remain the same.
           Replace any modified files from the vendor's media, not
           from backups.

           Reload your system from the vendor's media.

        3) Search the system for new or modified setuid root files.

                find / -user root -perm -4000 -print

           If you are using NFS or AFS file systems, use ncheck to
           search the local file systems.

                ncheck -s /dev/sd0a

        4) Change the password on all accounts.

        5) Don't trust your backups for reloading any file used by
           root.  You do not want to re-introduce files altered by an
           intruder.


B.   Improving the security of your system

        1) CERT Security Checklist
           Using the checklist will help you identify security
           weaknesses or modifications to your systems.  The CERT
           Security Checklist is based on information gained from
           computer security incidents reported to CERT. It is
           available via anonymous FTP from info.cert.org in the file
           pub/tech_tips/security_info.
        
        2) Security Tools
           Use security tools such as COPS and Tripwire to check for
           security configuration weaknesses and for modifications
           made by intruders.  We suggest storing these security
           tools, their configuration files, and databases offline or
           encrypted.  TCP daemon wrapper programs provide additional
           logging and access control.  These tools are available via
           anonymous FTP from info.cert.org in the pub/tools
           directory.

        3) CERT Advisories
           Review past CERT advisories (both vendor-specific and
           generic) and install all appropriate patches or workarounds
           as described in the advisories.  CERT advisories and other
           security-related information are available via anonymous
           FTP from info.cert.org in the pub/cert_advisories
           directory.

Appendix B:  
                         ONE-TIME PASSWORDS

Given today's networked environments, CERT recommends that sites
concerned about the security and integrity of their systems and
networks consider moving away from standard, reusable passwords. CERT
has seen many incidents involving Trojan network programs (e.g.,
telnet and rlogin) and network packet sniffing programs.  These
programs capture clear-text hostname, account name, password triplets.
Intruders can use the captured information for subsequent access to
those hosts and accounts.  This is possible because 1) the password is
used over and over (hence the term "reusable"), and 2) the password
passes across the network in clear text.

Several authentication techniques have been developed that address
this problem. Among these techniques are challenge-response
technologies that provide passwords that are only used once (commonly
called one-time passwords). This document provides a list of sources
for products that provide this capability. The decision to use a
product is the responsibility of each organization, and each
organization should perform its own evaluation and selection.

Waves went high in some German media on Friday, Feb.5 1994, when news from
Philadelphia (via CMU-SEI's press release) and Washington's Post was mediated 
by some European news agencies. Germany's 2nd TV channel (ZDF) informed the 
surprised public that *hackers had succeeded to invade a secure network which 
had been installed in times of Cold War to protect US Armed  Forces even in 
the case of a Nuclear War*. As several 10,000 passwords had been hacked, now 
more than 20 million users have to change their password. Regional and private
TV and radio stations followed on Saturday, though only few newspapers took
this up on Monday. 

Nothing of this (mis)information was in the CERT advisory distributed on 
Febrary 3, where users of some UNIX systems (esp. SunOS with  /dev/nit) were 
informed that it might be wise to take precautionary action against a potential
sniffer attack. Now, 3 days later, responsible journalists inform us that 
there were *2 agency reports*, one delivered by German press agency (dpa) 
which was rather serious and non-speculative, and another one from Agency 
France Press (AFP) which ZDF based it's report upon (as it was the more 
"interesting one :-). Here is this in-famous text (translation by messenger):

    "Washington, February 5 (AFP) - Computer pirates have cracked the largest
     computer network in the world. Totally 20 million users on 'Internet'
     should receive new passwords, told the emergency committee installed by
     US ministry of defence. Internet is used by universities, government
     agencies, enterprises and private persons. The network was established
     in times of the Cold War to serve US Armed Forces also in case of Atomic
     War as 'invulnerable' information network. The hackers, so far unidenti-
     fied, succeeded according to the emergency committee to read data from
     ten thousands of systems on 'Internet'. They succeeded by using a program
     named 'Trojan Horse' which allows legal access to Internet central com-
     puter but then does not go any further."

Apart from the many wrong or misunderstood facts in this news, the reaction of 
some experts was interesting. German Information Agency (GISA) said: "Old 
stuff, no reason panic!" Another expert said: "CERT is in actual fight for
money from US administration, they needed some public attention!" General
comments were: "Blind actionism of US' CERT!"

Somehow, the media uproar reminds of the Michelangelo case where cautious
warnings of experts (infection at most small percentage of PCs) were publicly 
raised *up to 50 mio infected PC systems* by badly informed journalists. 
No expert can ever exclude that her/his warnings are always correctly under-
stood, but in this case, the serious question is: With so many unknown 
parameters (how many different sniffer trojans existed? How many nodes were
affected? For what purposes were the sniffers used? etc): why issued CERT/CC 
a press release (which it very rarely did so far), in addition to its advisory?

Unfortunately, this unjustified media hysteria will fall back, as in previous 
cases, on those who work hard for improving security and safety of systems 
and networks:-) This is why the background must be carefully analysed.

Klaus Brunnstein (Feb.7,1994)

&gt;From the Associated Press newswire via Executive News Service (GO ENS) on
CompuServe:

Health Care-Privacy, By MARCY GORDON, Associated Press Writer 
   WASHINGTON (AP, 27 Jan 1994) -- In a clear, quiet voice welling with
emotion, Rep. Nydia Velazquez told a Senate hearing Thursday how hospital
records related to her suicide attempt were leaked to New York newspapers
during her election campaign.  Velazquez, a New York Democrat, testified
before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on how President Clinton's
proposed health plan would protect the privacy of medical records."

The author continues with details of the hearing.  Key points:

o    Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chair of the subcommittee on technology
     and the law, warned that the Clinton proposals would result in a
     nationwide computerized database holding confidential data.

o    Nan Hunter, deputy general counsel of the Department of Health and
     Human Services, said, "[T]he administration is committed
     to privacy as a first principle and the need to protect the
     confidentiality of these records." 

o    Misuse of medical card numbers would result in criminal and civil
     penalties.

o    Velazquez discovered that her medical records had been sent by
     anonymous fax to several newspapers, resulting in front-page headlines
     about her attempted suicide.

o    According to Velazquez, there are no federal regulations controlling
     the use of medical records that escape from doctors' offices.

o    Leahy mentioned that Arthur Ashe' medical records also became public.

o    Janlori Goldman, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
     privacy and technology project, warned of the importance of
     safeguarding "the privacy and security of personal health information."

o    Carolyn Roberts, chairwoman-elect of the American Hospital
     Association, commented on the wide disparities in state legislation
     protecting health information against unauthorized disclosure.  She
     argued for a new federal privacy law to supersede state laws.

Newsgroups: alt.internet.services
Subject: Altered White House documents
Date: 5 Feb 1994 09:38:23 -0800

I assume everyone knows about the ftp site whitehouse.gov. I just discovered
that the Clinton rebuttal to Elizabeth McCaughey's critique of his health care
plan has been altered on whitehouse.gov - with no mention in the current
version that it has been changed.

According to Associated Press writer Tom Raum, the original White House
rebuttal to McCaughey's New Republic magazine article used the word "lie" four
times. The copy of the White House rebuttal I just downloaded (Feb 5, morning,
pacific time) does not contain the word lie nor does it contain any indication
that it is a "revised" version.

White House spokesman Dee Dee Myers defended the rebuttal on Thursday although
she conceded that "perhaps the language was a little strong." Clinton, asked
by reporters earlier this week about calling McCaughey's comments lies,
responded, "Well, I hate to use that word, but the New Republic article was
way off base and the New Republic didn't make total disclosure about the
source of the article." So Clinton admitted to the use of "lie" but it has
since been removed from the version available for anonymous ftp at
whitehouse.gov. Makes you wonder just how self- serving and accurate the rest
of the information there might be...

UWSA'ers note: the whitehouse.gov directory /pub/political-
science/speeches/perot contains the text of Perot's book "United We Stand,"
and various Perot speeches. But no, I have not double- checked them for
unauthorized "revisions."

From: Samer Farha &lt;Samer@clark.net&gt;
Newsgroups: alt.internet.services
writes:

In almost every speech (be it a minute or an hour) every member of Congress
starts off by saying words to the effect of "I would like to reserve the right
to extend and revise my remarks", which is followed by the chair saying that
"without objection, it is agreed to.."

This little phrase gives any speaker the right to add pages of a speech, when
they only have two minutes left in official debate.  That way, when someone
says, but you got up there and said only one thing, the Congressman can say
that is not true: look at the daily record, it has the whole speech.  Often,
they may say something in a less than articulate way and then revise the way
the said it for the record.

One time two Senators got into a very heated name calling session, it was
reported in the press and seen on C-SPAN, but it was removed from the official
record after they both calmed down and "revised" their remarks.

People will always change their minds or regret saying something, they often
try to tell you that what they meant was not what they said.  If they are rich
or powerful enough, they will hire press agents to "spin" the story the right
way.  This changing of printed documents is nothing but an extension of that.
The media is there to make sure that big glaring mess ups don't fall through
the cracks.

CPSR ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN TO OPPOSE CLIPPER PROPOSAL

Embargoed until 2 pm, Monday, February 7, 1994

contact: rotenberg@washofc.cpsr.org  (202 544 9240)

Washington, DC -- Following the White House decision on Friday to endorse a
secret surveillance standard for the information highway, Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today announced a national
campaign to oppose the government plan.

The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security Agency, is
a technical standard that will make it easier for government agents to wiretap
the emerging data highway.

Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties organizations
have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the plan since it was first
proposed in April 1993.

According to Marc Rotenberg, CPSR Washington director, the Administration made
a major blunder with Clipper.  "The public does not like Clipper and will not
accept it. This proposal is fatally flawed."

CPSR cited several problems with the Clipper plan:

o The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It would provide
government agents with copies of the keys that protect electronic
communications.  "It is a nightmare for computer security," said CPSR Policy
Analyst Dave Banisar.

o The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not privacy
protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed widespread NSA
abuses, including the illegal interception of millions of cables sent by
American citizens.

o Computer security experts question the integrity of the technology.  Clipper
was developed in secret and its specifications are classified.  CPSR has sued
the government seeking public disclosure of the Clipper scheme.

o NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A 1987 law
explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set standards for the
nation's communications network.

o There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently forced the
release of FBI documents that show no such problems.

o The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the general
public. When the Commerce Department solicited public comments on the proposal
last fall, hundreds of people opposed the plan while only a few expressed
support.

CPSR today announced four goals for its campaign to oppose the Clipper
initiative:

o First, to educate the public about the implications of the Clipper proposal.

o Second, to encourage people to express their views on the Clipper proposal,
particularly through the computer network.

Toward that goal, CPSR has already begun an electronic petition on the
Internet computer network urging the President to withdraw the Clipper
proposal. In less than one week, the CPSR campaign has drawn thousands of
electronic mail messages expressing concern about Clipper. To sign on, email
clipper.petition@cpsr.org with the message "I oppose clipper" in the body of
the text.

o Third, to pursue litigation to force the public disclosure of documents
concerning the Clipper proposal and to test the legality of the Department of
Commerce's decision to endorse the plan.

o Fourth, to examine alternative approaches to Clipper.

Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full implications of
this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and industry groups that understand
the proposal.  But the consequences of Clipper will touch everyone.  It will
affect medical payments, cable television service, and everything in between.

CPSR is a membership-based public interest organization.  For more information
about CPSR, send email to cpsr@cpsr.org or call 415 322 3778.  For more

&lt;Text of petition solicitation removed to save bandwidth&gt;

&gt;with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)

&gt;You will receive a return message confirming your vote.

I apologize for sounding sarcastic or cynical, but I was quite chagrined
when I saw this proposal appear in RISKS.  Not because I am opposed to what
CPSR proposes in the message, but rather:

  1 - Because the risks associated with electronic voting have been well
      discussed in this forum and

  2 - Because the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, an
      organization that ought to know better, (certainly with a name like
      theirs), does not appear to have included any mechanism in their
      their petition drive to mitigate these risks.

Now I'll certainly grant that the CPSR's petition has no rule of law behind
it, as would a petition to put a local ordinance on an election ballot, but
the irony of CPSR's request is noteworthy.  

  [Given the inherent risks of spoofing E-mail, there is clearly a risk
  of someone sending a bogus petition signature.  In the absence of 
  nontrivial authentication, there is always the option of human 
  verification...  PGN]

I am the victim of false accusations.

My wife and I were at home some time last week. I was busy cooking dinner.  My
wife was busy chasing our two year old, when we received a phone call which my
wife accepted.  The fellow on the other end of the line was extremely irate.
His wife has been receiving obscene phone calls for some time now.  He had
purchased the service provided by the phone company which allows you to call
back the last person to dial you.  After his wife had discontinued the obscene
call she'd just received, he had used this feature to righteously confront her
abuser.  Instead he had dialed us.

 This was somewhat perplexing until a few minutes later, my wife's best
 friend called. Imediately after saying hello, My wife began relating
 this strange occurence to her friend. Her friend then told my wife
 that it was her husband who had made this call utilizing this phone
 service. 

This has put a heavy strain upon my wife's relationship with her
friend, because her friend's husband has assumed that I am the author
of these obscene calls. Whereas I barely have time for all the things
which fill my life. I have no time or interest in making such calls.

It is my belief that my wife had tried to call her best friend during the
obscene phone call. This attempt overwrote the perpetrator's number, so that
when the call back service was used, our phone rang instead.

If there are any knowledgeable netter's out there that could give me any more
info, I'd appreciate it.

My uncle was poking around in a used bookstore and found a book entitled "The
Naked Computer" (by Jack Rochester &amp; John Gantz, Wm Morrow &amp; Co., NY) which was
published in 1983 and intended for a lay audience.  It's got some stories
I have never heard, such as this one on p. 71:

"David Walonick, a computer programmer and consultant in Minneapolis, found
that his new IBM personal computer divided 0.1 by 10 and came up with 0.001
instead of 0.01.  IBM told him beginning programmers "have problems like
that."  It wasn't corrected until Walonick told the _New York Times_."

There follows a somewhat muddy and unsatisfying explanation of the problem,
followed by the insightful comment:

"The more serious problem is that most computer users have difficulty
discerning when there is an inaccurate sum; computers are generally regarded
as correct."

The book also includes an interview by Adam Osborne, in which he says the
following on the subject of computer risks:

"Authors:  In your book, _Running Wild_, you say there are places we shouldn't
use computers.

"Osborne:  Yes.  In balloting, for instance, I just feel that the slightest
chance of fraud isn't worth it.  If we are going to spend a little bit more
money for counting or if we have to wait longer, fine.  We all know that
rigging is possible -- it's very easy to do.  It's not just the outsiders I'm
worried about, it's the people running it.

"Electronic funds transfer is the next place where I have a lot of problems
because the potential for fraud is so great.  I've heard of banks that are
doing funds transfer on public-access networks.  In 1980 I issued a public
challenge to any bank that would guarantee in writing not to prosecute me that
I would steal $10 million from them via wire fraud.  We weren't actually going
to rip off the bank; in fact, we were going to call the bank president and ask
him to come and get his money.  We'd have a $10 million cashier's check
waiting for him.  Of course, no bank took me up on the offer.

As for the stock exchange, my God!  There has never been an opportunity like
that.  Who is going to count the shares?  Who really knows who owes who what?
I think it's madness."

Wonder what he thinks now?

I subscribe to the Presidential-speech service from CLINTON.ai.mit.edu.  I've
been getting electronic copies of all Clinton's speeches since before his
election (when I also got Bush's speeches).

A couple of days ago, I got a letter from "M.I.T. Pollster's Assistant",
asking me to fill out a survey about my usage of the service.  I, of course,
complied.

There was some confusion about one of the questions -- I gave the server an
invalid answer, and it wrote me back asking me for a correction to that
particular question only.

I sent back the form -- but apparently the server misunderstood, because I got
back *another* polite auto-letter telling me I'd filed an incomplete survey,
and would I please fill out the remaining seven questions?

Confused, I decided to make a wash of the whole thing.  I have done nothing
for one week.

I just received a letter from the server, asking me to finish filling out my
survey!  Not surprising, except that the 40-odd line message was preceded by
250 lines of "Apparently-To: &lt;hapless-fool@some.other.machine&gt;".  Apparently,
all of us hapless fools are in the same boat, but now ALL OF THEM know that I
am one of "those" undesirable sorts of people who start filling out surveys
and then don't finish them.  In fact, I (and they) can surmise that everyone
on the list receives the clinton service. In a matter of seconds, I had
several of their true names via finger -- as, I imagine, they did mine.  Mild
annoyance -- here, privacy is more a matter of courtesy than necessity -- but
it's easy to imagine a situation that called for more anonymity (say a sexual
preferences survey).

To sum up: (A) public mail-servers have to be not only clever and polite, but
also extremely robust; and (B) it's very easy to compromise list privacy by
mistake.

Fortunately, I'm in good company.  Two lines below me is BIFF@MIT.EDU,
another truant survey-taker!  K00L, EH?!!1!

Following up on Jeremy Epstein's note in RISKS 15.41, I went to visit the
National Cryptology Museum, and can recommend it.  It's open 9am-3pm weekdays
and by appointment.  It's basically one large room, with several interesting
displays; my favorite was 7 volumes from the NSA rare book collection,
including the oldest published work on cryptology, Johannes Trithemius'
"Polygraphiae," first published in 1517.  They also had a Pace-10 analog
computer, and IBM Harvest and a Cray XMP-24 on display.  There were nice
historical displays on Yarley &amp; the Black Chamber, US Civil War crypto and a
US Revolutionary War era crypto device (the M-94) that may have been designed
by Thomas Jefferson.  The largest display was dedicated to Enigma and the
device for cracking it, Bombe.  There is a working Enigma that visitors can
use!  There are a few displays that are more current: pictures of the NSA
buildings and director and a description of NSA's Special Processing Lab (SPL)
which does special purpose chip fabrication.  There was the expected KGB
stuff, and a quote from George Washington about the importance of "keeping the
whole matter secret."

The curator, Jack Ingrams, was friendly and eager to answer (some) questions.
He said that since the Washington Post article, traffic had been about 25-30
people a day, and that they will be on TV this week, which he expects to
further increase the number of visitors.  He was curious about the RISKS
posting and internet, so if anybody who sees this talks to him while visiting,
mention the net.  He also said that they will be opening the unclassified
portion of their crypto library to scholars sometime in the summer.  The
handout on the museum also says that the FOIA reading room shares space with
the library.

Obligatory RISK-y note: Ingrams mentioned that the museum opened to NSA
personnel in October, and to the general public around Christmas time.  A
quick glance through the guest sign-in book shows that the fourth visitor to
the museum, on October 29, was one Duane Whitlock, who listed his employer as
C&amp;P Telephone, our local baby bell.  hmmm.

                     CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION
                      Tenth Annual Computer Security
                         Applications Conference
                           December 5-9, 1994
                            Orlando, Florida

        With the advent of the Information Age, information systems are
routinely processing private, proprietary, sensitive, classified, and critical
information.  Computers have created a universal addiction to information in
the military, government, and private sectors.  The result is a proliferation
of computers, computer networks, databases, and applications empowered to make
decisions ranging from the mundane to life threatening or life preserving.

        Some of the computer security challenges that the community is faced
with include the following:

        *  Develop methodologies and tools for designing systems capable of

           protecting the sensitivity and integrity of information, and
           assuring that expected services are available when needed.

        *  Design safety-critical systems such that their software and hardware
           are not hazardous.

        *  Develop methodologies and tools capable of assuring that computer
           systems accorded trust are worthy of that trust.

        *  Build systems of systems out of components that have been deemed
           trustworthy.

        *  Build applications on evaluated trusted systems without compromising
           the inherent trust.

        *  Include computer security in enterprise modeling and reengineering.

        *  Extend computer security technologies to specifically address the
           needs of the civil and private sectors.

        *  Develop international standards for computer security technology.

        This conference will attempt to address these challenges.  It will
explore a broad range of technology applications with security and safety
concerns.  Technical papers, panels, vendor presentations, and tutorials that
address the application of computer security and safety technologies in the
civil, defense, and commercial environments are solicited.  Selected papers
will be those that present examples of in-place or attempted solutions to
these problems in real applications; lessons learned; and original research,
analyses, and approaches for defining the computer security issues and
problems.  Of particular interest are papers that present descriptions of
secure systems in use or under development, general strategy, methodologies
for analyzing the scope and nature of integrated computer security issues, and
potential solutions.  Papers written by students will be judged for a Best
Student Paper Award.  A prize of $500, plus expenses to attend the conference,
will be awarded for the selected best student paper (contact the Student Paper
Award Chairperson for details, but submit your paper to the Technical Program
Chairperson).

        Panels of interest include those that present alternative/
controversial viewpoints or those that encourage lively discussion of relevant
issues. Panels that are simply a collection of unrefereed papers will not be
selected.

        Vendor presentations of interest should emphasize innovative product
implementations, especially implementations involving the integration of
multiple products.  Vendor presentations that simply describe product features
will not be selected.

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

        Send five copies of your paper or panel proposal to Dr. Gary Smith,
Technical Program Chair, at the address given below. Since we provide blind
refereeing, we ask that you put names and affiliations of authors on a
separate cover page only.  Substantially identical papers that have been
previously published or are under consideration for publication elsewhere
should not be submitted.  Panel proposals should be a minimum of one page that
describes the panel theme and appropriateness of the panel for this
conference, as well as identifies panel participants and their respective
viewpoints.  For panel/forum preparation instructions, please contact Jody
Heaney at (703) 883-5837 or via e-mail at heaney@smiley.mitre.org.  Send five
copies of your vendor presentation proposal to Steve Rome at the address given
below.  Vendor presentation proposals should include an abstract and outline
that describe the product and example applications.  Send one copy of your
tutorial proposal to Daniel Faigin at the address given below.  It should
consist of one- to two-paragraph abstract of the tutorial, an initial outline
of the material to be presented, and an indication of the desired tutorial
length (full day or half day).  Electronic submission of tutorial proposals is
preferred.

Completed papers as well as proposals for panels, vendor presentations, and
tutorials must be received by May 31, 1994.  Authors will be required to
certify prior to June 30, 1994, that all necessary clearances for public
release have been obtained; that the author or qualified representative will
be represented at the conference to deliver the paper, and that the paper has
not been accepted elsewhere.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by August
5, 1994.  Camera-ready copies are due not later than September 26, 1994.

Article titled "Sounding the Alarm: Noisy medical alert systems are 
getting out of hand" by Jon Van, Chicago Tribune, appeared in San Jose 
Mercury News Science &amp; Medicine Section 8 Feb 1994.
     
The article pointed out the alarm systems from medical equipment are 
"driving doctors and nurses to distraction" who agree that "alarm noise 
pollution is a significant problem that threatens patient health" 
presumably because "doctors order that all alarms be disconnected except 
those deemed absolutely necessary for patient safety."  
     
Points raised in the article:
     
* Efforts to create international standards for alarms have been 
underway since 1983 and are still unfinished.
     
* "...it is common for one event, such as a drop in a patient's blood 
pressure or speeding of his heart's rate, to set off a cascade of alarms 
from several sources..."
     
* "... conditions change during surgery, and medical equipment isn't 
able to distinguish context..."
     
* "... typically the attorney or chief executive [of the medical 
equipment manufacturer] thinks that the louder the alarm, the less 
likely their company is to be sued if someone doesn't respond..."
     
* Manufacturers see legal problems in trying to tie together warning 
systems from a variety of medical systems.  
     
The article did not point out the technical difficulties involved in 
prioritizing alarm conditions.

The "New Scientist" for 6 February 1993 contains this article:

		Chips hold key to door security

	An electronic key with a chip in its tip is to be marketed by the
	locksmiths, Chubb Security of Sunbury-on-Thames.  The key, called
	Eloctro, has a tiny silicon chip which stores a unique number
	ranging from 10 to 70 000 billion.

	The key fits a special battery-powered lock which stores all the
	authorised numbers in a memory chip.  When a key is inserted, the
	lock generates an electromagnetic field, which is picked up by an
	antenna on the chip.  The antenna switches on the chip, allowing
	the lock to read the key's unique number.  If the number matches
	one in the lock's memory the key can turn.

	The numbers in the lock's memory can be stored individually, by
	inserting a controllor's key followed by the numbered key; or, a
	computer can load a list of authorised numbers.

	Although individually numbered swipe cards have been available for
	years storing the number on a chip is more secure because it is
	almost impossible to read or reprogramme the number without
	breaking the key.  It is not available for homes yet.

Several rather evident risks there.

</i><PRE>

Following my posting to RISKS on January 17 entitled "Safety in
Telescript" a number of readers have strongly questioned some of the
statements I made in that posting. Two of those statements, in which I
used casual or imprecise language, were particularly criticized:

1- "Telescript is interpreted and, thus, is safer than compiled
languages." As pointed out by many readers, an interpreted language is
not intrinsically safer than a compiled language. It is the Telescript
language definition that provides that protection. Within the abstraction
created by Telescript, programs lack operations for directly manipulating
the physical resources of the "real" computer(s) on which they execute.

That doesn't mean that Telescript programs cannot interact with
applications (e.g., databases) outside the Telescript abstraction.
However, that interaction can only take place via Telescript objects that
act as proxies for the "external" applications. Each such proxy object
defines the features of the corresponding external application that are
to be made available to Telescript agents and places. It may also define
and enforce a security policy for controlling access to those features
(e.g., based on an agent's credentials and permit). Furthermore, the
administrative authority for a given Telescript engine is capable of
controlling (by means of mechanisms built into the language) who can and
cannot create these proxy objects.

2- "Authority names are cryptographically generated and cannot be
forged." Obviously, that statement is not true in an absolute sense since
the "unforgeability" of the authority name is directly related to the
cryptographic mechanism used to generate it. We currently use RSA-based
public key cryptography for generating authority names. Entitlement to
use a particular authority name can be linked to the secret key used to
generate it.

Aside from the criticism leveled against my poor choice of words in the
aforementioned statements, several readers complained about the lack of
more detailed information on the security technology used by Telescript,
namely, what cryptographic algorithms are used, key sizes, key
distribution and management issues, exportability issues, etc.

Let me start by saying that my posting was not meant as a treatise on
Telescript Technology but merely a brief description of some of the
features of Telescript that can be used effectively against misprogrammed
or ill-intentioned telescripts.

General Magic has already published a white paper entitled "Telescript
Technology: The Foundation of the Electronic Marketplace." This paper
provides a high-level description of Telescript and is intended for the
layman, not the techno-savvy reader. It can be requested directly from
General Magic by calling (415) 965-0400. In the coming months we will
publish additional information on many different aspects of Telescript
Technology (including security).

Let me further say that the point of my original posting was not that
Telescripted networks are intrinsically secure (i.e., the "it won't
happen here" syndrome). It was simply to let RISKS readers know that we
have put a lot of thought into the security aspects of Telescript. In
fact, when General Magic started developing Telescript, security was at
the top of our list of concerns. As a result, we have built into the
fabric of the language a number of features that, we believe, will enable
application developers to write safe Telescript programs and network
operators to run highly secure Telescripted networks.

Heretofore, the discussions on RISKS have only covered a few of the many
security issues faced by a dynamic, interpreted, communication-centric
language like Telescript. As more detailed information on Telescript
becomes widely available, I am certain it will generate heated debates on
this and other forums. I look forward to them!

&gt;From the New York Times, Tuesday, February 8, p. C5:

E-mail apparently made a bad situation worse for Bon Marche, a department
store in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  The store
misprinted a sale price for a Sony five-disk carousel CD player as $99, when
it was intended to be $179 (on sale from $199).  The NYT reports that nearly
5,000 people took advantage of the misprint, some placing paid orders once
available stock had been sold.

One salesman called attention to an unusual risk of email:

    The surge came in part because some employees at the Microsoft
    Corporation, based in nearby Redmond, had mentioned the deal in
    electronic-mail messages, he said.

Although the store could have run a correction ad or posted a disclaimer, they
did not; the price, according to the senior VP for marketing John Buller, "was
not totally irrational for this product."  I suppose the risk shouldn't keep
us up nights.

Craig DeForest (zowie@daedalus.stanford.edu) describes how an automated
survey daemon managed to show him a list of other subscribers to a
political-speech service. I had a similar, but more serious incident occur
on my account with a commercial Internet access provider.

The access provider (approximately 1000 users), in the interests of security,
routinely runs one of the many password cracking programs against their
/etc/passwd file. One day, I received Email stating that my password was
weak (it was). The interesting thing about the Email is that it included
a list of all recipients of the same message; the To: field was a concatenated
string of all users with weak passwords...

I sent Email to the operator, advising that this might not be the best
strategy for dealing with the problem :-). He assured me that this was a
one-time slip, due to his having used a Email command that improperly
included the full distribution list... Sigh.

The site DOES use a shadow password file, so it's not as bad as it could be.

Tom Bodine reports the unsettling experience of being accused of making an
obscene phone call, after the husband of the recipient of the call (his wife's
best friend) used the "call return" feature at the end of the obscene call,
and then reached his number.  He speculates that his number was captured by
the friend's telephone switch as the result of a failed call from his wife
while the friend's line was busy with the obscene call.

While such a feature interaction is possible (is the number supposed to be
captured on a busy ? I know it is on a no-answer failure), there is another
way for this to occur: The perpetrator may have applied the call forwarding
feature on his own phone prior to making the call, and left it there for a bit
afterwards. In this situation, the number that was captured would not be the
Bodines', but that of the perpetrator. The effect would be the same, however,
except that if the call is a billable long distance call, the number would
show up on the next phone bill, and in the case of forwarding it would be the
perpetrator's number (since the last leg of the call is billed to the
forwarding phone).

I believe that there is no such interaction problem in the case of the
"calling number identification" feature, since the number is delivered in real
time and only when the call rings through. Thus, the call that would come in
DURING the problem call, would only be recorded if the recipient had the "call
waiting" feature, and in that case would not get busy, but ringback, and the
CNID (if subscribed) would be delivered between the rings (call waiting
tones)).

I am forwarding this note to the TELECOM DIGEST where someone from AT&amp;T or
Bellcore will probably be able to look up whether the mechanism surmised by
Tom Bodine is also possible. I hope that this technical information will go
some way towards repairing relations between the families.

Someone of my acquaintance (who doesn't care to be identified here) sent in a
response to CPSR's Clipper petition and received a full and explanatory
confirmation from CPSR at the address from which it was sent.  So if CPSR is
also culling out signatures from bogus addresses, those two measures together

In Risks issue 46, David Gursky mentions the possibility that some of the
responses to the CPSR petition will be of the "Vote early, vote often"
variety, and goes on to cite previous discussion of the risks of dial up
voting.

Petitions are not votes.  CPSR does not claim to be collecting votes on
Clipper and tallying the ayes, nays and throat clearings.  Petitions are an
unsupervised form of expression.  The older paper variety could be padded
pretty easily too.  Other risks associated with petitions (electronic or not)
include the possibility of bias in the question to manipulate response: "Even
though the President claims to have stopped beating his wife, it is the
opinion of responsible rabble rousers in this great country that..."  Anybody
who's been in politics even as long as our present youthful president knows
that petitions can be manipulated, and adds salt accordingly.

The theatrical value of collecting a petition about the electronic
superhighway in the rest stops of the present byways is obvious.  The strong
risk that the petition will include invalid responses needs to be weighed
against the risk of having an unnecessarily expensive and possibly
untrustworthy security system in future.  Or does anyone believe that Clipper
would make collecting petitions safe from democracy?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation needs your help to ensure privacy rights!

                     * DISTRIBUTE WIDELY *

Monday, February 7th, 1994

From: Jerry Berman, Executive Director of EFF, jberman@eff.org

Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier,

I'm writing a personal letter to you because the time has now come for
action. On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Administration announced that it
plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip encryption scheme
a national standard, and to discourage the development and sale of
alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the government succeeds
in this effort, the resulting blow to individual freedom and privacy could
be immeasurable.

As you know, over the last three years, we at EFF have worked to ensure
freedom and privacy on the Net. Now I'm writing to let you know about
something *you* can do to support freedom and privacy. *Please take a
moment to send e-mail to U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell (cantwell@eff.org) to
show your support of H.R. 3627, her bill to liberalize export controls on
encryption software.* I believe this bill is critical to empowering
ordinary citizens to use strong encryption, as well as to ensuring that
the U.S. software industry remains competitive in world markets.

Here are some facts about the bill:

Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 in the House of Representatives on November
22, 1993.  H.R. 3627 would amend the Export Control Act to move authority over
the export of nonmilitary software with encryption capabilities from the
Secretary of State (where the intelligence community traditionally has stalled
such exports) to the Secretary of Commerce. The bill would also invalidate the
current license requirements for nonmilitary software containing encryption
capabilities, unless there is substantial evidence that the software will be
diverted, modified or re-exported to a military or terroristic end-use.

If this bill is passed, it will greatly increase the availability of
secure software for ordinary citizens. Currently, software developers do
not include strong encryption capabilities in their products, because the
State Department refuses to license for export any encryption technology
that the NSA can't decipher. Developing two products, one with less secure
exportable encryption, would lead to costly duplication of effort, so even
software developed for sale in this country doesn't offer maximum
security. There is also a legitimate concern that software companies will
simply set up branches outside of this country to avoid the export
restrictions, costing American jobs.

The lack of widespread commercial encryption products means that it will
be very easy for the federal government to set its own standard--the
Clipper Chip standard. As you may know, the government's Clipper Chip
initiative is designed to set an encryption standard where the government
holds the keys to our private conversations. Together with the Digital
Telephony bill, which is aimed at making our telephone and computer
networks "wiretap-friendly," the Clipper Chip marks a dramatic new effort
on the part of the government to prevent us from being able to engage in
truly private conversations.

We've been fighting Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony in the policy arena
and will continue to do so. But there's another way to fight those
initiatives, and that's to make sure that powerful alternative encryption
technologies are in the hands of any citizen who wants to use them. The
government hopes that, by pushing the Clipper Chip in every way short of
explicitly banning alternative technologies, it can limit your choices for
secure communications.

Here's what you can do: 

I urge you to write to Rep. Cantwell today at cantwell@eff.org. In the
Subject header of your message, type "I support HR 3627." In the body of
your message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. EFF will
deliver printouts of all letters to Rep. Cantwell. With a strong showing
of support from the Net community, Rep. Cantwell can tell her colleagues
on Capitol Hill that encryption is not only an industry concern, but also
a grassroots issue. *Again: remember to put "I support HR 3627" in your
Subject header.*

This is the first step in a larger campaign to counter the efforts of
those who would restrict our ability to speak freely and with privacy.
Please stay tuned--we'll continue to inform you of things you can do to
promote the removal of restrictions on encryption.

In the meantime, you can make your voice heard--it's as easy as e-mail.
Write to cantwell@eff.org today.

Sincerely,

Jerry Berman, Executive Director, EFF   jberman@eff.org

P.S. If you want additional information about the Cantwell bill, send
e-mail to cantwell-info@eff.org. To join EFF, write membership@eff.org.
For introductory info about EFF, send any message to info@eff.org.

Subject: Administration adopts coldwar mentality, pushes for Clipper

EFF Press Release            Feb 4 '94             * DISTRIBUTE WIDELY *

At two briefings, Feb. 4, 1994, the Clinton Administration and various
agencies gave statements before a Congressional committee, and later
representatives of civil liberties organizations, industry spokespersons
and privacy advocates.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation's position,
based on what we have seen and heard from the Administration today, is
that the White House is set on a course that pursues Cold War national
security and law enforcement interests to the detriment of individual
privacy and civil liberties.

The news is grim.  The Administration is:

 * not backing down on Clipper
 * not backing down on key escrow
 * not backing down on selection of escrow agents
 * already adamant on escrowed key access procedures
 * not willing to eliminate ITAR restrictions
 * hiding behind exaggerated threats of "drug dealers" and "terrorists"

The material released to the industry and advocacy version of the briefing
have been placed online at ftp.eff.org (long before their online availability
from government access sites, one might add).  See below for specific details.

No information regarding the Congressional committee version of the briefing
has been announced.  EFF Director Jerry Berman, who attended the private
sector meeting, reported the following:

"The White House and other officials briefed industry on its Clipper chip and
encryption review. While the review is not yet complete, they have reached
several policy conclusions.  First, Clipper will be proposed as a new Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) next Wednesday. [Feb.  9] It will be
"voluntary" for government agencies and the private sector to use. They are
actively asking other vendors to jump in to make the market a Clipper market.
Export licensing processes will be speeded up but export restrictions will not
be lifted in the interests of national security. The reason was stated bluntly
at the briefing : to frustrate competition with clipper by other powerful
encryption schemes by making them difficult to market, and to "prevent" strong
encryption from leaving the country thus supposedly making the job of law
enforcement and intelligence more difficult.  Again in the interest of
national security. Of course, Clipper will be exportable but they would not
comment on how other governments will view this.  Treasury and NIST will be
the escrow agents and Justice asserted that there was no necessity for
legislation to implement the escrow procedures.

"I asked if there would be a report to explain the rationale for choosing
these results - we have no explanation of the Administration's thinking, or
any brief in support of the results. They replied that there would be no
report because they have been unable to write one, due to the complexity of
the issue.

"One Administration spokesperson said this was the Bosnia of
Telecommunications. I asked, if this was so, how, in the absence of some
policy explanation, could we know if our policy here will be as successful as
our policy in Bosnia?"

Tue, 08 Feb 94 16:03:55 -0500
</i><PRE>

(originally submitted last week, but lost somewhere in our news system)

A group from NSA and FBI met the other day with a group of us at Bell Labs to
discuss the key escrow proposal.  They were surprisingly forthcoming and open
to discussion and debate, and were willing to at least listen to hard
questions.  They didn't object when asked if we could summarize what we
learned to the net.  Incidentally, the people at the meeting seemed to base a
large part of their understanding of public opinion on Usenet postings.
Postings to RISKS, sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto seem to actually have an
influence on our government.

Since the many of the points brought up at the meeting have been
discussed in RISKS, it seems appropriate to post a summary here.

A number of things came out at the meeting that we didn't previously know or
that clarified previously released information.  What follows is a rough
summary; needless to say, nothing here should be taken as gospel, or
representing the official positions of anybody.  Also, nothing here should be
taken as an endorsement of key escrow, clipper, or anything else by the
authors; we're just reporting.  These notes are based on the collective memory
of Steve Bellovin, Matt Blaze, Jack Lacy, and Mike Reiter; there may be errors
or misunderstandings.  Please forgive the rough style.  Note also the use of
"~ ~" for 'approximate quotes' (a marvelous Whit Diffie-ism).

NSA's stated goals and motives for all this:
	* DES is at the end of its useful life
	* Sensitive, unclassified government data needs protection
	* This should be made available to US Citizens
	* US business data abroad especially needs protection
	* The new technology should not preclude law enforcement access

They indicated that the thinking was not that criminals would use key escrowed
crypto, but that they should not field a system that criminals could easily
use against them.  The existence of key escrow would deter them from using
crypto in the first place.  The FBI representative said that they expect to
catch "~only the stupid criminals~" through the escrow system.

Another stated reason for key escrow is that they do not think that
even government-spec crypto devices can be kept physically secure.
They do expect enough to be diverted to the black market that they feel
they need a response.  NSA's emphasis was on the foreign black market...

There seems to be a desire to manipulate the market, by having the fixed cost
of key escrow cryptography amortized over the government market.  Any private
sector devices would have to sell a much larger number of units to compete on
price.  (This was somewhere between an implication and an explicit statement
on their part.)

When asked about cryptography in software, "~...if you want US government
cryptography, you must do it with hardware~".

The NSA people were asked whether they would consider evaluating ciphers
submitted by the private sector as opposed to simply proposing a new cipher as
a "black box" as they did with Skipjack.  They said they can't do this
because, among other things, of the extraordinary effort required to properly
test a new cipher.  They said that it often takes from 8-12 years to design,
evaluate and certify a new algorithm, and that Skipjack began development
"~about 10 years ago.~" I asked if we should infer anything from that about
the value of the (limited time and resource) civilian Skipjack review.  They
accepted the question with good humor, but they did say that the civilian
review was at least presented with and able to evaluate some of the results of
NSA's previous internal reviews.

Clipper chips should be available (to product vendors) in June.  You can't
just buy loose chips - they have to be installed in approved products.  Your
application interface has to be approved by NIST for you to get your hands on
the chips.

An interesting point came up about the reverse-engineering resistance of the
chips: they are designed to resist non-destructive reverse engineering.  It
was not clear (from the information presented at the meeting) whether the
chips are equally resistant to destructive reverse-engineering.  That is, the
chips are designed to resist non-destructive reverse engineering to obtain the
unit keys.  They do not believe that it is possible to obtain the unit key of
a particular chip without destroying the chip.  They did not present any
assertions about resistance to destructive reverse engineering, such that
several chips can be taken apart and destroyed in the process, to learn the
Skipjack algorithm. They said the algorithm was patented, but they may have
been joking.  ("~And if that doesn't scare you enough, we'll turn the patent
over to PKP.~")

The resistance to reverse engineering is not considered absolute by NSA.  They
do feel that "~it would require the resources of a national laboratory, and
anyone with that much money can design their own cryptosystem that's just as
strong.~"

They repeated several times that there are "~no plans to regulate the use of
alternate encryption within the US by US citizens.~" They also indicated they
"~weren't naive~" and didn't think that they could if they wanted to.

There were 919 authorized wiretaps, and 10,000 pen register monitors, in 1992.
They do not have any figures yet on how often cryptography was used to
frustrate wiretaps.

They do not yet have a production version of the "decoder" box used by law
enforcement.  Initially, the family key will be split (by the same XOR method)
and handled by two different people in the authorized agencies.  There is
presently only one family key.  The specifications of the escrow exploitation
mechanism are not yet final, either; they are considering the possibility of
having the central site strip off the outer layers of encryption, and only
sending the session key back to the decoder box.

The escrow authorities will NOT require presentation of a court order prior to
releasing the keys.  Instead, the agency will fill out a form certifying that
they have a legal authorization.  This is also backed up with a separate
confirmation from the prosecutor's office.  The escrow agencies will supply
any key requested and will not themselves verify that the keys requested are
associated with the particular court order.

As an aside, we've since been informed by a member of the civilian Skipjack
review committee that the rationale for not having the escrow agency see the
actual wiretap order is so that they do not have access to the mapping between
key serial numbers and people/telephones.

Regarding the scale of the escrow exploitation system, they said that they did
not yet have a final operational specification for the escrow protocols, but
did say that the escrow agencies would be expected to deliver keys "~within
about 2 hours~" and are aiming for "~close to real time.~" Initially, the FBI
would have the decoder box, but eventually, depending on costs and demand, any
law enforcement agency authorized to conduct wiretaps would be able to buy
one.  The two escrow agencies will be responsible for verifying the
certification from and securely delivering the key halves to any such police
department.

The NSA did not answer a question as to whether the national security
community would obtain keys from the same escrow mechanism for their (legally
authorized) intelligence gathering or whether some other mechanism would exist
for them to get the keys.

The masks for the Clipper/Capstone chip are unclassified (but are protected by
trade secret) and the chips can be produced in an unclassified foundry.  Part
of the programming in the secure vault includes "~installing part of the
Skipjack algorithm.~" Later discussion indicated that the part of the
algorithm installed in the secure vault are the "S-tables", suggesting that
perhaps unprogrammed Clipper chips can be programmed to implement other 80-bit
key, 32 round ciphers.

The Capstone chip includes an ARM-6 RISC processor that can be used for other
things when no cryptographic functions are performed.  In particular, it can
be used by vendors as their own on-board processor.  The I/O to the processor
is shut off when a crypto operation is in progress.

They passed around a Tessera PCMCIA (type 1) card.  These cards contain a
Capstone chip and can be used by general purpose PC applications.  The cards
themselves might not be export controlled.  (Unfortunately, they took the
sample card back with them...)  The card will digitally sign a challenge from
the host, so you can't substitute a bogus card.  The cards have non-volatile
onboard storage for users' secret keys and for the public keys of a certifying
authority.

They are building a library/API for Tessera, called Catapult, that will
provide an interface suitable for many different applications.  They have
prototype email and ftp applications that already uses it.  They intend to
eventually give away source code for this library.  They responded favorably
to the suggestion that they put it up for anonymous ftp.

Applications (which can use the library and which the NSA approves for
government use) will be responsible for managing the LEAF field.  Note that
they intend to apply key escrowed Skipjack to other applications, including
mail and file encryption.  The LEAF would be included in such places as the
mail header or the file attributes.  This implies that it is possible to omit
sending the LEAF -- but the decrypt chip won't work right if it doesn't get
one.

When asked, they indicated that it might be possible wire up a pair of
Clipper/Capstone chips to not transmit the LEAF field, but that the way to do
this is "~not obvious from the interface we give you~" and "~you'd have to be
careful not to make mistakes~".  They gave a lot of attention to obvious ways
to get around the LEAF.

The unit key is generated via Skipjack itself, from random seeds provided by
the two escrow agencies (approximately monthly, though that isn't certain
yet).  They say they prefer a software generation process because its correct
behavior is auditable.

Capstone (but not Clipper) could be configured to allow independent loading of
the two key halves, in separate facilities.  "~It's your money [meaning
American taxpayers].~"

The LEAF field contains 80 bits for the traffic key, encrypted via the unit
key in "~a unique mode &lt;grin&gt;~", 32 bits for the unit id, and a 16 bit
checksum of some sort.  (We didn't waste our breath asking what the checksum
algorithm was.)  This is all encrypted under the family key using "~another
mode &lt;grin&gt;~".

They expressed a great deal of willingness to make any sort of reasonable
changes that vendors needed for their products.  They are trying *very* hard
to get Skipjack and key escrow into lots of products.

Finally, I should make clear that "Clipper" is more properly called the
"MYK-78T".

   [Matt, Thanks for the contribution, and thanks for making careful
   distinctions among the escrow initiative (EEI), the algorithm (Skipjack),
   the telephone implementation (Clipper), and the computer system/network
   implementation (Capstone).  Much of what has been written on the subject
   has been confused because those distinctions were not consistently made.

CPSR has announced a petition campaign to oppose the Clipper initiative.  I
would like to caution people about signing the petition.  The issues are
extremely complex and difficult.  The Clipper initiative is the result of
considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
not made lightly.

I would like to respond to some of the statements that CPSR has made
about Clipper in their campaign and petition letters:
 
     The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
     Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for
     government agents to wiretap the emerging data highway.

The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting from FIPS
185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile and
computer information communicated in a telephone system.  A telephone system
for purposes of this standard is limited to a system which is circuit switched
and operating at data rates of standard commercial modems over analog voice
circuits or which uses basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service."

The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
computer networks.  All it will do is make it technically possible to
decrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assuming
the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
communications in the first place, and advances in technology have made
interception itself more difficult.  The standard will make it much
harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government.

The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong encryption algorithm -
something much stronger than DES - and to do so in a way that does not thwart
law enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are escrowed so that
if someone uses this technology, they cannot use it against national
interests.

     Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
     organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the
     plan since it was first proposed in April 1993.

     "The public does not like Clipper and will not accept it ..."

     The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
     opposition to Clipper.  

As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM is in the process of
conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
issues, not a public statement either for or against.  The International
Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my knowledge made any official
statement about Clipper.

     The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
     plan while only a few expressed support.

Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
following a sample letter that was sent out.
	
     The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It
     would provide government agents with copies of the keys that
     protect electronic communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
     security."

I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our
review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very
strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow system, from
what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide an extremely high
level of security for the escrowed keys.

     The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
     intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
     privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s
     disclosed widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
     interception of millions of cables sent by American citizens.

NSA is also responsible for the development of cryptographic codes to protect
the nation's most sensitive classified information.  They have an excellent
track record in conducting this mission.  I do not believe that our
requirements for protecting private information are greater than those for
protecting classified information.  I do not know the facts of the 1970s
incident that is referred to here, but it sounds like it occurred before
passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This act requires
intelligence agencies to get a court order in order to intercept
communications of American citizens.  I am not aware of any recent evidence
that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans.

     Computer security experts question the integrity of the
     technology.  Clipper was developed in secret and its
     specifications are classified.

The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very
strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full evaluation.
Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the technology by
someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that person is an expert in
security.

     NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
     1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
     standards for the nation's communications network.

The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
Agency."

     There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
     technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently
     forced the release of FBI documents that show no such problems.

CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field offices.  Those offices
reported no problems.  CPSR did not get reports from all field offices and did
not get reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell you that it
is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
hampered criminal investigations.  I personally commend law enforcement for
trying to get out in front of this problem.

     If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
     new products will face extensive government obstacles.
     Cryptographers who wish to develop new privacy enhancing
     technologies will be discouraged. 

The standard is voluntary -- even for the government.

     Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
     industry groups that understand the proposal. 

I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to
be fully informed of the national security implications of uncontrolled
encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and
debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to talk about the full
implications of encryption on law enforcement.  This is why it is important
that the President and Vice-President be fully informed on all the issues, and
for the decisions to be made at that level.  The Feb. 4 decision was made
following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the National Security
Council, that examined these issues using considerable input from industry,
CPSR, EFF, and individuals as well as from law enforcement and intelligence
agencies.  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
the full implications of encryption on society.

As part of the Feb. 4 announcement, the Administration announced the
establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Encryption and
Telecommunications, chaired by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy and National Security Council, with representatives from
Commerce, Justice, State, Treasury, FBI, NSA, OMB, and the National Economic
Council.  The group is to work with industry and public interest groups to
develop new encryption technologies and to review and refine encryption
policy.  The NRC's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board will also be
conducting a study of encryption policy.

These comments may be distributed.

Don Watts of Tustin CA checked in by SnailMail with a note that the StarWars
decoy/laser-radar program (FireFly) worked completely backwards (for example,
with respect to incoming maneuvers) because the accelerometer was wired in
opposition to the directional assumption in the software.  (The shaker tests
of the decoy were omitted in an effort to save money.)

Don Watts also offered the following memo from Steven Ray of the Ball Efratom
Division, dated 20 Jan 1994, and lightly edited by PGN.

  Aging Analysis Software malfunction

  On Monday, 17 January 1994, a `bug' developed in the IBM-based ``Ball
  Aging Analysis'' software program.  This bug prevents us from plotting
  any aging data after 16 Jan 1994 even though the data actually exists
  in the database.  This bug effectively shut down all shipments of units
  because no graphs could be generated.  After some initial investigation,
  this bug was linked to the modified Julian date of 2148 and that any 
  date before that was OK, but any data after that would not plot.  So,
  as a temporary fix while the software code is being corrected and to
  continue to be able to ship units, I have set the dates on all of the
  Aging computers back one year, to 1993, so that the aging data can be
  plotted on all Aging plots until a permanent fix can be done.

Which of the following is *not* a reason for the clinician to remain an
essential part of the diagnostic process?

A Computers are unable to collect and evaluate nonverbal data.
B Patients have poor acceptance of computer-assisted assessment.
C Computers are poor at temporal reasoning.
D Computers cannot assess the clinical significance of a behavior.

The answer was given as B, though of course AI researchers are working on the
others....

Anyway, the _Psychiatric Annals_ Jan 1994 Vol 24, No 1 issue is about "Using
Computers in Psychiatry".  Shrinks can get continuing education credit for
reading this mag and mailing in a quiz included.

Titles of articles range from using computers to teach ugrads (including
showing video clips of psychopaths from popular hollywood productions..)  to
expert systems making drug recommendations, to computational models of the
mind and Psychiatry.  Most articles are written by MDs with a few real
doctorates.

I was hoping that someone else might have seen more about this and posted 
information here, but it appears not; in that case I'll mention what I know,
in the hope that someone will be able to fill in the details.

One of the big UK banks is apparently planning to introduce a trial in
Swindon, UK of an electronic money system, where money is held on plastic
cards (I'm not sure whether magnetic or smart). Money is transferred through
the system using either a handheld reader or an EFTPOS system in a shop. The
cards are not personal, but can be locked with a 4-digit PIN code. A card that
isn't locked can be used by anyone, while a locked card requires the code in
order to view the balance or deduct money from the card. The nature of the
system allows individuals to transfer money from card to card using the
appropriate palmtop-sized system.

I assume that the money is "cryptographic", but I've forgotten the details (I 
read all this in a paper some months agp). Does anyone know any more about this
system? It raises a whole host of issues, both social and technical.

The following was posted on a local BBS about the recent incident on the 
network.

ANDREWS NEWS
 
Staff member suspended for network abuse, by Wendy Wein
 
     Clarence Thomas, systems administrator for "Redwood," the administrative
computer, will be temporarily suspended from his job because he sent a 5,500
character religious message to between 1,200 to 1,500 news groups across the
world through the Internet.  This act violated the system's purpose, giving
Andrews University a bad reputation among the Internet users. Over 1,200
complaints came over the Internet to the Andrews computer science department
demanding justice.
     According to Mailen Kootsey, chair of the academic computing committee
and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Thomas will be suspended from
his position for a week. His status will be reviewed at the end of the time
period. During this week Thomas will not have available access to the network
computers.
     Sometime between five and eight o'clock Monday evening, January 17,
Thomas sent his three-page message titled "Global Alert for All: Jesus is
Coming Soon," from the Andrews computing center to the news groups which are
accessible through the Internet, a computer system which connects computers
throughout the world.
     These news groups deal with different individual topics. For example, if
a news group is about cars, then only information about cars should be sent to
that news group. Some people subscribe to more than one group and some
universities and organizations are subscribed to almost all of them. Thomas
sent his religious message to all of these groups.
     People who were not interested received this message, some more than
once. Some organizations received 1,200 to 1,500 copies.  For many of the
subscribers religious input was not accepted very well. This message took up
their time and money.  The message accumulated 5.5 kilobytes of disk space.
Within an hour after the message was sent, Daniel Bidwell, administrative
contact for the network at Andrews, received Internet messages from the East
coast.
     In two hours they came from the West coast and within four hours,
complaint letters came in from other countries. The letters made statements
such as "This is not what I am paying for" and "Will this guy be stopped?"
     In addition to the news groups, Thomas also sent his message through a
mailing list, filling others' electronic mail. This could have been changed by
sending it to only a few news groups so fewer copies could have been
distributed.  "If he sent his message through a news group which dealt with
religious issues then everything would be fine," said Bidwell, "No one would
have known."
     There are no laws against Thomas' actions, yet he violated and broke some
of the unwritten rules of society. That is why many people are unhappy.
     This act created poor reactions towards the university.  Thomas' intent
was to spread the good news of Jesus' return to all those he could reach.
Thomas was trying to witness to others, yet instead of creating joy in
peoples' heart, he only created anger and resentment. "He was doing the right
thing in the wrong way," said Bidwell.
     Some of those who wrote to complain said that they agreed with the
message, but that Thomas delivered it wrongly. This message has created bad
public relations for the church at another's expense.
     The letters that were received included threats. They wanted Thomas
fired, or else the Internet connections from the Andrews campus could be
"taken." People are now writing and finding ways to contact President Lesher.
Not only have strangers called, but also a large amount of Adventists claiming
that something must be done to save the church's sacred reputation.
     On Monday morning, January 24, Rob Barnhurst, Thomas's supervisor and
director of the computing center, Ed Wines, vice president for finance, and
Kootsey, met to discuss the incident.  They decided to send out an apology
through the Internet, explaining that they did not condone Thomas's act and
will try to keep this from happening again.
     Thomas graduated from Andrews with a computer science degree.  Those at
the computer science department feel that he knew better then to send out that
many copies. "It was clearly, very definitely abuse," said Ray Paden, chair of
the computer science department.  "He broke the guidelines for the Internet
and violated the net etiquette. The trust was violated."

Glitch Reveals The Power Of Internet; New Group's Offer Unleashes Users' Tirade
By John Burgess and John Schwartz, Washington Post Staff Writers, 31 Jan 1994
  
  A small organization promising free access to a global computer network
  found itself recently the focus of a deluge of electronic hate mail. To its
  chagrin, the messages were carried all over the world by the very network
  the group promotes, the Internet.

The authors explain that the International Internet Association (IIA) issued
ads last year offering free access to the Internet.  However, to get access,
eager users had to submit a credit card number.  Then, potential customers
were told, the free-access ports were generally busy.  If they wished, such
customers could subscribe to the service at $0.20/minute, charged to the
credit card.

Scott Ward, an official with CapAccess of Washington, DC, another service
providing free Internet access, investigated IIA and couldn't locate any
evidence of its computer.  He then sent out an electronic warning that was
widely circulated. He wrote, "I am not convinced this organization exists and
highly discourage any Internet user from sending information until you make
certain that the IIA is real."

Unfortunately for everyone involved, the IIA was real.  The Executive Director
of the IIA, Max Robbins, promised to repair the damage to its credibility
caused by the incorrect electronic rumour.  He announced changes in the
organization's financing: all access would be free, but the IIA would solicit
corporate donations.


This story once again illustrates the need for the same (or greater) level
of care in verifying what we post on the Internet.  Because information in
electronic form doesn't fade, get wrinkled, or impossible to read after
multiple use, electronic rumours can circulate forever.  RISKS readers will
recall the case of Craig Shergold's unstoppable avalanche of post cards.

Medicare Billing to Join Electronic Superhighway; One National System to
Handle All Payments, By Spencer Rich, Washington Post, 20 Jan 1994

    By the end of the decade, one giant nationwide computer system will
  electronically pay nearly all of the 1 billion bills Medicare handles each
  year. Beneficiaries will only have to hand their Medicare cards to their
  doctors, hospitals, laboratories or nursing homes to make sure their bills
  get paid.
    Once a patient's identification number is punched into a terminal at a
  hospital or doctor's office, the computer will compute how much Medicare
  owes, electronically transfer that amount to the doctor's or hospital's bank
  account, calculate how much an individual's Medigap (supplemental insurance)
  policy owes and automatically bill for that. If the Medicare beneficiary has
  no Medigap policy, the government computer will bill the patient for
  whatever is owed."

The article continues with the following key points:

o    $19 million six-year contract to GTE Government Systems Corp. of
     Chantilly, Va., for design and implementation;
o    implementation '96-'98;
o    Medicare Transaction System (MTS) will eliminate many manual procedures;
o    may save $200 million a year.

As an addendum to Phil Agre's note in Risks 15.44, PGN begins:

&gt;    [We are going to see all sorts of metaphors springing up on the

Perhaps most evocative, from the "Editor's Note" on the state and future of
jounalism in the January/February issue of the /Columbia Journalism Review/:

  Only now, thanks to the new technology, the public doesn't have to take
  it anymore; with every passing day people have more alternatives to the
  traditional news media to choose from, a situation that has prompted
  commentator Jeff Greenfield to warn that journalists may become
  "roadkill on the information highway."

&gt;Newsgroups: alt.internet.services
&gt;Subject: Altered White House documents
&gt;Date: 5 Feb 1994 09:38:23 -0800
&gt;
&gt;I assume everyone knows about the ftp site whitehouse.gov. I just
&gt;discovered that the Clinton rebuttal to Elizabeth McCaughey's
&gt;critique of his health care plan has been altered on
&gt;whitehouse.gov - with no mention in the current version that it
&gt;has been changed.
 
    I assume that neither of you know the difference between a 
    speech-as-written and a speech-as-delivered.
 
&gt;According to Associated Press writer Tom Raum, the original White
&gt;House rebuttal to McCaughey's New Republic magazine article used
&gt;the word "lie" four times. The copy of the White House rebuttal I
&gt;just downloaded (Feb 5, morning, pacific time) does not contain
&gt;the word lie nor does it contain any indication that it is a
&gt;"revised" version.
 
    Then, it's the speech-as-written and not the                  
    speech-as-delivered.
 
&gt;White House spokesman Dee Dee Myers defended the rebuttal on
&gt;Thursday although she conceded that "perhaps the language was a
&gt;little strong." Clinton, asked by reporters earlier this week
&gt;about calling McCaughey's comments lies, responded, "Well, I hate
&gt;to use that word, but the New Republic article was way off base
&gt;and the New Republic didn't make total disclosure about the source
&gt;of the article." So Clinton admitted to the use of "lie" but it
&gt;has since been removed from the version available for anonymous
&gt;ftp at whitehouse.gov. Makes you wonder just how self- serving and
&gt;accurate the rest of the information there might be...
 
    That's a knee-jerk reaction and totally inaccurate. The       
    speeches-as-written are usually delivered a few hours in      
    advance of the speech, with an embargo on publication until the 
    speech has been delivered (the same embargo the rest of the   
    news media observes, by the way). If you look in the White    
    House Papers gopher hole (accessible for anonymous ftp by     
    telnetting to vector.casti.com), which mirrors the gopher     
    SUNsite at Syracuse University), there are several examples of 
    speeches-as-written (indicated by "as prepared") being followed 
    by clearly indicated "CORRECTED--as delivered" speeches.
 
&gt;UWSA'ers note: the whitehouse.gov directory /pub/political-
&gt;science/speeches/perot contains the text of Perot's book "United
&gt;We Stand," and various Perot speeches. But no, I have not double-
&gt;checked them for unauthorized "revisions."
 
    These are no longer contained in directories which are mirrored 
    by whitehouse.gov, as they are not White House documents. Talk 
    to Mr. Perot and get the address of *his* ftp site (I doubt if 
    he has one).
 
In the future, make sure you get the FACTS before you spout off
about stuff you--apparently--know nothing about. I know that doing
a bit of investigative research would greatly hobble your
arguments, but it would be the courteous thing to do.
 
If you have questions about what is or isn't contained in the
documents available through whitehouse.gov, ask first. 
 
The address for comments/questions/suggestions about the document
site is:

    In <A HREF="/Risks/15.47.html">RISKS-15.47</A>, mech@eff.org (Stanton McCandlish) asks us to "*Please take
a moment to send e-mail to U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell (cantwell@eff.org) to show

    It's unclear if Rep. Cantwell

	(a) asked for the account to be established,
	(b) was aware of the account's existence, or
	(c) had no idea of the existence of the account (though I'm sure she

    If EFF is acting on its own initiative as a mail to print reflector for
Rep. Cantwell, perhaps this should be stated and some other, non-confusing

&gt; "driving doctors and nurses to distraction" who agree that "alarm noise 
&gt; pollution is a significant problem that threatens patient health" 
&gt; presumably because "doctors order that all alarms be disconnected except 
&gt; those deemed absolutely necessary for patient safety."  

For more information and detail on one aspect of this see the December 1993
issue of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology.  This magazine is probably
of interest to many Risks readers, since the subject is an intersection of a
significant risk area with a significant computer content.

The discussion of ethics in the December issue is probably the most important.
It should act as a strong reminder that the risk of computer malfunction is
merely one aspect of system ethical analysis.  Just as most people now
understand that risk analysis must include the whole operational environment,
not just the literal instructions, we will eventually learn to consider risks
in the larger ethical context.  The initial step is to begin to understand the
ethical issues.

Isn't wuarchive one of the more widely mirrored archive sites? Couldn't they
get most of their files back by copying from the mirrors? I know this misses
the original point about failed backups as far as other sites are concerned,
but it seems to me there are benefits of as well as risks from computers and
technology here.   Tim

&gt; ... the FORTRAN library disk i-o routine did retry for read failure, 

This reminds me of something I had meant to send in long ago, but which
may still be relevant.  The NEC CDR-72 CD-ROM seems to have used a similar,
highly successful error recovery technique.  I don't remember the exact
details, but the drive would substitute either the previous or the next
block for the one it had meant to retry.  There was absolutely no indication
of error to the host machine, just _silent_ data corruption.  Given what we
expect from CD-ROMs, the risks of this kind of failure mode are obvious.
(Oh, and note that this problem showed up with the first soft errors after
but a few months of dust accumulation.)

I think NEC's treatment of the problem shows a worse risk, though.  They
knew the flaw existed and they took no action to contact registered owners
(let alone unregistered ones).  Moreover, their first-level technical support
was either uninformed or else was instructed to avoid the issue.  When I
explained the problem to them in great detail, they kept insisting that I
send them the specific CD that was showing the problem and/or try a different
CD in the drive.  They could not (or would not) grasp the concept that an
unreported error was unacceptable in this context.  And they felt that if
any CD could be found to read without corruption at least once then the
drive must be fine.  I asked that they have somebody with a more technical
background get back to me, and indeed somebody did get back to me.

The technical person was so technical, of course, that he would not listen
to my detailed description of which blocks ended up where.  Instead he
required me to bring the phone to the computer to perform a ``special test.''
The test turned out to be to copy a file from the CD to the hard disk and
then run the ``special'' DOS program COMP on the two copies.  I was to
report the number of mismatches shown.  The number of mismatches was
the maximum that COMP will display before giving up, and reciting that
number won me a replacement drive for what he admitted was a known
problem.  I hate to think what would have happened if the drive failed
the same way during the COMP as during the copy.  Or worse, if I didn't
have a DOS machine on which to run the ``special test'' to his satisfaction.

I'm no expert on the uses of CD-ROMs, but I'll bet someone can come up
with a pretty bad scenario caused by these kinds of errors.

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.48.html">RISKS-15.48</A>, 9 Feb 1994, Dorothy Denning states:

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
&gt;many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
&gt;people who have been silent on this issue.  The ACM is in the process of
&gt;conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
&gt;I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
&gt;issues, not a public statement either for or against.  The International
&gt;Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my knowledge made any official
&gt;statement about Clipper.

I am chair of USACM, which is the new U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM.
A few months ago we asked Steve Kent to chair a panel that would study
encryption policy in the U.S. and produce a report for ACM.  As Dorothy
mentions, she is on the panel, together with several other illustrious
individuals, including the esteemed moderator of RISKS.  I have included the
list of panelists at the end of this note.  CPSR is no more a member of the
panel than are the National Security Agency or the Department of Justice.
The panel does have members who are affiliated with all three organizations.

I am certain that Dorothy did not intend to give the impression that the
ACM panel has decided that ACM will not have a public position on Clipper.
However, since her email might have been misinterpreted by some readers,
I want to clarify that, while ACM has not taken a position on Clipper,
there has not been any decision made within ACM of which I am aware that
prevents ACM from taking a position at some future time.  In addition,
it is my understanding that there has been no final determination made by
the panel of precisely what the report will or will not contain.

Barbara Simons, Chair USACM

The members of the ACM encryption policy panel are:

  Dr. Clint Brooks, National Security Agency
  Scott Charney, Department of Justice
  Dr. Dorothy Denning, Georgetown University
  Dr. Whitfield Diffie, Sun Microsystems Inc.
  Dr. Anthony Lauck, Digital Equipment Corporation
  Douglas Miller, Software Publishers Association

Dorothy Denning has raised important questions about the Clipper proposal.  As
she says "the issues are extremely complex and difficult."  Below I've tried
to answer the points she has raised.  I apologize in advance to RISKS readers
who know all of this.

Please read her comments and my response.  Speak with others interested in the
Clipper proposal.  If on balance, after reviewing the arguments, you decide
Clipper is a mistake then you should express your opposition by sending a
message to:

     CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG

with the words

     "I oppose Clipper"

in the subject header.  If you have already signed the petition, ask a friend
or colleague to sign.

Your help is needed.

Marc Rotenberg, director, CPSR Washington office

&gt;&gt;  The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the   
&gt;&gt;  National Security Agency, is a technical standard 
&gt;&gt;  that will make it easier for government agents to 
&gt;&gt;  wiretap the emerging data highway.
  
&gt;  The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the 
&gt;  Internet or any other high speed computer network.  It 
&gt;  is for the telephone system.  

The letter to the President makes clear that we are concerned about "Clipper
and associated standards" which include the Capstone EES configuration for
data transmission.

It is clearly the intent of the EES proposal to cover both voice and data
transmissions.
  
&gt;  The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, 
&gt;  let alone computer networks.  All it will do is make it 
&gt;  technically possible to decrypt communications that are 
&gt;  encrypted with the standard, assuming the communications 
&gt;  are not superencrypted with something else.  

This is a little bit like saying that leaving a master key for every house on
your block with the police will not make it easier for the police to open
locked doors.

We may disagree about whether this is a good idea, but let's be clear about
the intent of the proposal.
  
&gt;  The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong 
&gt;  encryption algorithm - something much stronger than DES 
&gt;  - and to do so in a way that does not thwart law 
&gt;  enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are 
&gt;  escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they 
&gt;  cannot use it against national interests.

The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
security" interests in domestic wire surveillance?
 
&gt;&gt;  Industry groups, professional associations and 
&gt;&gt;  civil liberties organizations have expressed almost 
&gt;&gt;  unanimous opposition to the plan since it was first 
&gt;&gt;  proposed in April 1993.
 
&gt;&gt;  The private sector and the public have expressed 
&gt;&gt;  nearly unanimous opposition to Clipper.  
  
&gt;  As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has 
&gt;  conducted any systematic poll of industry, professional 
&gt;  societies, or the public.  

To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a proposed technical
standard that generated more opposition.  Firms across the telecommunications
and computer industry oppose Clipper.  Computer security people and
cryptographers oppose Clipper.  Privacy experts oppose Clipper.

&gt;&gt;  The Administration ignored the overwhelming 
&gt;&gt;  opposition of the general public. When the Commerce 
&gt;&gt;  Department solicited public comments on the 
&gt;&gt;  proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the 
&gt;  plan while only a few expressed support.
  
&gt;  Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a 
&gt;  population of 250 million, especially when most of the 
&gt;  letters were the same and came in through the net 
&gt;  following a sample letter that was sent out. 

I would encourage Dorothy, or anyone else, to take a poll of any
representative user group -- RISKS readers perhaps -- if there is any doubt
about how the public feels about the proposal.
 
&gt;&gt;  The technical standard is subject to misuse and 
&gt;&gt;  compromise. It would provide government agents with 
&gt;&gt;  copies of the keys that protect electronic 
&gt;&gt;  communications. "It is a nightmare for computer      
&gt;&gt;  security."
  
&gt;  I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We 
&gt;  have completed our review of the encryption algorithm, 
&gt;  SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very strong.  While we 
&gt;  have not completed our review of the key escrow system, 
&gt;  from what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will 
&gt;  provide an extremely high level of security for the 
&gt;  escrowed keys.

Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The group
that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting history.  The
majority of cryptographers asked to participate declined.
  
&gt;&gt;  The underlying technology was developed in secret 
&gt;&gt;  by the NSA, an intelligence agency responsible for 
&gt;&gt;  electronic eavesdropping, not privacy protection. 
&gt;&gt;  Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed 
&gt;&gt;  widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal 
&gt;&gt;  interception of millions of cables sent by American 
&gt;&gt;  citizens.
  
&gt;  NSA is also responsible for the development of 
&gt;  cryptographic codes to protect the nation's most 
&gt;  sensitive classified information.  They have an 
&gt;  excellent track record in conducting this mission.  

Senator Frank Church, who conducted the most extensive hearings ever held on
the National Security Agency, said that the NSA's intelligence gathering
capabilities were important for the security of the United States.  He also
said that the massive eavesdropping capability created "A tremendous potential
for abuse." If ever turned against the communications system of the United
States:

  no American would have any privacy left . . . there
  would be no place to hide.

  We must see to it that this agency and all agencies
  that possess this technology operate within the law and
  under proper supervision, so that we never cross
  over that abyss.  That is an abyss from which there
  is no return. " (NBC Meet the Press, 1975)

&gt;&gt;  Computer security experts question the integrity of 
&gt;&gt; the technology. Clipper was developed in secret and 
&gt;&gt;  its specifications are classified.
 
&gt;  The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously 
&gt;  agreed that it was very strong.  We will publish a final 
&gt;  report when we complete or full evaluation. Nothing can 
&gt;  be concluded from a statement questioning the technology 
&gt;  by someone who has not seen it regardless of whether 
&gt;  that person is an expert in security.

The original CPSR letter to the President, asking for the withdrawal of
Clipper, was signed by Hellman, Rivest, Diffie, Merkle, and others.  Many more
experts are adding their names daily to the CPSR petition.
 
&gt;&gt;  NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing 
&gt;&gt;  the standard.  A 1987 law explicitly limits the 
&gt;&gt;  intelligence agency's power to set standards for 
&gt;&gt;  the nation's communications network.
  
&gt;  The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall 
&gt;  draw on the technical advice and assistance (including 
&gt;  work products) of the National Security Agency."

The original replacement for DES, proposed by the Department of Commerce in
1989, would have had these characteristics:

-- public, unclassified
-- implementable in both hardware or software
-- usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national corporation
-- a level of security sufficient for the protection of unclassified, 
   sensitive information and commercial propriety and/or valuable information.

The final proposal, developed with the "technical assistance" of the NSA, has
these characteristics.

-- The Clipper algorithm Skipjack is classified
-- Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is restricted
-- Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware 
-- It will not be used by multi-national corporations
-- The security of the configuration remains unproven.

The Computer Security Act was passed precisely because the NSA tried
previously to grab civilian computer security turf.  The law was specifically
intended to control the type of abuse that results from secret
standard-setting arrangements.

If there any doubt among RISKS readers about the illegal activities of the NSA
in the development of the EES, please consult the minutes of the NSA/NIST
Technical Working Group (TWG) that produced the standard.  The minutes should
be available from the National Security Agency Public Information Office.
That phone number is 301/688-6524.

&gt;&gt;  There is no evidence to support law enforcement's 
&gt;&gt;  claims that new technologies are hampering criminal 
&gt;&gt;  investigations. CPSR recently forced the release of 
&gt;&gt;  FBI documents that show no such problems.
  
&gt;  CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field 
&gt;  offices.  Those offices reported no problems.  CPSR did 
&gt;  not get reports from all field offices and did not get 
&gt;  reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell 
&gt;  you that it is a fact that new communications 
&gt;  technologies, including encryption, have hampered 
&gt;  criminal investigations.  

The statement is illogical.  There is still no evidence to support the FBI's
claims.

The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that none
of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The Department of
Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all relevant documents
concerning the Clipper proposal.

There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of a
file on a hard disk after it was seized.

If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world.

Every encrypted file. Everywhere.

&gt;&gt;  If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that 
&gt;&gt;  hope to develop new products will face extensive 
&gt;&gt;  government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to 
&gt;&gt;  develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be 
&gt;&gt;  discouraged. 
  
&gt;  The standard is voluntary -- even for the government.

An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House would
mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is backed by fines up to $10,000
per day and jail time.

That's not voluntary.
 
&gt;&gt;  Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to 
&gt;&gt;  understand the full implications of this plan.  
&gt;&gt;  Today it is only a few experts and  industry groups 
&gt;&gt;  that understand the proposal. 
  
&gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not 
&gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the 
&gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled 
&gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot 
&gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum.  

This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used simply
to stifle criticism.

&gt;  The Feb. 4 decision was made 
&gt;  following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the 
&gt;  National Security Council, that examined these issues 
&gt;  using considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and 
&gt;  individuals as well as from law enforcement and 
&gt;  intell

CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review.  Our position from
the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly.

&gt;  In the absence of understanding 
&gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to 
&gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can 
&gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on 
&gt;  society.

This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States would
have no right to express political views when the government claimed "national
security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that must be
protected, but when an agency with expertise in wire surveillance develops a
secret standard for eavesdropping and tells those who raise questions that
there are matters of national security that they would not understand, there
is good reason for concern.

Wed, 9 Feb 94 22:16:51 EST

I would like to comment upon a few points raised by Dr. Denning:

&gt;The decisions that have been made were not made lightly.

While I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Dr. Denning here, I'm
sure that those who oppose the Clipper initiative are also intelligent and
have also worked very hard to make their concerns known.  I have studied this
issue actively and I assure you that I did not sign the petition "lightly".

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network.

While the Clipper initiative only covers the phone system, the entire proposal
(Clipper and Capstone and the key escrow system) will touch the high-speed
networks and should be taken as a whole.

&gt;...assuming
&gt;the communications are not superencrypted with something else.  Law
&gt;enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
&gt;communications in the first place...

There are two points to address here.  First, it is currently very difficult
to produce and export cryptographic software of any significant strength due
to export controls.  A private entity which has the resources to produce a
strong cryptographic solution will have to invest a great deal to produce such
software.  The current export controls would make it impossible for such an
entity to compete on the world market, thus limiting profit, possibly to the
point of non-profitability.  This makes superencryption pretty unlikely, and
this is one of the purposes of the current export controls on encryption.
Also at issue is whether the government will outlaw non-Clipper/Capstone/Key
Escrow encryption entirely.

Second, law enforcement needs to get a court order to intercept phone
communications.  I know of no such need to get a court order to intercept
communications on a high speed network w.r.t. Capstone.  The current
administration proposal does not require a court order to get the escrowed
keys themselves.

&gt;     The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the
&gt;     general public. When the Commerce Department solicited public
&gt;     comments on the proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
&gt;     plan while only a few expressed support.
&gt;
&gt;Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
&gt;especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt;following a sample letter that was sent out.

Currently the community which is informed on this issue is rather small.  It
is unclear whether that population of 250 million would support the initiative
if they were fully informed.  Assuming the people which responded to the
Commerce Department solicitation is representative of the public at large,
it is clear that this is not a popular initiative outside of government/
law enforcement/national security circles.

&gt;I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We have completed our
&gt;review of the encryption algorithm, SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very
&gt;strong.  While we have not completed our review of the key escrow system, from
&gt;what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will provide an extremely high
&gt;level of security for the escrowed keys.

I'm sure that the committee which reviewed the algorithm made as accurate
an assessment of the algorithm they could in the limited time they were given.
What the NSA refuses to answer on this point is whether it, or the rest of the
national security community will use the escrow system.  If the [national
security] community does not sign up [for the key escrow system], then the
escrow system will be effectively compromised.

&gt;...I am not aware of any recent evidence
&gt;that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans...

From what I understand, the Act was passed in response to the incident in the
1970s.  Just because one doesn't have evidence doesn't mean that abuses don't
exist, and one can't make basic policy decisions based upon that.  When
considering important policy like this, one has to actively consider the risks
of abuse.

&gt;...

From what current reports show, NSA pushed the proposal through NIST, and it
was NSA, not NIST, which was the true author and sponsor of the initiative.
They were operating on a "gray area" where because they were the only source
for the standard considered, they effectively set the standard without
explicitly violating the law.

&gt;...  I can tell you that it
&gt;is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt;hampered criminal investigations.  I personally commend law enforcement for
&gt;trying to get out in front of this problem.

Dr. Denning, would you, as a service to RISKS readers, disclose your evidence
of how encryption has hampered criminal investigations?  And how often?  And
what kind of investigations were hampered?

&gt;...  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
&gt;believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
&gt;the full implications of encryption on society.

I disagree and Dr. Denning contradicts herself.  If the decision is made at
those levels, the public will not be informed.  This policy is too important
to relegate to a back room.

National Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee met today in Washington
at the Old Executive Office Building.  In comments made after a question and
answer period, Vice President Al Gore said that key escrow policy announced
last Friday (4 Feb 1994) had serious flaws and that he hope the issue of who
holds the keys and under what terms would be given more serious, careful
consideration.

Gore made it clear that some amount of control of cryptography technology was
necessary for national security.  However, the key escrow policies announced
by the Departments of Justice, Commerce &amp; State, and the NSA, were "low level
decisions" that got out before thorough analysis.  In a conversation with
Mitchell Kapor, Esther Dyson, and Mike Nelson (of the White House Staff), Gore
said that he would prefer that the keys be held by some part of the Judiciary
branch, or perhaps even by trusted, private escrow agents.  He made it clear
that he believed that the escrow agents named in last Friday's announcement
(National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology and the Treasure Department)
were no appropriate key holders.  Mike Nelson also indicated that there was
real interest in a software-based escrow system instead of the hardware-based
SKIPJACK standard

Those of us who heard Gore were quite surprised.  His remarks suggest that the
key escrow policies to date do not have full support of the White House.

Still, Gore was quite firm in asserting that some control of encryption
technology is essential to national security.  "Encryption and codebreaking
have determined the outcome of world wars.  He stated (incorrectly) that
most our industrialized allies place must stricter controls in encryption
that the US does.  In fact, almost all COCOM countries allow the export of
DES-based products, though some do not allow DES to be imported.

The whole question of encryption was raised when Mitchell Kapor told the
Vice President that over half of the Advisory Council members had serious
reservations about the current Clipper/Skipjack policies.  Gore and Kapor
agreed that the Advisory Council should be used to have a serious dialogue
about encryption policy.  Given Gore's departure from the current Clipper
proposals, there might actually be something to talk about.

==========
NOTE: This DOES NOT mean that Clipper is going away.  Part of stopping Clipper
is to lift export controls on encryption and enable US companies to start
producing products that enable all of us to protect our privacy with strong
encryption.

I urge you to write to Rep. Cantwell today at cantwell@eff.org. In the Subject
header of your message, type "I support HR 3627." In the body of your message,
express your reasons for supporting the bill. EFF will deliver printouts of
all letters to Rep. Cantwell. With a strong showing of support from the Net
community, Rep. Cantwell can tell her colleagues on Capitol Hill that
encryption is not only an industry concern, but also a grassroots issue.
*Again: remember to put "I support HR 3627" in your Subject header.*

  [For more info on the Cantwell bill, see Stanton's contribution 
  in <A HREF="/Risks/15.47.html">RISKS-15.47</A>.  I have deleted a lengthy repetition here.  There is as

    Carnegie Mellon University is known around the world as a technological
innovator. To a great extent, this also makes our entire university dependent
on technology to function efficiently.
    Our reliance on computers and computer networks was made clear earlier
today when the results of the student government elections -- for the first
time in the history of the school -- could not be validated because a computer
system with the master list of eligible students was offline.
    As might be expected, the ill-timed computer failure upset quite a few
people who wanted to know the results, for this election marked the
culmination of a drawn-out dispute between graduate and undergraduate
students, who had planned to settle their difficulties at the ballot box.
    But the results can't be completely counted until the SIS (Student
Information System) verifies that all the candidates -- and suspect voters --
have paid their bills this semester. We're hoping that it's going to be back
up tomorrow...

&gt;From the _Oregonian_, Sat. Feb. 5, 1994, p. B1, B3:

Near collision at PDX prompts investigation

Two commercial airplanes carrying 113 people nearly collided in flight near
Portland Thursday afternoon, prompting an FAA investigation into whether an
on-board warning system put the planes on a collision course.  The pilot of
Alaska Airlines flight 548 saw the Horizon Airlines Dash-8 out his window and
later estimated it flew within three-fourths to one mile of his plane.

   [...deleted paragraph about standard minimum separation of 3 miles...]

The Alaska MD-80 carried 80 passengers and five crew members; the Horizon
Dash-8 had 25 passengers and 3 crew.  The incident happened at 2:38 PM
Thursday and involved the Alaska flight taking off from Portland International
Airport and Horizon Airlines Flight 2215 from Spokane, which was on its
descent for landing.

Dick Meyer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Seattle,
said the Alaska flight was climbing at a normal rate of speed when each
plane's Traffic Collision Avoidance System warned of the possibility of
collision.  The planes were at between 9,000 and 10,000 feet elevation and 12
to 13 miles northeast of Portland when the collision alert was sounded.

The warning system, also known as TCAS, is a computerized warning system now
onboard every commercial flight in the United States.  It uses radio signals
emitted by each plane to determine whether there are other aircraft that are
approaching a plane's course.  If there are, TCAS sends out a "resolution
advisory" consisting of a visual signal and audible warnings telling the pilot
to either climb or descend.  

Meyer said the Horizon was at 10,000 feet and preparing to descend.  The
Alaska flight was climbing to 9,000 feet when the TCAS system on both planes
went off.  "The Horizon flight that was coming in received a TCAS alert that
told it to descend.  The Alaska plane was climbing at its normal rate and got
a TCAS alert that told it to climb," Meyer said.  Meyer said the Horizon pilot
began dropping to 9,000 feet and radioed air traffic control.  The controller,
realizing there was a plane coming up to that altitude, got both pilots on the
radio and ordered the Horizon flight "to climb and maintain separation," Meyer
added.

The two planes eventually flew within less than a mile of each other at the
same elevation.  "It was the response to the TCAS alerts that caused them to
come closer than they should," Meyer said.  Meyer said the Alaska pilot filed
a near midair collision report with the FAA.  Meyer said the incident was
being investigated by the FAA and its TCAS program manager in Washington, D.C.

Ted Blahnik, Horizon's chief pilot, said he didn't think the Thursday incident
demonstrated any problems with TCAS.

"This is not a glitch," he said.  "This thing operated exactly as designed.
[!! My *favorite* line!!]  The guy who really went into stress mode was the
air traffic controller."

TCAS has been on most commercial planes for the past several years.  It's been
required on all U.S. flights carrying more than 30 passengers since Dec. 30.

Air traffic controllers have been critical of TCAS, saying it is prone to
warn pilots of phantom planes and order them to fly into the paths of nearby
aircraft.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has complained repeatedly
about TCAS warnings in busy air space near airports.  Controllers have
contended that the devices tend to erode the margin of safety because pilots
tend to adhere to the warning system rather than rely on the controller's
directions.

The association reported in 1992 that about 63% of the TCAS warnings from May
1991 to July 1992 were invalid.  Groups representing airline pilots, however, 
favor the system.  They testified before Congress in 1991 that TCAS was a
"giant step forward" in preventing flight collisions.

The FAA in May 1991 ordered that some of the TCAS devices on commercial
airlines be removed temporarily because they were reporting false alarms.
Technical improvements were made since then, and Meyer said that more
improvements would be in place by the end of the year "that would make TCAS
readings...more definitive."

TCAS systems will be required on all planes carrying 10 passengers or more by
9 Feb 1995.

Pacific Bell customers get messages on voice mail that they'd rather not hear
Valley Times (Livermore Valley area), 10 Feb 1994

  Electronic hackers have been intruding in to the Pacific Bell voice mail
  service. "The hackers have broken into the system, altering message
  greetings and changing passwords, which can keep legitimate users out of
  their mailbox."  Pacific Bell spokeswoman Sandy Hale said that it is a rare
  occurrence. Patrice Papalus Director of the San Francisco-based Computer
  Security Institute said "Telecommunications, computer and switchboard fraud
  is on the increase...Breaking into voice mail is really common."

The article went on to say that two teenagers who were infuriated because they
didn't receive a free computer game poster in a magazine promotion broke into
IDG's voice-mail system and distributed obscene messages and greetings to
female employees. In some cases, customers couldn't get through.

"The violations are unauthorized use of telephone services and a computer
crime," said Joe Cancilla, an Asst. V.P. of external affairs with Pac Bell.

The Independent newspaper for Tuesday 11 Jan 94, p6 reports that a "Computer
upsets 15,000 gas customers". Apparently, 15,000 paid-up customers in British
Gas's south-eastern regional area got notices warning that their payments were
not up to date, and asking for payment. They complained, and British Gas is
sending out apology letters "at a cost of several thousand pounds". The
process is automated and "at no stage before posting is any human check made
on whether the machine is mistaken." British Gas said that "faulty programming
is to blame". (These two last sentences were adjacent. The journalist,
Nicholas Schoon, obviously didn't fall for the "dog ate my homework" tale fed
him by BG.)

The Independent newspaper for Thursday 10 Feb 94, p2, reports that "Computer
flop cost taxpayers \pounds 59m". The system was to provide an `information
network' for the department's Training and Enterprise Councils. The article is
a little hazy on details that would enlighten RISKS readers, but mentions a
highly negative report on the system by the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
(The Commons is the British lower House of Parliament, i.e. the significant
part of the governing body of Britain.)  Noone bothered to "test a pilot
scheme" to see if things worked.  The "info network" cost \pounds 48m, and the
department had spent \pounds 11m by Sept 92 on 200 management consultants to
help with it, despite planning only \pounds 1.3m for this in 1989. But it's
really hard to tell from the article how much of this was a computer system
that cost too much and didn't fill expectations, and how much was simply bad
management.

wiretaps in a case against now deceased Kansas City financier Frank Morgan:

  "...disturbing pattern of material misstatements, overstatements,

  to wiretap Frank Morgan's office.

  "The conduct of the FBI...rises to such a level of recklessness as to

&gt;Expect journalistic exaggeration. 

I can't resist: In 1982 (I think) a Polish climbing team had a fatal accident
in the Troll wall ("Trollveggen") in Norway.  In the serious Oslo morning
paper the climbers were reported to have fallen 600 meters to their deaths.
In the liberal afternoon paper, the fall was 800 meters.  In the sensational
afternoon paper, the figure was 1200 meters.

"Trollveggen" is approximately 1000 meters high.

It was my understanding that politicians have a "right of revision" to
anything that is placed in the Congressional Record such that if they happen
to say something in a speech that is later judged to have been "incorrect",
the error can be corrected before it goes into the Record.

As a result, it appears that there need not be any correlation between what is
said "for the Record" and what actually appears there. So why should we be
surprised if the same executive privilege is extended to Whitehouse.gov ?

&gt; The relevant quote came to mind immediately:
&gt; 
&gt; 	"He who controls the past controls the future."

My recollection of the intended quotation (from George Orwell's "1984") is:- 

        "He who controls the past controls the present. 
         He who controls the present controls the future." 

(I haven't looked it up in the book, so my recollection may be inaccurate, 
too!) Readers may recall that this was the slogan of the "Ministry of Truth" 
(which was in charge of lies and propaganda) where the hero, Winston Smith, 
was employed to doctor public archives according to the latest political 
line which the Party had decreed was the current infallible and unchangeable 
version of the "truth". 

Winston's work was demanding and creative. He would receive old issues of 
newspapers, which landed on is desk via a delivery spout, and rewrite any 
articles or news items which did not conform. Where this was not possible, 
he had to take an item out altogether, and replace it with a suitably anodyne 
item which he had to concoct on the spot. He would then pop the "incorrect" 
version into a chute which led directly to the furnace. 

Orwell once remarked that what he feared most was "Ghengis Khan with a 
telegraph". With Stalin, he got more-or-less that. Even Orwell's imagination 
could not foresee the possibilities for manipulating the "truth" which the 
advent of the computer has opened up, and the capabilities of electronic 
communication. 

Orwell was also concerned about the decay of language. The Party was in 
favour of "Newspeak", a language in which it was impossible to express a 
politically incorrect thought. At its best, this would become "duck-speak", 
the articulation of sounds in the throat without the involvement of the 
higher centres of the brain. (Remind you of any political speeches you've 
heard recently? :-) However, that is a separate concern. 

             "Orwell, thou shouldst be living at this hour!"

The following represents the text I will be reading at the Patent Office
hearing on the relationship between computer software and patent issues,
Crystal City, Virginia, 9:15am February 10.  This text has been edited to
allow me to fit it, and possible questions, into an 11 minute space.

This is a short portion of my remarks on the matter.  This will be part of
a complete comment on the Federal Register text.  My comment will be
posted to the Internet once completed. 

        --------------------------------------------

Good Morning Commissioner Lehman, Mr. Kushan, the staff here, members of the
audience, people reading this report in the future and anyone else I've
forgotten.

My name is Paul Robinson.  I am Chief Programmer for Tansin A. Darcos &amp;
Company, a software development firm specializing in text processing
applications; I also do work on Commercial Philosophy and metaphysics of
computer systems.  My special interest and my personal hobby is collecting
compiler and other program sources.  My reasons for this are that these all
solve problems.  By reading the manner and method other people have solved
other problems, it gives me insight into how to solve mine.

This is a common practice in the computer world in order to, as the expression
goes, "Not reinvent the wheel."  I assume this is common in other industries. 
In fact, this is most likely the reason that we have a patent system; someone
is granted the exclusive right over commercial use of an invention for a
limited term in exchange for telling the world about it.

For most computers, every application such as word processing or spreadsheets
has at least two and possibly three or more different applications fighting
for market share.  The fights in this industry are usually referred to by the
expression "Dinosaur mating dances" as huge companies fight for market share
by releasing new programs to introduce new features that the companies believe
the customers want.  Version 3 of Turbo Pascal was an excellent language
compiler and less than 40K.  Version 4 would fit on one 360K diskette.  Today,
Turbo Pascal for Windows version 1.5 takes 14,000K of disk space.  The program
that is probably the premiere application for graphics design is Corel Draw!,
which has so much material it is now being released on not one, but two 500
megabyte CD-Rom disks.

But there are probably still niches for smaller companies to move into.  

With the rapid changes in the marketplace, it is necessary to be ready to have
new programs and new releases of old programs out to encourage people to move
to the next release.  In some cases, companies make more money from upgrades,
and need to do so to stay alive.  These kind of cycles mean new releases have
to be out very quickly; in a matter of weeks to months.

With this kind of rapid development cycle, delays in the release of a program
could be fatal and the time available to create the work is sometimes barely
enough.  Until recently, the only legal issue that anyone had to worry about
was copyright infringement.  That could be avoided by creating new work from
scratch.

Now we have another issue altogether.  A programmer can independently create
something without ever knowing about any other developments, and yet be
sabotaged by the discovery that the method that they used is patented.  This
is a standard problem that all industries have had to face, and it is part and
parcel of living in an industrial society.  But there is another problem.  A
computer program is the written instructions by a human being to tell a
computer how to perform a particular task.  As such, there are only two
parameters: the input supplied to the program and the expected output. 
Everything else is literally a figment of someone's imagination.

This bears clarification.  A computer program is the means of manipulating the
internal data paths of a computer system.  There is no requirement that the
manipulations have any correspondence to the real world.  In this, the real
world, doing anything requires the expensive movement of people and goods from
one point to another, the possible refinement of materials into other
materials, and the expenditure of energy and resources.   Doing anything in a
computer is merely the essentially cost-free movement of electron paths from
one direction to another; it brings forth the apportation of the concepts of
the madman Imanuel Kant into reality: a world in which anything is possible:

- We can see this in the current discussions going on about violent computer
  games where someone goes about maiming, shredding and killing their
  opponents, in graphic detail, then when the game is over, nothing in the
  real world has changed except the clock.  One of my favorites happens to
  be the game "DOOM" where the weapon of choice is a 12-gauge shotgun, but a
  chainsaw does a nice job on people close to you.

- We have seen it in motion pictures such as "Total Recall", where, if one
  is acting within a part of a computer program, you cannot be certain what 
  is real or what is fantasy.  The movie "Brainstorm" had simulations of
  sexual contact apparently indistinguishable from reality.

There are things that can be done within a computer program that cannot be
done in the real world, or would have undesirable consequences.   As such, we
should ask whether the patent rules, which are designed to apply to real-world
conditions where doing something requires the expenditure of energy and
resources, should apply in a world where the known rules of the universe do
not apply.  Because the entire design starts from scratch, and the designer
doesn't just get to play God,  he &lt;italic&gt;is&lt;\italic&gt; God.

Despite the ease under which someone can do something, we still live under
real-world constraints.  Once a design choice is made, it is very expensive in
time and effort to change it.  Worse, because most programs have interactions
that cover every part, a change to one part can cause unexpected and even
undesirable side effects in unknown and unexpected places.  Computer programs
may be "the stuff that dreams are made of" but once placed into concrete form
as written in software instructions, it's just as expensive to repair or
change as if it was carved out of real materials.

It may be necessary to change the rules on patents to comply with the
conditions that exist for computer programs.  

There has been talk of instituting "first to file" in order to "harmonize"
with the systems in other countries; I think that is not a good choice; most
countries have fewer patents, and provide protection which is much narrower
than our system does.  This would also mean that someone who does invent a new
and useful technique for use in a computer application would be unable to
collect any royalties from someone else who is using the same invention, who
thought of it after they did, but started using it before they filed.

The two really large problems that exist in our system are probably two part:
the secrecy under which patent applications are filed, and the problems if a
program uses parts of several patents, which might not be discovered until
later.

As I mentioned earlier, computer programs are created out of the figment of
someone's imagination, then mass copied, the way an original painting can be
reproduced by lithograph.  A single large application might have a dozen
people working on it, and upwards of 50 different features, and might have
upwards of 200 or more different parts, any one of those might be infringing
on zero, one or more patents depending on what the claims are.  I doubt
seriously that all but the largest corporations have the resources to do 200
patent searches on a single software application, which would be prohibitive
for a small company, because it is likely that a large program could infringe
dozens of patents, due to the continued development of ever larger
applications that do multiple simultaneous functions.

But more than that, you can't do patent searches on works which are under
application form, until after the patent has been issued.  And more
importantly, with more than 1,200 patents issued every week, checking them all
for possible interconnection would make it impossible to do any serious work. 

Seventy years ago, fears that the major piano player manufacturer would tie up
the entire song market and prevent other companies from creating player piano
rolls caused Congress to institute compulsory licensing.  This may be an idea
whose time has come again.  

Therefore it might be considered to make two changes in the patent law with
respect to computer programs: to implement a standard compulsory license,
perhaps 10 percent of the manufacturer's suggested list price, and to
eliminate secrecy provisions in the filing of patent applications.

Either of these could certainly help the situation.  Eliminating secrecy and
publishing applications once filed would let people know about pending
inventions: they could endeavor to avoid infringements in advance; it might
also allow them to file interferences early, if it turns out that they
invented the concept earlier, while it is cheap to do so; and would allow
people to be aware of what is being developed which would comply with Article
1, Section 8 of the Constitution, where patent protection was designed "to
encourage the improvement of the useful arts".

The other option of setting a standard royalty via compulsory license would
eliminate the worries of someone infringing upon an existing patent or one
that is filed after their work is created.  It would also grant to inventors
an income stream from those who use their inventions, which started before
they filed their application but after they reduced the invention to practice.
It would also limit liability and exposure to sustainable limits.  As it
stands, if someone develops a program that infringes upon 40 patents, and they
each want a 3% royalty, it isn't hard to see that 120% of the program's income
is not going to be possible.

		Cygnus Support Frees Its Security Software
			To Beat Internet Break-Ins

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., February 10, 1994 - Cygnus Support today announced
public availability of its Cygnus Network Security (CNS), a software solution
to guard against the recently publicized rash of break-ins over the Internet.
Cygnus Network Security is a freely available, stable, tested version of
Kerberos, the well known network security software.

Cygnus Support is giving CNS to the public in an effort to protect users of
the "data superhighway".  The Internet community gains an immediate solution
for this break-in problem.  Organizations can then contract with Cygnus to
develop more comprehensive long-term security strategies.

The rapid evolution of information technology has opened the doors of
communication while leaving many sites vulnerable to break-ins.  The Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT) reported last week that intruders had captured
access information for tens of thousands of systems across the Internet. CERT
advised all Internet users to change passwords, but this is not enough to
prevent this type of break-in in the future.

"This security vulnerability has been there for a long time, but the crackers
have only taken advantage of it in the past year," said Michael Tiemann,
president of Cygnus Support. "It's well past time to solid countermeasures.
Kerberos is the only protection that's freely redistributable, software-only,
well supported and ready for use today."

CNS prevents passwords from being sent over the Internet in clear text.
Kerberos uses DES encryption to validate the user's password on a local
machine, rather than sending it across the net to a remote machine.  This
prevents the password from being captured off the network and used by
crackers.  CNS provides network-level security and eliminates the single
largest risk that Internet users face today.

Cygnus Network Security software is offered free of charge over the Internet,
and is available by calling Cygnus Support at 1 800 CYGNUS-1 or +1 415 903
1400.  Due to U.S. export policy, Kerberos is only available in the United
States and Canada at this time.  After calling Cygnus Support and verifying
their location, users will be told where on the Internet to download the
software.  CNS includes installation notes, complete source and binary code,
and preliminary documentation.  The Internet release is provided as-is and
without support; users who want help with installation or use must contract
with Cygnus for it.  CNS binaries are provided for these Unix platforms: SPARC
(both OS's), DECstation, HP 700, and Sun-3.  CNS is not currently available
for PC's or Macintosh.  Other platforms are under development.

Commercial support for Cygnus Network Security is available from Cygnus
Support.  Cygnus offers installation support, fast maintenance response,
printed documentation, periodic releases, and custom development work,
including ports of CNS to specific platforms.  Customers need not be on the
Internet to use Cygnus Network Security support.  Prices start at $5000 and
vary depending on the number of users supported.

Cygnus Support was founded in 1989 to provide commercial support for
sourceware.  Sourceware is supported, centrally managed software whose source
code is openly available.  Cygnus provides a full range of products and
services for software developers, including site support, custom development,
and open systems solutions, in North American, Europe, and Asia.  The company
is based in Mountain View, Calif., with an office in Cambridge, Mass.

To get copies of the software, call +1 800 CYGNUS 1 or +1 415 903 1400, and
say you want the free Kerberos software.

The following comments are in response to responses posted in <A HREF="/Risks/15.50.html">RISKS-15.50</A>
on my earlier comments in <A HREF="/Risks/15.48.html">RISKS-15.48</A>:  

&gt;From Marc Rotenberg:
&gt; 
&gt; The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
&gt; authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
&gt; security" interests in domestic wire surveillance?

I do not believe that NSA has any particular interest in domestic wire
surveillance.  I expect their concern is that if a product with a very
strong algorithm such as SKIPJACK were to be manufactured without keys
being escrowed, then such products would be very attractive on the
foreign black market (presumably, such products would not be
exportable) where they could interfere with foreign intelligence.

&gt; The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
&gt; investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
&gt; filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
&gt; The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that none
&gt; of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The Department of
&gt; Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all relevant documents
&gt; concerning the Clipper proposal.

In testimony before the Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory
Board (CSSPAB) at NIST, James Kallstrom of the FBI said that encryption
was stymying the effort in more than three but less than ten of ongoing
cases.  The FBI does not give details of ongoing investigations, so this
information would not be available through FOIA.

&gt; There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
&gt; enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of a
&gt; file on a hard disk after it was seized.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
&gt; the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
&gt; just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world.

I've heard of 3 cases now where encrypted files could not be decrypted, 
but law enforcers seem to be much more concerned about communications
than stored files.  Clipper does not address file encryption.

&gt; An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House would
&gt; mandate a Clipper-like scheme. That proposal is backed by fines up to $10,000
&gt; per day and jail time.

Everything I've seen has said Clipper is voluntary.  Quoting from the standard:
"This standard does not mandate the use of escrowed encryption devices by
Federal government agencies, the private sector or other levels of government."
Dept. of Commerce, NIST, Docket No. 930659-4017, RIN 063-AB19, Approval
of FIPS 185, Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES).

&gt; &gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not 
&gt; &gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the 
&gt; &gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled 
&gt; &gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot 
&gt; &gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum.  
&gt; 
&gt; This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used simply
&gt; to stifle criticism.

Certain information relating to foreign intelligence operations is
classified.  Are you saying that decisions should not be based on
classified information or that foreign intelligence information should
not be classified? 

&gt; CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review. Our position from
&gt; the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly.

As part of the inter-agency review, the CSSPAB was asked to sponsor hearings
on the proposal.  These were held in June.  The testimony that was presented
was given to the government.  Marc gave a presentation at those hearings, as
did David Banisar of CPSR.  Several people in the government who have been
participating in the inter-agency review were present at the hearings.  There
have been several other forums as well, including one sponsored by CPSR last
June.  Again, several people participating in the inter-agency review were
present.

&gt; &gt;  In the absence of understanding 
&gt; &gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to 
&gt; &gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can 
&gt; &gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on society.
&gt; 
&gt; This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States would
&gt; have no right to express political views when the government claimed "national
&gt; security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that must be

I did not mean to suggest that people should not express their views.  Being
cautious is different from being silent.

&gt;From George Talbot:
&gt; 
&gt; Second, law enforcement needs to get a court order to intercept phone
&gt; communications.  I know of no such need to get a court order to intercept
&gt; communications on a high speed network w.r.t. Capstone.  The current
&gt; administration proposal does not require a court order to get the escrowed
&gt; keys themselves.

You need a court order to intercept any electronic communications, including
those on high speed nets.  You need a court order to get keys.  Although the
court order is not given to the escrow agents (to protect the identity of
those under investigation), certification that one was obtained must be
presented to the escrow agents.  In addition, this certification must be
confirmed by an attorney associated with the U.S. Attorney's office (for a
Title III federal wiretap) or an attorney associated with the DOJ Office of
Intelligence Policy and Review (for a FISA wiretap).  For a local wiretap, the
certification must be submitted by the principal prosecuting attorney of the
state or political subdivision thereof.

Fred Cohen wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million ...
&gt; 
&gt; Do you claim to believe that the great silent majority is in favor of Clipper?

No I do not.  I was merely attempting to point out what I believed was RISKy
logic.
&gt; 
&gt; In the light of 5,000 years of cryptographic history where experts claimed
&gt; that systems were very strong only to find them broken soon after, I find it
&gt; hard to trust the hand picked committee of 5 so-called experts who are given
&gt; money and time to pass judgement on a technology that is so weak that they are
&gt; afraid to expose it to the light of day.  If it is so strong, why not let the
&gt; rest of the world review it? The German experts said the same thing about

We were not paid.  The main reason for not making the algorithm public
is that one could build inter-operable products that bypassed key
escrow, but that took advantage of the very strong algorithm.
&gt; 
&gt; Why is it that you think you understand more about the implications of
&gt; cryptography on national security than the rest of us? This elitist crap has
&gt; got to end.  It is bad for our country to have elitists who believe they know
&gt; more than the rest of us dictating how we will live our lives.  It is bad for
&gt; our country that the esteemed members of this forum do not have access to your
&gt; rational in order to openly discuss your points of view.  It is bad for our
&gt; country that professors at universities tell their students and the public not
&gt; to think about the issues, but to trust that the professors know best.  If you
&gt; want to serve the national interest, get the debate out in the open!
&gt; 
I did not mean to suggest that I understood the national security issues.
I do not.  Nor did I mean to suggest that people should not think or
talk about the issues.

Geoff Kuenning writes, with respect to NSA:
&gt;Personally, I don't see why I should trust any person or agency that is so
&gt;secretive.

	This is the same logic that many fear would be applied by law
enforcement against people using non-approved non-clipper crypto: "if they
aren't using clipper, they must have something to hide."

	Funny how the better swords tend to be double-edged.

Prof. Denning has issued a defense of the Clipper proposal (which she
advocated in a CACM article long before the initiative was announced).  Her
specifics are easy enough to refute and I'm sure others will do so.  However,
she closes with an idea so radical that it shocked me.

Her idea that we citizens need a security clearance in order to enter the
debate over whether or not we should give up a right we've had for all time
(to make, use, disseminate, ..., our own strong cryptography, interfering with
the government's ability to spy on us) is so radically off base that the
technical debate pales by comparison.

My grade-school social studies teacher is doubtless spinning in her grave.  On
this point, I would like to hear from newly freed members of the Eastern
block.

This is a reply to Dorothy Denning's message in Risks 15.48: 

&gt;...  A telephone system
&gt;for purposes of this standard is limited to a system which is circuit switched
&gt;and operating at data rates of standard commercial modems over analog voice
&gt;circuits or which uses basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service."

The wire running to your house will be part of the basic telephone system,
just as it is now.  And with "standard commercial modems" becoming much
faster in the next year or so, I expect them to last longer.  As far
as the "analog" part goes, they're trying to take care of that, too.

&gt;The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
&gt;computer networks.  

No, but the Digital Telephony requirements will -- more on that later.

&gt;Law enforcers still need to get a court order just to intercept the
&gt;communications in the first place, 

Law enforcement does.  Those with national security concerns have a much
less stringent procedure, if I'm not mistaken.  I think it's a bit more
than throwning a brick in the air and chanting "National Security" three
times, but not much.  And if someone overseas is dumb enough to use 
Clipper, it's pretty easy as well.

&gt;The standard will make it much harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps,
&gt;including the government. 

I'll buy that up through the "including the government" part.  You can't
prove that the escrow system cannot be compromised.  And the DOJ stated
that if the procedures are not followed, it will not be grounds to throw
out the evidence.  

&gt;Keys are escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they cannot use it
&gt;against national interests. 

So it's for our own good?  

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll of industry, professional societies, or the public.  While
&gt;many people have voiced opposition, there are many more organizations and
&gt;people who have been silent on this issue.  

I thought the NCSA did a survey of IS professionals, and found that they
opposed Clipper by 260 to one.  I don't know how systematic or not that
survey was, however.  Perhaps you or someone else has more information.

&gt;The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
&gt;advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
&gt;Agency."
 
Advice is one thing.  However, it does seem that the NSA is capable of 
either officially or unofficially scrapping any crypto scheme it doesn't
like -- for any reason.

&gt;The standard is voluntary -- even for the government.

Do you think that will last?  I can't see how it is going to avoid becoming
either a requirement or a de facto requirement.  It's really doomed otherwise.
Or are they going to make it a crime to encrypt communications for the purpose
of criminal activity with something other than Clipper?
 
&gt;For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and debated in 
&gt;a public forum.  

Convenient, isn't it?

&gt;Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to be fully informed of the
&gt;national security implications of uncontrolled encryption.   

We already have uncontrolled encryption outside of the United States.  Folks
in other countries are just as clever as we are, and there are a lot of
articles about encryption in general out there.  So what are we doing here?
In order to insure that some folks don't misuse the technology, there's a
built-in feature for decoding the communications.  The FBI knows full well
that only "dumb criminals" are going to use Clipper.  So what does that mean?
In order to protect us, the government wants us to use an encryption
technology that they can unlock -- a technology that none of the "real
threats" are using?

&gt;It is even difficult to talk about the full implications of encryption on 
&gt;law enforcement.

Why?  I think many of us have a pretty good grasp of the issue.  And I think
that if you look at the number of wiretaps and the number of cases where
encryption technology was a problem, you'll find that few really made a
difference in a case.  Wiretaps are not that useful in many ways.  Informants,
financial records, physical evidence, and "bugs," either planted on people or
in locations are far more useful.

&gt;The Feb. 4 decision was made following an inter-agency policy review, 
&gt;headed by the National Security Council

And we all know the extensive confirmation process that appointees to the NSC
goes through in the Senate, thus giving the legislative branch a measure
of oversight.  Oh, wait, that must be in some other reality.  Sorry.  This
is the reality where more and more tasks have been shunted over to "groups"
and "councils" outside of the normal channels of oversight.

&gt;considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and individuals as well as from
&gt;law enforcement and intelligence agencies.  

And surprisingly enough, the government decided to place the government's 
priorities first.

&gt;In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I believe we 
&gt;need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand the full
&gt;implications of encryption on society. 
 
"Trust the government."  No thank you.  Various agencies and departments have
done little to earn that trust, and have shown a willingness to violate the
Constitution for "greater interests" that turned out to not be so great.

&gt;Interagency Working Group on Encryption and Telecommunications, chaired by the
&gt;White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and National Security
&gt;Council, with representatives from Commerce, Justice, State, Treasury, FBI,
&gt;NSA, OMB, and the National Economic Council. 

Ah, yes.  The IWGET.  Chaired by whom?  Oh, I see.  No oversight, no
accountability.

&gt;The group is to work with industry and public interest groups to develop
&gt;new encryption technologies and to review and refine encryption policy.  

Oh, and also to resurrect the Digital Telephony issue.  You forgot that one.
&gt;From the press release:

	In addition, the working group will coordinate Administration
	policies regarding digital telephony. As more and more telephone
	companies install high-speed, digital communications links, it
	becomes more and more difficult for law enforcement agencies to
	conduct wiretaps. The working group will work with industry to
	ensure that new digital telecommunications systems are designed in
	a way that ensures that do not prevent court authorized wiretaps.

I'm really having a hard time with Clipper.  Depending on which spin you look
at, it's either a totally pointless, massive waste of time and money that
nobody in their right mind will adopt, or else it's an Orwellian plot to push
an encryption technology that Uncle can break.  Neither view is really
attractive.  I'd actually bet more on the first.  Or is this whole issue a
smokescreen?  Is this just an attempt to try to co-opt the issue of
liberalization of encryption regulations?  Or is it an attempt to make the
digital telephony proposal more palatable?

&gt; The LEAF field contains 80 bits for the traffic key, encrypted via the unit
&gt; key in "~a unique mode &lt;grin&gt;~", 32 bits for the unit id, and a 16 bit
&gt; checksum of some sort.  (We didn't waste our breath asking what the checksum
&gt; algorithm was.)  This is all encrypted under the family key using "~another
&gt; mode &lt;grin&gt;~".

One of my concerns from the beginning of the Clipper/Capstone proposal was
that the LEAF would not be protected to the same extent as the primary
traffic.  This paragraph confirms that the LEAF is encrypted at least
differently.

The RISK here is that the session keys may be vulnerable to a less rigorous
cryptographic attack than the traffic itself.  So it may not be necessary to
even go through the dance with the escrow agencies to compromise a
Clipper/Capstone chip.  Of course, the Skipjack algorithm would still be
required for decrypting the traffic, but it would still appear that this is a
vulnerability.  I wish this point had come out earlier.

"Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action"
_You Only Live Twice_ by Ian Fleming

On February 3rd, the CERT issued a warning concerning password breaking
sniffers that had compromised thousands of passwords on the Internet.
This was picked up by thousands of newspapers.

One line read "The best long term solution...is to reduce the transmission
of reusable passwords in clear-text over the network."

I am told that this problem had been known by experts for quite some time
before the alert.

On February 4th, the administration reaffirmed the Clipper/Capstone initiative.

Now I am waiting for the announcement of a "Capstone Ethernet Card" that will
protect "Information Superhighway" users from such sniffers. Number three ?

indeed eliminate the need for the kind of backup being done today.

&gt;	An electronic key with a chip in its tip is to be marketed by the

&gt;	Eloctro, has a tiny silicon chip which stores a unique number

&gt;Several rather evident risks there.

But compared to the technology it replaces, I think not.  There's a lot of

This is to announce the creation of a list for the public disclosure of
bugs, system problems, viruses, and any other conditions in a computer system
that people should be aware of so they can fix the problem.

It is also appropriate to report security holes, dangerous conditions in PBXs,
cellular and wire telephone systems, and other computer-controlled devices.
Also reports of things such as default accounts and passwords on systems that
should be changed, etc.

The focus will be on reporting clear descriptions of problems including how to
generate them.  The idea being that this will alert people to the nature of
certain problems that they might be unaware of.  Reproducing these conditions
lets others know what is being done, and can allow people to post solutions on
how to block them.

The purpose in creating this list is that currently, the only means currently
available for reporting discovered security holes in computer systems and
possibly other areas is via the Computer Emergency Research Team (CERT) out of
Carnegie Mellon University.

The problem with CERT reporting is that the reports generally tend to be done
in secrecy, and it fails to let system administrators and others know about
what is happening so that these things can be fixed.  In short, CERT acts like
a black hole and takes too long to publicize problems until lots of places get
hit because they didn't know about it.

Some people feel that reports should not be publicized because potential
reports might become available to "the bad guys."  Well, the truth of the
matter is that "the bad guys" trade their discoveries around all the time;
the current use of secrecy is only hurting "the good guys" who want to
protect their systems.

This list has just been created, and pending creation of an automated
processor will be temporarily moderated since my current equipment does not
yet tell me what address the message is sent to.  This will be changed in the
next two weeks.

There will, however, be two addresses.  The general list will be

PROBLEMS@TDR.COM 

which is used to post a report to the list.  To subscribe to the list, use

PROBLEMS-REQUEST@TDR.COM

Currently, both addresses are moderated.  This will change shortly as I
upgrade the software on my system.  Persons wishing to make a report but not
be identified should state so in the text of their message.  In the future,
they will do so by using the -request address which will come to me directly.

Persons wanting to receive this service by facsimile should contact me for
details.  All messages requesting subscriptions or posting information
will be acknowledged.  Please pass this announcement around.

It is my intent to set this up such that people can publicly report known
bugs, viruses and problems in clear detail so everyone knows about them and
can encourage much faster response to these problems than is currently
available.  It may even embarrass some manufacturers into making fixes sooner
when their errors are glaringly exposed in public.

Paul Robinson - Paul@TDR.COM

    [I presume that RISKS will try to avoid duplication of detailed
    discussions with PROBLEMS, but may provide summary information 
    and pointers to issues, as appropriate.  PGN]

An AP article in NY Newsday on 11 Feb 1994 describes a Congressional hearing
where prison inmates told lawmakers how they used electronic filing of tax
returns to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.

Here are some salient highlights:

* "I think the IRS is detecting maybe 25 percent of the fraud taking place
with electronic filing..."  -- Frazier B. Todd Jr., serving 2 1/2 years for
collecting more than US $500,000 over two years by issuing false W-2 forms
from fictitious companies in the names of people too poor to file income tax
returns.  Todd was able to obtain permission from the IRS to file
electronically via mail.  His frauds continued after he was caught, by
processing phony returns through legitimate tax preparation firms.
Registering the false companies with the IRS took only a phone call...

* A convicted tax preparer (doing 18 months) testified how he obtained US
$750,000 over three years in undeserved refunds on behalf of his clients, by
inflating deductions and other devices...

* IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson says the agency has put new
computer "filters" in place to spot fraudulent returns.  They've already
detected 200 schemes involving 3000 or so false claims (and the tax season is
only six weeks old).

* During the first 10 months of last year, the IRS detected 61,000 fraudulent
returns totaling US $110 million -- but a consultant's report says the true
cost could be more like billions of dollars.

* Representative JJ Pickle (D-Texas) threatens to recommend a freeze on
electronic filing if the problems can't be worked out.  Commissioner
Richardson claims that "electronic filing is the very thing that has allowed
us to detect fraud".

* The speed at which refunds are issued to electronic filers makes it
difficult for the IRS to stop questionable refunds.  A General Accounting
Office staffer suggests that "The IRS has often appeared more interested in
expanding electronic filing than in ensuring that it was fully understood and
adequately addressed the associated risks"...

[This is sounding all too much like William Gibson's novel _Neuromancer_,
where rogue computer jockeys could reap money out of the cyberspatial ether by
crashing into big computers and tampering with data...]

The Jan. 10, 1994 issue of The New Yorker has a long, juicy article entitled
"E-Mail From Bill," detailing a month-long electronic correspondence between
Bill Gates of Microsoft and the reporter, John Seabrook.  Seabrook is
apparently somewhat new to computers and e-mail (someone says to him, "Well,
hey, you're not a digital guy!") and his innocence provides a refreshing look
at our industry and its leading personality -- you would NOT see such an
interesting, forthright, or provocative piece on Gates in, say, PC Computing.

While the risks (as I see them) are not lethal, they are interesting and 
worth noting:

1. E-mail will not replace old-fashioned letter-writing as a form of personal
expression.  It's essentially an informal business medium for communicating
facts, not for sharing Deep Feelings.  Even so, in the Gates-Seabrook
exchange, it soon escalates/degenerates (depending on your point of view) into
ego-aggrandizement and, ultimately, an unintentional psychological profile of
Gates, provided by he himself (sans any Smileys).  At one point Seabrook asks
"How does the rapid change in the power of microprocessors make you feel?"
Gates replies, "Feelings are pretty personal."

2. Good grammar and proper punctuation are not required in e-mail, and their
absence does not seem to affect regard for that person.  Seabrook notes the
absence of a salutation, complimentary close, or any letter-style boilerplate
(e.g., "nice to hear from you", "best regards", etc).  Gates often confuses or
misuses _its_ and _it's_, something that would be looked askance at in a
business letter, but not on e-mail.  (However, just to be on the safe side,
maybe Gates ought to be using Word for Windows 6.0, with all that fancy
on-the-fly correction capability, to draft his e-mail.)

3. Finally, the risks of notoriety.  Gates talks about his forthcoming
marriage ("Being married I don't think is that big a change."), and when asked
about wealth corrupting, replies "Absolutely.  Hey.  Being in the spotlight is
a corrupting thing.  Being successful is a corrupting thing.  These are very
dangerous things, to be guarded against carefully.  And I think that's very,
very hard to do."

In the final e-mail exchange with Seabrook, Gates is asked what he thought of
Henry Ford:

Ford is not that admirable -- he did great things but he was very narrow
minded and was willing to use brute force power too much.  His relationship
with his family is tragic.  His model of the world was plain wrong in a lot of
ways.  He decided he knew everything he need to fairly early in his life.

The Computer User Family (CUF) is concerned about the health problem
associated with computers.  Video Display Terminals, emit UV and ELF radiation
and may cause cancer, immune system irregularities, miscarriages and eye
fatigue.  Computer noise from fans, disk and CD drives is also becoming a
source of anxiety, stress and general discomfort.  We usually don't realize
how loud our computers are: 50dB and more.  These problems should be dealt
with and add-ons should be provided for present computers to avoid putting us
at risks.  Some safe screens and quiet power supplies are coming out but they
are marginal and prices are prohibitive.

Meanwhile the general guidelines for the users are:

1. Position yourself approximately 22 inches to 28 inches (arm's length) from
   the screen and four feet from the sides and rear of other terminals. 
2. Eliminate sources of glare and lower light levels in the room.  Don't sit
   facing a bright window. If necessary, use screen hoods, glare shields over
   the screen or wear anti-UV/anti-glare glasses. 
3. Put a noise absorbing mat under your computer.  Pull your computer away
   from the wall or any hard surface that reflects noise and vibration back to
   you.
4. Rest occasionally during periods of intense concentration.  Closing your
   eyes helps.
5. Turn off the VDT when not in use.

   The Microsoft Software Development Network (MSDN) programme has lost my
registration twice in Canada and 3 times in the United States (the US number
is 1 800 759 5474). This has caused about 10 months of frustration.
Registering means you give a credit card number and an address. In return, you
are sent a CD-ROM every quarter.

   Today I tried to change my address for future mailings. The operator took
my name, then told me that there was no record of my registration. It appeared
lost yet again.  I asked why they were losing it. The operator (Dean Miller)
said he didn't know.

   I asked if they were using Oracle or a MS product. He said that it was a MS
product and could be Foxpro or Access. He also said the system seemed busy
while doing a look-up on it.

   It would appear that there are either serious administrative problems or
that there are software problems or both at this Microsoft branch. Likely the
software problems are related to multi-user addition of records (there are
multiple operators).

   Does somebody know which database they are using and why the system doesn't
work?

   Please do not use the operator's name. Please allow me to see
the final posting before using my name.

This article (re: backwards accelerometers) reminds me of a story from my own
past.  Years ago, I was writing a simulation of a guidance system.  For some
inputs, the output rate was in the wrong direction.  So I traced through the
equations and found the "erroneous" sign.  This fixed the original problem,
but created a similar problem along another axis.  I changed the "wrong" sign
in another equation, and presto, the problem moved to the third axis.  I
changed another sign, confident that I had the correct combination now.
Instead, the problem now appeared on *two* axes.  Any change I made in any
equation just moved the bug elsewhere.

Well, after spending the better part of a day, I realized the true problem.
I had reversed the sign of the acceleration due to gravity, so my program
thought that the force of gravity pulled *up*.  Once I corrected this,
the program worked fine.  

The moral:  How about "Can't fool Mother Nature, or Mr. Newton"?

Don Watts' letter describing the reversal of the Firefly control system, such
that it flies in a direction opposite to that intended, is archetypical of
navigation, guidance, and control systems.

Most such systems specify spatial conventions (i.e., which way is up) for the
vehicle very early in the development, usually in the system specification.  A
competent system engineer will lay down the law that these conventions shall
be followed now and forever and always.  This is good.  However, as the
systems evolves from paper to actual hardware, it is found that some
off-the-shelf subsystems do not conform to the spatial conventions established
early in the program.  Furthermore, costs to reconfigure such off-the-shelf
items may appear prohibitive.  This is bad.

An example might be an avionic inertial navigation unit which is adopted for
use in an underwater vehicle.  Is the altitude readout signed?  Does depth
correspond to negative or positive altitude?  Maybe we could mount the
inertial navigation unit up-side down - but no - that reverses pitch and yaw!
By this time, the system engineer has that resigned, forlorn look of Gary
Cooper in High Noon.

What about standards?  There are standards for these things, but as someone on
the net liked to point out, "The nice thing about standards is there are so
many to choose from."

   Following the 1989 earthquake, all the fire and other hallway alarms in my
one-story laboratory building at Stanford University went off and could not be
stopped.

   These alarms all in concert were so loud that in attempting to do a
building check for possible fires, spilled chemicals, injuries in interior lab
rooms and the like, I found it almost physically impossible to stay in the
hallways, much less communicate audibly with others.  Cries from possible
victims, perhaps trapped under furniture or bookshelves in laboratory rooms,
would have been totally impossible to hear.  Emergency rescues or damage
repair would have been greatly hampered.

   There was no way to turn off these alarms; I was told that only the
appropriate Public Safety personnel could do so, and that the staff in our
building did not even know how or where to turn them off.  Because necessarily
every building on campus was in a similar situation, our alarms continued to
operate for several hours before they could be turned off.

The building where I work has its fire alarm system tested annually, in
addition to possible fire drills. A few days ago the following email message
was sent out to all occupants:

  Xxxx Limited will be testing the Fire Alarm System on TUESDAY
  FEBRUARY 15, 1994 FROM 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.
  This is just going to be a test, so if you hear the bells ringing you do
  not have to evacuate.

There are at least two obvious risks, first of course that an actual fire
on that day could be quite disastrous, and second the usual email risk
that not everyone in the building that day will have seen the message, leading
to confusion.

The capper came the next day when another email message was sent out:

  The date for the fire alarm testing has been changed to Wednesday February
  23rd from 9:00 to 5:00.

Talk about a perfect way to amplify a risk...

I've heard (on comp.dcom.telecom.tech) of several tricks that can be used to 
set up these situations.  The two most common are:

1.  For caller-ID systems, there are devices that send another caller ID
    down the line after the phone call is answered.  Somebody looking at
    the display would have to scroll backwards to find the "real" number, but
    would have no reason to know to do so.

2.  For automatic callback, as you describe, the obscene caller can forward
    the return call (along with any other calls) to a different number.  In 
    this case, if the obscene caller forwarded calls to your phone, the return
    would end up there.

Your subject is one of the lessons.  Another is not to let the phone company 
off the hook for tracing obscene calls simply because they've provided a few
technical features to the user.

Another possibility is that his wife had called your wife recently and he
actually pressed `redial' on his phone instead of activating that
`abuser-combating feature'. It's easy to misdial some keys when you are angry.

This is an interesting and disturbing story.  You have probably been the
victim of either a feature interaction or a bug in the implementation of the
code that updates the calling number.

I've been following the discussion of this problem on the Telecomm Digest, and
most of the possibilities have been listed there:

To summarize:
Possibility 1: The calling number from the obscene call was not updated 
because for some reason it wasn't delivered to Tom's central office.
The register still contained the Tom's number, from an earlier call
placed by his wife.

Possibility 2: Another feature (possibly call waiting) interfered in such a
way that Tom's number replaced the number of the obscene caller.

Possibility 3: The obscene caller was clever enough to call-forward his or her
phone to Tom's number immediately after ending the obscene call.  This is an
unpleasant thought, since it suggests that he or she knows Tom or his wife and
is actively trying to make trouble.

Tom, you should tell your friend, or is it your wife's friend's husband, that
any one of these could have happened.

The first possibility is almost certainly a bug -- Bellcore writes
requirements for these features, and its requirements say that the number
should always reflect the last caller unless the last caller received busy or
call forwarding treatment.  On the other hand, Bellcore doesn't write
switching software, and the companies that write it don't have to follow the
requirements exactly.  So it may not even be a bug, it may have been the way
that AT&amp;T or NT or whoever wanted it to work.

The second possibility could have happened if your wife's friend has call
waiting, and your wife called her after the obscene call began, and her friend
was sufficiently distracted by the call not to notice the call waiting.  Then
your number would have been used by automatic recall, at least according to
Bellcore specifications.

The third possibility means that the return call went initially to the obscene
caller, but was routed to you by call forwarding.  Recommending that your
wife's friend get Calling Number Delivery won't help -- if an obscene caller
is clever enough to do the call forwarding right after the call, he has
already blocked Calling Number Delivery.  On the other hand, there's yet
another feature, Call Origination Trace, that may be useful.  I can't find the
documentation for it right now, but if I remember correctly you enter a code
immediately after hanging up and the caller is reported to the police.  Tell
your wife to suggest to her friend that they try it.

Nancy Griffeth

P.S.  For anyone interested in more detail, here are the responses
that appeared on Telecom Digest:

Possibility 1: The calling number from the obscene call was not updated 
because for some reason it wasn't delivered to Tom's central office. ...

&gt;&gt;From: rhorer@medics.jsc.nasa.gov (Kyle Rhorer)
&gt;&gt;Is it possible that Mrs. Bodine was the last caller *before*
&gt;&gt;the obscene call, and the obscene call came from a subscriber in a
&gt;&gt;different operating company?  Perhaps the OC that serves the Bodines
&gt;&gt;simply doesn't update the call return register if the call is from an
&gt;&gt;"unidentifiable" source?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I don't think this is true. I think the
&gt;&gt;buffer which holds that information is flushed each time around, meaning
&gt;&gt;valid, identifiable information from an earlier call would be erased by
&gt;&gt;the new call, even if the new call put nothing more than 'outside' or
&gt;&gt;'cannot identify' in the buffer where the previous information had been.  PAT]

and also:

&gt;&gt;From: Monty Solomon &lt;monty@roscom.COM&gt;
&gt;&gt;Call Return works only for calls which originate in areas which have
&gt;&gt;the availability of the PHONESMART package (Caller ID, Call Return,
&gt;&gt;Repeat Dialing, and Call Trace).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: What seems to put a fly in the ointment
&gt;&gt;where the arguments about false identification due to a variety of
&gt;&gt;possible causes (one call arrived when line was busy, next call went
&gt;&gt;in the 'return call' buffer, etc, call returned to the wrong party of
&gt;&gt;the two who called about the same time) is Mr. Bodine's comment that
&gt;&gt;this woman had received *several* obscene calls over a period of time.
&gt;&gt;Surely the intricacies of the modern phone network did not interact 
&gt;&gt;in such a bizarre way every time. If there have been so many obscene
&gt;&gt;calls, can't the woman at least identify the voice of the caller, or
&gt;&gt;listen to Mr. Bodine's voice and qualify or disqualify him as the
&gt;&gt;person responsible?   PAT]

Comments: Kyle, Monty, and Pat are both right in a way.  

In favor of Pat's point: The Bellcore requirements state that if the calling
number is not available, the register that holds the calling number should be
updated in such a way as to reflect its unavailability.  To quote from the
LSSGR Feature Specification Document FSD 01-02-1260 on the subject of
Automatic Recall (Bellcore's name -- the name varies from region to region and
country to country):

   The AR feature enables a customer to place a call to the last
   station that called the customer and did not receive busy or call
   forwarding treatment.

In favor of Monty's and Kyle's points: Bellcore doesn't write switching 
software; almost all switching software used in the US is written by AT&amp;T 
or NT.  Bellcore requirements are more suggestions than real requirements... 
so, does Tom's particular switch (which may be any one of several AT&amp;T or 
NT switches) actually do the updating as recommended by Bellcore?  It's 
quite possible that it doesn't.  And two different switches may do 
different things!

Pat's argument that coincidences couldn't have caused this problem every
time is irrelevant, though, because Tom was talking about just *ONE* callback,
immediately after his friends had bought the service.  The point he was making
was that his friends bought the service because they had received a number of
obscene calls.


Possibility 2: Another feature (possibly call waiting) interfered in such a
way that Tom's number replaced the number of the obscene caller.

&gt;&gt;Lars Poulsen (lars@eskimo.CPH.CMC.COM) wrote:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe that there is no such interaction problem in the case of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; "calling number identification" feature, since the number is delivered
&gt;&gt;&gt; in real time and only when the call rings through. Thus, the call that
&gt;&gt;&gt; would come in DURING the problem call, would only be recorded if the
&gt;&gt;&gt; recipient had the "call waiting" feature, and in that case would not
&gt;&gt;&gt; get busy, but ringback, and the CNID (if subscribed) would be delivered 
&gt;&gt;&gt; between the rings (call waiting tones)).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In my experience, CNID is not delivered if your phone is busy, even if
&gt;&gt;you have call waiting.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Brian
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You are correct, it is not delivered if
&gt;&gt;your line is busy, and it is only delivered (if arriving via call waiting)
&gt;&gt;on one condition that I can determine: if the call-waiting party stays on
&gt;&gt;the line, allowing it to ring, then when the called party and whoever he
&gt;&gt;is talking to disconnect the call-waiting call will start to ring through
&gt;&gt;and Caller-ID will be delivered between the first and second audible
&gt;&gt;rings heard by the called party just as though it was the first and second
&gt;&gt;'true rings'. That is to say, you ring me and I am on a call. I get the
&gt;&gt;call-waiting signal and tell my party we have to ring off so I can take
&gt;&gt;the new call. We chat a few seconds more and hang up. Rather than flashing
&gt;&gt;to accept the new call, I actually hang up and let my phone ring a couple
&gt;&gt;times more. Between the first and second rings *that I hear* my display 
&gt;&gt;will get the Caller-ID, even if the calling party had to sit for a dozen
&gt;&gt;rings or more. I'm not sure, but I think if I flash to answer, then put
&gt;&gt;the party on hold and later hang up (the first call) allowing 'reminder
&gt;&gt;rings' to tell me about the party on hold, I'll get Caller-ID between the
&gt;&gt;first and second of those 'reminder rings' also. I know the first instance
&gt;&gt;is correct; I think the second one is. That seems to be the one and only
&gt;&gt;way of receiving Caller-ID under the circumstances: you have to hang up
&gt;&gt;on the party you are talking with and let the call-waiting actually cause
&gt;&gt;your phone to ring so delivery can be made to your display, regardless of
&gt;&gt;how long that may be (or how many rings have occurred) since the call-
&gt;&gt;waiting party entered your premises.   PAT]

Whew!  Well, Pat's wrong, and Lars has it right, if we look believe the 
Bellcore requirements.  On the other hand, the implementation could be
different.

Details of how the register is actually updated are given in Appendix E
of Bellcore feature specification document FSD 01-02-1260 on Automatic Recall.  
As Lars said, customers that are call waited DO NOT receive busy treatment --
instead they get ringing.  Appendix E specifies that "The incoming
memory slot should always be updated for all incoming calls that are
call waited, whether or not the incoming call is answered by the called
party."

Pat is right about actual delivery of the Calling Number, but he is wrong
to assume that this means the register is not updated.  Even for Calling
Number Delivery (or Caller ID), the register is updated when a caller
is call-waited.  It's not actually delivered to your phone because
the signal is delivered in-band and delivering the number in the middle
of a call would also deliver an ugly noise to your ear.  There are proposals,
however, for muting the sound briefly to deliver it.  After all, often the
only thing you want to know when you're already on the line is who's calling,
so you can call them back.


Possibility 3: The obscene caller was clever enough to call-forward his or her
phone to Tom's number immediately after ending the obscene call.  This is an
unpleasant thought, since it suggests that he or she knows Tom or his wife and
is actively trying to make trouble.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; ... If Mr. Bodine insists he is not the party who made the obscene
&gt;&gt;call, then I guess we take his word for it and find someone else to
&gt;&gt;blame; but it seems quite a stretch of the imagination ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well ... I hope you'll take *my* word for this, too!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;About six, maybe seven months ago, I was sleeping, and was awakened by
&gt;&gt;the telephone ringing:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Me:  "Good evening, Burch residence"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Female Caller:	"Who is this?"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;moment of disorientation, non-sequiturs at 1:00 AM cause this ...&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Me: "I think I ought to ask you that, since you called me..."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;FC: "No, *you* called me."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Me: "The telephone was ringing, and I answered it, so, really, I'm pretty
&gt;&gt;sure you called me."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;this was starting to sound like some bad practical joke.&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;FC: "No, you made an obscene call to this number just now, and I used
&gt;&gt;call return to call you back."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Me: "I'll beg your pardon, but there is nobody at this number but me at
&gt;&gt;present, and I was sleeping."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;FC: "If you ever call me again, I'll see you arrested."  *click*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, I'm absolutely *certain* that there are major bugs with this
&gt;&gt;feature.  Possibly some bright jerk has figured out how to give it
&gt;&gt;false information, but I'd bet on a bug first.  (I've done telephone
&gt;&gt;switch programming, so I'm allowed to have an opinion ...)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Oh, I believe you. It could be that
&gt;&gt;whoever called the lady quickly call-forwarded his line to yours 
&gt;&gt;immediately after disconnecting; he woke her up with his call, she sat
&gt;&gt;there in a just-awakened stupor and thought about it for a minute then
&gt;&gt;used 'return last call' to reach you via him. This is where having
&gt;&gt;Caller-ID *and* 'return last call' both on the line would be useful.
&gt;&gt;That way one could see the actual number placing the call even if the
&gt;&gt;return trip led somewhere else. Maybe there ought to be a dialing code
&gt;&gt;for the purpose of 'do not forward'. That is, the person placing the
&gt;&gt;call would dial some two-digit code (such as for blocking or do not
&gt;&gt;disturb) which meant 'absolutely ring number such and such'. This would
&gt;&gt;be sort of like the post office endorsement we can use on letters which
&gt;&gt;says, 'do not forward, return to sender if unable to deliver as addressed'.
&gt;&gt;Telco's response would be to ring that number or respond with a voice
&gt;&gt;intercept, 'cannot ring that number now' if the number was being for-
&gt;&gt;warded. There may be times, for example, when I wish to speak with you
&gt;&gt;but not if I know you are elsewhere; in those cases I am willing to wait
&gt;&gt;until you are at home. The recipient's Caller-ID box would show some
&gt;&gt;notation such as 'forced delivery from xxx-yyyy' to indicate a call had
&gt;&gt;been received but not forwarded at the caller's request.  PAT]

  Hacker attempts to chase cupid away
  SAN FRANCISCO (UPI, 10 Feb 1994) -- Two bachelors who rented a billboard to
  find the perfect mate said Thursday they had fallen victim to a computer
  hacker who sabotaged their voice mail message and made it X-rated.  Steeg
  Anderson said the original recording that informed callers how they may get
  hold of the men was changed to a "perverted" sexually suggestive message.
  He said the tampering occurred sometime Wednesday."  [United Press newswire
  via Executive News Service (GO ENS) on CompuServe]

The article states that Pacific Bell has been investigating other voice-mail
tampering recently as well.

  Welfare Cards (By Michael Holmes, Associated Press Writer) 
    AUSTIN, Texas (AP, 10 Feb 1994) -- Texas plans to begin providing welfare
  benefits electronically this year with bank-style cards that take the place
  of paper coupons.  The new system is designed to reduce administrative
  expenses, fraud and theft.  [From the Associated Press newswire via
  Executive News Service (GO ENS) on CompuServe]

The author continues with the following key points:

o "Electronic benefits transfer" will begin in two counties in autumn 1994
  and should be statewide by 1996.

o The Lone Star Card will function like a debit card, allowing holders to
  purchase food only in cooperating grocery stores.

o Cardholders will use a 4-digit PIN.

o Officials hope the cards will reduce fraud by eliminating all cash from
  food-stamp transactions (sometimes stores returned change).

It will be interesting to watch this program to see how security aspects are
handled.

An Article in London's Evening Standard of February 11 says that "in one of
the most ingenious and innovative high-tech crimes of recent years", culprits
planted a fake ATM card reader at a London branch of the Midland bank.  In a
variation on the theme, the reader was not planted over top of the ATM, but
was installed to emulate the door opening devices which most banks use.  Users
were asked to swipe their cards through the device, and then type in their
PINs, to gain admission to the ATM hall.

A suspicious customer informed the bank.  Some customers had used the device
unsuspectingly, but no money was stolen.

I see the following developments:

  - As we know, thieves are well able to reproduce magnetic swipe cards.
    They no longer need to steal peoples' cards to gain access to their
    accounts.  Any scheme which gives the card number and PIN will do.
    If this plan really qualified as "ingenious" it would have transmitted
    the data by radio directly to the thieves' card making machine, and
    the resulting cards would have been used without delay.

  - The article was on the front page of a popular newspaper.  Although
    it did contain some excess verbiage (such as the quote above) it
    also contained all the salient technical details, it described the
    extent of success and the outcome of the scheme.  There is a quote
    from a bank spokesman and a quote from the police.
    
I've never seen such a complete description of a RISK-worthy story in such a
prominent position.  Is this a sign that the non-technical public are becoming
more aware of the risks of technology, or at least more interested in it ?

My wife and I are blessed with an extremely literate 14-month-old
boy.  James is extremely enamoured of technology in general, with
special attention being given to remote controls and our family
Powerbook laptop.

As you might expect, we suffered through the usual baby-instigated
data processing disasters (leave the Mac unattended for a moment
and he'll go and click the mouse or hit keys in such a way as to
maximize the damage), but we have since adjusted to these dangers.

Yesterday, however, he got us but good.  In a display of hitherto
unsuspected manual dexterity, he managed to introduce into the
floppy disc drive a used popsicle stick, a fact not discovered
until some time later when an attempt was made to insert a floppy
into the drive.

15 minutes and a spirited display of vocabulary on the part of this
author later, the errant splinter was removed with the help of
a bent paperclip.  In a tribute to modern floppy disc design, the
drive has apparently survived the introduction of wood pulp and
traces of raspberry juice.

The risks are of course obvious.  As our children become more and
more computer literate at an earlier age, we need to develop a new
BABYSPEC specification (similar to MILSPEC but tougher), which
should include (but not be limited to)

* Diskette drive flaps that only flap for real diskettes.
* Hardened keyboards capable of withstanding two-fisted infant
  impacts (our "f" key will never be quite the same, though we
  did manage to get it working again with a paperclip).
* Smudge-resistant screens.
* Washable.
* And, of course, a baby-proof paperclip storage area.

If you're interested in a thought experiment about how to abuse the
Intelligence system and products like Clipper, then read Joe Finder's new
novel, _Extraordinary Powers_ (Ballentine).  It's a great spy
novel/technothriller that kept me up long past my bedtime. Saying anymore
would spoil the story.  (I should say that he is a friend...)  Peter

I won't attempt to do more than a very brief comment on each one. As I've
noted in the past, some of us (would like to) assume that simply placing a
reference (link) should sufficient. In the world of the Web it's actually
starting to happen.

Discover Magazine (March 1994) has an article entitled "Counting on 
Dyscalculia" (which I've called innumeracy). It discusses various problems 
familiar to Risks readers such as the fact that a false positive rate on a 
rare disease produces results which are not very good indicators of whether 
you have the disease. It mentions the impact on public policy such as banning 
substances at levels that are a fraction of what we ingest anyway.

A recent issue of Science News (which I put aside to mention here and have 
yet to find again) summarizes research on the difference between logical 
reasoning and human reasoning. In many cases humans reason correctly. These 
are the cases that make sense to the person doing the reasoning. Otherwise 
they can be very far off. It covers some of the open issues such as how much 
people use correlation and coincidence because of its evolution advantages in 
the absence of complex reasoning. Again, not a surprising article for Risks 
readers. It does jibe with my observation phrase like "Couldn't care less" 
and "could care less" mean the same thing because the sentence is analyzed 
against one's own semantic biases as opposed to logical analysis.

The Feb. 13th Sunday New York Times had two articles. One is by Peter Lewis 
based on the CERT alert. It has a sidebar illustrating how a Kerberos 
challenge/response key system works. Lawrence Fisher has an article on the 
changes in Telecommuting since the San Francisco earthquake. It says that 
security is a serious concern and has some discussion on approaches.

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.53.html">RISKS-15.53</A>, Jack B. Rochester writes:

&gt; The Jan. 10, 1994 issue of The New Yorker has a long, juicy article entitled
&gt; "E-Mail From Bill," 

And NOW, from the 21 Feb 1994 issue of BusinessWeek:

BILL GATES INUNDATED IN BOX

A personality profile in _The New Yorker_ magazine's Jan. 10 issue revealed
Bill Gates's electronic-mail address -- and his electronic in box hasn't been
the same since.  "I've got 5,000 messages stacked up," says Gates, CEO of the
Redmond (Wash.) giant, Microsoft.  That's up from no more than 10 e-mail
messages daily before from the outside (although he may receive as many as 250
per day internally).

Until the article ran, the software billionaire was never too busy to read --
and often respond to -- messages sent from around the world via the Internet
data highway.  Gates chats with outsiders on items that include technology and
business opportunities.  In his email -ure of the Information Superhighway and
his analysis of F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_.  [This article has
been taken verbatim from the magazine.  I assume that last sentence is a
misprint?]

Now, though, he has been forced to use a software program that sifts through
the deluge to identify items from important people such as Intel CEO Andrew
Grove.  But what about the thousands of notes from who-knows-who that continue
to stream in and sit in computer memory, ungraced by Bill's attention?  Gates
has never had anyone else read his electronic mail for him, "but I'm seriously
considering it now."

A case has just concluded in England which may be significant for computer and
cryptographic evidence in general, and for electronic banking in particular.
It also give some interesting insights into the quality assurance and fraud
investigation practices of one of Britain's largest financial institutions.

I will be talking about this case to the BCS Computer Law Special Interest
Group on Thursday 17th February at 6pm. The meeting will be held at the
offices of Bristows Cooke Carpmael, which can be found at 10 Lincoln's Inn
Fields. To get there, take the tube to Holborn, exit southwards and turn
second left into Remnant Street.

For the sake of those who cannot make it, there follows a report of the 
case from the notes I made during the hearing.

			*		*		*

1. Background.

On February 8th, 10th and 11th, I attended the trial at Mildenhall
Magistrates' Court, Suffolk, England, of a man who was charged with attempting
to obtain money by deception after he complained that he had not made six of
the automatic teller machine transactions which appeared on his statement.

The essence of the case was that John Munden, a police constable, had
complained to the manager of the Halifax Building Society in Newmarket about
these transactions, which appeared in September 1992. He had also stated that
his card had been in his possession at all times. Since the society was
satisified about the security of its computer systems, it was alleged to
follow that Munden must have made these transactions, or suffered them to be
made; and thus that his complaint was dishonest.

This trial had resumed after being adjourned in late 1993. According to the
clerk, evidence was given for the Crown at the initial hearing by Mr Beresford
of the Halifax Building Society that the society was satisfied that its
systems were secure, and so the transaction must have been made with the card
and PIN issued to the customer. Beresford had no expert knowledge of computer
systems, and had not done the investigation himself, but had left it to a
member of his department. He said that fraudulent transactions were rarely if
ever made from lobby ATMs because of the visible cameras. The Newmarket branch
manager, Mr Morgan, testified that one of the transactions at issue had indeed
been made from a machine inside the branch. He also said that in his opinion
the defendant had been convinced that he had not made the transaction; and
that he would not be aware of all the possible malfunctions of the ATM.

The defence had objected that the evidence about the reliability of the
computer systems was inadmissible as Beresford was not an expert. The court
allowed the prosecution an adjournment to go and look for some evidence; and
at the last minute, on the 20th January, I was instructed by Mr Munden's
solicitor to act as an expert witness for the defence.

2. The Prosecution Case.

On 8th February, Beresford's evidence resumed. He admitted that the Halifax
had some 150-200 `unresolved' transactions over the previous 3-4 years, and
that it would be possible for a villain to observe someone's PIN at the ATM
and then make up a card to use on the account. He confirmed that the person
who investigated the incident had no technical qualifications, had acted under
his authority rather than under his direct supervision, and had involved the
police without consulting him.

Evidence was next given by Mr Dawson, the Halifax's technical support manager.
He had originally written the bank's online system in 1971, and was now
responsible for its development and maintenance. The ATM system had been
written in 1978 for IBM 3600 series machines, and altered in 1981 when the
Diebold machines currently in use were purchased. All software was written
internally, and in the case of the mainframe element, this had accreted to
the nucleus originally written in 1971. Amendments to the online system are 
made at the rate of 2-3 per week.

The PIN encryption scheme used was nonstandard. The PIN was encrypted twice
at the ATM and then once more in the branch minicomputer which controls it.
At the mainframe, the outer two of these encryptions were stripped off and
the now singly encrypted PIN was encrypted once more with another key; the
16 digit result was compared with a value stored on the main file record and
on the online enquiry file.

When asked whether system programmers could get access to the mainframe
encryption software, he categorically denied that this was possible as the
software could only be called by an authorised program.

When asked whether someone with access to the branch minicomputer could view 
the encrypted PIN, he denied that this was possible as there were no routines 
to view this particular record (even although the mini received this field and
had PCs attached to it). When asked what operating system the mini used, he
said that it was called either TOS or TOSS and that he thought it had been
written in Sweden. He could give no more information.

He had never heard of ITSEC.

He had not investigated any of the other 150-200 `unresolved transactions'
because he had not been asked to. The last investigation he had done was of
another transaction which had led to a court case, three years previously; he
had no idea what proportion of transactions went wrong, was not privy to
out-of-balance reports from branches, and was not familiar with branch rules
on ATM operations. He never visited the branch at Newmarket, where the
disputed transactions took place, but merely looked at the mainframe records
to see whether any fault records or error codes. He found none and took this
information at face value.

The fault recording system does not show repairs. The cryptographic keys in
the ATM are not zeroed when the machine is opened for servicing. The
maintenance is done by a third party. The branch only loads initial keys into
the ATM if keys are lost.

The Halifax has no computer security function as such, just the internal
auditors and the technical staff; it does not use the term `quality assurance'.

When asked by the bench what information was required to construct a card,
Dawson initially said the institution identifier, the account number, the
expiry date, a service code, an ISO check digit, a proprietary check digit,
and a card version number. He concluded from this that a card forger would
have to have access to an original card. However it turned out that the ATM
system only checks the institution identifier, the account number and the card
version number. He maintained doggedly that a forger would still have to guess
the version number, or determine it by trial and error, and claimed there was
no record of an incorrect version number card being used.

However, Munden's card was version 2, and it transpired later that version 1,
though created, was not issued to him; and that an enquiry had been made from
a branch terminal two weeks before the disputed transactions (the person
making this enquiry could not be identified). When asked whether private
investigators could get hold of customer account details, as had been widely
reported in the press, he just shrugged.

He claimed that the system had been given a clean bill of health by the
internal and external auditors.

The branch manager was recalled and examined on balancing procedures. He
described the process, and how as a matter of policy the balancing records 
were kept for two years. However the balancing records for the two machines
in question could not be produced.

There was then police evidence to the effect that Munden kept respectable 
records of his domestic accounts, which included references to the undisputed 
withdrawals from ATMs, and that although he had once bounced a cheque he was 
no more in financial difficulty than anybody else. The investigating officer 
had only had evidence from the branch manager, not from Beresford or Dawson. 
The investigating officer also reported that Munden had served in the police 
force for nineteen years and that he had on occasion been commended by the 
Chief Constable.

3. The Defence.

That concluded the prosecution case, and the defence case opened with Munden
giving evidence. He denied making the transactions but could not produce an 
alibi other than his wife for the times at which the alleged withdrawals had 
taken place.

The only unusual matter to emerge from Munden's testimony was that when he
went in to the branch to complain, the manager had asked him how his holiday
in Ireland went. Munden was dumbfounded and the branch manager said that the
transaction code for one of the ATM withdrawals corresponded to their branch
in Omagh. This was not apparent from the records eventually produced in court.

The next witness was his wife, Mrs Munden. Her evidence produced a serious
upset: it turned out that she had had a county court judgment against her, in
a dispute about paying for furniture which she claimed had been defective,
some two weeks before the disputed withdrawals took place. Her husband had not
known about this judgement until it emerged in court.

I gave expert evidence to the effect that the Halifax's quality procedures, as
described by Dawson, fell far short of what might be expected; that testing of
software should be done by an independent team, rather than by the programmers
and analysts who created it; and that Dawson could not be considered competent
to pronounce on the security of the online system, and he had designed it and
was responsible for it.

At a more detailed level, I informed the court that both national and 
international ATM network standards require that PIN encryption be conducted in
secure hardware, rather than software; that the reason for this was that it 
was indeed possible for system programmers to extract encryption keys from
software, and that I understood this to have been the modus operandi of a
sustained fraud against the customers of a London clearing bank in 1985-6;
that I had been involved in other ATM cases, in which some two dozen
different types of attack had emerged and which involved over 2000 complaints
in the UK; and that the Halifax, uniquely among financial institutions, was a
defendant in civil test cases in both England and Scotland.

I continued that ATM cameras are used by a number of other UK institutions,
including the Alliance and Leicester Building Society, to resolve such cases;
that in other countries which I have investigated the practice would be not to
prosecute without an ATM photograph, or some other direct evidence such as a
numbered banknote being found on the accused; that card forgery techniques
were well known in the prison system, thanks to a document written by a man
who had been jailed at Winchester some two years previously for card offences;
that I had personally carried out the experiment of manufacturing a card from
an observed PIN and discarded ticket, albeit with the account holder's consent
and on an account with Barclays rather than the Halifax; that the PIN pad at
the Halifax's Diebold ATM in Cambridge was so sited as to be easily visible
from across the road; and that in any case the investigative procedures
followed in the case left very much to be desired.

In cross examination, the prosecutor tried to score the usual petty points: he
attacked my impartiality on the grounds that I am assisting the Organised
Crime Squad at Scotland Yard to investigate criminal wrongdoing in financial
institutions (the reply from our lawyer was of course that helping the
prosecution as well as the defence was hardly evidence of partiality); he
claimed that the PIN pad at the ATM in Newmarket was differently sited to that
in Cambridge, to which I had no answer as I had not had the time to go there;
and he asserted that the Alliance and Leicester did not use ATM cameras.  On
this point I was able to shoot him down as I had advised that institution's
supplier. He finally tried to draw from me an alternative theory of the
disputed transactions - staff fraud, or a villain whom Munden had booked in
the past getting his own back by means of a forged card, or a pure technical
glitch? I was unable to do this as there had been neither the time nor the
opportunity to demand technical disclosure from the Halifax, as had been the
case in two previous criminal cases I had helped defend (both of which we
incidentally won).

Dawson was recalled by the prosecution. He explained that only two of the
three tests carried out on new software were done by the analysis and
programmers who had written it, and that the third or `mass test' was done by
an independent team. He said that software failures could not cause false
transactions to appear, since the online system was written in assembler, with
the result that errors caused an abend.

He claimed that they did indeed possess a hardware security module, which was
bought in 1987 when they joined VISA, and which they used for interchange
transactions with VISA and Link although not for all transactions with their
own customers; and he finally repeated his categorical denial that any system
programmer could get at the encryption software. When asked by what mechanism
this was enforced, he said that they used a program called ACF2.

In his closing speech, the defendant's lawyer pointed out the lack of any
apparent motive, and went on to point out the lack of evidence: the balancing
records were not produced; the person responsible for attending to those ATM
malfunctions which the branch could not cope with was not identified; the
Halifax employee who had carried out the investigation was not called; the
handwriting on the ATM audit rolls, which was the only way to tie them to a
particular machine, could not be identified; the cameras were not working;
statements were not taken from branch staff; the disk in the ATM had not been
produced; and the internal and external audit reports were not produced.

He mentioned my expert opinion, and reiterated my point that when a designer
of a system says that he can't find anything wrong, what has he shown? He also
recalled that in the High Court action in which the Halifax is the defendant,
they had not relied on the alleged infallibility; and pointed out that if ATM
systems worked properly, then people wouldn't need to go to keep going to law
about them.

4. The Verdict and Its Consequences.

I have been aware for years that the legal system's signal-to-noise ratio is
less than 10dB; however, in view of the above, you can understand that it was
with some considerable surprise that I learned late on Friday that the court
had convicted Munden. My own reaction to the case has been to withdraw my
money from the Halifax and close my account there. Quite apart from their
ramshackle systems, the idea that complaining about a computer error could
land me in prison is beyond my tolerance limit.

No doubt it will take some time for the broader lessons to sink in. What is
the point, for example, of buying hardware encryption devices if people can
get away with claiming that system programmers can never get at an authorised
library? Why invest in elaborate digital signature schemes if they simply
repair the banks' defence that the system cannot be wrong? Is there not a case
for giving more consideration to the legal and political consequences of
computer security designs?

5. Action.

In the meantime, the police investigations branch have to consider whether John
Munden will lose his job, and with it his house and his pension. In this
regard, it might just possibly be helpful if anyone who feels that Dawson's
evidence was untruthful on the point that software can be protected from system
programmers on an IBM compatible mainframe, or that his evidence was otherwise
unsatisfactory, could write expressing their opinion to the Chief Constable, 
Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Hinchingbrooke Park, Huntingdon, England PE18 8NP.

    THE RIGHT NAME, THE WRONG MAN

Freed after a month in jail, innocent man found he'd lost 
job, van, and girlfriend.  By Margaret Zack, Staff Writer

Maintenance worker Russ Hamilton tried for more than a month to convince
authorities that he wasn't truck driver Russ Hamilton, who was wanted for
fraud.  .... His troubles began Nov. 28 at a Salt Lake City party that got out
of hand.  Police were called, and Hamilton was arrested on two misdemeanor
charges.  In a routine check, police found there was a warrant out for a
Russell Hamilton in Wisconsin, and both men had the same birth date.  So
Hamilton sat in jail.

... Dane County deputies flew to Salt Lake City and took him to Wisconsin on
Dec. 19.  He remained jailed, always protesting his innocence, until Dec. 30,
when authorities learned they had the wrong man and released him.  ... the
evidence that freed him -- a photo of the man wanted on the fraud charges --
had been in the prosecutor's file all along.

Hamilton, and his attorney Alan Albrecht of Brooklyn Center, said last week
that someone had obtained Hamilton's birth date and gotten a driver's license
in his name.  They said they don't know how that occurred.  The fraud suspect
has reportedly been identified but is not in custody.

What Albrecht finds so appalling about the case is that the photo of the real
person wanted in Wisconsin was always in the prosecutor's file.  "The picture
could have been faxed out to Salt Lake City," he said.  Or at least the
deputies who flew to Utah could have taken the photo with them to be sure they
had the right suspect, he said.

... But the prosector told him those would have been "extraordinary" measures
and weren't warranted in the case, Albrecht said.  The Dane county prosecutor
who handled the case did not return repeated phone calls last week.

  [The article goes on to detail differences between Hamilton and the man
  wanted for fraud: Hamilton is 37, 5'9", heavy, with long hair, a goatee, and
  tattoos on his arms.  The man wanted for fraud is over 6' tall, thin, and in
  his 50s.

  In addition, while Hamilton was in jail, authorities seized his van and its
  contents and sold them.  His girlfriend, with whom he shared an apartment,
  moved out, and he hasn't been able to locate his clothes, furniture, or
  other possessions.  He is now living in Minneapolis with a brother, and is
  preparing a civil lawsuit.

The risks of technology here are apparent and familiar to RISKS readers.  In
this case, too, technology would seem able to have provided reasonable
safeguards.  That a simple check would be regarded as "extraordinary" seems
itself extraordinary, but alas, is all too common.

   [Here is a case where checking the SSN might have helped -- except that
   the RISKS archives contain several cases of two people with the same name
   who were accidentally assigned the same SSN!  PGN]

The Op-Ed page (A13) of the National Edition of The New York Times on 14 Feb
1994 had a piece by William Safire that is worth ferreting out.  Three
paragraphs (excerpted out of 15) summarize his message:

  To the tune of ``I Got Algorithm,'' the Eavesdrop Establishment is singing
  that it will help us protect our privacy but not from intrusion by the Feds.
  In effect, its proposal demands we turn over to Washington a duplicate set
  of keys to our homes, formerly our castles, where not even the king in olden
  times could go.

  Tomorrow's law enforcement and espionage cannot be planned by people stuck
  in the wiretap and Big Ear mind set of the past. The new Ultra secret is
  that the paradigm has shifted; encryption has overcome decryption.

  Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers: you can't detect the crime wave of
  the future with those old earphones on.

                             Washington, DC
                       February 15, 1994 (second edition)
            Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
             ALMOST 15,000 HAVE SIGNED PETITION TO OPPOSE CLIPPER

In only two weeks, almost 15,000 users of the nation's computer networks have
signed the CPSR petition calling for President Clinton to withdraw the Clipper
proposal.  Opposition has been widespread, from CEOs of large firms to college
students in small towns, from librarians and civil libertarians to computer
programmers and product marketers.

To sign the petition, email &lt;clipper.petition@cpsr.org&gt; with the message
"I Oppose Clipper".  [See Banisar, <A HREF="/Risks/15.44.html">RISKS-15.44</A> for the petition.  PGN]

In 1990, over 30,000 people sent email message to Lotus asking that a product
containing detailed personal information called "Marketplace" be withdrawn.
Eventually Lotus withdrew the product.  

CPSR is a non-profit, membership organization based in Palo Alto, CA. 
CPSR's mission is to provide analysis of the effects of new technological 
developments on society.  For more information, please email cpsr@cpsr.org or 
call 415-322-3778.

     [MODERATOR's NOTE: Many contributions have been received on escrowed keys,
     Clipper, et al.  Some are repetitions of what has already been included,
     others are full of ad hominem comments and not appropriate for RISKS.
     There are also some messages that are lengthy interstitiations of already
     too-long messages.  You will all appreciate that I am having to moderate
     much more stringently than usual.  But the overwhelming majority of 
     E-mail is opposed to EES/Clipper, and in support of the CPSR petition.

   Canadian security intelligence services is trying to make equipment to keep
records of all conversations from millions of airborne phone, fax, radio
signal and other transmissions.
   The first thing that comes to my mind from this high-tech snoop gadget is
that it violates the people's trust and confidence. Nobody can ever be
confident to have a private conversation with others. They are always afraid
of what have been said because the government keeps records of these
conversations. This monitoring of phone calls is the invasion of privacy.
    As we have read from the other examples in the text book about risk_forum
digest contributions, the computers could make mistakes. In the case of
Canadian government, using computers could cause someone else to be accused by
the government for something he/she didn't do.  An error could result, for
example, from two persons having the same name.
    The other risk factor could be the possibility of an intruder accessing a
system and erasing some of the data or other information. An intruder changing
the data could cause other people to be at risk.
    Computers are not always to be credited. They could make errors, or
someone else could cause these errors by changing the data. This hardware on
Canadian security service will have the same problem, but the main issue is
that the Canadian government is taking advantage of the new technology to
invade people's private life.

A recent product announcement from Sun Microsystems (SunFLASH Vol 62 #8,
4 February 1994) introduces "new microphone, SunMicrophone II, to ship
with current and new Sun desktop platforms".  Among the features
described by the announcement for this "uni-directional microphone
which allows greater focus on direct voice input while providing less
interference from background ambient noise" is the following Q&amp;A:

 Q. Does the SunMicrophone II look similar to the SunMicrophone?

 A. No, the two products look very different.  The current SunMicrophone
    has a unique square shape, with an on/off switch.  The SunMicrophone II
    looks like a classic microphone on a rectangular stand, with no
    on/off switch.  Both products come in Sun colors and with Sun logo.

So, the new, "improved" model has no "on/off" switch, although the old
one did.  Maybe the new microphone is "uni-directional", but that
doesn't mean it can't pick up ambient sound--just turn up the gain.

This "improvement" makes it all the more difficult to follow the final
recommendation of CERT Advisory CA-93:15 (21 October 1993), quoted in
part below.  It's bad enough that the problem existed in the first
place, but Sun has now made it worse!

 III. /dev/audio Vulnerability
     This vulnerability affects all Sun systems with microphones. ...

     A. Description
        /dev/audio is set to a default mode of 666. There is also no
        indication to the user of the system that the microphone is on.

     B. Impact
        Any user with access to the system can eavesdrop on conversations
        held in the vicinity of the microphone. 

     C. Solution
        [...]
        *** Any site seriously concerned about the security risks
        associated with the microphone should either switch off the
        microphone, or unplug the microphone to prevent unauthorized
        listening. ***

Even if this vulnerability is fixed from a systems viewpoint, a user is
still vulnerable to Trojan horse programs that exploit the user's own
(legitimate) access to the microphone--and the information discussed in
a person's office may be far more sensitive than the information stored
on an office computer.

This is especially a problem for multi-level secure (MLS) systems.  Although
MLS systems offer protection against disclosure of information by Trojan horse
programs, that's no help at all if the microphone picks up a Top Secret
conversation that occurs in the office while the user happens to be logged in
at Unclassified.  Sure--one might look around to be sure there's nobody who
can inadvertently overhear, or close the office door--but the computer?
Computers don't eavesdrop, do they?

Computer manufacturers need to address these risks.  It's certainly
nifty to have desktop audio- and video-conferencing, but not when that
equivalent to installing a bug in every office (and remember not to aim
your video camera at the whiteboard).

Every microphone and video camera should have a positive on/off switch and
some positive indication (such as a light) to show when it's actually in use
(as opposed to just being enabled by the on/off switch).  The broadcast
industry learned this years ago, with its "ON THE AIR" lights.  Fail-safes,
such as permitting only manual activation, but computer deactivation, or
requiring manual confirmation of any attempted activation, would be better
still.

I'd just like to disagree briefly with one of the comments made in RISKS 15.53
by Jack B. Rochester &lt;0002757498@mcimail.com&gt;, talking about electronic mail.

He writes that "Good grammar and proper punctuation are not required in
e-mail, and their absence does not seem to affect regard for that
person."  I must disagree with that assertion strongly.

One particular case springs to mind, where I first met someone over the net.
I got the impression that he was, shall we say, 'intellectually challenged'.
When I eventually met him in real life, I was astounded to discover that he
was quite eloquent.  I had built up a very strong disregard for him, based on
his appalling grammar, spelling and punctuation.

That may seem unfair, but people discriminate the same way in real
life, as any stutterer or stammerer will know.  At the risk of being
contentious, my perception is that those who claim spelling,
punctuation and grammar are unimportant, generally turn out to be
people who cannot spell, punctuate or string together a sentence.

It's true that e-mail lacks the boilerplate formalisms of paper mail.  In
fact, when I get e-mail which starts "Dear Sir", it seems very odd to me.
Whether the lack of generally meaningless stock phrases is a risk, I don't
know.  Doubtless such formalisms originally served some purpose, or else they
wouldn't be there; I'm not sure that all etiquette is worth keeping in the
transition from paper to screen, though.  Some of it may be obsolete.

Regarding notoriety, I do still find it bemusing to discover that "real
people" (from TV, films and so on) have e-mail addresses.  Sometimes the lack
of distance and formalism one gets with e-mail can give a whole new
perspective on a person.  For example, I gave in to temptation and sent
electronic mail to Billy Idol.  He turned out to be a really nice guy, and
articulate too -- absolutely not what I was expecting from a world-famous rock
musician.

     Response to the Draft Report of the Federal Internetworking
	      Requirements Panel (FIRP), 14 January 1994
				 
		      Part 1: Strategic Comments

			  Stephen D. Crocker
	  Vice President, Trusted Information Systems, Inc.
		     IETF Security Area Director

			   15 February 1994

INTRODUCTION

"The Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP) was established by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to reassess federal
requirements for open systems networks and to recommend policy on the [U.S.]
Government's use of networking standards."  [Preface, para 1.]

The FIRP report describes the need for the U.S. Federal Government to embrace
not only the OSI protocol suite but also the ubiquitous TCP/IP Protocol Suite.
In fact, Internet Standards, which include the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, are in
very wide use in the Government, throughout the U.S. and throughout the world.
Some OSI products and systems exist, and it may be impossible to switch
completely to TCP/IP-based systems.  Nonetheless, the report says, it is time
to acknowledge the widespread use of the Internet Standards and give formal
sanction to their use in the Government.

This is indeed a welcome change, and it should help the Government take better
advantage of modern data networking.

This memo is the first of two responses to the report.  In this memo, some
issues are raised with respect to the recommendations in the FIRP report, and
suggestions are made for avoiding problems in the future.

In the other memo, comments are given with respect to specific sections of the
report.


STRATEGIC COMMENTS

This panel was convened in response to a divergence between the strategy the
U.S. Federal Government had been following for several years and the direction
of the marketplace.  As the report makes clear, the divergence had become so
great that the policy no longer reflected attainable objectives.  The
accommodation of the Internet Standards brings policy into line with
widespread practice and removes obstacles for rational management decisions in
the future.

In this light, it's worth examining the recommendations to ascertain if they
are sufficient to avoid similar problems in the future.  As with any large
organization, the U.S. Federal Government pursues multiple policy objectives
and has ingrained organizational imperatives.  Recommendations that respond
only to the current marketplace without also anticipating the future or
without including the flexibility to follow the lead of the marketplace may
lead to the convening of a similar panel in the not too distant future.


The FIRP report makes five recommendations:

  1. The role of oversight and integration across federal agency
  internetworking activities should be strengthened within the Office of
  Management and Budget.

  2. The roles and responsibilities for fostering standards and
  assessing technological change should be refocused and strengthened by
  the Department of Commerce.

  3. The roles and responsibilities for infrastructure development and
  operations to support all internetworking services from advanced
  research and development to leading edge to core/commodity services
  should be clearly defined and formally assigned through the
  Information Infrastructure Task Force.

  4. The roles and responsibilities of affinity groups should be
  defined, including how they are created and coordinated by the
  Government Information Technology Services working group.

  5. In accordance with OMB Circular A-119, Revised October 1992,
  voluntary standards should be adopted and used by Federal agencies,
  and international standards should be considered in the interests of
  promoting trade.  The current GOSIP policy should be modified by the
  Department of Commerce to reflect the wider range of international
  voluntary standards for internetworking.


Recommendation 1 asks that OMB's role be strengthened.  OMB has the charter to
review the roles, responsibilities and performances of the various agencies
which provide, develop or guide the U.S. Government's internetworking
activities.

This is an important role.  The OMB should develop guidelines for measuring
the performance of the assigned agencies and the attainment of the overall
objectives.  Although there is usually a preference to avoid duplication of
activities, some degree of competition, exploration of alternative strategies
and comparison of results is desirable because it tends to produce more cost
effective products and services that are better matched to the needs of the
users.  Wherever feasible, the OMB should also foster multiple approaches
and/or participation by multiple agencies in order to provide for maximum
feedback within the system.


Recommendation 2 suggests the Department of Commerce be tasked with new
responsibility for "fostering standards."

Presumably the context of this recommendation is with respect to internal
standards within the U.S.  Government.  The general arena for developing
Internet Standards is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which
operates in conjunction with the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) under the
auspices of the Internet Society.  The Internet Society, along with NSF, ARPA,
DOE and NASA, provide considerable financial support to the standards
activities.  This process enjoys wide spread support form the industrial,
academic and government communities, and as a result, the standards developed
in this arena reflect the needs of marketplace and are usually adopted widely
and quickly.

Even if this recommendation is understood to be limited to refer to internal
use of the U.S. Government, the recommendation is flawed.  "Department of
Commerce" here certainly includes NIST, but is likely to include other parts
of the Department.  While NIST is indeed the federal agency tasked with
promoting and developing standards, NIST and the rest of the Department have
at least two difficulties to overcome.

First, NIST has been the lead agency with respect to GOSIP.  NIST personnel
are deeply knowledgeable about the OSI suite and less familiar with the TCP/IP
Protocol Suite.  NIST is not now in a position to provide leadership in this
area, although it does have the technical strength to follow, assist and
participate in the ongoing standards activities.  One challenge for NIST in
the next few years will be to strengthen its staff and adjust its direction to
move toward a stronger involvement in the Internet Standards activities.  A
significant part of this challenge is working in a standards arena in which
the U.S. Government does not have de jure authority or veto power.

Second, the Department of Commerce is heavily committed to a particular
strategy with respect to cryptography that is currently in conflict with the
forces in the marketplace.  NIST is the lead agency involved in the
promulgation of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and the "Clipper"
escrowed-key encryption system.  Both of these initiatives are meeting very
strong resistance from industry and academia.  The RSA algorithm is the de
facto standard for signatures and key exchange, and some form of DES and/or
some proprietary algorithms, e.g. RC2 and RC4, are likely to be the de facto
standards for bulk encryption.

The U.S. Government's orientation toward cryptography comes from the specific
concerns of the intelligence and law enforcement agencies.  While not denying
the principle that the intelligence and law enforcement agencies have
legitimate concerns, it is far from clear that the approach being taken by the
Department in support of these concerns will be successful.  In fact, it is
entirely possible these initiatives will not succeed in the marketplace.  If
so, the result will be the existence of dual standards in which the Government
algorithms will be used only under duress, both the Government and the general
population will bear unnecessary costs dealing with dual standards, the
introduction of strong security controls will be retarded, and the
intelligence and law enforcement agencies will not succeed in preventing the
use of strong encryption, except in so far as they succeed in retarding the
use of encryption altogether.  On February 4, 1994, the Department announced
it had made substantial progress in its review of policies governing
cryptography.  Its announced that export controls on DES and similar
cryptography will remain in place, that the Department will continue to
promulgate the Digital Signature Standard despite uncertainties about the
patent and licenses, and it will adopt the escrowed encryption system
(Clipper) as a Government standard.  Nothing in the public record supports
these decisions, and it was made clear that these decisions are driven by the
views of the law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The purpose of citing these controversies concerning cryptography policy here
is to explicate a consequence relevant to the FIRP report.  The Commerce
Department, and in particular NIST, have a conflict of interest.  Like a
lawyer with two clients with intertangled interests, the Department is trying
to serve two constituencies.  One constituency is the federal government as a
whole, and in that role, it must do the best job it can of interpreting the
market forces and adopting federal standards that are consistent with the
marketplace.

The Department's other constituency is the particular needs of the law
enforcement and intelligence agencies.  Those agencies desire to
influence and change the direction of the marketplace.  In service of
this role, NIST is adopting federal standards that reflect the
direction the law enforcement and intelligence agencies want the
market to go.

The only way for the Department to be successful is if the law enforcement and
intelligence agencies prevail and the marketplace adopts the standards the
Government is promulgating.  Perhaps this will happen, and if so, the
Government's gamble will pay off.  However, if the marketplace continues to
adopt RSA as the preferred public key algorithm, if DES and other non-escrowed
algorithms are used for symmetric key encryption, and if products with
encryption are become prevalent in non-U.S. markets, not only will the stated
goals of the law enforcement and intelligence communities be lost, the rest of
the federal government and indeed the rest of the country will have paid the
price in struggling with dual standards.

Like a stubborn child with a tensed jaw, the U.S. Government seems bent on
pressing forward with these initiatives.  So be it.  But in handing out
accolades because NIST is now willing to accommodate the protocols that have
been commonplace for many years, it's fair to note that NIST and the rest of
the Department are engaged in an exercise which promises to bring a repeat of
the same divergence, confusion and waste of resources which the FIRP report
documents.


Recommendation 3 suggests that each role and responsibility should be tasked
to some specific agency.  Apparently this is aimed at reducing duplication.
While useful in principle, this approach is fragile.  If the assigned agencies
are incompetent or inefficient, everyone suffers.  The report does suggest
that some assignments may be decentralized.  Decentralization should be
emphasized.  Wherever possible, multiple approaches and multiple agencies
should be encouraged.  Competition and comparison are enormously useful
forces.  As noted above with respect to recommendation 1, the OMB should
encourage as much decentralization as possible and should oversee the agencies
establishing a means of measuring the results.


Recommendations 4 and 5 are oriented toward implementation of the first three
recommendations and raise fewer strategic concerns except that recommendation
5 implicitly acknowledges that the role of the U.S. Government in the
standards process shift from one of controlling the process to one of
participating in the process.  As noted above with respect to recommendation
2, this shift poses an institutional challenge for the Government in general
and NIST in particular.

Electronic card system launched on London's buses

--United Press newswire 02/15 1027 via Executive News Service (GO ENS) on
CompuServe.

  LONDON (UPI) -- London Transport Minister Steven Norris Tuesday launched
  an 18-month trial of an electronic ticketing system on the city's buses.
  More than 200 buses operating in the Harrow district of northwest London
  have been fitted with a contactless "Smartcard" reader that validates bus
  tickets.  Government officials said the trial will be the largest of its
  type in the world.

The article states that the credit-sized card will be activated by proximity
sensors without requiring any physical contact with the reader.  The card is
expected to make boarding the buses easier and faster as well as reducing
fraud.

Perhaps the most significant sentence in the article is the following: 

  "...  the card will help reduce fraud and give bus operators more
  information about who is using their services."

I wonder if the system includes audit trails which record details of who rode
which bus when.  If so, I hope the software development team uses adequate
quality assurance.  RISKS readers will recall that Ross Anderson recently
described a case in the U.K. in which a policeman was convicted of fraud for
having the temerity to complain about what he claimed were unauthorized
withdrawals from his bank account.  The court ruled that the bank's electronic
records, which _failed to support_ the defendant's arguments, were sufficient
to convict the suspect.

Any system which records information about personal movements poses risks when
the information is accurate; but inaccurate information can cause even more
trouble.

Can a RISKS reader in the U.K. follow up on this story?

                   PRINCIPLES OF PRIVACY
        FOR THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

                     Robert Ellis Smith
      Publisher, PRIVACY JOURNAL, and Attorney at Law

     Before the NII Task Force Working Group on Privacy
                      January 26, 1994
                              
1.  Any analysis of the National Information Infrastructure
must recognize that privacy includes more than an
expectation of confidentiality.  The right to privacy also
includes (1) freedom from manipulation by others and (2) the
opportunity to find safe havens from the crassness and
commercialism of daily life.

2. The infrastructure must be an INFORMATION-TRANSFER
medium, not a SALES medium.  It must be primarily an
INFORMATION medium, and only secondarily an ENTERTAINMENT
medium.  (Will the information superhighway be only another
way to exploit couch potatoes?)

3.  It must have different levels of security and
confidentiality so that some sector in it allows for
confidential communications.  These communications could be
intercepted by law enforcement only under current Fourth
Amendment guidelines.  Aside from that, in the confidential
portion of the infrastructure, there must be strict
penalties for the interception of any PERSONAL data without
the consent of BOTH the sending party and the person who is
the subject of the data.  And for aggrieved individuals and
organizations there should be a right to sue for breaches of
confidentiality.

4.  There must be some portion of the infrastructure free
from commercial messages and free from the commercial uses
of the names and electronic mail addresses of the users.
Even though it is commercial-free, this sector need not
necessarily be operated by the government or a non-profit
entity.

5.  In the sectors of the infrastructure available for use
by individuals, there must remain opportunities for
ACCESSING (non-personal) data anonymously (as exist in a
library situation now).  Whether
to permit anonymous MESSAGE-SENDING in these sectors
remains, for me, an open question.  To deny this will
deprive the network of much of its spontaneity, creativity,
and usefulness; however, to permit anonymous message-sending
runs the risk of having these sectors dominated by obscene,
inaccurate, slanderous, racially and sexually-insulting
chatter - and worse.

6.  Privacy interests are less compelling, to me, in two
other sectors of the proposed infrastructure.  In those
sectors transmitting proprietary business information and
sensitive business dealings, the organizations using the
network will see to it themselves that security meets there
needs, and they will have the resources to pay for it.  By
the same token, in those sectors providing point-of-sale
services (presumably from the home), companies offering
these services will provide adequate security or risk losing
customers.

7.  The infrastructure ought not become a means for large
conglomerates to transfer personal information between and
among subsidiaries where the data-handling is regulated
(credit bureaus, cable companies, medical providers) and
entities where the data-handling is not regulated (telephone
providers, brokerages, credit-card processors,
telemarketing).
                        ___________

Rather than proposing specific safeguards -- which can be
drafted later -- the task force can be most effective in
1994 by establishing the DOMINANT THEMES of the
infrastructure:  information-transfer, not commercialism;
democratic access not corporate dominance; diversity (in
usage as well as in levels of security) not conformity.

Recently I moved my bank account to Telephone bank PLC (names changed to
protect the guilty :-), a subsidiary of Traditional bank PLC.  Amongst the
apparent advantages of this arrangement is the ability to use Traditional
bank's ATMs.

I had a substantial amount in my current account after the transfer, much 
of which had come from a savings account, which gave substantially more 
interest than the current account does.  naturally when the ATM offered me 
a transfer between accounts as one of its functions I elected to transfer 
this cash to my savings account with Telephone bank.  

Nearly two weeks later I checked the balance and find that nothing had been 
transferred.  Telephoning the bank the operator said "It doesn't allow you 
to do that".  I offered the opinion that the ATM shouldn't offer functions 
it can't provide.  The operator said that it couldn't be changed "otherwise 
the machine wouldn't recognise your card."  She did however agree to look 
into whether there were any warnings in the banks literature (I read 
everything in their welcome pack and i did not see any). 

The risks are obvious, but as I hate people leaving it at that, I will 
enumerate those that are obvious to me.

1	Loss of interest.
2	My balance isn't what I thought it was (they wouldn't reall bounce 
	my cheques would they 8-)
3	Can I trust the other facilities provided by the ATM (ordering
	statements, cheque books, etc.)

The latest issue of New Scientist includes an article on the overcharging of
some BT customers.  The full article gives more details on the scope of the BT
investigations, the perceived extent of the problem, and the steps that have
been taken to notify business customers.  I've tried, though, to extract the
paragraphs which may be of interest to RISKS readers.  There only risk I can
think of is that of trusting computers, so those who cheque their phone bill
should not be at risk.  In my opinion, there is no risk to domestic customers
since a jump of \pounds 420 in a quarterly phone bill should be noticed by the
monitoring system, and if it isn't, then surely the customer would notice!

Reproduced (without permission) from New Scientist, 19th February
1994, page 18:

``British Telecom has been overcharging some of its customers because
its computers cannot subtract one number from another reliably.
...
BT is conducting two investigations, one to find out why the
computer-generated bills were wrong by such a large amount, and the
other to discover why the errors were not spotted by a separate
computer system designed to trap gross billing errors.

BT charges calls by units (4.2 pence plus VAT).  Meters at the local
exchanges that log the units used on each line are read each quarter.
BT's billing computer subtracts the figure for the last reading from
the current reading to give the number of units it charges for.  
...
In each case [of overcharging discovered], simple subtraction of the
two meter readings gave a result which was wrong by 10,000 units.
In one bill, four separate mistakes were discovered:
	18497 - 2964 = 25533
	14295 - 2096 = 22199
	11030 - 1824 = 19206
	    3 -    1 = 10002
These four mistakes added \pounds 1680 to a bill of \pounds 3908.

BT's backup system is designed to monitor the billing computer and
register any unprecedented peaks of activity on a line.  But the
system failed to notice any errors later spotted by subscribers.
...
Insiders say that modern digital exchanges use solid-state metering
which feeds data directly into BT's billing computer.  They believe
that BT has a bug in its accounting software and that the problem is
thus much more widespread than has so far been recognised.''

Mathew has identified the risk of poor grammar and spelling in e-mail
messages, namely that the originator of a message will be judged as much (or
more) by its form as by its content.  I firmly believe that etiquette has
evolved in social interactions to manage the risks of those interactions - and
that the e-mail media is still young enough to be defining "proper" etiquette.

As to Mathew's comments on notoriety, several stories come to mind.  Recent 
RISKS articles describe the flood of e-mail to Bill Gates mailbox, as well 
as to WHITEHOUSE.GOV.  An older story describes the e-mail trials and 
tribulations of DEC's Ken Olsen, whose mailbox was deluged with mail, some 
from people who would never dare to talk to him in the hall but felt 
perfectly at ease taking him to task in an e-mail message.

I would greatly appreciate any pointers from RISKS readers to more 
information on the developing etiquette of e-mail.

I agree with Mathew, FWIW.  As a manager, I insist on the use of proper
English by all the Software Quality Assurance folks that I supervise.  Why?
Because, in the minds of many, as Mathew noted, hearing or reading improper
English reflects poorly on the education and intellect of the person
communicating.  In addition, I feel that sloppy communication is a symptom of
a larger problem of carelessness and lack of attention to detail, something I
find inappropriate in a professional setting.  How one chooses to express
one's ideas is indicative of the value one places on them.  Interestingly, I
have worked with a number of people for whom English was a second language,
and they put more effort into doing it properly--often with better
results--than many who grew up speaking and writing it.

This is NOT a definitive account, just my hazy recollections from
having watched a "Horizon" documentary shown on the BBC this week.

Apparently, a 737 crashed near Panama about two years ago; all on board (about
47) were killed.  The fault was identified by the investigating team as a
probable loose wire from the gyros to the flight deck which caused the
artificial horizons to "stick" in one position from time to time without any
indication to the pilots that there was a fault.

The aircraft was flying at night during a storm, and the investigators thought
that a 1G roll would be undetectable to the crew; therefore, they surmised,
they had no way of knowing the plane's true attitude.  The resulting wild
maneuvers as the pilots tried to make the stuck artificial horizons show a
level attitude led directly to break-up from aerodynamic forces at about
10,000 feet.

The switches which control the artificial horizon displays were found to be
set to "BOTH ON VG1" which denied the pilots information from the backup
gyros.  The reason for this was unknown.

The cockpit voice recorder was recovered, but proved to contain only a
recording of an earlier flight; it used magnetic tape (as opposed to wire) and
the tape had snapped some weeks previously.  As the recorder was sealed, the
tape doesn't get checked.  The flight data recorder (also tape based) worked
properly.

The programme implied that the team could not in the end identify the faulty
wire, and had made no recommendations on modifications or checks on other 737
aircraft to prevent a reoccurrence, although they felt improved crew training
might be beneficial.

Can someone post more information on this?  Tim

The indicated article stated that in month that the victim was held, his van
and its contents were sold.

It would seem a second lawsuit would be indicated here for improper procedure
violations.  I would think that while his assets could be seized, they
couldn't be sold except after conviction or a motion for a court order at
which time the defendant would allowed to object.

``I would like to caution people about signing the petition,'' Dorothy
Denning said. ``The issues are extremely complex and difficult.''%1

Clipper (by which I mean EES/Skipjack/Clipper/Capstone collectively)
does raise some mildly tricky issues, which I'll discuss later. But 
those are _side_ issues. The basic argument%2 against Clipper is simple
and deserves emphasis.

Clipper is bad because it is unfair competition in the crypto market.

Who has paid for the design and implementation of Clipper over the past
decade?%3 The taxpayers. Who has paid for ramping up Clipper production
at Mykotronx? The taxpayers. Who pays for the lawyers and accountants
keeping Clipper on course, and the NSA-FBI team which visits Bell Labs
and other locations to promote Clipper? The taxpayers. Who will pay for
the key escrow ``service,'' probably an agency with dozens of people,
including armed guards? The taxpayers.

I resent being forced to pay for Clipper's development and adoption.

Is this Clipper subsidy the only way that the government is interfering
in the market? Not at all. Consider, for example, export controls. A
private company, even if it doesn't see a foreign market for its
encryption products, has to register as an arms dealer and take
precautions to avoid selling crypto to non-citizens. These restrictions
have been dramatically reduced for Clipper.%4

Are these points a matter of dispute? Is this just my view? No. The
government knows full well that Clipper is unfair competition.

In fact, unfair competition is the goal of Clipper policy. According to
Jerry Berman, ``the reason [for various Clipper-related actions] was
stated bluntly at the [4 Feb 94 White House] briefing: to frustrate
competition with Clipper by other powerful encryption schemes by making
them difficult to market, and to "prevent" strong encryption from
leaving the country...''%5

Now, here's the problem: The government talks about Clipper's market
interference as a _good_ thing.

Of course, I see it as a bad thing. America's need for data protection
would be fully served by a healthy encryption industry; let's eliminate
crypto export controls! If you agree with me---if you want a free crypto
market---then you should oppose Clipper. There's nothing complicated
about this.

Let me close by briefly addressing a few side issues, mostly reasons
that Clipper is risky when compared to other crypto available today.

1. There is a RISK that the Skipjack algorithm is, intentionally or
unintentionally, weak. Suppose that in 1986 an NSA cryptanalyst noticed 
a subtle but wide hole in Skipjack, which was relatively new at the 
time. Why would it be in NSA's interest to divulge this information?
Denning points out that we don't _know_ of any holes, but that's
axiomatic---Clipper would be dead otherwise. One cannot deny the _risk_,
exacerbated by secrecy, of a hole.

2. There is a RISK that Clipper will be easier to break than the basic
Skipjack algorithm. Given two encryption algorithms one can (carefully)
compose them to produce a ``double encryption'' which is strong even if
one of the algorithms is weak. Clipper also has two encryption steps,
but for a different reason---one encryption is transparent to the user,
the other transparent to the FBI. If either of these different%6 steps
is weak then Clipper is weak. ``Half encryption,'' I'd say.

3. There is a RISK that key escrow security will be compromised, either
by bribes from the outside or by corruption from the top. It is highly
dangerous to keep so many keys under the control of such a small group 
of people.

4. There is a RISK that, if Clipper fails to dominate the market, the
government will simply outlaw all non-escrowed encryption. ``This is a
fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad
policy review.''%7 Alternatively the government could outlaw Clipper
superencryption while requiring Clipper in government procurements, new
phones, and so on. Denning points out that Clipper is voluntary right
now, but the mere fact that the government brought up the possibility
of a Clipper law means that there's a risk.

In RISKS 15.52, Prof. Denning states (in reply to someone else):
&gt;Certain information relating to foreign intelligence operations is
&gt;classified.  Are you saying that decisions should not be based on
&gt;classified information or that foreign intelligence information should
&gt;not be classified? 

I am saying that decisions about the encryption I use, as a private American
citizen, must not be based on classified information.  I am saying that the
decision must be based on a totally public debate in which we all engage.
There should be no executive session, giving classified agencies an advantage
over the citizenry.

She goes one to state:
&gt;You need a court order to intercept any electronic communications, including
&gt;those on high speed nets.  You need a court order to get keys.  Although the
&gt;court order is not given to the escrow agents (to protect the identity of
&gt;those under investigation), certification that one was obtained must be
&gt;presented to the escrow agents.

This "protection of the identity of those under investigation" could actually
be protection of agents doing illegal wiretaps.  If the escrow agents were to
give not the master key for a chip but a session key and if each request for a
session key included the name of the person being tapped and the court order
authorizing it, then the escrow agents would be in a position to notice the
kind of abuses for which Nixon and Hoover were famous and therefore would be
able to blow the whistle on the offending agency.

CALL FOR PAPERS : CARDIS
FIRST SMART CARD RESEARCH AND ADVANCED APPLICATION CONFERENCE
October 24 - 26, 1994  LILLE FRANCE
Sponsored by IFIP - The International Federation for Information Processing

AIMS AND GOALS

Smart cards or IC cards are becoming a significant part of the information
processing world. Furthermore they are beginning to move towards real
integration into the information systems. They participate in the overall data
management, security and communication processes. But they bring their own
special characteristics. It is very likely that future IC cards will require
many scientific and technical improvements which represent a challenge for the
success of the technology. So far there are many events which are mostly
devoted to the commercial and application aspects of IC cards. There is now an
opportunity to initiate a scientific conference bringing specialists who are
involved in all aspects of design of the future IC cards and related devices
and environment. IFIP - the International Federation for Information
Processing has agreed to sponsor this conference. It will be the first
occasion for the IC card community to start a permanent activity: In addition
to the conference itself there will be discussions about creating a permanent
group within IFIP with possible implication for advancing standards,
publishing and international cooperation.

SUBMISSIONS
Six copies of detailed abstracts of original papers corresponding to one or
several themes for the conference should be sent in English to the program
chairman before May 2, 1994. The submissions will start with a succinct
statement of the problem addressed and their significance, appropriate for a
non-specialist.  Technical development directed to the specialist should
follow as needed (at most ten pages).

They should be accompanied by a fact sheet indicating the following:
  - Title of the paper with the relevant conference theme(s);
  - Author(s) with affiliation, address, phone and fax numbers, E-mail.

Proceedings will be available at the conference.

An extra line meant to be "dormant" for now caused Chemical Bank to deduct
twice any amount its customers withdrew from ATM machines Tuesday night and
Wednesday.  However, they received praise from the state consumer board for
their prompt and open response to the problem.

My information comes from articles in The New York Times, 18 Feb 1994, p. A1
and 19 Feb 1994, p. C1.  The new line of code was part of a year-long effort
to add functionality to ATM machines.  It sent a copy of the ATM withdrawal to
a different computer system (the one that handles paper checks), which then
deducted the money a second time.  This second system is only run overnight,
so the problem was not detected until Thursday morning.

About 430 checks were bounced incorrectly as a result, but Chemical contacted
the customers affected, and offered to pay any charges they incur, or write
letters of explanation to the recipients of the checks.  The NY state consumer
board has also asked them to refund any fees for the ATM transactions which
were completed incorrectly.

There were about 150k ATM transactions incorrectly doubled, amounting to $15M.
(Last year in the US there were 7G ATM transactions averaging $50, according
to The NYT article.)

Steven Bloom, who runs a consulting firm in NJ said: "There are similar
episodes that take place all the time, but we never hear about them because
the bank is able to get the accounts straight before it opens its doors in the
morning.  The problem in this case is the ATM system is highly visible and
runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week."

          In one of the biggest computer errors in banking history, Chemical
        Bank mistakenly deducted about $15 million from more than 100,000
        customers' accounts on Tuesday night, causing panic and consternation
        among its customers around the New York area.
          The mistake affected 150,000 transactions from Tuesday night
        through Wednesday afternoon. Some checks were bounced Thursday
        morning as a result, although the bank said the number was small.
            [The New York Times, Friday 18 Feb 1994]

          Millions of dollars vanished from New Yorkers' bank balances
        Wednesday, when a computer deducted $2 from accounts for every $1
        withdrawn from automated teller machines."  [...]

            [The Washington Post, 18 Feb 1994, from Jeremy Epstein]]

          Customers stormed into Chemical Banking Corp's branch offices to
        complain of empty accounts and bounced cheques after a computer glitch
        affected at least 70,000 of the bank's approximately one million
        customers.

[Autoweek 7 Feb. 1994]

A British Ford dealer set out to impress potential purchasers with the
burglar-proof features of the new Ford Mondeo by staging a break-in in his
showroom.

As a room full of potential customers watched, the hired thief walked up to
the front of the car and gave it a swift kick in the bumper, near the airbag
sensor.  The bag inflated, AND the central locking system disengaged.  The
thief then opened the door, quickly broke the steering column lock, hot-wired
the ignition and started the car.

News spread quickly, and copycat incidents have followed.

Autoweek says "Sales of The Club should increase."

  Historical Anecdote:
  Word from friends in MoTown, was that when Ford was testing the very first
  airbags in Police cars, the fuel cut-off relay would also be triggered by
  the same impact sensing circuit.  Street-wise evaders found this out and
  they would tap the bumper to trigger the airbag if the cops were too close
  in pursuit, disabling the vehicle.  (This also may have been how Ford was
  able to guarantee the ability to inspect the vehicle after the bags were
  deployed, as it was a testing situation.)

Maxis Business Simulations, the creators of SimCity, have a new product called
"SimHealth."  The program is a simulation of a health care system,
incorporating features from the new Clinton (US) health care proposal and
other plans dating back to Truman (US president from a number of years ago).
The other Maxis products are sold as games, and I imagine this one is sold
that way too, but the February issue of CIO describe it as "to help the public
better understand the complicated issues that underlie the nation's
health-care debate."  Furthermore, they attribute Maxis as "envision[ing]
SimHealth being used by a wide range of concerned citizens to evaluate current
policy and new proposals."

The obvious risk is a public that expects a certain policy to work because it
works in SimHealth.  (Admittedly it is juse a game.  But in addition to the
benefits simulations give, there is always the danger that too much trust will
be put in a simulation, or that the beliefs of the simulation developers will
be giving too much credence after being filter through a computer.)

&gt;From "The New York Times Magazine" February 13, 1994:

"It's a thin plastic card that will completely change the way you pay fares on
New York City's subway and buses.  No more searching for tokens in pockets or
purses.  Metrocard is convenient to carry and easy to use."

So says the M.T.A. [Metropolitan Transit Authority] in its brochure on the new
Metrocard, which can be obtained in several denominations and used instead of
tokens in a number of subway stations.  But -- and there's always a but --
should any problems arise, then, in the dim light in the wee hours at Grand
Army Plaza, follow these instructions:

"... Try it again and check the turnstile display to see what it says.  If the
card still doesn't work, try another turnstile.  If the second turnstile
doesn't let you enter, see what the Metrocard Reader near the turnstile says
when you swipe the card there.  If the information displayed on the Reader
doesn't explain the problem, ask the clerk at the Metrocard window in the
token booth for assistance."

[description of what conditions the clerk can fix - often the clerk
can give you a replacement immediately,  when to mail the card in for
a replacement, and addresses and phone numbers for assistance] 

[The Times adds this comment:] Meanwhile, carry spare tokens.

Here the MTA has apparently done a good job of identifying likely problems,
and providing solutions.  They've explained what to do, and what they can do
if something doesn't work. (I don't know the details, so I don't know if they
have identified the right set of problems, but they've done a much better job
than most new installations of card readers.) The language is slightly
technical (In particular is "swipe" widely used?)  but the directions for
trouble shooting are quite clear.

What do they get for their care?  A cheap shot from the Times.  Had they just
said "the Metrocard will work perfectly" (as many places have), RISKS readers
would smirk, but the Times would probably not have commented.  As we've gotten
more cynical about computerized systems, we've made it harder for the
organizations which do plan for problems to get credit for their forethought.

A week later (Feb. 21), the Times had an article saying that distribution of
the first 40,000 cards went smoothly.  Perhaps the MTA really has done a good
job.

Recently, I heard the Chairman of Sun Microsystems on California Commonwealth,
a Bay-area radio program, lampooning the National Information Infrastructure
(aka information superhighway), and in particular lambasting its vision of
doing everything at home.  In his view, this would lead to birth of the
ultimate couch potato.

Those interested in the risks of computing should contemplate the following
notion: is it possible to make communications too effective?

When I heard Scott McNealy give his comments, my mind went back to a story by
E.M.Forster, called The Machine Stops.  This story, written before WWI,
imagines a world where the NII is in place but the rest of the world has gone
to hell, quite literally, and everybody has degenerated into couch potatoes.
This, they imagine, is paradise until the Machine stops!

Merchant and Ivory have had such a great time and made a lot of money turning
other Forster stories into movies (Passage to India, Howard's End, A Room With
a View).  I think they should look this one over too. Should make quite a
thriller.

Here in Turku Finland one can make calls from pay phones using prepaid cards
issued by the city phone company, Turun Telelaitos.  These cards are on sale
throughout the city, and are bought anonymously for cash.

On two different occasions I have had cards malfunction.  When the card is
placed in a phone it is read and seen as valid, and I can dial, but when the
other party answers, and the card is locked in for debiting, an error is
generated and the call is (frustratingly!) terminated.

On both occasions I have taken the offending card to the phone company's
office.  The card is passed thru a reader which displays the card's unique
identifying number.  The service person then calls this number in to another
bureau, where they can dump a complete calling history of the particular card,
no doubt to verify malfunction and protect themselves against fraud.

Having verified the card malfunction, the service person asks for a name and
address before issuing a refund (in the form of another card) for the
malfunctioning card's unused portion.  I do not know whether the name and
address are ever verified; in this country I would imagine not.

It is all well and good that they can extensively track an individual card,
and where it has malfunctioned, and that this card can be bought anonymously,
but naturally my privacy breaks down when they take my name and address, which
they can (in principle) match it to the card's audit trail to get a partial
track of my calling activities.

But given that such card malfunctions are an unusual occurrence, related
perhaps to the recent spate of subzero (fahrenheit) weather, it does not seem
to me to be an undue threat to my privacy.

Nonetheless, can anyone suggest some ideas that I might take to the phone
company to permit them to make the same checks but with a higher level of
privacy?  Or should I just give them a bogus name and see if it ever causes a
problem (in the form of, for example, more intrusive checks before issuing
refunds)?

Bill Fitler (bfitler@ccmail.com) asks about email courtesy issues in RISK 
15.56.

Perhaps one disturbing trend as more people use Internet is the practice by
college students of using subject matter listservs as sources of first resort
for information they should be looking up in their university library.  Every
year BIOSPH-L@UBVM.BITNET, a list dealing with environmental issues, is
flooded with ill-expressed questions that should not be addressed to the list.
These include questions such as "what is hazardous waste," etc.  Another which
came up today was a question which could be answered by using the Statistical
Abstract of the US or any World Almanac, etc.

Last year a hot debate erupted when a graduate teaching assistant at a major,
dare I say, top 10, Eastern university, assigned a class of undergraduates to
use Internet to seek information on research paper topics.  The TA did not
instruct the students to use the library first and then pose well formulated
questions to the net.  BIOSPH-L was flooded with questions on basic
environmental science.

Both the TA and the students were outraged by the complaints they received
from list readers who objected to being asked fundamental questions that ought
to be dealt with by the students themselves.  The root cause appears to be
neither the TA nor the students had any idea who was at the other end of the
line.  All they saw was a computer that should be giving them answers.

What was said to them repeatedly is this.  The courtesy issue is that traffic
on BIOSPH-L is voluntary. If you want people to take the time to answer your
questions, indicate you have done some legwork on your own and have a genuine
problem looking for additional information.  Otherwise, you are soaking up
volunteer resources which could be better used to meet needs not answered
elsewhere.

Also, neither the students nor the TA took kindly to suggestions that if they
absolutely insisted on using computer terminals instead of (gasp) books, that
there are online services which for a fee will gladly give them the
information they want.

Another RISK of the high prevalence of poor grammar and spelling in e-mail is
the risk to one's own style.  If immersion in a foreign language is an
established way to improve one's fluency in that language, then surely
immersion in a medium where capitalization, spelling, punctuation and grammar
are weak might harm one's own ability to compose correctly.  I've found that I
sometimes question my own use of "it's" vs. "its", which I never had trouble
with before I used e-mail, for example.

In the U.S., the CBS television network airs an "Olympic Late Night" show
every night at 11:30 p.m. or 12:30 a.m. The show is a sort of hip, MTV-style
rundown of the day's events in Lillehammer. The show also does a nightly
"Information Highway" segment, and maintains a forum and e-mail address on
Prodigy. Wednesday night, for instance, host Pat O'Brien sat down at a PC and
personally answered e-mail from a doting user.  On the air, O'Brien tells
viewers to send Prodigy e-mail to "Ask Pat O'Brien". (And he doesn't mention
whether there are spaces, hyphens, or anything else in his address.)

Some readers of the rec.sport.olympics newsgroup are upset with the CBS
coverage, so someone suggested mailing "obrien@prodigy.com". The poor Prodigy
user with the username "obrien" was understandably upset when his mailbox
flooded with harsh criticism of the CBS Olympic coverage. I don't know if
other Prodigy users joined Internet users in sending their CBS-bashing to the
wrong address, but poor Mr. O'Brien had to have his e-mail address changed.

According to the 21 Feb 1994a _Business Week_, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
has never had anyone screen his electronic mail.  With the recent publication
of his e-mail address in _The New Yorker,_ however, he's reconsidering.

While in the short run that would be a good idea, I don't know why Gates
hadn't installed aliases and mail filters long before.  Now I suspect that
Microsoft Mail doesn't even have these capabilities.

Aliases would allow re-routing of mail to billg, but with a different "To:"
header.  In combination with mail filters, Bill could give out a separate VIP
address and send all non-VIP mail to a reserve mailbox for a staffer to read.

Electronic food stamps might be a good way to prevent fraud, but they also may
make it easier to steal from the government.  It will stop thieves from
robbing the food stamp from people's mail, but thieves may be able to use
computers to steal from the accounts on the card.  The criminals use of
technology to commit food-stamp fraud may be more educated than the criminals
who were robbing mail boxes.

&gt;... I would think that while his assets could be seized, they
&gt;couldn't be sold except after conviction or a motion for a court order at
&gt;which time the defendant would allowed to object.

Sorry, but no.  His property was no doubt subject to 'Civil Seizure' (probably
the single MOST SERIOUS threat to the foundation of the US constitution).
Under 'Civil Seizure' a strange legal circumlocution allows the PROPERTY to be
arrested because it 'participated in a crime' and since property cannot defend
itself there is no due process.  The only recourse for the prior owner is for
him to sue for its return and HE MUST PROVE THE PROPERTY IS 'INNOCENT' (note
no assumption of 'innocent until proven guilty'). Furthermore, there is a
fairly short period of time during which the prior owner must take action or
his property is considered 'abandoned' and he has no further recourse.

I'm not a lawyer, a legal expert, or even an expert on Civil Seizure but the
above comments are substantially correct...

Here's another example of a familiar problem with a topical twist,
as reported by the Portland "Oregonian" February 22, 1994, p. C5:

"Access Violation: Several U.S. reporters were contacted by Mike
Moran, the U.S. Olympic Committee chief press attache, after they got
Portland figure skater Tonya Harding's Olympic identification number
and broke into her computer mail program.

"All persons with Olympic credentials have access to a computer mail
system on which they can send notes to others and receive information.
Access is is through an individual's Olympic ID number and a password,
typically the user's birthdate.

"The reporters got Harding's ID number through a blown-up photo and
typed her birthdate to gain access to her messages.

"The skater had received 61 messages by Sunday."

The Atlanta Journal of 18 Feb 1994 carried an article by Chris Grimes
describing an error in 300,000 auto tax bills (about 5% of the total).  The
error added $10 to $30 to the ad valorem portion of the bill.  Apparently the
mistake was caused by a patch added to correct a similar problem from the
previous tax season.  (Once again, the rule of thumb that a change to fix a
bug has a 50% chance of introducing a new one seems to hold.)  Officials
expect the problem to be fixed for next year's tax season.  (One wonders if
the have a "three strikes and you're out" rule :-)

Apparently, the State is not notifying motorists directly of the incorrect
amounts --- they must contact their local tag offices to ask if there was an
error.  The article warns, however, that this might result in a higher bill
since the errors apparently were both postive and negative.

An article by Davidson Taylor appeared in the 18 Feb 1994 issue of the Asbury
Park Press (NJ) described the arrest a teller of a local credit union for
embezzling $15,000.  The embezzling was allegedly done on the teller's last
day of work, 8 Mar 90.  There is a supposition that the teller might have
destroyed the paper trail; she was apparently caught through computer auditing
by the Federal Reserve, which notified the credit union on 19 Mar 90.  No
clear explanation was given for the nearly four year delay in filing charges.

Of interests to RISKS readers was the quote from Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jay McMahon regarding the detection of the fraud:

TESTING THE SOFTWARE  [Nuclear Engineering International, 12/93, p.10]

Britain's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate is satisfied that the software
for the Sizewell B Primary Protection System (PPS) will be adequate for its
role - provided that no further major issues arise from NII's continuing
assessment or from the commissioning trials now underway, that the various
ongoing independent assessments are completed successfully, and that a
"clean" dynamic testing demonstration is achieved.

The NII does not believe that Nuclear Electric's original PPS integrity target
(10E-04 probability of failure per demand as proposed in the Pre-Construction
Safety Report) has been fully demonstrated - it was always regarded as a very
tall order by the regulators - but it does accept that the overall safety case
for the plant "can accommodate, without significant detriment, a lower
integrity for the PPS."

These conclusions are part of a status report on NII's assessment of the PPS
presented by NII staff to the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear
Installations on 1 July.  In October, the UK trade newspaper _Computer Weekly_
took the innovative step of helping the nuclear industry in its mission to be
more transparent by making the leaked report available to readers (at 2 pounds
to cover copying and postage).

The NII notes that two main themes have emerged from its assessment of the
Sizewell B PPS software. On one hand there is complexity of design, which "has
made the task of demonstrating a high integrity for the system particularly
difficult."  On the other hand there is the compensatory effect of examination
and testing, not only by the supplier, Westinghouse, but also by a range of
organisations in the UK: "no other reactor protection system in the world,
past or present, has received more attention than the PPS" (see NEI, March
1993, pp. 28-33, for a flavour of the 500 person-year effort).

Because of the difficulties of quantitative demonstration of software
reliability, NII has adopted a "special case procedure" consisting of two
legs: demonstrating excellence of production; and an onerous programme of
confirmatory independent assessment, to build confidence that the required
dependability has been delivered (see NEI, September 1991, pp. 38-40).

The independent assessment is still going on.  Because of the huge effort
entailed, it was always expected to "run right up till the eleventh hour" says
David Hunns of the NII.

The dynamic testing, which has received a good deal of publicity recently, is
just one part of the independent assessment programme.  Originally offered by
the utility on a voluntary basis, the dynamic testing uses a "test harness" to
subject an actual guardline of the PPS to a sample of the inputs it might see
during selected fault scenarios and then to compare the output from the
guardline against what it should have been according to a logical model based
on the specifications of the PPS.

Unfortunately, in about 52% of the 49694 valid tests performed in the 6 month
programme ending December 1992 there was a discrepancy between the actual and
expected PPS output.  About 90% of the failed runs have been ascribed to
inadequacies of the test harness (in particular limitations in its modelling
of PPS characteristics) rather than the PPS itself, but the NII wants a
complete explanation of all the reasons for failure and demonstration of a
"clean" test run the the test harness performing satisfactorily.  More tests
are underway.

In a recent samizdat, I've heard that the National Intelligence Agencies are
urging the White House to use Clipper for its own internal system.  It sounds
like a good plan to lead by example, right?

Unfortunately, I would resist using such a system if I was the President.
Why? Because Washington is filled with intramural spooks watching other
branches of the government. Most of the folks in privacy groups like to
imagine the Clipper chip as an instrument of government oppression directed
toward the common folks. In reality, I would bet that a number of phone taps
are agency-vs-agency, intramural things.

For instance, Bill Safire found out that his phone was tapped while he was a
speechwriter for Nixon. A recent internal investigation by the DOJ revealed
that there was an internal eavesdropping system for listening into different
branches of the DOJ. Internal Phone calls were routinely recorded.

This is why, I believe, that 13 state legislatures ban their state and local
police from using phone taps. These taps would give the folks who run the
local police a good deal of intelligence about state-wide issues and spending.

This is also why the recent Bush-to-Clinton transition was such a mess. The
clintonians arrived to find computers stripped of their hard disks.  Why?
Because it is possible to retrieve info from hard disks long after they've
been erased. Also, the Clintons stripped out the phone system and had a new
one installed? Why? Who knew what bugs were left in place.

Of course the most important reason not to adopt the Clipper for White House
use was on the cover of the NYT today. A CIA analyst was finally caught spying
for the Soviets. He was supposed to have netted at least 1.5 million dollars
for his information.

I was particularly struck by the size of the house that he bought for $500,000
in allegedly ill-gotten cash. It wasn't that big. Life in Washington is very
expensive-- especially for the clerks and career employees of NIST and the
Treasury Dept. If you need to sell out to get this house, it must be tough to
sit there on top of hte keys to every conversation in america and be happy in
your rundown bungalow and Reagan era sedan.

So, you can buy a high ranking CIA person (who ran the *counter*intelligence

Social RISKS of Universal IDs

This was in the op-ed section of the Globe &amp; Mail last Friday (23 Feb).  As it
is a relatively non-technical description, I'm not sure how appropriate it is
for this forum, but it presents a fairly eloquent argument outlining the
potential social RISKS of universal ID cards.

    =-=-=-=-=-=-=

*Your identity card please*

Ontario's Social Services Minister is worried about welfare fraud, but doesn't
want to stigmatize welfare recipients by singling them out for fingerprinting.
So Tony Silio has seized on a clever alternative: require _everyone_ in
Canada, whether or not they are on welfare, to carry a universal identity
card.  Citizens wouldn't have to clutter their wallets with a separate
driver's license, age-of-majority card, health card and so on.  It would be
adorned with a photograph and (possibly) a digitized fingerprint.  How
efficient.  How practical.  How unwise.

It's always difficult to argue against such schemes because they are, on the
surface, so sensible.  There is no doubt at all that a universal ID card would
make life easier for all kinds of authorities, from the welfare people (who
could easily prevent multiple claims) to health care administrators (who could
catch out-of-province and out-of-country freeloaders) to the police (who could
quickly check the identity of suspected wrong-doers, whether or not they are
licensed to drive).  For honest Canadians, they would make daily life a little
more convenient without posing any immediate threat -- just as photo radar on
the highways poses no immediate threat to people who do not speed, or video
cameras on street corners pose no immediate threat to people who don't
vandalize public property.  Why, then, do all these things give us a chill?

Critics would say it is irrational fear, an automatic reaction to any measure,
however reasonable, that reeks of Big Brother.  They would be partly right.
Few opponents of identity cards really expect Canada to become a police state
the day after they are introduced.  Their opposition springs instead from
instinct, a gut feeling that a society that makes its members carry an
identity card is, however intangibly, less free.  It is, on the whole, an
admirable instinct.

There are many practical objections, too.  The very existence of a unified
identity card would invite invasions of privacy.  Advances in microchips and
other technologies have made it possible to put an immense store of
information on a simple plastic card.  If such a card can carry a digitalized
fingerprint, it can also be designed to contain the holder's medical history
(handy for insurance companies), credit record (convenient for banks and
stores) or criminal record and probation status (nice for the police).  Thanks
to computer networks, this sort of information can easily be shard among
various agencies.

At present, we are at least partially protected by the fact that we carry
separate cards for separate things.  A person who is pulled over by the police
for speeding expects to hand over his driver's licence because he knows that
holding such a license is required to operate a car.  He does not expect
simultaneously to hand over his welfare, medical or employment ID.  The merit
of separate cards is that each agency of the government has access only to the
information that it clearly and demonstrably needs.

Canadians already must carry a host of identification cards they did not need
on the past.  Ontario, for example, only recently required residents to
present a health card when visiting the doctor.  Until 1964, there was no such
thing as a social insurance number.  But if a citizen is not applying for a
job, paying his taxes, going to the doctor or driving a car, he can still
leave his wallet and home and walk down the street without a scrap of
identification in his pocket, defined not by a piece of plastic but by his
status as an individual.  That is a feeling that citizens of most countries do
not enjoy.  It is one Canadians should not let slip away.

SimHealth, introduced in Washington D.C. last November, was developed by Maxis
Business Simulations, which is a special unit of that company. It was
developed, as I`ve learned, for the Markle Foundation as kind of
"demonstration/educational tool" for students and community colleges etc. to
show, discuss and learn about some basics of health reforms and politics. The
only "risk" I see is that the result is better informed, critical citizens.

One general issue of the Sim series is that they portray certain viewpoints of
how the world operates and don't pretend to be objective. As noted, there is a
danger in using the simulations to understand public policies where just about
every parameter is debatable. One benefit is making people appreciate the
complexity of interacting systems.

I'm reminded of the Apple ads of a decade ago arguing that pretending to
dissect a frog on an Apple ][ was just as good as cutting open a real frog.
It also worth noting that the Psychic Hotlines on the 900 #'s are listed in
small type as "for entertainment purposes only". How much of their audience
consists of people who are spending $300/hr just to play a game.

Maxis makes fine software and great games with a number of valid lessons. Too
bad schools don't teach much about models vs reality.

What happens when the police arrest a suspect in some crime, find a prepaid
phone card on him, take the phone card to the telephone company, and say,
"Tell us what calls were made with this card?"

What happens if the enemies of a prominent businessman engaged in private
negotiations hire someone to mug him to get his phone card, take the phone
card to the telephone company pretending to be the legitimate owner, and claim
that it malfunctioned?  Will they be able to look at the screen the operator
pulls up with the phone numbers called on it?  What happens if they don't
bother to go to the telephone company directly, and instead just break into
the telephone company's computers and read the number off of the stolen card
themselves?

This doesn't sound like an "anonymous" system at all.

An alternative system that would do a much better job of protecting users'
privacy would be to allow users to type a special code on the pay phone if
their card malfunctions while placing a call.  That code would cause *that
call only* to be recorded in the telephone company's computers.  No explicit
action by the user means no records in the computer.

The flip side of this issue (inappropriate questions posted to news or list
server when the questioner should have used the library first) is that it's
ego-gratifying to answer questions.  So for every simple question there are
likely to be dozens of answers, some sent to the asker in private e-mail but
many posted back to the list or newsgroup.  There is, however a socially
redeeming aspect of all this.  When dozens of answers are posted many of them
will be slightly or completely wrong.  One learns, over a period of time, just
how unreliable information obtained on the net can be, and whose answers tend
to be the most reliable.

I'd pose the complaint differently. The argument that one should trek miles to
the public library to look at the berries on wood pulp before querying the
electronic medium is misdirected. There is a valid complaint that reasonable
discussions should be stratified according to some measure of common interest
or expertise. This is going to be an increasingly serious issue as the network
grows, especially in the absence of control mechanisms such as financial
incentives and/or an established etiquette.

Asking questions online is more a symptom of the lack of effective 
information retrieval technology in this medium (net surfing is not the final 
answer) and is more a teething problem. Yes, deciding not to don ones winter 
gear and head out into the blizzard is laziness. But it is precisely this 
laziness that will force the issues and encourage people to make this new 
medium work. If it breaks, fix it. You can ask people to hold back until the 
problem is solved but don't blame them for the problem.

I do get a cultural jolt when I use an online catalog only to find I've 
actually got to find the pbook.

The same program has been floating about New Mexico over a year now.  It works
very well, I should know, I use it.  It is very convenient.  My card has a
little 'Money card' symbol on the back, name of the service is called
Electronic Benefits Transfer or EBT.  Some of the propaganda on the card and
it's protective sheath :

Warning : It's a crime to illegally use, transfer, acquire, alter or possess
	  food stamps or authorized cards.  Persons convicted may be FINED
	  AND/OR IMPRISONED.  PENALTIES ARE SEVERE.

(on the card)

	This card remains the property of the State of New Mexico Human
	Services Department and is subject to the terms and conditions
	under which it is issued.  If found etc.. etc..

In any case, I think that the security of the card is much better than
carrying around paper food stamps which someone without the knowledge of your
PIN could use.

Concerning the Washington Post article about the International Internet
Association that was mentioned in <A HREF="/Risks/15.49.html">RISKS-15.49</A>:

The tone of the original article in the Post and the RISKS followup were along
the lines of "Gee, isn't it a shame that this legitimate organization has had
its reputation impugned by someone who was took quick on the trigger in his
e-mail."  There's another side to this story that I'd like to share.

I'm a member of an informal network of organizations in the DC area that work
with student and youth activists.  We meet for dinner once a month, and a
running joke for the last few meetings has been the IIA.  Several of us have
gotten faxes from the IIA, which promised free Internet access and a
forthcoming larger packet of information that never materialized.

Contact was frequent enough to keep us joking and wonder who these people
were, but the whole thing had a very fly-by-night feel to it.  First off, an
organization called the International Internet Association appears out of
nowhere... one would have thought that an organization like that would have
made itself known *on* the Internet in order to build its reputation.  Second,
the letterhead consisted of clip art of a world map with IIA typed over it --
materials that could have been thrown together in about 15 seconds with no
monetary investment, especially since everything we saw arrived by fax.

All of this was merely quaint, until they asked us for a credit-card number
for a *free* account.  As soon as I saw that, I told the rest of the group to
stay as far away from these people as possible; the whole thing just screamed
"scam", and I am still not convinced otherwise.

I read this story in Robert Park's "What's New" from opa@aps.org, and
am forwarding it because, though it came up in conjunction with the
CIA spy, it seems relevant to the discussions of Clipper here.

-&gt; Recall the 1986 case of Larry Chin, a career CIA analyst and spy
-&gt; for China; he also fooled the polygraph. In 1983 I was waiting to
-&gt; testify before the House Security Subcommittee. OTA Director John
-&gt; Gibbons was summarizing a study of the scientific validity of the
-&gt; polygraph for the subcommittee.  Loosely paraphrased, Gibbons was
-&gt; explaining that these things couldn't distinguish between a lie
-&gt; and the sex act.  Seated next to me was General Richard Stillwell
-&gt; (ret.) of the CIA. He had no idea who I was, but he could contain
-&gt; himself no longer; leaning toward me, Stillwell muttered, "I wish
-&gt; these damn scientists would leave intelligence to the experts."

                  SERVICE INTERRUPTION

Cleanliness is not always the best policy.

There was a short interruption to some ACS services on Thursday, February 24,
1994.  The gopher server, postbox, and HomeNet services were offline for about
1 hour at the beginning of the day.

A member of the custodial staff plugged his vacuum cleaner into a power strip
attached to our uninterrupted power supply (UPS).  Poooooof.  Down went
several computers and part of the network.  Just when you think that you have
solved the problem of power outages with a brand new UPS .......

ACS is working with the custodial services to remedy the problem and prevent
future such occurrences.

This is 2nd hand from soc.culture.portuguese. Portuguese police found out that
a drug traffic ring used pagers to receive orders from clients, and also to
receive announcements of new bulk deliveries (This is a more recent practice
in Portugal than in the US, given the relatively recent arrival of pageers
there and the less serious drug problem).  They arrested one of the drug
sellers, took his pager, and started recording the arriving messages. Soon
they figured out the code used by the ring, and they caught them all.

Two lessons: 

1. Physical access to a node is the best way to break into a network.

2. Old-fashioned police work can take advantage of the vulnerabilities in
criminal activities created by the use of new technology. Even if all the
links in that network had been securely encrypted, the method followed by the
portuguese police would still work. Food for thought in relation to the
current Clipper debate.

By Business Times Staff, Bombay, 25 Feb 1994

Clearing of cheques at the Reserve Bank of India's national clearing cell
(NCC) at Nariman Point came to a half on Wednesday night as a result of a
"major fault" in the IBM mainframe computer handling the clearance of magnetic
ink character recognition (MICR) cheques.  The fault has crippled the
reader-sorter machine.

As a result of the breakdown, clearing and settlement of about 10 lakh (i. e.
one million) cheques valued at Rs. 1,000 crores (i. e. Rs 10 thousand million,
roughly equal to US$ 300 million) have been held up over the last two days.
The disruption has sent corporate houses and the salaried class into a panic
as salary payments were due this week.

Sources in the RBI said the fault was yet to be located at the time of going
to press today.  Personnel from the RBI's Calcutta and Madras Offices and
experts from Computer Maintenance Corporation, the maintenance agent of IBM,
have been summoned.

The breakdown, according to the sources, was unprecedented in recent times and
"the experts are grappling" with the snag since yesterday.

The NCC handles about six lakh cheques each day amounting to a total value of
Rs. 1,000 crores.  Clearance of high-value cheques (over Rs. 1 lakh) and
inter-bank instruments, however, is being carried out unhampered.  The worst
hit were the public account cheques into which category fall salary cheques
and other instruments.

The NCC has been inundated with calls from commercial banks which wanted to
find out when normalcy will be restored.  As it happens, the snag that stopped
the clearing of cheques came at the end of the month and many salaried
employees have been left with no choice but to get their cheques discounted.

The back-up programmes which the NCC had were of no avail and the 
experts had to be summoned.  The RBI put up a notice at its Amar
Building office and at the NCC yesterday about the snag and said: "Due
to a problem with the computer system with the national clearing cell,
processing of MICR presentations of yesterday evening (February 23)
could not be completed.  Member banks are advised that settlement of
this clearing will not be accounted for today (February 24).  A further
communication will follow."

Branches of commercial banks have been advised by their respective zonal
offices that "outward MICR clearing could not be presented" yesterday and have
been instructed not to release the credits of clearing presented on February
23 and thereafter until further notice.

"The system will have to be rectified, its programme loaded, tested to see
whether it can function to its usual capacity and then only the backlog can be
cleared," the sources said.  The would mean a delay of at least two more days,
they added.  Loading its programme, incidentally, takes a substantially long
period.

"We have made some progress since yesterday and hope to locate the problem by
tonight.  We expect the machine to start only by tomorrow evening," the
sources added.

The mainframe could not load the programme properly on Wednesday night and all
efforts by the NCC staff came to naught.  Personnel from RBI offices and the
CMC had to be flown in yesterday.  The RBI is also in touch with IBM personnel
who designed the system.

The RBI said in a statement the "computer system developed certain hardware
and consequential software problems" on Wednesday.  "The problems are being
attended to on an emergency basis and the normal cheque clearing and
settlement work is expected to resume shortly," the statement said.

High-value cheques and inter-bank payments account for a very large
proportion of the clearing settlement in terms of value, the RBI said.

Van Eck Radiation Helps Catch Spies

Van Eck in Action

Over the last several years, I have discussed in great detail how the
electromagnetic emissions from personal computers (and electronic gear in
general) can be remotely detected without a hard connection and the
information on the computers reconstructed.  Electromagnetic eavesdropping is
about insidious as you can get: the victim doesn't and can't know that anyone
is 'listening' to his computer.  To the eavesdropper, this provides an ideal
means of surveillance: he can place his eavesdropping equipment a fair
distance away to avoid detection and get a clear representation of what is
being processed on the computer in question.  (Please see previous issues of
Security Insider Report for complete technical descriptions of the
techniques.)

The problem, though, is that too many so called security experts, (some
prominent ones who really should know better) pooh-pooh the whole concept,
maintaining they've never seen it work.  Well, I'm sorry that none of them
came to my demonstrations over the years, but Van Eck radiation IS real and
does work.  In fact, the recent headline grabbing spy case illuminates the
point.

Exploitation of Van Eck radiation appears to be responsible, at least in part,
for the arrest of senior CIA intelligence officer Aldrich Hazen Ames on
charges of being a Soviet/Russian mole.  According to the Affidavit in support
of Arrest Warrant, the FBI used "electronic surveillance of Ames' personal
computer and software within his residence," in their search for evidence
against him.  On October 9, 1993, the FBI "placed an electronic monitor in his
(Ames') computer," suggesting that a Van Eck receiver and transmitter was used
to gather information on a real-time basis.  Obviously, then, this is an ideal
tool for criminal investigation - one that apparently works quite well.  (From
the Affidavit and from David Johnston, "Tailed Cars and Tapped Telephones: How
US Drew Net on Spy Suspects," New York Times, February 24, 1994.)

&gt;From what we can gather at this point, the FBI black-bagged Ames' house and
installed a number of surveillance devices.  We have a high confidence factor
that one of them was a small Van Eck detector which captured either CRT
signals or keyboard strokes or both.  The device would work like this:

A small receiver operating in the 22MHz range (pixel frequency) would detect
the video signals minus the horizontal and vertical sync signals.  Since the
device would be inside the computer itself, the signal strength would be more
than adequate to provide a quality source.  The little device would then
retransmit the collected data in real-time to a remote surveillance vehicle or
site where the video/keyboard data was stored on a video or digital storage
medium.

At a forensic laboratory, technicians would recreate the original screens and
data that Mr. Ames entered into his computer.  The technicians would add a
vertical sync signal of about 59.94 Hz, and a horizontal sync signal of about
27KHz.  This would stabilize the roll of the picture. In addition, the
captured data would be subject to "cleansing" - meaning that the spurious
noise in the signal would be stripped using Fast Fourier Transform techniques
in either hardware or software.  It is likely, though, that the FBI's device
contained within it an FFT chip designed by the NSA a couple of years ago to
make the laboratory process even easier.

I spoke to the FBI and US Attorney's Office about the technology used for
this, and none of them would confirm or deny the technology used "on an active
case."

Of course it is possible that the FBI did not place a monitoring device within
the computer itself, but merely focused an external antenna at Mr. Ames'
residence to "listen" to his computer from afar, but this presents additional
complexities for law enforcement.

     1. The farther from the source the detection equipment sits means that
the detected information is "noisier" and requires additional forensic
analysis to derive usable information.

     2. Depending upon the electromagnetic sewage content of the immediate
area around Mr. Ames' neighborhood, the FBI surveillance team would be limited
as to what distances this technique would still be viable.  Distance squared
attenuation holds true.

     3. The closer the surveillance team sits to the target, the more likely
it is that their activities will be discovered.

In either case, the technology is real and was apparently used in this
investigation.  But now, a few questions arise.

     1.  Does a court surveillance order include the right to remotely
eavesdrop upon the unintentional emanations from a suspect's electronic
equipment?  Did the warrants specify this technique or were they shrouded
under a more general surveillance authorization?  Interesting question for the
defense.

     2. Is the information garnered in this manner admissible in court?  I
have read papers that claim defending against this method is illegal in the
United States, but I have been unable to substantiate that supposition.

     3. If this case goes to court, it would seem that the investigators would
have to admit HOW they intercepted signals, and a smart lawyer (contradictory
allegory :-) would attempt to pry out the relevant details.  This is important
because the techniques are generally classified within the intelligence
community even though they are well understood and explained in open source
materials.  How will the veil of national security be dropped here?

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that the Government had
admitted the use of Van Eck (Tempest Busting etc.)  in public.  If anyone
knows of any others, I would love to know about it.

  [Dave Parnas asked me to post the following message from him.  
  It is HIS, not MINE.  PGN]

The article in [Nuclear Engineering International, 12/93, p.10, reported by
Bob Dolan contained the following assertion, "no other reactor protection
system in the world, past or present, has received more attention than the
PPS".

Having read the report that was leaked to the BBC and later circulated by
other organizations, I see no evidence to support that statement.  For
example, there have no reports of the software having been subject to a formal
(mathematically based) inspection procedure such as the one used for the
Nuclear Station at Darlington Ontario.

The leaked report also showed that the authorities were quite prepared to
accept a safety-critical software product that had FAILED the majority of its
tests on the basis of vague and unsubstantiated claims that the failures were
caused by the test harness not the program itself.  The report did not
indicate that there were any plans to rectify the problems in the test harness
and carry out the test properly.  There was no indication of how the test
cases were selected and whether they were statistically meaningful.  I know
that in other nuclear plant situations, far more care was taken in the design
of testing procedures.

The Sizewellreport was kept secret and I have heard of no plans to have
British software experts who are not part of the nuclear industry take part in
the evaluation procedure.  My experience suggests that, for whatever reasons,
"inside experts" tend to be less rigorous and demanding than "outsiders".
Organisations tend to pick the experts whom they expect to say what they want
to be told.  They aren't always right in their predictions, but I have never
seen an industry knowingly engage a "loose cannon".

In the Darlington case, reports were not kept secret, and the inspection
process involved many outside consultants.

Sizewell seems to me to provide ample evidence that outside scrutiny,
openness, and an active press are essential when there are potential conflicts
between short-term financial exigency and safety.  Nobody who read that report
could have much faith in the authorities who were prepared to accept such test
results.

With simulations, good modelling of the real situation and initial conditions
is important.  With simulation-based propaganda, however, it's also useful to
know the biases of the game-writer and the desired conclusion you're supposed
to come to :-)

At the Knoxville World's Fair in ?1983, the Tennessee Valley Authority had a
simulation game that put you in charge of their power system, letting you pull
levers to choose how much power to get from what source, in order to keep
enough power for the demand at the best price.  The conclusion you were
supposed to get was (surprise, surprise), "Use all the hydro power you can,
then all the nukes you can, then coal&amp;oil".  As a resident of an area whose
government gave electrical supply monopoly to the folks who own Three Mile
Island and a few other old nuclear plants, I thought they should at *least*
have the nuke plants go off-line every once in a while, spending money real
fast when they're down :-)

SimCity had a fairly strong bias toward City Planners telling people what to
do and making decisions for them instead of letting them do what they want.
Is SimHealth similarly biased toward single-decider systems?

&gt;... In his view, this would lead to birth of the ultimate couch potato.

The solution is quite obvious, and even environmentally friendly!

Take your standard electronic stationary bike (which uses an electrical
generator to produce the current required to run the display) and replace the
current display panel with an LCD display and waterproof keyboard.

For even better performance, use logic devices that operate faster if more
power is available, so someone really cranking on the pedals will get their
job to compile faster than someone who's coasting... and hence get the fat
bonus check!

(The home version would determine the recharge period of your weapons
(in games) by the amount of power supplied by the user.)

Not only does this ensure that computer users will be among the fittest people
on the planet (doing aerobic exercise for 8 hours a day), it would eliminate
the need to use fossil fuels to power computer systems, monitors, etc.

Of course, it would require waterproof printouts.  But on the other hand, this
ensures that long meetings of the programming staff would be a thing of the
past....

Electronic Frontier Foundation Statement on FBI Draft Digital Telephony Bill

        EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital
Telephony" bill.  After initial analysis, we strongly condemn bill, which
would require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to
law enforcement agencies, in real time, both the contents of all
communications on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional
information.  

        In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National
Information Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be
used by law enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image
is not hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks.

        Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to
maintain status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological
changes, in fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools. 
Among the new powers given to law enforcement are:

1. Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
monitor individuals in real time.

        The bill would require common carrier network (telephone companies
and anyone who plans to get into the telephone business, such as cable TV
companies) to deliver, in real time, so called "call setup information." 
In the simplest case, call setup information is a list of phone numbers
dialed by a given telephone currently under surveillance.  As we all come
to use electronic communications for more and more purposes, however, this
simple call setup information could also reveal what movies we've order,
which online information services we've connected to, which political
bulletin boards we've dialed, etc. With increasing use of
telecommunications, this simple transactional information reveals almost as
much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally
followed us around on the street, watching our every move.

        We are all especially vulnerable to this kind of surveillance,
because, unlike wiretapping the *content* of our communications, it is
quite easy for law enforcement to get permission to obtain this
transactional information.  Whereas courts scrutinize wiretap requests very
carefully, authorizations for access to call setup information are
routinely granted with no substantive review.  Some federal agencies, such
as the IRS, even have the power to issue administrative subpoenas on their
own, without appearing before a court.  

        The real impact of the FBI proposal turns, in part, on the fact
that it is easy to obtain court approval for seizing transactional data.

       The change from existing law contained in the FBI proposal is that
carriers would have to deliver this call setup information *in real time*,
directly to a remote listening post designated by law enforcement.  Today,
the government can obtain this information, but generally has to install a
device (called a 'pen register') which is monitored manually at the
telephone company switching office.

2. Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
movements.

        The bill requires that carriers be able to deliver either the
contents or transactional information associated with any subscriber, even
if that person is moving around from place to place with a cellular or PCS
phone.  It is conceivable that law enforcement could use the signalling
information to identify that location of a target, whether that person is
the subject of a wiretap order, or merely a subpoena for call setup
information.

        This provision takes a major step beyond current law in that it
allows for a tap and/or trace on a *person*, as opposed to mere
surveillance of a telephone line.

3. Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
Internet, online information services, and BBSs.

        The privacy of electronic communications services such as
electronic mail is also put at grave risk.  Today, a court order is
required under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to obtain the
contents of electronic mail, for example.  Those ECPA provisions would
still apply for the contents of such messages, but the FBI bill suggests
that common carriers might be responsible for delivering the addressing
information associated with electronic mail and other electronic
communications.  For example, if a user connects to the Internet over local
telephone lines, law enforcement might be able to demand from the telephone
company information about where the user sent messages, and into which
remote systems that user connects.  All of this information could be
obtained by law enforcement without every receiving a wiretap order.

4. The power to shut down non-compliant networks

        Finally, the bill proposes that the Attorney General have the power
to shut down any common carrier service that fails to comply with all of
these requirements.  Some have already called this the "war powers"
provision.  Granting the Department of Justice such control over our
nation's communications infrastructure is a serious threat to our First
Amendment right to send and receive information, free from undue government
intrusion.

The Bank of Stockton (California) accidentally turned Mohammed Idrees Kussair's
deposit of $100,000 into $1M.  He assumed that a relative in Pakistan must have
wired the money to him, and spent it to pay off rental properties and to take a
trip to Pakistan.  A San Joaquin County Superior judge ruled that he had not
broken any laws, and cleared him of criminal charges.  A spokesman for the bank
said that the bank intends to sue him.  [Source: An AP item in the San

Quoting from the Feb. 24 News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois:

"UI student arrested for e-mail threat to Clinton"

     URBANA -- A University of Illinois student has been arrested for
threatening the life of President Clinton, U.S. Attorney Frances Hulin
announced today.
     Christopher James Reincke, 18, of Townsend Hall, Urbana, allegedly
sent an electronic mail message to the White House on Dec. 4 threatening
Clinton, Hulin stated in a press release.
     The message read: "I am curious, Bill, how would you feel about being
the first president to be killed on the same day as his wife ...  It would
be best, I think, to not continue with your immediate plans.  Perhaps a
vacation.  You will die soon.  You can run, but you cannot hide."
     The message was signed "Overlord" and purported to be from
"Allmighty@Never.Gonna.Catch.Me."
     Reincke appeared before U.S. District Judge Harold A. Baker in
Danville today and was released on his own recognizance.
     Hulin said the charge resulted from an investigation by the Secret
Service and the UI police.
     Investigators determined the message originated at the UI, and a
computer trace identified Reincke as the apparent author, Hulin said.
     While being questioned by agents, Reincke admitted he had sent the
message, according to the press release.


(Local news reports suggest that the student intended this to be a
practical joke.  As I see it, the risk is in assuming that it doesn't
really matter what you say by email.)

Denver Post, p. 1C, Feb. 25, 1994

A former employee of a Boulder [Colorado] computer software company was
arrested yesterday for fraudulently transferring 122 computer files worth
$915,000 just before leaving his ex-employer, the FBI said in Denver federal
court documents.  Liaosheng Wang, also known as Andrew Wang, of Westminster,
was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly stealing the computer files,
including important "source code files," from Ellery Systems Inc., where he
worked as a design engineer from December 1990 until his resignation this
month.

In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Denver, FBI special agent John
Gedney said Wang may have stolen the files after twice being denied promotions
at the Boulder company late last month.  ...  Wang apparently transferred the
files from his account at Ellery Systems to Internet, a global computer
network, the complaint said.  From Internet, Wang was able to communicate from
his computer at Ellery Systems with a computer at Unidata Inc., a Denver
company.  [sic]

The FBI is continuing its investigation to determine if Wang was trying to
sabotage his former employer or transferred the information for a fee.
"Everything that was transferred was confidential property," said Jeff Jordan,
an Ellery vice president.  "It was the source code for our product and we
intend to get it back."  [...]

Geoffrey Shaw, Ellery Systems' chief executive officer, told the FBI that Wang
had no authority to transfer the files to Unidata, particularly since they
contained a proprietary program that had been copyrighted.

If convicted of wire fraud, Wang could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison and fined up to $250,000.

After reading a recent RSISKS article about validating the Sizewell B PPS
software, I was struck by an idea: how about a bounty for inspecting
safety-critical software?

Here's the plan: the government organization which is purchasing the
safety-critical software publishes the specification, the entire source
code as delivered by private contractors, and technical documentation
on the hardware environment.  It then offers a bounty to any party
anywhere who demonstrates a logical error in the software.  The bounty
would be funded by reductions in money paid to the original contractors.

Finding a bug is much harder than demonstrating that one has found a bug.
Bounty hunters would have an incentive to deploy whatever technology they
found useful in finding errors.

Of late there have been quite a few articles in the RISK forum regarding
Smart/Reloadable Cards and issues surrounding their incipient risks.  The
impression (whether right or wrong) is that most readers (or respondents) are
not aware of the level of acceptance that this technology have outside of
North America.  While the potential risks of the cards are legion, I will not
attempt to address them at this point, but merely attempt to touch the tip of
iceberg and illustrate the impact having outside of North America.

The kind of chargeable card described in John Gray's item in RISK issue #49
has been available in Japan and some other parts of Asia for at least a year.
The cash the card is charged with can be spent at any retail outlet equipped
with a simple PoS-type terminal; and the card can be "re-loaded" with cash at
ATMs, by a simple transfer from a current or savings account held by the same
holder.

Both mag-stripe and embedded-chip versions of the card are in commercial use.
The embedded-chip versions are usually multi-function cards (i.e., they can be
used for other purposes as well as that of an electronic wallet).

Countries in which reloadable card programs (or pilot programs) exist include:
Singapore, Japan, France and South Africa. The cards used are mostly
embedded-chip cards, not mag-stripe based. These cash cards are loaded
electronically in machines similar to ATMs, by transfer from chequing or
savings accounts.

Cards can be used at any retailer with a reading device.  The reading device
deducts purchase price, issues a receipt, and shows the balance remaining on
the card.  Some of them (not all) are PIN-activated (RISK readers take note).
When the balance on the card is exhausted the card is taken back to the
issuing bank or a retail machine for replenishment.

In Japan, the use of the cards apparently has been growing quickly, there is
some political pressure to regulate the business, because it is seen as
cutting into the Bank of Japan's sole right to issue bank-notes. There is talk
of regulations to force issuers to deposit a specified percentage of the money
circulating on such cards with the central bank, or to charge a consumption
tax on such transactions, the money to go into a central fund which would
reimburse card-holders in case the issuing institution went belly-up.

The Japanese are fairly far along in terms of acceptance of the cards, some of
the applications are as follows:

  - NTT (the Japanese equivalent of AT&amp;T) is a large proponent of the use of
the cards for making pay phone calls.  They have found their usage quite
profitable as they have found that callers using such cards talk 20-40% longer
on the phone, maybe because they don't have to fumble for coins or replacement
cards.

  - Other Japanese retailers who accept such cards include the railways, buses
and taxis, car washes, highway toll booths, fast-food outlets and even
video-game arcades.

  - One of the last bastions in Japan to hold out against such cards gave in
not long ago.  You can now use them at Buddhist temples, to make donations.
An argument between religious and tax establishments now threatens. Temples
have been tax-exempt so far, but the tax authorities do not want to exempt
them from the consumption tax on the use of cards.
 
Another country which has launched a smart card scheme is Guatemala, no less.
The scheme in Guatemala is called Credisa, the card is called Elite, and the
launching bank is a new retail bank called MultiBanco.  The hardware and
software are being provided by GemPlus, the same (French) vendor who provided
the hardware for the French reloadable card pilot.

In Guatemala, I believe the major incentive for smart cards is the poor
telecomms infrastructure, which places limits on on-line authorization
capability.

	This article elaborates on part of the EFF statement issued last 
week concerning the FBI's proposed Digital Telephony wiretap bill.  The EFF
condemned the bill, which enlarges law enforcement powers of surveillance,
granted by wiretap laws, by adding tracking ability. Addressed herein is point
two of the EFF statement, concerning the surveillance of mobile communica-
tors, such as cellular phones, Personal Communications Services (PCS) and 
laptop computers.  PCS mobile phones create severe privacy risks for future
phone users, especially under the FBI's proposal; and these risks strongly
support the EFF's position.

	The FBI asserts that their proposal adapts existing wiretap laws to
account for emerging communications technologies.  Wiretap laws have not
adequately covered mobile communications, and the FBI is correct to assume
that some revisions will be necessary to adequately balance law enforcement
needs with the privacy rights of mobile phone users.  Their proposed
revisions, however, do not simply provide for wiretap; instead, the FBI seeks
to expand wiretap laws, allowing law enforcement officers to track the
signalling information of mobile communications users.

	The EFF believes that the FBI proposal would create an enormous hole 
in the privacy rights of individuals suspected of crimes.  Their statement
notes:
	It is conceivable that law enforcement could 
	use the signalling information to identify the
	location of a target.....This provision takes a 
	major step beyond current law in that it allows
	for a tap and/or trace on a *person*, as opposed
	to mere surveillance of a phone line.

	This fear is completely realistic.  It is not simply "conceivable"
that the FBI's proposal would allow law enforcement to surveil the location of
a target -- positioning technology is a planned part of PCS networks, one of
the technological advances anticipated by the proposal.  Similar positioning
technology is planned for cellular phones, as well.

	PCS advances cellular phone technology by integrating mobile
communications with other phone networks, and by expanding the services and
quality mobile phones can offer.  Most PCS proposals involve three forms of
mobility: terminal mobility, the ability to make and receive calls at any
location, and the ability of the phone network to track the location of the
mobile phone; personal mobility, the ability of the user to be reachable by a
single phone number at all times; and service mobility, the ability of the
user to access CLASS(sm)-like features, such as Call Waiting and Caller ID,
from any phone they use.

	The FBI proposal requires phone companies, when presented with a
wiretap order, to transmit the content and the signalling, or "call setup
information," from the tapped phone to law enforcement officers.  With a
wireline phone, such as a residence phone line, call setup information would
comprise only the originating and dialled phone numbers, as well as billing
information (such as the residence address) for the call.  Because of the
wireless aspect of PCS, however, call setup information for a PCS phone
includes very detailed information on the location and movement of the caller.

	PCS mobile phones will connect with the phone network via
"microcells," or very small receivers similar to those used for cellular
phones.  While a cellular network uses cells with up to an 8 to 10 mile
radius, PCS networks will use microcells located on every street corner and in
every building.  The call setup information for a PCS call would include the
microcell identifier -- a very specific means of locating the user.  An order
for a PCS wiretap would allow law enforcement officers to receive a detailed,
verifiable, continuous record of the location and movement of a mobile phone
user.

	These phones are also likely to "feature" automatic registration:
whenever the PCS mobile phone is on (in use or able to receive calls), it will
automatically register itself with the nearest microcell.  Law enforcement
agencies, able to track this registration, would have the equivalent of an
automatic, free, instantaneous, and undetectable global positioning locator
for anyone suspected of a crime.

	PCS tries to improve on cellular phone privacy and security by
incorporating cryptographic techniques.  Encryption could not only create a
secure phone conversation, but could also (coupled with use of a PIN number)
insure that only a valid subscriber could make calls on a particular phone,
preventing fraudulent calls on stolen phones.  An additional phone-to-network
authentication could prevent fraudulent calling through a "masquerade" phone
designed to simulate a user's registration.

	But the FBI proposal would require that such encryption be defeatable
in wiretap circumstances.  As the proposal stands, this form of weak
encryption is distinguishable from the Clipper Chip because the phone
companies, not a key escrow arrangement, enable law enforcement access; but it
is entirely possible that the Clipper Chip could be used as the encrypting
device.  In either circumstance, PCS encryption could be compromised by
careless or malicious law enforcement officials.  Perhaps it is time for Phil
Zimmerman and ViaCrypt to begin work on PGPCS -- and let us all hope we are so
lucky.

	The cellular phone market is tremendous, and analysts believe that the
PCS market, incorporating both voice and data communications, will be even
larger.  Coupled with the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal, PCS raises many
privacy and security risks, making the EFF's condemnation of the FBI proposal
all the more appropriate.

It just struck my irony bone that we have the Feds on the one hand wanting to
install leaks in encryption and communication switching; and we have the FCC
regulating things like PCs so they don't radiate interfering signals.  When
will FCC be ordered to "get with the program" and _require_ that PCs and
monitors radiate enough so the snoops can do their jobs?

	The contention that this is a Van Eck device is ludicrous! You don't
need to use radiated signals if you place a bugging device in the computer.
You simply listen to the information and transmit it over a normal radio
channel.

&gt; ... .  The device would work like this:

	This is not how Van Eck's mechanism worked.  It exploited the normal
radiated signals, not those created by a bugging device.

&gt; I spoke to the FBI and US Attorney's Office about the technology used for 
&gt; this, and none of them would confirm or deny the technology used "on an 
&gt; active case."

	Now that's a journalistic confirmation if I ever heard one!

&gt; To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that the Government had
&gt; admitted the use of Van Eck (Tempest Busting etc.)  in public.  ...

	Since when is a refusal to comment an admission?

	If the point of the article is to assert that there are radiated
signals from video screens that can be used at a distance to observe the
content of the screens, of course there is.  If you want confirmation, why not
go and buy the 100 dollars of equipment required to do it yourself?

First of all, reception of a signal from computer screen is much easier than
it seems due to the fact that images are mostly static; i.e., the same pattern
of radiation will be repeated many times allowing for digital accumulation of
the signal (it works the same way for astronomers who are able to resolve very
dim objects by collecting "random" photons for a long time).  Interferometry
(i.e., simultaneous reception of the signal from several distant points and
multiplying the received signals delayed to compensate for the propagation
delays) can also be a very useful tool to sort out weak signal coming from a
single source with known location from random electromagnetic noise.

Also, cleaning up the signal using spectral analysis (FT, etc.) should work
great because the spectre of the source signal is discrete (i.e., all
frequencies are derived from a single stable oscillator's frequency by
dividing it by small integer numbers).

Add directed antennae or (even better) phased antennae arrays and you got the
picture...

It's nothing more than methods very well known in optical and radio astronomy
so the special services don't have to bother me :-)

It's time for someone to shout "Occam's Razor!"  If the FBI placed anything
"in" Ames' computer, it needn't have been anything as complicated as a
receiver that sucked keyboard strokes or video pixels out of the electronic
chaos that's inside a computer case.  A sophomore EE student could design a
high-impedance device to pluck video and keyboard signals directly off their
respective connectors and relay them onward.  Such a gadget would be much
simpler, and therefore more reliable than a Van Eck receiver.

On the other hand, the FBI could have simply copied the contents of Ames'
hard disk with something like LapLink.  They're (understandably) not talking.

&gt;On October 9, 1993, the FBI "placed an electronic monitor in his (Ames')
&gt;computer," suggesting that a Van Eck receiver and transmitter was used
&gt;to gather information on a real-time basis.

I don't know about you, but if I were able to stick a bug inside the computer,
I'd attach it directly to the keyboard and video ports.  Why fool around
trying to reconstruct a signal, when a wire containing the signal itself is
half an inch away?

Do we have here a risk of technophilia?  Even if I couldn't get inside the
house, it's quite possible that a conventional camera looking through a window
could see enough of the the screen and keyboard to gather useful information.

A case recently came up in Washington State that is related to the question of
the legality of using Van Eck radiation emitted from a residence as a
survelience technique.

In the incident in question, a person was suspected of growing marijuana in
his home, using grow lights.  However, there was insufficient evidence to get
probable cause for a search warrant.  So, without a warrant, the police stood
in the street and used an IR detector on the house.  They determined that the
house was emitting radiation that was consistent with grow lights, and used
this evidence as probable cause to get a search warrant.  In the ensuing
search, the house was found to contain marijuana and the homeowner was
convicted.

He appealed his conviction on the grounds that the use of the IR detector
constituted a search of his home, for which a warrant was required; evidence
from this illegal search could not be used as probable cause for a warrant.
The Washington State Supreme court agreed with the defendant, ruled the search
illegal and overturned his conviction.  They said that non-visible radiation
emanating from a home is not the same as, say, leaving a window open, and that
a reasonable expectation of privacy existed for such radiation.

I would imagine that this legal precident would also preclude the use of Van
Eck radiation detectors in the state of Washington without a search warrant.
Of course, in the Ames case such a warrant almost certainly had already been
obtained based on other probable cause, and so this wouldn't be a valid
defence for Ames.

&gt;The Bank of Stockton (California) accidentally turned Mohammed Idrees 
&gt;Kussair's deposit of $100,000 into $1M.  ...

Did the bank say why they converted $100,000 to $1,000,000? Could it be due to
the following: in India &amp; Pakistan the placement of commas on large numbers is
different from the west. The power-of-ten table and their names are shown
below:

	ten             10
	hundred         100
	thousand        1000
	ten thousand    10,000
	one lakh        1,00,000
	ten lakhs       10,00,000
	one crore       1,00,00,000

Could he have deposited a check which was made out for $1,00,000 but got
`corrected' by the bank because an `obvious' error was made in the number of
zeroes.

Just a wild guess...  Raju Varghese  raju@inso.pr.net.ch

&gt;From the Washington Post newswire, 17 February 1994, via Executive News
Service (GO ENS) on CompuServe:

"Break-Ins Prompt A Search for Better Computer Security 
 By John Burgess, Washington Post Staff Writer 
  
    Since the dawn of the electronic age, the computer password has been a
trusted guardian of secrets large and small.  For many people, obtaining their
own password became a rite of initiation into computer culture itself.  Now,
growing numbers of security experts feel that the password in its common form
is too old and unsophisticated for the job."

The author continues with the following key points:

o    The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) is now arguing for a change to
     alternative methods of identification and authentication (I&amp;A).

o    Proposals include hand-held one-time password generators and smart cards.

o    Concern is growing over the practice of sending cleartext passwords
     through unencrypted communications channels.

o    Trojan Horse programs can capture unencrypted passwords and store them
     for misuse by criminal hackers.

o    The most recent attack described in a CERT-CC (Computer Emergency
     Response Team Coordination Center) Advisory involved a Trojan.

o    There is as yet no evidence of widespread use of the captured passwords.

o    Another approach to I&amp;A is the challenge-response system, in which
     the computer logging on to another system has to perform calculations
     based on data and algorithms stored on the client and the server machines.

o    Other methods focus on biometric I&amp;A.

o    In general, current use of passwords needs to be improved: users
     should select passwords with strong random components to prevent
     dictionary attacks and should guard their passwords closely against
     inadvertent or deliberate disclosure.

'Biometrics' refers to the use of physical charactersistics as identification.
Human beings use this in that when we see a friend, we identify them by face,
size, hair color, etc.  Changes in Biometric data usually return an
identification when positive ("Are you losing weight?", "Gee your hair looks
teriffic") while negative changes are usually not stated publicly ("I see he's
getting married, but his bride-to-be looks somewhat plumper than before;
perhaps they _had_ to...").

However, when someone else needs to identify you and doesn't know you, they
usually have to rely on authentication.  Usual forms of authentication are
various forms of paper, photographic/multimedia, and/or magnetic
authentication issued by a government or trusted third-party.

With the increased sophistication of duplicating equipment, relyance on
documentary authentication is becoming unreliable.  Witness the fact that
anyone giving out a social security number is presumed to be the holder of
that number.  When they aren't, the actual holder is usually chagrinned to
find out how much expense and damage they have to suffer to rectify the
situation.

With this, various organizations are working on means of real-time automatic
biometric identification of individuals.  The implications of this can be both
good and bad.  As the actual article is rather complicated, I'll summarize it
in a separate article here.

The dangers to people is that if, for example, biometric photographic
measurements are used, that real-time tracking of people could be done as the
technology gets cheaper.  Further, you may never even know that you've been
tracked unless and until something happens that it comes to your attention.

What does the Aldrich Ames Spy Case mean about Clipper? In an earlier posting,
I thought it just proved that people could be bought and this meant that the
Clipper escrow keys weren't that safe.

Yesterday, I spoke with a Clipper Fan who said that Ames was an isolated case
and Ames wouldn't have a need-to-know about Clipper keys. I'm not so sure.

The fact is that someone in Ames's position would be one of the first people
who would need access to the Clipper keys. The Department of Justice and other
parts of the government have already placed large orders for the Clipper
capable phones. The anti-US government spies would be operating in this arena.
This is precisely where Ames should have been looking for spies to counter. If
everyone at the DOJ and the FBI is going to be using Clipper, then Ames would
be one of the first with a need-to-know.

The private sector response is much cooler and local cops will probably go
years before needing access to Clipper keys.

Now consider another important fact. The Escrow Key Kops won't have a list
matching names with Clipper Chip ID numbers in order to prevent them from
abusing their keylist.  (Memo to NIST: Don't measure response time to tap
requests in Keystones.) They won't be able to tell if a spy in Ames position
is asking for the Clipper Key to some long sought after mole or the target
dictated by his foreign masters. Such a spy could have complete and total
access to any Clipper-protected conversation they wanted.

People designing the Clipper system must not only consider the security of the
two Escrow Key Centers, but they must also look at who gets access to the
keys. This is going to be the weak link and if Clipper becomes standard there
will be plenty of potential weak links around.

In a recent editorial, Dr. Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University argued in
support of the U.S. government's proposed Clipper Chip, a security device that
would allow law enforcement to decipher the communications of users of such
devices.

Dr. Denning attempts to argue that Clipper is necessary for law enforcement
agencies to be able to do their job.  I'm not going to argue that one; there
are plenty of people who can argue that compromising privacy for all citizens
in order 	to aid law enforcement is a bad idea more effectively than I,
particularly in the Clipper case, where the arguments from law enforcement are
dubious at best.  (The current justification is inadequate; there may be
better reasons, from a law enforcement perspective, but we haven't heard them
yet.)

Without doubt, law enforcement and intelligence are huge stakeholders in the
debate over encryption. But every individual and corporation in the U.S. must
be included as well. Are NSA's actions really in the best interests of all the
stakeholders? Are there alternatives to the current key escrow program?

If one steps back and looks at what has happened over the last few years, one
might well question the approaches, if not the motivation.  (I believe it may
even be possible to conclude that Clipper is the visible portion of a
large-scale covert operation on U.S. soil by the National Security Agency.)
Over a number of years, through their subversion of the Commerce Department
(who should be championing the causes of U.S.  industry, not the intelligence
agencies), NSA has managed to put many U.S. government resources normally
beyond their control, both legally and practically, to work on their program
of making U.S. and international communications accessible.

The first step was the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) between NIST NSA.
This document appears to contravene the provisions of the Computer Security
Act of 1987, the intent of which was to give NIST control over
standards-making for the unclassified government and commercial sectors.  The
MOU essentially gave NSA a veto over any proposals for crypto standards by
NIST.

By using the standards making authority of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), NSA is attempting to force the entire U.S.  government
to purchase Clipper equipment since only NIST-standard equipment may be
purchased by government agencies. This purchasing power can then be used to
force U.S. manufacturers to build Clipper products or risk losing government
business.  (GSA is currently questioning NSA's authority to control
government-wide procurement, and should continue to do so.)  This of course
not only subsidizes Clipper products, but could make Clipper a de facto
standard if the costs associated with alternatives are too high.  These costs
to industry, of ignoring Clipper, come in the form of lost government market
share, costly support for multiple versions of incompatible products, and
non-exportability of non-Clipper products.

It also appears that NSA is desperately seeking a digital signature standard
that would force users to take that signature capability wrapped up with a
Clipper chip.  If this is the case, as it appears to be, then NSA has is
trying to use what is probably the most powerful business tool of the
information age as a means to deny us its benefits unless we subsidize and
accept Clipper in the process.  This would, if true, be an unprecedented abuse
of government power to influence U.S.  industry and control individual
privacy.  (Clipper is part of a chip called Capstone, which is where their
proposed digital signature standard would be used.)

The overall cost of these policies is unknown.  We only know that NSA has
spent a considerable amount of money on the program directly.  Other costs are
not so obvious. They are:

* A burdened U.S. industry, which will have to build multiple products
  or more expensive products that support multiple techniques;

* A low-intensity "trade war" with the rest of the world over
  encryption;

* Lost sales to U.S. companies, since international buyers will surely go to
  non-U.S. suppliers for non- Clipper encryption, as may buyers in the U.S.;

* Potential abuses by government and loss of privacy for all citizens.

Does NSA truly believe they can displace other methods with Clipper?  With
over three million RSA products, the technology they feel threatened by, in
use in the U.S. today? Not likely; therefore, they have already decided that
these costs are acceptable even if they only delay the inevitable, and that
U.S. industry and U.S. taxpayers should bear these costs, whatever they are.
This policy was apparently developed by unelected people who operate without
oversight or accountability.  Does the White House really support this policy?
(Does this all sound familiar?)

It has been rumored that NSA will gain support from foreign governments for
escrow technology, especially if "local control" is provided.  Even if NSA can
convince their sister organizations around the world to support key escrow (by
offering Clipper technology with a do-your-own-escrow option), will these
other governments succeed in selling it to their industry and citizens?  Most
countries around the world have much stronger privacy laws and a longer
history of individual privacy than the U.S.

WHY AGAIN WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME?

Many seem to have forgotten or are not aware that the Clipper program is not
new, and it's also not the first time NSA has attempted to force
communications security on U.S. industry that it could compromise.  In the
mid-80's, NSA introduced a program called the Commercial COMSEC Endorsement
Program, or CCEP. CCEP was essentially Clipper in a black box, since the
technology was not sufficiently advanced to build lower-cost chips.  Vendors
would join CCEP (with the proper security clearances) and be authorized to
incorporate classified algorithms into communications systems.  NSA had
proposed that they themselves would actually provide the keys to end-users of
such systems.  The new twist is access by key escrow.

To see how little things have changed, consider this quote: "...RSA Data
Security, Inc.  asserts that since CCEP-2 is not published and therefore
cannot be inspected by third parties, the NSA could put a 'trap door' in the
algorithm that would enable the agency to inspect information transmitted by
the private sector.  When contacted, NSA representative Cynthia Beck said that
it was the agency's policy not to comment on such matters."  That was in 1987.
("The Federal Snags in Encryption Technology," Computer and Communications
Decisions, July 1987, pp.  58-60.)

To understand NSA's thinking, and the danger of their policies, consider the
reply of a senior NSA official when he was asked by a reporter for the Wall
Street Journal if NSA, through the CCEP program, could read anyone's
communications: "Technically, if someone bought our device and we made the
keys and made a copy, sure we could listen in. But we have better things to do
with our time." (The Wall Street Journal, March 28, 1988, page 1, column 1, "A
Supersecret Agency Finds Selling Secrecy to Others Isn't Easy," by Bob Davis.)
Another NSA official, in the same Journal story, said "The American Public has
no problem with relying on us to provide the technology that prevents the
unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons. If you trust us to protect against
that, you can trust us to protect private records."  Remember that the Cold
War was still on at that time.  Maybe they're not so busy today.

Law enforcement and intelligence gathering are certainly impeded by the use of
cryptography.  There are certainly legitimate concerns that these interests
have.  But is the current approach really the way to gain support?  People
with a strong military and intelligence bias are making all the decisions.
There seem to be better ways to strike a balance.

AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL

One approach would be to have NIST develop a standard with three levels.  The
first level could specify the use of public-key for key management and
signatures without any key escrow.  There could be a "Level II" compliance
that adds government key escrow to message preparation.  "Level III" could be
key escrow controlled by the user, typically a corporation.  Would this work?
The first level, meeting the standard by itself, would back up the
government's claim that key escrow is voluntary; if I want privacy and
authentication without key escrow, then I can have it, as the government has
claimed I can.  Actions speak louder than words.

Why would any vendors support Level II?  They would find a market in the
government. (I would certainly like our public servants to use key escrow,
just as I want work product paid for by my corporation to be accessible.)  So
the government can still influence the private sector by buying only products
that include Level II compliance. Also, Level II products would be
decontrolled for export. The market can decide; vendors will do what their
customers tell them to.  This satisfies the obvious desire on the part of the
government to influence what happens, as a consumer.

Level III would allow any user to insert escrow keys they control into the
process.  (Level II would not be a prerequisite to Level III.) My company may
want key escrow; I, as an individual, may want to escrow my keys with my
attorney or family members; a standard supporting these functions would be
useful.  I don't necessarily want or need the government involved.

NIST already knows how to write a FIPS that describes software and hardware
implementations, and to certify that implementations are correct.

This approach certainly isn't perfect, but if the administration really
believes what it says and means it, then I submit that this is an improvement
over a single key escrow FIPS foisted on everyone by NSA, and would stand a
much better chance of striking a workable balance between the needs of the
government and the right of individuals to privacy.  Therefore, it RISKS much
less than the current plan.

The real problem with the way NSA works is that we don't find out what they're
really doing and planning for decades, even when they're wrong.  What if they
are?

In the 60's and 70's, the CIA was out of control, and the Congress, after
extensive hearings that detailed some of the abuses of power by the CIA,
finally moved to force more accountability and oversight.  In the 80's and
90's, NSA's activities should be equally scrutinized by a concerned Congress.

Dear Patent Commissioner,

I object to the existence of software patents.  I object for many reasons, but
an argument you may not have heard before is that computer algorithms do not
have clear boundaries.  Thus it is not possible, or not feasible, to prove
that a particular software product has not used some algorithm which has been
patented.  This problem is due to the very nature of software, so I feel that
patents should not apply to software.

It is somewhat difficult to express this concept clearly, but consider this:

A mechanical device, made of metal, has hard surfaces.  There are clearly
defined boundaries between metal parts.  It is clear where one device stops
and another starts in physical space - or at least one can take a machine
apart to determine this.

Thus one can examine a machine for patent violation by taking it apart and
looking at the pieces.

This is not always the case with software.  Computer programs are usually
implemented as some sort of "virtual machine", in which mechanistic concepts
are used to guide the construction of the software, but computer programs have
the peculiar property of having no boundaries.  (Or, if you prefer, soft and
penetrable boundaries.)

This is a problem for software reliability, for example: any line in a
computer program has the capacity to reach out and destroy any other line.
Thus software programs are inherently unreliable. [1] If this could happen in
a mechanical system, a poorly molded windshield wiper might reach into the
engine and throw a piston rod.  This does not happen to mechanical systems,
but it is a daily problem in my work as a programmer.

Now, suppose I devise an algorithm, let us call it A.  The source code that
implements the algorithm looks like this:

A-line-1
A-line-2
A-line-3
A-line-4

and so on.  Suppose also someone has patented an algorithm B.  He might examine
my source and find that his algorithm can be expressed within my source code
as:

A-line-1
B-line-1
A-line-3
B-line-2

Thus I would expose myself to a lawsuit by writing this code.  In this small
example it could be obvious that I have used someone's patented work... but
suppose my program consisted of 100,000 lines of extremely convoluted code:

A-line-1
...
A-line-9 999
B-line-1
A-line-10 001
...
A-line-90 000
B-line-2

In this case it would be very difficult for any normal human being to know
that the algorithm has been used.  Certainly this could not be done within the
time constraints usually placed on commercial software development.  If the
source code were revealed to a team of engineers and attorneys in a lawsuit,
with this engineers solely focused on finding patent violations, this patent
violation could be detected.  Thus any normal commercial development effort is
quite at risk to patent lawsuits.

There are other ways in which this could happen.  I will elaborate if the
Patent and Trademark Office is interested in further information.

This is in relation to the recent article in RISKS by Ross Anderson.  He
described the case of John Munden, an English police constable who complained
of unauthorized transactions appearing on his bank statement and (without any
other real evidence) was tried and convicted of ATM fraud.

I was sufficiently outraged to (as Ross suggested) send a letter to the Chief
Constable of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary, expressing my deep concern.

I enclosed a copy of the RISKS report and stated that my opinion was based on
this information.

Here is the reply I received today, dated 18 February 1994:

    Dear Sir,

    I acknowledge receipt of your letter concerning the case of
    Police Constable John Munden who was recently convicted of
    obtaining money by deception from the Halifax Building Society.

    The investigation into the allegations made against Police
    Constable Munden was carried out by members of the Suffolk
    Constabulary, and the prosecution was undertaken by the Crown
    Prosecution Service for the Suffolk Area.  In view of this I
    have forwarded your letter to the Deputy Chief Constable of
    the Suffolk Constabulary for his information and the information
    of the Crown Prosecution Service.

    Any action taken against Police Constable Munden in relation to
    his conviction will be made under the Police (Discipline)
    Regulations 1985, which instruct all Chief Officers on breaches
    of the Discipline Code and the scope of punishments intended
    for such a breach.

    Yours faithfully,

    D. R. Winser
    A/Deputy Chief Constable

Rob Hasker wrote in <A HREF="/Risks/15.60.html">RISKS-15.60</A>, concerning an E-mail threat to the life of
the US President:

&gt; (Local news reports suggest that the student intended this to be a
&gt; practical joke.  As I see it, the risk is in assuming that it doesn't
&gt; really matter what you say by e-mail.)

It may be premature to assign a RISK, since one doesn't yet know any motive.
But there is a prima facie argument against Hasker's suggestion of prime RISK,
which is that if it doesn't matter what's said in email, then one might as
well send it in the clear. And Reincke didn't.

It seems that Reincke intended either (a) to confuse the audit trail, or (b)
to give others the impression he was trying to confuse the audit trail.  If
(a), then it shows the risks involved in using a traceable fake; if (b), maybe
he wanted to get caught and prosecuted (this is a known characteristic of some
of those who engage in criminal activity of various sorts), and succeeded in
doing exactly what he tried to do - in which case there seems to have been no
computer-related RISK at all to him!

&gt; Here's the [suggestion]: the government organization which is purchasing the
&gt; safety-critical software publishes the specification, the entire source
&gt; code as delivered by private contractors, and technical documentation
&gt; on the hardware environment.  It then offers a bounty to any party
&gt; anywhere who demonstrates a logical error in the software.

Data exist (there's apparently a JPL study) to support the assertion that in
safety-critical software, many more errors are usually to be found in the
requirements specification itself than in the match between the delivered
software/hardware and the requirements spec. If this is correct, information
delivered to the public according to Chastain's suggestion would need to be
supplemented by information enabling the requirements spec itself to be
critiqued. Documentation on the hardware environment is unlikely to be
sufficient by itself. I have only the usual numerous and incomplete
suggestions as to what the extra needed info could be.

However, there are examples in which Chastain's suggestion, unsupplemented,
could have helped.  Consider the September 1993 A320 accident in Warsaw.
Inspection of the requirements (in this case, simply the info contained in the
Pilot's Operating Handbook) reveals the design that fatally inhibited
deployment of the braking systems after the plane had landed.

The 3/3/94 New York Times includes a long, fascinating article on recent
trends in cigarette advertising, away from mass media like billboards 
and magazines and toward database-oriented marketing based on promotions.  
The full reference is: 

  Allen R. Myerson, Selling cigarettes: Who needs ads?, New York Times,
  3 March 1994, pages C1, C5 (business section).

Here are two paragraphs from the middle of the article:

  ... Philip Morris marketers boast that the Adventure Team promotion and
  a carefully calculated price cut restored Marlboro's share of the $42
  billion cigarette market from 22 percent last March to nearly 27 percent
  in January, widening its lead over all other brands.  Flush with the
  names and addresses of their new customers, they are planning their next
  campaign.

  Over at R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris' major rival, marketers pride
  themselves on computerized data banks so huge and detailed that they
  can go far beyond merely aiming their discount coupons and Camel Cash
  merchandise offers at the less than one-quarter of Americans who smoke.
  They can choose not just smokers of competing brands, but those who
  smoke brands with price, taste and image most like those of Camels, for
  example.  In fact, Reynolds can select from that last group just those
  smokers who would gladly switch, for a few pennies a pack, or perhaps an
  ashtray or cap.

These trends have the virtue that non-smokers get exposed to less cigarette
advertising, thus lessening the force of claims that such advertising is
recruits new smokers rather than getting existing smokers to switch brands.
On the other hand, mass cigarette advertising (such as glossy booklets urging
folks to "Get More Gear") is not going away; indeed it is an integral part 
of the new strategy.  Finally, and most importantly for Risks, the cigarette
companies' increasingly personalized connections to their customers may
inhibit smokers' attempts to end their addictions, since they will now be
exposed to ever-more-customized stimuli encouraging them, if only implicitly,
to continue smoking.  This is only speculation, of course, but it's an
important test case for the social implications of data-intensive one-to-one
marketing, and it should be watched closely.

In a 16 Feb 1994 letter from The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Henry Fogel,
Exec. VP describes a "computer error".  It seems that all American Express
charges for tickets and contributions since 1991 were re-submitted.
Considering my seats cost nearly $100 each, this could represent a significant
amount of money.  The letter does not identify which party (Amex or the CSO)
caused the error.

The letter says, "Charges for these items will appear again on your next
statement...", and continues, "In most cases, these charges will also be
removed on the same statement."

The risks include:

  Transaction systems that don't range check their input (shouldn't 
  charge dates have to be somewhat current?).

  Automated postings that aren't tied out to an independent check 
  (Wow, sales were up 3,700% this month!).

In the Feb 94 "Advanced Imaging" magazine, there is a discussion of how video
cameras (from above, preferably, for contrast and occlusion reasons) are being
deployed with machine vision systems in malls.  The stated purpose is to
measure people flow, to learn about buyer behavior.  Sort of like machine
vision applications for traffic flow monitoring.  There is mention of
secondary sensors causing cameras and vision systems to "orient" [my
interpretation] towards some situation.

In the same issue there's an unrelated advert for something called an
"imputer" which is a white palm-sized box with a lens.  (Looks like an
aperture of about a cm.) Next to it is the circuit board presumably within the
white box.  It contains 4 chips: an imaging chip and a microcontroller among
them. One of the chips is socketed.  You can develop algorithms on your
desktop machine and then load them onboard, it seems.  And have your own
standalone motion-interpretation system.

I was on one of the few aircraft to land in the Boston blizzard today. There
was zero visibility. When we hit the runway (ouch!), the plane veered back and
forth, slipping on the ice, apparently working differential thrust.

After we landed, the pilot said "in case anybody is interested, you are in one
of the few Northwest Airbus 320's capable of landing itself, which it just
did."

And I thought, "oh, wow."

And I wondered which would have been RISKier: landing on autopilot, or landing
on human pilot.

This is the headline of article in the 3/3/94 Boston Globe on the front page
of an inside Metro/Region section.

  For most parents, the thought of their child sitting in a bedroom and
  skillfully using a computer is a source of comfort and pride"
 
  Increasingly, however, the home computer has become a source of danger, as
  manipulative child molesters reach out to unsuspecting children through
  thousands of interactive and easy-to-use computer bulletin board systems."

... The news article triggering this discussion article is:
 
  A 23-year-old Chelmsford [Mass] man pleaded not guilty to an attempted
  kidnapping charge after he allegedly used a computer bulletin board to
  attempt to coax a teen-ager into helping him abduct a young boy for sexual
  purposes

The article goes on to explain BBS systems and how they allow impersonal
contact between juveniles and child molesters. Law enforcement officials in
Massachusetts have been concentrating upon (and getting publicity) for
investigating computer assisted child-abuse. There have been several other
charges, and in 1992 a Cambridge man pleaded guilty to raping two boys who he
met through a BBS.

In Amnesty International's Freedom Writers list for February 1993, one of the
letters is to the Cuban Government on behalf of Luis Grave de Peralta Morrell
and 3 other scientists.  They were convicted in February 1992 of various
charges and given sentences which varied from 8 to 13 years.

Evidence against them included a book written by Luis Grave de Peralta which
criticized the Cuban Government.  Earlier, he had lost his position as
professor of physics at the University of Oriente after resigning from the
Cuban Communist Party.

One of the charges against them was "that the four had been trying to spread a
computer virus."  Amnesty International claims that no clear proof of this was
offered during the trial.  Does anyone have more details on this?  What kind
of virus were these individuals supposedly trying to spread?

The RISK?  I suppose that if a totalitarian government is out to get you, they
will use any possible charge against you, including computer-related ones.

In an article on the cover of the February 10, 1994 {Washington Technology}
magazine of the same name, talks about a specialized use of biometrical
information (specific details unique to a person like size, etc.) to identify
them.

The idea behind this is that in an airport, an infrared camera is mounted near
the arriving passengers section, taking pictures of every person who is
passing through the facility.  This captures the 'aura' or underlying facial
vascular system (pattern of blood vessels and such).  In 1/30 of one second,
it captures the data and forwards it via high-speed data lines to an FBI
database that has stored auras of the worlds most-wanted criminals and
terrorists, then matches generate an order to nab a suspect, supposedly
producing "a piece of evidence that is as rock-solid as any presented to a
court."

Currently, infrared cameras are being attached to desktop computers to create
digitized thermograms of people's faces in 1/30 of a second.  The company that
is working on this technology, Betae Corp, an Alexandria, VA government
contractor, claims that the aura is unique for every single person.  The
photos in the front of the article show two clearly different thermographic
images that are claimed to be from identical twins.

The facial print does not change over time (and would allegedly require very
deep plastic surgery to change it), retains the same basic patterns regardless
of the person's health, and can be captured without the person's
participation.  The technology will have to show it is a better choice than
current biometric techniques such as retinagrams (eye photographs, voice
prints and the digital fingerprint.

A Publicity-Shy Reston, VA company called Mikos holds the patent for certain
technology uses of this concept.  Dave Evans of Betac who has obtained certain
"non exclusive" rights in the technology claims that "thermograms are the only
technology he has seen in his more than two decades of security work that meet
the five major criteria of an ideal identification system: They are unique for
every individual, including identical twins; they identify individuals without
their knowing participation; they perform IDs on the fly; they are
invulnerable to counterfeiting or disguises; they remain reliable no matter
the subject's health or age," the article said.  Only retinal photos are
equivalent, but potential assassins aren't likely to cooperate in using them.

Right now it takes about 2-4K per thermograph, (it says '2-4K of computer
memory' but I suspect they mean disk space) and that's not really a problem
for a PC-Based system of 2000 or so people going to and from a building; it's
another magnitude of hardware to handle millions of aircraft travelers in
airports.  Also, infrared cameras are not cheap, in the $35,000 to $70,000
range, which, for the moment is likely to keep small law enforcement
facilities from thermographing all persons arrested the way all persons
arrested are routinely fingerprinted.  But we can expect the price to come
down in the future.

The writer apparently had to agree with Evans not to raise privacy and
security issues in the article, it says, since first they have to show the
technology works.  But even it raised questions:

- The technology could be a powerful weapon in a "big brother" arsenal, 
  with cameras in front of many stores and street corners, scanning for
  criminals or anyone on the government's watch list?
- Does the government have the right to randomly photograph people for
  matching them against a criminal database?
- What guarantees do we have that thermographs are actually unique for
  every person, or that the system is foolproof?
- What is the potential for blackmail, with thermographs to prove people
  were in compromising places and positions?

There are also my own points.

- While this can be used to protect nuclear power plants against 
  infiltration by terrorists (as one example it gives), what is to stop it,
  for example, to be used to find (and silence or eliminate) critics and
  dissidents?  I wouldn't give China 30 seconds before it would use 
  something like this to capture critics such as the victims of Tianamen 
  Square. 

- Long history indicates that better technology is not used to improve 
  capture of criminals who violate the lives and property of other private
  parties, it is used to go after whatever group the government opposes.
  That's why people who defend themselves with guns against armed
  criminals in places where gun controls are in effect, can expect to
  be treated harsher than the criminal would have been.  Existence of
  criminals supports the need for more police and more police-state laws;
  defending oneself against criminals shows the ineffectiveness of those
  laws.

Last night there was a news report on our local KABC affiliate about a man who
had been arrested at a local bank for wandering around the parking lot in the
area of the automatic teller machine and acting very suspiciously.  Evidently
a bank patron thought this odd and flagged down a passing police officer. In a
search of the suspect's van that followed, a few hundred blank ATM cards were
found as well as nearly $5,000 in twenty dollar bills. The man had apparently
been "shoulder surfing," the act of peering across the shoulder of an ATM
client to garner their PIN number as it is entered. Such a surfer then
acquires discarded transaction slips in the region of the ATM, matches the
transaction time up with the acquired PIN, programmes a card, and with- draws
a good chunk of money.

Yes, this is nothing new. But where the TV reporter had an excellent
opportunity to remind viewers to _always keep your transaction receipt_
(throwing it away at home if you have to) they neglected to. Instead, I was
presented with a number of interviews with patrons explaining the various
methods they used to conceal their PIN entry actions (my favorite was a woman
who explained that she could type it so fast, nobody could ever see it.)

Great. Another chance to bring the general public up to speed lost in poor
journalism. Maybe all news services should have a RISKs reader on staff?

The RISKS of sending credit card numbers (and other such information) over the
Internet are well known in this group, so I won't rehash it.

I recently received an inquiry from the organizer of an upcoming conference
about the security ramifications of accepting electronic registration.  They
want people to upload (into their World Wide Web server) the registration
data, including a credit card number.  The data is then processed and the
information (including the credit card number) is e-mailed to the registration
agent.  The person who made the inquiry had a suspicion that all of this
electronic traffic might have some security implications, but wasn't sure.

The point of this note is that even though readers of *this* forum know the
RISKS, as more and more people join the Internet we need to deal with
education.  If the Internet community doesn't warn people of the do's and
don'ts, the Internet will get a black eye when the inevitable fraud occurs.

IMHO passwords have been used since before the Roman empire and their
effectiveness has only gotten worse - back then they were changed daily.

I have been using tokens for nearly five years now &amp; a couple of years ago
wondered (both publicly and in print) why, instead of using the token's output
for authentication, it was not used as the seed for autoigniting encryption
since both sides had the result and it had never passed on the line. Since
most token's responses are seven bytes long, DES seemed to be a natural that
was well documented.

The fact that you could communicate would authenticate both ends of the line
and would be resistant to a "man-in-the-middle" attack. Talked to two vendors
about it &amp; both said "fine - you fund it and we'll do it".

The RISK is always that if you wait too long to develop a product, you 
will wind up getting Clipped.

The North Carolina State University has proudly announced their web server
to the net on the NCSA What's new page.  Having a look I spotted the following
easy steps to compromising an account there ...

: The username is generally composed of the initial letters of the user's 
: first and middle names and the first six characters of his or her last 
: name. For example, if the user's name is John Q. Public, then the username 
: would be jqpublic. 
: 
: The password that users are given initially is their social security number, 
: which is typed in the password field without the dashes (e.g., 123-45-6789 
: is 123456789). In order to prevent unauthorized access, users need to change 
: their passwords as soon as possible and never share their passwords with 
: anyone. 

I wonder how many illegal accesses they have?

A recent RISKS reported on a "kick to enter" interaction in certain late model
automobiles.  The current Autoweek, quoting a manufacturer's press release
calls this a "high-tech legend".  Among other things, the air bag mechanism is
deactivated within 150 milliseconds after the ignition is turned off.  (I
assume the delay is to allow for the ignition circuit "dropping" in an
accident.)

This has been well-known dirty trick in showroom-stock autoracing (IMSA
Firehawk and SCCA Showroom Stock, primarily) for many years.  The impact
sensor is typically in the rear of a car.  A firm bumper-to-bumper tap from
behind will often lead to an impact sensor shutting off the electric fuel
pump, usually resulting in a DNF for the bumped driver.  Many showroom-stock
competitors bypass the impact cutoff to keep this from happening, thus leading
to real risk in the case of a serious accident.

I find it strange that the airbag system in the early Ford airbag cars (as
indicated in the post above) was triggered by a sensor that is typically found
in the rear of the car.

Side note: road racing organizations such as IMSA and SCCA require the
disabling of any airbag systems.  The safety equipment required negates the
use of passive systems.

CONTACT:  Larry Williams   (202) 482-1551   MARCH 1, 1994  

     The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is
undertaking a comprehensive review of privacy issues relating to private
sector use of telecommunications-related personal information associated with
the National Information Infrastructure (NII).

     Public comment is requested on issues relevant to such a review.  After
analyzing the comments, NTIA will issue a report and make recommendations as
needed.

     The inquiry will focus on potential uses of personal information
generated by electronic communications, including interactive multimedia,
cable television and telephony.  NTIA is studying the issues that arise when
such telecommunications- related information is used to create detailed
dossiers about individuals.  NTIA seeks to determine whether any overarching
privacy principles can be developed that would apply to all firms in the
telecommunications sector.  In addition, NTIA is soliciting comment on other
countries' actions to ensure the privacy of information transmitted over
telecommunications networks, and to ascertain how any U.S. policies in this
area will affect the international arena.

     The Notice of Inquiry and Request for Comments appears in Part IX of the
February 11, 1994, Federal Register and is also available on the NTIA Bulletin
Board at (202) 482-1199.  Set communications parameters to no parity, 8 data
bits and 1 stop.  Go into the menu "Teleview-Public Notices and Comments."
File size is 48,514 bytes or about 18 pages of text. Internet users can telnet

			   CALL FOR PAPERS
               The Second ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the
		 Foundations of Software Engineering
		      New Orleans, Louisiana USA
			  6-9 December 1994
		       Sponsored by ACM SIGSOFT

The ACM SIGSOFT '94 Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering will
focus on innovative research results that identify and contribute to the
foundations of software engineering.  The intent is to help establish software
engineering as a viable engineering discipline.

We solicit papers in all technical areas of software engineering.  A
successful paper is expected to report on new principles, methods, or results
of experimentation in software engineering (which includes topics related to
the specification, design, implementation, and evaluation of software
systems).  Papers should emphasize how they contribute to a foundation that
allows us to effectively engineer classes of complex software systems in
disciplined, reasoned ways.  Unless a strong tie to software engineering is
made, papers more central to other aspects of computer science should be
submitted to conferences in those areas.

A paper should clearly state the contribution and its underlying assumptions.
It should also assess the results, making appropriate comparisons with and
references to the literature.  Papers will be judged on clarity, significance,
relevance, correctness, and originality.  The paper must contain ideas not
previously presented in or currently waiting acceptance to another formal
forum.

All papers will be reviewed by program committee members.  In some cases,
additional external advice may be solicited by the program committee.  Papers
of particular merit may be recommended to major software engineering journals
for expedited review.

Submissions are limited to 12 pages (including figures) in 10 point type or
larger, excluding references.  Overly long submissions will be returned
without review.  Five copies, preferably double-sided, must be RECEIVED BY the
program chair by MAY 31, 1994.  Authors will be notified by AUGUST 5, 1994.
Camera-ready versions of accepted papers are due, along with ACM copyright
release forms, by SEPTEMBER 19, 1994.  Proceedings will be distributed at the
symposium and as a special issue of ACM Software Engineering Notes.

Tutorials will be held on Tuesday, DECEMBER 6, 1994.

Boston Globe, Monday, March 7 -- (Summarized)

For the past 4.5 years, Clinton Rumrill 3rd has been trying to clear his name
of financial and criminal problems caused by One of Rumrill's childhood
friends, John Mudge.  Mudge apparently started by taking a department store
credit card in Rumrill's name, has since racked up traffic charges, and been
charged with ticket scalping, all in Rumrill's name and with Rumrill's social
security number.

Although he's been able to clear up each case so far, because Rumrill and
Mudge have very different appearances, new cases keep springing up.  Rumrill
has been told it would be easier to change his name and SS number than to keep
trying to clear his name.

Rumrill now has another problem.  Police have been made aware of the fact that
Mudge is using Rumrill's ID, and now police computers think they are the same
person!

The difficulties are made worse by the fact that in Massachusetts it
is not a crime to give false information to the police.

KYW Radio reports that the 911 emergency service for almost the entire city of
Philadelphia was out of service last night for several hours resulting in
dozens of emergency calls not going through.  Callers got a "try again later"
message.  The outage was reportedly due to a "software problem".  Service has
apparently been restored but the station reports that the authorities are
still trying to correct the source of the problem.  Nothing in the early
edition of this mornings Inquirer but this sounds like a mini version of the

I came across this report of a really nasty computer risk....

&gt;From Electronics Now, April 1994, page 6
(I contacted the magazine to confirm this is NOT a joke and permission to
post the article.  Many thanks for Evelyn Rose, editorial assistant.)

NESDA Challenges U.S. Copyright Act
  The National Electronics Service Dealers Association (NESDA) has come
to the aid of Peak Computer Corporation in its legal battle with MAI
Systems Inc.
  NESDA and its associated organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in Washington DC last November on behalf of Peak which has been sued by
MAI Systems for alleged violations of the U.S. Copyright Act.
  MAI says the software which operates its computers is licensed only to
the owners of those computers, and only licensed owners should be allowed
to turn them on.  Its suit charges that Peak and other service companies
are breaking the law by turning on the computer for service.
  Two lower courts agreed with MAI that by turning on a computer a "copy"
of the operating program is made in the computer's RAM.  This, MAI says,
violates Sec. 117 of the U.S. Copyright Act.
  NESDA believes that if the ruling is allowed to stand, manufacturers
of such products as appliances, audio and video equipment, and heating and
air-conditioning controls could claim a similar exclusive right to their
"intellectual property."  According to NESDA Executive Director Clyde
Nabors, "NESDA has no choice but to oppose" the lower court's ruling,
which he views as "another of a long string of thinly-veiled attempts
by some manufactures to eliminate competition from independent service
[organizations]."
  The NESDA brief challenges the ruling on several points of law.  In its
brief, NESDA referenced a previous Supreme Court ruling that concluded
that a market for the service of a product exists after the sale of the
product.  In effect, the Court said that even if a manufacturer does not
monopolize the sale of its product, it can still be charged with illegally
trying to monopolize the service of those products.
  The NESDA brief entitled the "Service Industry Signal," is being filed
by attorney Ron Katz of the San Francisco office of Coudert Brothers, a
New York law firm.  To recover the cost of the brief as well as the cost
of future "signals' from the service industry, NESDA has requested
contributions to the "S.I.S" legal defense fund from concerned service
dealers and technicians.  The contributions are to be sent to the SIS
Fund, c/o NESDA, 2708 West Berry Street, Fort Worth, TX 76109.

Court Case casts doubt on cashpoint credibility, by Mark Ward
*Computing* (UK weekly), 3 Mar 1994 

ATM's are in the news again after the Halifax Building society's court-rrom
defence of their reputation. 

Almost all high-street financial institutions are now facing a combined
lawsuit brought by Denis Whalley of Liverpool solicitors, J Keith Park, on
behalf of 66 clients who claim they have been victims of phantom withdrawals
from automated teller machines.  The case follows that of Suffolk policeman
John Munden. He was convicted of attempting to obtain money by deception when
he queried the Halifax over a series of transactions he claimed he had not
made but which appeared on his bank statement (Computing, 24 February).  The
Halifax - the UK's biggest building society - decided to prosecute.
Curiously, though, when the trial was convened it was adjourned because the
building society could not offer any expert testimony on its security
procedures. The case came to court late last month and led to Munden's
conviction. He is due to be sentenced in the next couple of weeks.  During the
trial, the somewhat ramshackle nature of the Halifax's security procedures
came to light. The central personal identity number (PIN) validation
application was first developed in 1978 and reworked in 1981, when the Diebold
series of cash machines were bought. It doubtless it has been tweaked since,
but it is still a system built for a less demanding era.  Banks and building
societies alike are trying to patch up the failing security procedures of
their cash machines by putting in cameras and looking at other ways to prove
users are who they claim they are.  But the Halifax is not alone in trying to
use old technology to meet changing customer needs. Every high-street bank and
building society is closing branches or working out how to turn them into
selling spaces rather than service points. And one man at least is convinced
that this and other trends will make the cash machine a museum piece by 2010.
A book, published next month, by author Bryan Clough, Cheating At Cards: Sharp
Practice and Naive Systems, takes a long look at cashpoint crime.  Clough
believes the high pnce of ATMs in terms of pounds and pain could force a
banking revolution.  He says in many US states, so many people are mugged and
murdered while using ATMs that state governments are forcing banks to fit
safety devices that nearly double the cost of holes in the wall. And this is
before any consideration is given to making the machines less fallible.  The
UK's first recorded incident of a person murdered after using a cash machine
occurred in Hampshire this January. Clough is sure there have been others,
though no one is collecting figures.  He is convinced that retailers have an
enormous opportunity to take business away from the banks, with the secure
environment they offer people for getting cash when using debit cards to buy
their shopping. That advantage is compounded by the fact that the cost to
supermarkets of being able to offer the service is only that of a (pounds)50
swipe terminal and the connection to the bank's computer.  Certainly, there is
a real contradiction between banks and building societies trying to turn a
branch into a space through which to sell more services, and their putting a
machine on the outside that means customers have no contact with branch staff.

Regulatory bodies regard cash machine fraud as small beer. According to the
Association for Payment and Clearing Services, the body that comments on
security, ATM fraud in 1992 cost banks and building societies (pounds)3m,
compared with the (pounds)165m cost of plastic card fraud.  Apacs sees cash
machines as a relatively secure method of dispensing money.  Some are even
looking at extending the PIN concept to plastic cards to cut the level of
fraud at the point of sale.  An Apacs spokesman said there are various studies
being conducted that will result in technology to aid decisions at the point
of sale. He said one problem lies in limiting false rejections - turning away
genuine customers.  He suggested a false rejection rate of one in 100,000 as
acceptable. No technology on trial has yet demonstrated anything like this
rate.  What is clear is that crunch time is coming for the humble cash
machine.  Will it go the way of all flesh, or become the preferred method of
dealing with your bank-only this time with the banks paying for their
mistakes.

In the German news magazine Der Spiegel 1994(9) 28/2/94 p243 is a story
concerning Dominic Rymer, who obtained a doctor's password by looking over his
shoulder, and then edited the drug protocol of a nine-year-old meningitis
patient to something that might have killed her. This all happened at the
Arrowe [sic] Park Hospital in Wirral, Lancs. I didn't see any article about it
in a British newspaper.

I was looking through "The Sunday Mail" here in Brisbane, Australia on Sunday,
March 6, when I noticed an article on page 20 titled "New Phone Stumps Oz Spy
Group".  I'll paraphrase it and give a few excerpts.

The key point was that the new digital Telecom Talkabout system which has been
deployed here in Brisbane "cannot be traced or bugged using current
technology".  Talkabout is a "small cell" mobile phone system: there are now
Talkabout poles all over the CBD and most suburbs, and people can buy a cheap
small mobile phone to take advantage of the system.  It is quite popular.

What the above quote probably means is that the police, ASIO (domestic
security) and ASIS (Australia's CIA), don't currently have scanners that
can decode the digital signals, although I suspect that Talkabout probably
also uses the GSM encryption system which was introduced here recently,
over the objections of the afore-mentioned agencies.

Of relevance to the Clipper debate is the following quote: "Telecom corporate
public relations spokesman, Mr John Tucker, said it was a requirement of the
federal Attorney General's department that all telecommunications be capable
of being intercepted by intelligence and police agencies".  Telecom have
special dispensation from the Attorney General to run Talkabout as a trial
as long as it is contained to the Brisbane network.  The future of the
system would be discussed after the trial and a decision would be made as
to who would fund the cost of developing means of tracing calls.

So, it looks like Australia is doomed to repeat the same battle for strong
encryption that is currently raging in the United States.

The usual RISKs of "buggable" encryption systems apply, but an additional
RISK for Australia is that the Attorney General will buy the US government's
line on Clipper and put our telecommunications at risk with all of the keys
stored in databases held by a foreign power, no matter how friendly that
power may currently be.  Either that or the Attorney General will commission
the development of a similar system here.  Another RISK is that once a
tracing mechanism is developed, the "small cell" nature of Talkabout might
permit the tracking of a user's every move.

The cynical members of the Clipper debate will put this down as yet another
power that the US government seeks over its citizens and the rest of the
world.  The NSA for one would have no restrictions against monitoring the
Clipper-ised internal communications of another country: that is part of
their purpose for existence.

Probably the only good sign is that since Talkabout is very popular (and
Telecom have been pushing it very aggressively), Telecom will probably fight
tooth and nail to keep their investment, and the concerns of the above
agencies will be overridden.  The agencies will then be forced to recognise
that wiretap surveillance is coming to the end of its useful life whether
they like it or not, and they will have to develop alternative means.
We can only hope.

	Lurking in a computer lab in a High School is a Macintosh, a Macintosh
that wasn't well oiled, a Macintosh that ended its existence abruptly during a
High School music class.  It was a Macintosh SE and like its many other
brothers in the lab it had a little hole in the back of it in which oil was
placed.  The brilliant administrators at the school found out that when a
computer is left on 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year for
seven years a computer gets worn out.  An unsuspecting student sat down at his
table, flipped on his keyboard and turned on his Macintosh SE like he always
did.  The Mac slowly came to life, he clicked on the MIDI program and all hell
broke loose.  At first it started rather benignly, a gentle tap but, far worse
things were about to come.  Soon the Macintosh was going BUMP BUMP BUMP and
was jumping on the desk.  The student yelled for his teacher and the teacher
proceeded to click on the mouse in a vain effort to fix the ailing computer.
Next the Mac began to emit a grinding noise not unlike a garbage disposal.
	The teacher screamed "DID YOU OIL IT!!!!."
	The student replies "YES I DID, YES I DID."
The Macintosh is now rapidly convulsing on the table.  The screen began to
flash black and white.  Next the Mac started to emit a high pitched whine.
All of the other students began to flee from the room, several female students
began to cry and the Mac, like an animal slowly dying of blood-loss, began to
spurt oil out of the little hole on the back of the computer coating several
other computers.  There is a gigantic BANG as the student runs for his life
out of the room and pieces of glass slide out into the hallway.  The moral of
the story....  KEEP YOUR MACINTOSH WELL OILED.

"Verification, Validation and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the
Earth Sciences" by Naomi Oreskes, Kristin Shrader-Frechette and
Kenneth Belitz, SCIENCE 263, 4 Feb 1994, 641 -- 646.

This article is a critique of computer modelling applied to such
public policy issues as global warming and nuclear waste disposal.

  &gt;From the abstract:
  "Verification and validation of numerical models of natural systems is
  impossible ...  The primary value of models is heuristic."

The article struck me as a philosophical essay on the limits of
modelling in general, rather than as a critique of particular models.

These authors do not use the term "verification" with its usual
meaning in computing, rather they use "verified" to mean "makes
predictions consistent with observations."   In fact, the article does
not consider computing issues specifically.  I think a better title
would have been just, "Validation and Confirmation ..."

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.62.html">RISKS-15.62</A>, Simson Garfinkel says: 

&gt; I was on one of the few aircraft to land in the Boston blizzard today. There
&gt; was zero visibility. [...]
&gt; And I wondered which would have been RISKier: landing on autopilot, or landing
&gt; on human pilot.

It's well to wonder, but in this case there might not have been the option.
There are three categories of Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches, Cat
I, II and III, and Cat III is further subdivided into A, B, and C. The
categories are differentiated according to the minimum weather conditions
required for landing. An ILS is, abstractly, a couple of radio homing beams.
One, the `localiser', beams down the centerline of the runway, so you can tell
if you're left or right of it, and another beams up at an angle, usually
between 3-5 degrees, from the touchdown point - the `glide slope'. You or your
favorite autopilot are supposed to follow the beams from 5-15 miles out. In
order to land legally for most Cat I Instrument Landing System approaches,
besides the usual visibility conditions, some part of the runway, its lighting
or its environment must be visible when you're roughly 200 feet above the
ground (and therefore a few more hundred feet from touchdown).  Cat II
`minimums' are lower, Cat III lower still.  Furthermore, for air carriers,
operation is only permitted with certain values of `Runway Visual Range'.
Special crew and aircraft certification is required for Cat II and III, and
certain modes of operation are mandatory.  It is possible that the landing
described was made under Cat IIIA, in which case use of some automated systems
is mandatory, and hand-flying is not an option.

A further question is: what form of safety analysis has been done to ensure
that the requirement to use automated landing systems rather than people is
appropriate for Cat III landings? Perhaps those RISKS readers who have
extensive dealings with the regulatory authorities and the airplane
manufacturers could tell us?

At the end of each semester, my university publishes unit results by printing
out the student number of each pupil and their unit scores.  These results are
then posted in a public area in the university.  Since only the student ID
number (and not the person's name) is printed, it is impossible to find out
someone else's results unless you know their student ID number.

This was reasonable secure, as it was fairly difficult to find out someone
else's student ID number without obtaining their student card.  Unfortunately,
the computing unit at the university have introduced a new scheme for
allocating usernames to students.  The username is comprised of the first
letter of the user's surname, and the user's student ID number.

It is fairly easy to obtain someone else's username.  They may give it to you
for e-mail purposes.  Their username will often appear in a window title on
their physical terminal, or in their command prompt.  Tools like 'who' could
also assist in finding out another person's username without their permission.
The inclusion of the first letter of the person's surname into the username
makes such investigation even easier.

Thus, with only a small effort, any student with a computer
account could quite easily obtain the student number, and then
the results, of any other student who uses the system.

Of course the university may change it's policy on posting results in a public
place, but somehow I doubt it.

In an effort to avoid the problem of MCImail RISKS recipients getting each

I tried BCC on a sublist that at that time also included MCImail, CompuServe,
NetCom, and a few other so-called services.

CompuServe gets added to the MORON list of services apparently unable to
handle BCC, because they turned that into the long list of addresses that
apparently worked just fine when sent TO the sublist.  NetCom reportedly also
got wedged as a result of my attempt to use BCC.

I GUESS YOU CAN CONCLUDE THAT BCC: MAY BE VERY RISKY!

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.62.html">RISKS-15.62</A> I solved that problem by creating a BCC sublist just for
MCImail and reverting to TO for everyone else on the rest of that sublist.  I
feel like a three-TO:ed sloth.  But the degenerative "services" are really
causing me too much grief.  (I presume you recall the fact that several of

Tue, 08 Mar 94 20:15:54 -0500
</i><PRE>

Twice in the last 6 months I have received a rather interesting brochure in
the mail.  Before I comment on it, let me describe it.

The first page is bright yellow, with the picture of a small guinea pig.  In
big letters, it proclaims "Microsoft would like to use your company as a test
site for the 4,000,000 lines of new code in NT."

Inside, it states "SunSoft would like to offer you a leading-edge operating
system with 10 years of fine-tuning behind it: Solaris."  It then goes on with
other "ad-speak".

I find this amusing in several respects:
  1) It plays on a long-standing perception of many computer users
     that Microsoft does a poor job of testing their code (I am
     enclosing a humorous posting that circulated on the Usenet
     recently that also points this out);
  2) It underscores one of the major, major concerns about using
     large software artifacts (e.g., NT) -- they are often poorly
     tested, and the consumer is usually the one to suffer;
  3) Sun's Solaris has been the subject of several very public, very
     significant bugs and security lapses over the past several years.
     It is hardly something to crow about in comparison to NY.

When the first round of these ads came out a few months back, a great many of
the engineers inside Sun were very chagrined by it.  Several were even angry
-- they got a lot of comment from people outside Sun struggling with bugs in
tar, sendmail, lpr and other utilities.  It makes Sun appear to be unaware and
uncaring about existing bugs and problems.

Now, for a second round of mailing to appear is almost the height of
cluelessness by the advertising folks.

Risks?
  1) Advertising folks who don't talk to the software engineers or
     customer support people.
  2) Companies that spend more money and effort getting problems out
     the door than they do on design and testing.
  3) Using your company as the test site for 4 million lines of
     Windows NT.  Or X million lines of Solaris.
  4) If you develop a reputation for poor testing and poor customer
     service, it can be used against you in advertising.

In the March 9-15 1994 issue (Vol XIV, No. 23 p.9) of the Metro Times, the
freely distributed alternative newspaper in Detroit, Dennis Rosenblum reports
on yet another ethically-questionable activity ironically associated with the
violation of Tonya Harding's e-mail at the Olympics.  &lt;"E-Mail blunder at
Olympics" RISKS 15-58&gt;

Both the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported that Free Press
sports reporter Michelle Kaufman--with two other reporters from other
papers--broke into Harding's account, but did not read any mail. The Free
Press story was printed on page 8D in the sports section, but the News printed
its story on page 1A, the front page, and portrayed it as much more
scandalous.

The News and Free Press operate under a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA), a
controversial arrangement which allowed the two supposedly editorially
independent papers to combine their business and production facilities to cut
costs, with a 100-year federal antitrust exemption. Both papers argued
successfully in federal court that the Free Press would go out of business if
not for this agreement.

The twist comes in when the Detroit News ran a photo of Kaufman with their
front-page story. The digital image was stolen from the production facilities
in the News building, which both papers share. According to Rosenblum:

"It turns out that a photo of Kaufman which the News ran with its story came
from Free Press computer files. A News editor had a composting room worker
sneak along a copy of the digital photo file, without the knowledge of the
Free Press."

"Ed Wendover, a leader of Citizens for an Independent Press, which opposed the
JOA in court, considered it predictable. 'This is perhaps only a precursor of
what happens when they move in together,' said Wendover, a suburban
publisher."

"In a memo to editors at the News, Editor and Publisher Robert Giles termed it
a 'clear breach of the security that is critical to maintaining editorial
separation and independence...as required by the joint operating agreement.'"

The irony of this story is obvious, but the RISK involves the impact of lax
computer security on the First Amendment issues concerning the distinct
editorial voices that were promised under the JOA.

A recent flurry of articles in RISKS talks about poor spelling and
punctuation, including the common problem of confusing "it's" and "its".  Let
me try the argument that these errors, like so many so-called "human errors"
are in actuality design errors -- language design.

English is well known for its peculiarities in spelling, in part due to its
multiple origins that give rise to words with different historical roots, in
part because so many reformers have tinkered with it, sometimes successfully,
sometimes not (Ben Johnson, George Bernard Shaw and Noah Webster come to mind,
and I am sure that RISKS readers can name others). As a result, the spelling
is so inconsistent on the surface that it takes a Halle &amp; Chomsky to write a
learned book explaining that there is an underlying deep consistency.  If it
takes a complex book to explain it, then maybe spelling isn't "designed" with
the user in mind.

Now take punctuation. One problem is that English uses the symbol ' for at
least two separate meanings (not counting its use in quotations): contraction
and possession, as in "that's my dog's ball." With words that are homonyms, so
the same spelling indicates contraction and possession, the rule is that
contraction wins use of the '.  Hence, "It's not its fault," where "it's" is a
contraction and "its" is a possessive.

Try explaining that to a non-native speaker of English.  Hell, try explaining
that to a native speaker.

If English weren't so stingy with symbols and used different symbols for
possession and contraction, then we wouldn't have any problem.  English
doesn't use symbols to mark parts of speech such as subject, or indirect
object (or, in a case-based framework, agent or recipient): why use a symbol
to mark possession?

Anyway, some human error in spelling and punctuation is really a system or
design error: blame evolution -- or those early typographers who transformed
the spoken language into its printed form.

I just received my new credit card in the mail, only it wasn't mine.  The
paper enfolding the card had my name and account number but the card had a
different name and account number.

The credit card company claimed that this had _never_ happed before, blocked
both accounts as having lost/stolen cards and is sending me a new card.

I was really surprised to be the first one having this problem.  I would
assume that this could happen if the entire run of cards mailed was off by one
and we all received the right paper with the wrong cards.

Compounding the problem, they have redesigned the card this year so that the
names are printed in the same color as the card, making them hard to read.
Only by chance did I look closely enough to notice that it wasn't my card.
Perhaps the entire line did go astray after all.

An article by the Associated Press notes that a woman in Pembroke,
Massachusetts, used the CNID feature to track down an obscene caller who had
been bothering her since 1991.

After years of harassment, the woman signed up with her phone company for the
CNID service, compiled a map with the numbers and addresses of public phone
booths in her vicinity, and obtained a second telephone line to alert police.

Her efforts paid off last Saturday at about 2:30 AM, leading to the arrest of
a 28 year old suspect, who was still on the phone when the police arrived.

The following article was posted to the USENET newsgroup comp.os.lynx
today. The group deals with a UNIX-style hard real-time operating system
called LynxOS. LynxOS' primary market is the real-time process control
market (which is also often a safety critical market).

I should explain that LynxOS threads are light-weight processes.

&gt; From: govinda@anest.fgg.eur.nl (N Govinda Rajan)
&gt; Newsgroups: comp.os.lynx
&gt; Subject: Window move in X holds up other threads even of higher priority
&gt; Date: Tue, 8 Mar 1994 10:43:50 GMT
&gt; Organization: Dept Of Anesthesiology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam
&gt; Message-ID: &lt;govinda.48.2D7C56E6@anest.fgg.eur.nl&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; When I move a window or resize a window, all other threads in any process 
&gt; which has the X Main Loop [are] held up. For example, I have a process which
&gt; has the X Main Loop which starts a thread. This priority of this thread is 
&gt; made higher than the process and it starts a count down timer and waits for 
&gt; the timer signal, which is SIGALRM. When the timer counts down it does some 
&gt; work (actually sends an analog signal through D/A convertor to an external 
&gt; instrument) and restarts the count down timer once more and sigwaits once 
&gt; more and so on. SIGALRM is supposed to be thread unique. 

&gt; All goes well, except when I move a window or resize, then the timer thread 
&gt; does not respond at all and as long as I have the mouse button pressed down
&gt; it does not respond. When I release it everything continues normally again.

So far, so good. The problem can be explained by the fact that when an X
window manager wants to move or re-size a window, it "grabs" the X server to
prevent other X events from interfering with the window move.

Now the comes the RISKy bit:

&gt; My external instrument is an artificial ventilator and if it does not get 
&gt; the signal in time the patient does not get any breaths.
[temporary technical solution from article deleted]

So the patient's life depends entirely the timely delivery of a software
signal (and nothing else)? The complete absence of any recognition that this
is a safety critical system that could kill people horrifies me.

I think I'll be staying away from Dutch ventilators if at all possible...

If I may boil down the government's side of the Clipper debate, it is this:

    "We need to implement this encryption method so as to avoid problems we
think may be coming.  Trust us!  We promise not to abuse your privacy."
Except, of course, Clipper technology gives them a 'pen register' on every
phone.  Pen register give those in power a running list of every phone contact
made between two Clipper phones without the need to fill out even the minor
paperwork now required for this surveillance.

    I do not doubt the sincerity of Dorothy Denning or others who 
defend Clipper.  And I would have fewer problems with Clipper/Capstone 
proposal if the people who will be granting access to the keys and 
those with legal access to the keys and call records were of Dorothy's 
caliber. 

    However, people of good will are not likely to be the ones who apply for
these keys to your privacy in the future.  I am right in the middle of a case
which has remarkable similarities to a Clipper "request for keys."

    Full details have been posted to comp.eff.talk and misc.legal, but in
brief summary, a Postal Inspector from Tennessee is attempting (for political
reasons) to impose the obscenity standards of that region on an adult BBS run
from Milpitas (just North of San Jose).  To this end, he obtained a warrant to
take the BBS hardware.  Because of contained email and First Amendment
activities of a BBS, subpoenas, not warrants, are required under *two*
sections of federal law.  The laws are Title 42, Section 2000aa, and Title 18
Section 2701, the same ones which were applied in the well-known Steve Jackson
Games case.

    Pointers to these federal laws were *posted* on the BBS.  The postal
inspector downloaded this file and *included* it in his affidavit for a search
warrant to a Magistrate-Judge in San Francisco, along with a remarkably weak
theory of how he could avoid application of these laws to himself.

    To obtain a warrant to take email and 2000aa materials, the laws require a
number of judicial findings to be made.  None of these requirements were
considered by the court.  The postal inspector got his warrant, mailed child
pornography to the BBS, served the warrant, "found" the child porn and
obtained an indictment in TN.  The child porn charge is bogus because the
agent specifically described the material as "sent without his knowledge"
(referring to the sysop).  Of course the sysop has to defend himself from the
charges 2000 miles from home and shut down his business while doing so, and
everyone on the system had their email copied and passwords compromised.

    This example applies directly to the Clipper situation.  

    The risk under Clipper is that your private communications will be
protected by the *weakest* link in the chain--one of the thousands of low
level Magistrate-Judges among whom corrupt or zealous law enforcement agents
shop for warrants and will shop for keys.  These magistrates (who are *not*
judges, but work for the US Attorney's office) tend to be busy, or lazy or
corrupt or all three. As in this case, even if the law is *directly quoted* in
search warrant affidavits or key requests, and these laws *expressly forbid*
granting warrants or key requests under the conditions cited, the magistrate
may not even read the supporting affidavit before approving it.  He is *very*
unlikely to read or consider the underlying laws when granting a request.  The
key escrow agents provide no protection whatsoever since they simply fill
orders from agents with approved applications.

    Judges ignore the law with impunity, and so do law enforcement 
agents because one agency will almost never investigate another. 

    As a practical matter, applications for search warrants are almost never
denied.  The same situation is certain to occur for Clipper key applications,
no mater how weak the justification happens to be, or what laws are being
violated by those seeking the keys.

Jim Bidzos submitted his reaction to the Clipper proposal.  I agree with
him for the most part, but would add a few notes:

[risks of Clipper]
&gt;- Potential abuses by government and loss of privacy for all citizens.

I would add:

	increased vulnerability to Organized Crime (because they're
	not very experienced with cryptanalysis but they have lots of
	experience with bribery, breaking/entering, theft of machines
	and data, ... -- in other words, all the talents you need to
	break the key escrow scheme).

&gt;AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL
&gt;
&gt;One approach would be to have NIST develop a standard with three
&gt;levels.  The first level could specify the use of public-key for key
&gt;management and signatures without any key escrow.  There could be a
&gt;"Level II" compliance that adds government key escrow to message
&gt;preparation.

What's wrong with just having the FBI, NSA, GCHQ, French bureau (whatever
it's name), ..., publish their own RSA keys (both PGP and RIPEM format)
so that individuals can voluntarily include those keys as recipients
when they encrypt, if they want to volunteer to give the gov't access?

This achieves exactly the voluntary wiretapping the NSA says it wants --
with no hardware and no special code.

&gt;II products would be decontrolled for export. The market can decide;
&gt;vendors will do what their customers tell them to.  This satisfies
&gt;the obvious desire on the part of the government to influence what
&gt;happens, as a consumer.

I disagree with any plan to control exportability based on the NSA's ability
to read traffic.  I believe nothing which is already available outside the US
should be restricted from export.  Anything else just makes the US government
look stupid.

		************************************************
			Computer Risk Bulletin #478
		************************************************

			Warning Notice M.U.D-1

On the 3rd of September, 1992 the computing world was rocked by the horror of
a new computer-originated illness and the life it claimed.

Eldred Squires, a 26 year old Operator/Administrator at major British Chemical
Company was the first victim.  At  approximately  9:03am,  Squires logged into
his  personal account,  ees, and sent some email to a friend at a remote site.
Logging out, he then proceeded to log into the  operator  account  to clean up
some  problematic  printing  queues.  Following this, he logged out and logged
into  a  test  account to check that his print queues were accepting data from
normal  users.  Finding that  all was well, he logged out then logged into the
root account to create a new username to receive  helpdesk mail, not realising
the  mortal  danger  he was in.   Wanting to test this new username, he logged
out from root and proceeded to login to his new account.  Barely three letters
into  his  twelve  letter alphanumeric password, he slumped forward across his
keyboard, dead.

Investigators, on arriving at the scene could find no reason for his death and
elected to wait for further information from the outcome of the Autopsy.

        The Autopsy revealed that the victim's cerebral cortex suffered damage
consistent  with  heating  of  the brain to approximately 120 degrees celsius.
Still no nearer to the solution of the death,  Computer and  Workplace  Safety
Officers  decided  to  recreate,  using  accounting  logs and user audits, the
circumstances leading up to the  tragedy.   Shielding the testing officer from
the  equipment with leaded glass, the team commenced their tests.  Within five
minutes,  another  victim  lay  sprawled across the keyboard, a fine patina of
sweat on their brow.

   Admitting defeat, the Safety Office called in an expert in Computer Related
Deaths,  Dr Brian Analpeeper.  Within minutes of examining the logs and audits
Analpeeper was able to  correctly  diagnose  the  cause  of  death.   Multiple
Username Disorders.

  Multiple Username Disorders, Analpeeper explained, are a dangerous new
side-effect of the current computing mindset.  People become encumbered with
several usernames until, ultimately, their brain fries out.  Analpeeper also
explained that for years the Social Sciences had been aware of the existence
of Multiple Personality Disorders (commonly mis-referred to as Split
Personalities) and that in a small way, M.U.Ds were in fact a computer
replication of this.

 "People are required to maintain several accounts for various purposes, One
for say, an Administration function, One for their own personal use, Another
for normal work, and perhaps yet another for financial and charging matters.
Sooner  or  later  the  combination of what is required of the user of these
accounts will wreak it's havoc on the brain, causing mass cerebric hysteria.
Of course some people have a higher tolerance to this than others, yet there
is *no* way of accurately judging how far we can push a user."

     Later, in a harmless demonstration, Dr Analpeeper, took a volunteer and
assigned him 5  usernames  for  different purposes.  Victim number 3 fell to
the floor in a lifeless heap.

"I lied about it being harmless"  Analpeeper said.  "So sue me."

       Months later scientists are still no nearer finding a solution to the
problem, mainly because they're to scared to login to the research computers.
Life goes on, or sometimes it doesn't.


Are you in danger?

     In an effort to reduce the deaths and crippling side effects of Multiple
Username  Disorder,  the  Computer  Risk  Committee has compiled this list of
warning symptoms:

Victim may:
	- Wonder whether they've read their mail today
	- Wonder which account they're logged into
	- Complain of feeling hot and bothered in front of their terminal
	- Complain that the room appears to be getting warmer
	- Slur words, especially after consuming large quantities of alcohol
	- Repeatedly forget passwords
	- Ask to see the wine list at restaurants for no apparent reason
	- Pause for a few seconds before entering their password.
	- Talk to themselves whilst logging in or executing everyday
		commands.
	- Fail to notice everyday events, such as telephones ringing, 
		power failures, being struck about the head etc
	- Fall to the floor dead.

Should one or more of these symptoms be present, STOP USING YOUR ACCOUNT NOW!
Logout and walk away.  Life is, after all, too precious..

   The recently reported case of the woman using caller ID to catch an obscene
caller was noteworthy only because of its relative rarity.  Fewer and fewer
such callers are stupid enough these days to make such calls from other than
payphones, and most won't hang around the phone long enough to get caught.  To
the extent that an idiot does stay around, use of the call-trace feature that
is an integral part of the new systems (which provides the number instantly to
the telco, rather than to the callee) would provide the same info in a much
less invasive manner.
   The telcos know full well (all you have to do is read their own literature)
that the real reason they push caller ID is to provide businesses with tools
for phone number collection of inbound callers for building of telemarketing
lists.  Its overall usefulness for dealing with harassing calls is quite
limited, and becoming less so every day as more and more of the callers catch
on.

Lisa Balkes' story of the Janitor interrupting the UPS brought back to mind a
problem which I ran into this past summer.  I will keep the company anonymous
to protect it's identity.  I was employed there during the summer as a student
programmer/analyst.  On with the story!

A new alarm system was being installed at company P over one weekend.
The installers had to access the climate controlled computer room
where company P's Prime system was located to incorporate the
thermometer with the alarm system (if the air conditioner conks out,
and the room gets too warm, the alarm is set off).

The installers were let into the room by the plant manager who was
working that week, however there is an unwritten rule that only
authorized personnel are to enter the room, and any unauthorized
people are to be escorted.

When we arrived Monday morning, two of our three hard drives in the
drive cabinet where crashed.  We also noticed that the cabinet had
been physically moved a few centimetres (there was an imprint of its
original position left on the floor).  The security alarm installers
insisted that they did not move the units, yet they must have since
they were the only people to enter the locked room that weekend.
Since nobody saw them do it, we had no proof (the plant manager left
them alone in the room).

We were supposedly prepared for an event where one of our boot-up
drives crashed, however the backup unit and the main unit were the two
which crashed.  It took about a month and a half and 4 refurbished
drives later to get us up and running.

A few weeks after we were up and running fully, there was an
electrical fire in the manufacturing plant, at the point were the
electricity came into the plant.  Fortunately, the system was saved
from being fried, but we had to deal with the soot from the fire.

Because there was no electricity, we were able to bring in diesel
electric generators and get the computers up and running (since our
computer was accessed by our salesmen and by company P's other
manufacturing plants).  The generated electricity was "dirty" and our
UPS consistently complained and would go online.

Also, during the evenings when no one was around, the electricity
consumption decreased, and somehow the generator would detect that and
do something to the electricity such that the UPS would kick in.  For
a week we came into work with the UPS beeping in morse code SOS, and
our system would be down, until we temporarily solved the problem by
leaving all the lights and personal computers on during the evenings.

Needless to say, it was an exciting and unpredictable summer, with
lots of long hours, frustrations, and rewards.  And company P is still
operating today.

Risks?  No matter how prepared you are, you are never prepared enough.

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.64.html">RISKS-15.64</A>, jcr@msen.com (John C. Rivard) reports that "A News editor had
a composting room worker sneak along a copy of the digital photo file, without
the knowledge of the Free Press."

I wondered idly what kind of pitchfork would be best for digital compost, but
came to no earth-shaking conclusions.  Despite mental ferment, I made, as they
say, no hay.  Eventually, I moved on to the next article ... in which
dnorman@apple.com (Don Norman) speculated that "Maybe appalling grammar is bad
language design."

There are moments when the enjoyment to be derived from digitized
debate seems to outweigh almost any RISK.

&gt; ... a composting room worker ...

Hmmm... We always known what news people handle, but it's nice to know they
know too.

I don't recall the outcome, but there were some lawsuits a while ago
concerning the government's right to paw through your trash after you put it
on the street.  Is compost material protected by intellectual property laws or
the first amendment?  I suppose one could argue about a right to privacy...

&gt; With words that are homonyms, so the same spelling indicates contraction
&gt; and possession, the rule is that contraction wins use of the '.  Hence,
&gt; "It's not its fault," where "it's" is a contraction and "its" is a
&gt; possessive.

&gt; Try explaining that to a non-native speaker of English.  Hell, try
&gt; explaining that to a native speaker.

In either case, try explaining it *correctly*.  There is no such "contraction
wins" rule.  "Its", like "his" and "her," is a possessive pronoun, not a noun
requiring "'s" (or "'", if already ending in s) to form a possessive.  One
does not even think of writing "I threw hi's ball over the fence,"
notwithstanding the fact that "his" has no homonym.

&gt; If English weren't so stingy with symbols and used different symbols for
&gt; possession and contraction, then we wouldn't have any problem.

An extremely unlikely statement on its face, and completely unsupported by the
preceding argument.

I would have more sympathy with Don Norman's comments about bad language
design (<A HREF="/Risks/15.64.html">RISKS-15.64</A>) if he hadn't confused the great lexicographer with a
[...] runner.

  _Samuel_ Johnson, please!

Mr. Norman has, however, produced an interesting analogy. Any software
designer who thinks that his/her design will survive many iterations of fixes
and upgrades might look at the evolution of languages for a cautionary
counter-example.

"Freedom of information" means literally "freedom to defend yourself", ie "the
right to live". States can falsify information on a grand scale (eg make
computers) and do pretend to respect human rights (which I would argue is a
weak claim, but the UK and the USA do indeed make that claim, and spend a
fairly derisory but not non-existent sum to "prove" it); if you can attribute
heinous crimes, such as child pornography, to someone, then you can destroy
them.  Clipper in effect destroys the value of computer evidence ("it must be
faked"), so I am glad in a way that the public scepticism of computer
"evidence" is about to be reinforced.  I don't believe that the law enforcers
will thank Clinton, once they realise the true effect of Clipper on their
cases - everyone will claim that the police "of course" knew all about their
personal life and then falsified suitable evidence to substantiate a
tailor-made case.  They will edit their own version and insert points at which
the police "made it all up" (as they do in many non-computerised defences).  I
await with interest the first defence on these lines when Clipper hits the
streets.

Since Mr. Henson speaks of "Clipper" (and not Skipjack generally), I
assume he's referring strictly to telephonic communications.  He's
incorrect in implying that a Magistrate Judge can issue a wiretap
warrant; Title III makes quite clear that they *cannot*.  See _In re
United States_, 10 F.3d 931 (2d Cir. 1993).

&gt;These magistrates (who are *not* judges, but work for the US Attorney's 
&gt;office) tend to be busy, or lazy or corrupt or all three. 

Mr. Henson also misstates the facts here.  Magistrate Judges most assuredly do
not work for the US Attorneys nor for the Department of Justice.  They are
Article I judicial officers; in my experience, they are no more or less "lazy
or corrupt" than life-tenure, Article III federal judges.

And for the record, I oppose Clipper.

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.64.html">RISKS-15.64</A>, hkhenson notes that 

   The risk under Clipper is that your private communications will be
   protected by the *weakest* link in the chain--one of the thousands of
   low level Magistrate-Judges among whom corrupt or zealous law
   enforcement agents shop for warrants and will shop for keys.

This is hardly the only risk under Clipper, nor are the federal magistrates
necessarily the weakest link in the chain: your conclusion is based on an
incorrect understanding of the law and the role of U.S. Magistrate-Judges.

   These magistrates (who are *not* judges, but work for the US Attorney's
   office) tend to be busy, or lazy or corrupt or all three.

The magistrates *are* judges.  They do not work for the U.S. Attorney's
office, but for the United States District Court.  The magistrates are
appointed by the District Court which they serve, for nine-year terms; the
District Court judges (who appoint the magistrates) are appointees of the
President, and serve for life.  Magistrates are as well-qualified as the
judges they serve, and have the same duties, responsibilities, and powers.
They do tend to be busy; in my experience, they are not likely to be any
more lazy or corrupt than any other federal judge.

   As in this case, even if the law is *directly quoted* in search warrant
   affidavits or key requests, and these laws *expressly forbid* granting
   warrants or key requests under the conditions cited, the magistrate may
   not even read the supporting affidavit before approving it.  He is
   *very* unlikely to read or consider the underlying laws when granting a
   request.

This is no more true of a federal magistrate than of any other judge, in
either the federal or state court systems.  As a rule, judges *do* try to
make sure that the application is lawful and that the rules for granting it
are applied appropriately.  Sometimes a bad application gets through, and
some judges unquestionably treat such applications more favorably than
others.  This is a general problem with "the system" and is not unique to
Clipper.  There *might* be an enhanced risk with Clipper because the bench
(almost by definition) is inhabited by generalists who are called upon to
be "instant experts" in many areas; they must rely on others to provide
them with sufficient technical insight to allow an informed decision.
Sometimes that insight is provided entirely by the applicant; very often,
it is provided by the judge's law clerk.

   The key escrow agents provide no protection whatsoever since they simply
   fill orders from agents with approved applications.

This, in fact, is a much more troubling weakness with the Clipper proposal,
and one which has been discussed at length in other fora.  While Clipper does
introduce some very weak links into the security chain, judicial oversight is
not one of them --- that particular link is not changed at all.  (One could
even argue that because the technology makes wiretaps so much easier, judges
might actually be less inclined to approve every application that comes their
way.)

COMPASS is an annual conference committed to bringing together researchers,
developers, and evaluators who work on problems related to specifying,
building, and certifying high-assurance computer systems.  What distinguishes
COMPASS from similar conferences is its emphasis on bridging the gap between
research and practice.  Researchers are provided an opportunity to present
results, new theories, and new technologies to both other researchers and
practitioners who can put them to practice.  They can also learn from
practitioners of new research problem domains and of problems encountered in
building real systems.  Practitioners have an opportunity to share lessons
learned, to learn of new research, and to influence future research.

Welcome to COMPASS 94, the ninth in a series of annual symposia on Computer
Assurance. This year's conference focuses on both the use and assessment of
formal methods and on alternatives to formal verification in a variety of
critical areas:
                       * Safety
                       * Reliability
                       * Fault Tolerance
                       * Concurrency and Real Time
                       * Security

At COMPASS, the diverse program and small conference atmosphere provide plenty
of opportunity for audience and speakers to mingle and share their
experiences.  The audience bring their own wealth of knowledge, and
interchanges among industry, members of government agencies, and academia
provide unique opportunities to discuss current requirements and future needs.
We invite you to participate and increase the benefits of COMPASS by your
attendance.

*** MONDAY, 27 JUNE

 8:00 am            Registration Opens

 9:00 am - 4:00 pm  Tutorial (Lunch on your own)

1.  "Formal Software Development Using Z", John McDermid, University of York

Much has been written about the benefit of formal methods for developing high
integrity software -- but there are relatively few examples of successful use
of formal methods on large scale projects.  This tutorial demonstrates that
cost-effective formal software development is now possible, using Z and a
refinement approach into Ada that is supported by two tools: CADiZ and ZETA.
CADiZ supports the production and analysis of Z specifications.  ZETA supports
formal, rigorous or informal stepwise development of Ada from Z specifications
(in compliance with the UK Interim Defence Standard 00-55) in a cost-effective
way that enables the user to determine the level of rigor for the refinement.
Examples will be offered, and the tools will be demonstrated in support of the
presentation.

*** TUESDAY, 28 JUNE

evaluation and assessment of software products and processes. Particular
emphasis is given to identifying and selecting software characteristics and
metrics and the handling of evaluation methods and tools.  The impact of the
SEI Capability Maturity Model, SPICE, ISO 9000 series, ISO 12119, ISO 9126 and
the EVALUATION METHOD will be discussed in detail.

The Wall Street Journal (3/16/94, pg 1) reported that Jan Pablo Davila lost at
least $207 million of Codelco, a state-owned Chilean company by typing the
wrong financial transaction into his computer. He typed "buy" when he says he
ment to type "sell". Now, all of Chile is obsessed with the mistake that cost
0.5% of Chile's GNP and the new word "davilar" is a verb that is "...loosely
translated as 'to botch things up miserably.'"

The Washington Times (3/16/94,pg A3) reported:

  CIA sources told the Washington Times that Mr. Ames used his CIA computer to
  make unauthorized entries into computers within the espionage branch and
  downloaded information about the CIA's operations in Europe, including the
  identity of undercover agents posing as businessmen.

The story goes on to say that they'll be tightening up access to this
information in response to this problem.  But later in the story, they note
that they'll be loosening requirements for peering into the financial records
of the agents. "New legislation would be required to permit secret searches
into personal-finance and credit data without employee consent."

My prediction is that they will reverse both of these changes in a few years
when they discover that 1) some operation abroad was hampered by lack of
direct access to info at a critical time and 2) some employee was
bribed/spindled or mutilated using the data that they got by peering through
credit records.

This just illustrates the problems of maintaining secrets and building
networks of trust. The CIA has a hard job ahead of them. The folks who are
building a Clipper network and crossing their fingers that the centralized
repository won't be compromised have an even tougher one.

Clipper Compromised?
"Security Insider Report," a monthly newsletter published in Seminole, Fla., 
has reported that government officials are seeking to determine whether former 
CIA employee and alleged traitor Aldrich Ames may have sold information to the 
Russians about the government's secret key-escrow technology used in Clipper 
Chip chipsets and Capstone Tessera cards.  The secret key-escrow technology, 
dubbed Skipjack, can be used to encrypt network voice and data.

Network World, March 14, 1994, Page 2

The RISK of secret algorithms and government key escrow being compromised may 
already be 100 percent.

"Sly Imposter Robs S.F. Man of Good Name", by Catherine Bowman,
*San Francisco Chronicle*, 14 Mar 1994, p.1.

San Francisco attorney Charles Sentman Crompton II, dogged by a string
of arrest reports, mysterious credit card bills and a fake ID, is fed up and
frustrated - so frustrated, in fact, that he is taking Charles Sentman 
Crompton III to court.  [...]
Using Crompton's name, address, and Social Security number, the man has
opened charge accounts at local stores, rented an apartment and obtained
a driver's license, Crompton says.  He has allegedly run up nearly $3,000
in purchases at Macy's, Radio Shack and other stores, buying a portable
computer and other items.  [...]

  (The suspect has been repeatedly arrested and set free by local police
  for stealing cars, etc., and gave Crompton's name.)  [...]
  (The real Crompton obtains the phony Crompton's driver's license after the
  suspect drops it while fleeing from a suspicious store clerk.)  [...]

Crompton obtained a photocopy of that license, which he forwarded to the 
state Department of Motor Vehicles with a letter explaining the problem.
He then asked for a new license with a different number.

The DMV obliged.  Then in a monumental goof, the agency mailed the license
to the other Crompton.  [...]

  (The article includes a photo of the real Crompton and a physical
  description of both men.  Real Crompton states that phony Crompton could not
  possibly be a true Elvis fan like him.)

The punch line:

Crompton says he does not blame the system for allowing the case to snowball.
Still, he worries about his credit record and being fingered for crimes he
did not commit.

Hmm... I'd say that this is a built-in feature of the system.

    ---

Mike's doomsday speech:

"We are just entering the Information Age.  Those who possess the information,
those who dispense it, and those who know how to manipulate the information
will be the rulers.  Those who do not will be the peasants."

I conjecture that the DMV goof was caused by different people handling the
task of reissuing the license without communicating the nature of the problem
to each other.  One clerk dutifully issued a request for a new license, and
perhaps typed a memo explaining the problem.  Another clerk printed the
license and sent it to the address on file (along with the letter explaining
the problem, so the phony Crompton was officially tipped off in writing by the
state.)

The California DMV is one of the largest bureaucracies in the United States,
and possesses one of the largest management information systems as well.
Well-defined lines of communication to handle such exceptional situations
probably do not exist.  I'd say we're lucky it works at all for the normal
case.

One solution might be a government debugging agency.  There should be a single
office that Crompton could go to, that would work with all of the government
agencies and credit bureaus to straighten out the record.

Of course this agency would itself be a fertile ground for fraud.

A news bulletin just in: A fire in a Pacific Bell switching complex
has knocked out local phone service to most of Los Angeles, CA.

Those of us who recall the Hinsdale, IL fire of several years ago are already
aware of the significant potential single points of failure in the U.S.
telephone systems. Again, fire turns out to be the Achilles' Heel in this
case.

It is ironic that while many financial firms (including my own) have remote
disaster sites, and have had occasion to use them (we tested ours for the
first time when the World Trade Center was bombed last year), telephone
companies continue to use the "fortress" approach, beefing up security of
non-redundant phone switches, instead. It doesn't appear to be effective
enough, and fire will likely be the key element of disaster.

The newer digital small-office phone systems (such as the Northern Telecom
Meridian or NorStar units) reduce the system complexity and cost by enabling
the system to be configured from any telephone (rather than from a terminal or
other specialised interface).

While all of the critical settings are password protected, changing the
password on phone systems seems to be even less popular than managing 
computer passwords.

While waiting for some friends at a local (very) up-market Chinese restaurant 
I noticed that the convenience phone provided patrons in the waiting area was
a NorStar. Having little else to do while waiting I decided to try the
factory-default master administration password. It worked.  The surprise
was that when I turned over the phone I saw the "Installed by" sticker of
the local telco's "independent" customer premise equipment interconnect
company (i.e. not some small fly-by-night operator but the largest vendor
of such equipment in the province).

The RISK?  Reprogramming their phone switch (a) to change the password and
(b) not to ring on any (audible) extension when incoming calls arrive on 
their reservation lines could easily cost such a restaurant a significant
chunk of its income (especially on a Saturday when even finding someone
able to fix the problem once it was discovered could result in hours of 
delay, not to mention the time to type in the entire configuration again
once the memory was wiped to get around the changed password).

Just as a reminder that doctoring photos is nothing new, there is a news 
story out of the UK on CNN saying that someone confessed (on his deathbed) 
that the famous Loch Ness Monster picture was a hoax. On one hand, it reminds 
us that as much as we like to think that all we do is new, it isn't. But it 
also puts the risk in perspective and makes us think about how these risks 
have been handled in the past. Alas, they are not handled all that well.

Article by David Lyon in Canada's _Globe and Mail_, 94.03.17, p. A21:

  "Super-ID: keeping and eye on everybody."

  The author reports on Ontario government officials are considering providing
  citizens with a single universal identifier to replace the hodge-podge of
  driver's license, medical card and so on.

Key points:

o	Driving concern is fraud, especially by foreigners using Canadian
medical insurance cards for free medical care.

o	Trend towards a "surveillance society" in which it is expected that
governments and private industry have a right to as much information as they
can gather about individuals, their preferences, behaviour and movements.

o	Risks of developing and using profiles of suspect behaviour and
applying sanctions or suspicion to innocent people simply because they happen
to fit a statistical pattern.

o	Single ID allows cross-relations among disparate databanks; could
easily lead to abuse by commercial or other exploiters.

o	Countries differ in extent to which they require "papers":to be
carried by citizens.  France have used them for decades, Germans since 1987.
Britain still resisting the universal ID, including DNA fingerprints.
Australian proposal rejected in 1987.

o	Recent surveys in Canada indicate popular concern over privacy is
rising; in 1993, a "survey by Ekos Associates showed that 52 per cent of
Canadians are `extremely concerned' about privacy.  Sixty per cent claim they
have less privacy than 10 years ago, and 81 per cent of them attribute this to
computer use."

The author ends his thoughtful, concise essay with a note on who shall
determine whether a single ID is to be used.  He urges everyone to "question
the morality of the super-ID and its place in the trend toward a surveillance
society.  And we need to find out just how and why people feel threatened,
diminished or fearful about things that on other levels--security, efficiency,
convenience--seem so alluring.

The paper published this note about the author:  "David Lyon is associate
professor of sociology at Queen's University, Kingston [Ontario].  His latest
book is _The Electronic Eye: The Rise of Surveillance Society_ (University of
Minnesota Press, 1994).

An article from the Reuters News Agency appeared in Canada's _Globe and Mail_
newspaper for 94.03.17, p. A15:

"Who undressed Jessica Rabbit?"

It seems that officials at Walt Disney Co. are embarrassed because some of
their animators got a little playful with Jessica Rabbit, the sultry lead in
the semi-animated film, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"  In one scene, the
animators (or someone) removed Jessica's underwear in three frames during a
pirouette which causes her skirt to ride up around her waist.

News of this ghastly descent into depravity seems to have caused hundreds of
people to rush out and buy the $40 CD of the film, depleting stocks at many
retail outlets.  As one viewer said after the L.A. Fox TV affiliate KTTV
showed the three frames publicly on the 16th of March, "If that turned you on,
it's time to see a psychiatrist."

[Seems to me that the RISK here is quality control failure more than anything
specifically electronic.  However, given the growing dependence of animators
on computers to help overcome the drudgery of their craft, I can see all kinds
of possibilities for bored technicians or crafty hackers.  How about a new
version of Snow White--showing what she was _really_ up to with those cute
dwarves.  What about _The Lady and the Tramp--After Hours_?  Or _The
Unexpurgated Little Red Riding Hood_?]

"Ex-member of Heritage Front tells hearing of dirty tricks."

by R. Platiel (Globe and Mail reporter).

A disenchanted young former Nazi reported that the neo-Nazi Heritage Front
group broke into telephone answering devices (T.A.D.s) used by anti-racism
activists and recorded the phone numbers of correspondents.  They then passed
these numbers around among neo-Nazi supporters and harassed the victims.  She
claimed that some anti-racists were followed; others found that their
employers had received phone calls alleging that they were "Bolsheviks."

[Most T.A.D.s have a 2-digit code at best.  Not very challenging to crack.]

The new issue of Fortune contains a long article about the potential risks
of derivatives, which are complex types of financial deals that depend on
the values of certain underlying assets, such as currencies, commodities,
or composite entities like stock indexes.  The full reference is:

  Carol J. Loomis, The risk that won't go away, Fortune 129(5), 7 March
  1994, pages 40-57.

At the moment, there exist outstanding derivatives contracts on assets whose
total value is about $16 trillion dollars, about 2.5 times the United States'
GDP.  The problem is that nobody really understands how derivatives work.
They only exist in the first place because of big computers and global data
networks (see Risks 14.87).  In theory, they allow firms to manage the risks
of global business by hedging against potentially damaging fluctuations in
commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, and so forth, and
this can be a good thing.  In practice, it is difficult to do this right.
Moreover, the nature of derivative contracts entails increasing levels of
interconnection in the world financial system, with the solvency of each major
player frequently contingent on the ability of numerous other players to make
good on complex contracts.  A serious misjudgement at a large bank, on the
order of the savage losses recently incurred through bungled oil-price hedging
at the German firm Metallgesellschaft, could conceivably propagate through the
entire system.

It actually gets worse from there, as Loomis explains at some length.
Regulation is nearly nonexistent, largely because nobody knows how one *could*
regulate such things.  Reporting requirements are derisory as well.  In short,
the global economy is wound up real tight.  To be sure, market forces are
bringing an urgent profusion of risk management strategies.  The big question
is whether the prudence of individual players is adequate to prevent the total
system from collapsing in case of some exogenous event, or simply because
there's an angle nobody figures out until it's too late.

Phil Agre, UCSD

PS. The same issue of Fortune contains some advice for companies wishing to
engage in commercial activity on the Internet.

[I'm in square brackets counting risks.  LRW ]

"FAA wants to know why system sent 2 jets toward each other

A collision course alarm sounded in the Portland incident, but the equipment's
subsequent response has officials baffled A system designed to avert air
collisions sent two planes heading toward one another near Portland Int'l
Airport, and federal authorities are trying to figure out why.  The Feb. 3
incident involved an Alaska Airlines jetliner and a HorizonAir commuter jet.
Each plane was equipped with the Traffic Collision Avoidance System, which
alerts pilots to other air traffic and sounds an alarm if there is a chance of
a collision.

"The question is not whether TCAS did its job.  The question is why did the
logic of TCAS tell the upper plane to go down and the lower plane to climb,"
said Dick Meyers, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman based in Renton,
Wash.  A crash would not have resulted if the pilots had continued obeying the
instructions of the system, but the planes would have come uncomfortably
close, FAA officials said.

Alaska Airlines pilot Thomas Hedrick had been instructed by an air traffic
controller to climb to 9,000 feet and level off.  At the same time, a
HorizonAir commuter jet piloted by Brian Penwell was approaching the airport
and was instructed to descend to 10,000 feet and level off.

In both planes, the FAA-required collision avoidance alarm sounded -- a common
occurrence in the traffic-congested skies around airports -- letting the
pilots know they were too close to other aircraft.
[Risk 1 -- many false alarms.  LRW ]

Then a second alarm sounded indicating the aircraft were on a potential
collision course.  Rather than advising the pilots to level off, the system
instructed the higher-flying plane to descend below the lower-flying plane and
the lower-flying plane to climb above the other.
[Risk 2 -- uncoordinated solutions.  LRW ]

An air traffic controller noticed the HorizonAir plane descending toward the
Alaska plane and ordered the pilot to level off.

"I told him we could not because we were receiving a Resolution Advisory,"
Penwell wrote in a report filed with the FAA.  A Resolution Advisory in this
case was the system's directive to descend.
[Risk 3 -- unclear who or what is in charge.  LRW ]

Penwell said he finally saw the Alaska plane and banked to the left at about
9200 feet.  Penwell estimated that the planes came within about a mile of each
other."

An anonymous contributor recently denigrated the utility of caller ID in
stopping obscene callers, believing instead that the real purpose is to swell
the business telephone data banks.  Yet in the note it is recognized that the
uility for catching obscene callers is decreasing "as would be callers catch
on".

Forgive me, but does that mean they are modifying their behavior? If it
inconveniences them, discourages the casual obscene caller, has it not done
its task?

The risks of this logic is clear... discard a technology that is doing what it
was intended to do because someone else is making (horrors) money.

The following incidents were mentioned in the March 14, 1994 Modesto Bee.

- Laurie Powell joined an on-line service to discuss the joys and pitfalls of
raising children.  An elusive cyberstalker called Vito has threatened her
life, sent her pornographic e-mail and may be following her around the
country.

- Larry Greenberg of New York could have lost his job when someone sent his
boss a fax from a phony law firm accusing him of being a convicted rapist and
child molester.  Greenberg suspects the fax was sent by an on-line foe.

- A 14-year-old New Jersey girl was forced off the network last month after
continuing to receive unwanted computer-generated sexual images of young boys.

- Evelyn McHugh, a New Jersey housewife, discovered a Chicago man was sending
obscene messages in her name.

- A 14-year-old Boston boy disappeared after running away to meet a man in
Texas who sent him on-line love letters and airline tickets.

This has absolutely nothing to do with computers, but it is heartening to know
that our industry isn't the only one that does foolish things. -- Mark

----- Begin Included Message -----

The Farside comes to life in Oregon.

I am absolutely not making this incident up; in fact I have it all on
videotape.  The tape is from a local TV news show in Oregon, which sent a
reporter out to cover the removal of a 45-foot, eight-ton dead whale that
washed up on the beach.  The responsibility for getting rid of the carcass was
placed on the Oregon State Highway Division, apparently on the theory that
highways and whales are very similar in the sense of being large objects.

So anyway, the highway engineers hit upon the plan--remember, I am not making
this up--of blowing up the whale with dynamite. The thinking is that the whale
would be blown into small pieces, which would be eaten by seagulls, and that
would be that.  A textbook whale removal.

So they moved the spectators back up the beach, put a half-ton of dynamite
next to the whale and set it off.  I am probably not guilty of understatement
when I say that what follows, on the videotape, is the most wonderful event in
the history of the universe. First you see the whale carcass disappear in a
huge blast of smoke and flame.  Then you hear the happy spectators shouting
"Yayy!" and "Whee!" Then, suddenly, the crowd's tone changes. You hear a new
sound like "splud."  You hear a woman's voice shouting "Here come pieces
of...MY GOD!" Something smears the camera lens.

Later, the reporter explains: "The humor of the entire situation suddenly gave
way to a run for survival as huge chunks of whale blubber fell everywhere."
One piece caved in the roof of a car parked more than a quarter of a mile
away.  Remaining on the beach were several rotting whale sectors the size of
condominium units.  There was no sign of the seagulls who had no doubt
permanently relocated to Brazil.

This is a very sobering videotape.  Here at the institute we watch it often,
especially at parties. But this is no time for gaiety.  This is a time to get
hold of the folks at the Oregon State Highway Division and ask them, when they
get done cleaning up the beaches, to give us an estimate on the US Capitol.

The following appeared in the New York Times on Tuesday, March 1, front page
of the Metro Section (page B1). I haven't seen reference to this in Risks
digests since then. And if there's been anything about it since in the local
press, I've missed it.

My comments and questions:
- Anyone know more about this than appeared in the Times?
- Those with the *technical* ability to affect Board of Ed funding had no
*legal* authority to do so. The design of the system - and its security - does
not reflect the legal and political boundaries of the organizations it's
supposed to serve.
- Probably easy to overlook one budget code out of "399 different budget
categories." Unless they were informed by the administration, the agency and
personnel who actually installed the change probably didn't know its full
impact. They were "just following orders" ...
- The funds were not just "frozen" they were "transferred" to another account.
I think the technical term is "stealing"?  - The Mayor, his administration,
and the City Comptroller violated state law.  Are there computer-specific laws
they may also have broken? Wire fraud, for example?

	Giuliani Tries Electronic School-Spending Freeze, by Josh Barnabel

	Without warning the Board of Education, the Giuliani administration
  last week loaded software on a computer accounting system to block spending
  on school supplies. But the administration reversed the spending freeze
  after the Board considered legal action ...
	School officials said they discovered that the $68 million spending
  freeze had been imposed only when budget analysts ... noticed that spending
  authorizations were rejected by the city's accounting system for lack of
  funds ...
	At the direction of the Mayor and the city's Comptroller, the
  [Financial Information Services Agency] loaded new software on the city's
  accounting system after business hours on Thursday. The software sent
  instructions to the city's computers blocking spending of 90 percent of the
  available funds in 399 different budget categories for all city agencies,
  from supplies and materials, to out-of-town travel, to temporary service and
  consulting contracts.
	The software in effect froze the school system's checking accounts,
  and transferred the available balances into reserve accounts controlled by
  the Mayor ...
	The board receives less than half its money from city taxes, and is
  not required to submit its detailed line-item budget to the Mayor or the
  City for approval ...

Subject: Risk Conference - Two for the price of one!

I recently registered for the upcoming Software Engineering Institute (SEI)
Conference on Software Risk and provided my Master Card information for
billing purposes.  About a week later, I received a confirmation letter and
receipt from the SEI; two days later, I received a second confirmation letter
and receipt.

Since the registration and payment numbers were different on the two receipts,
I suspected a double booking/billing may have occurred, and called the SEI to
rectify the problem.  After looking into the situation, the SEI informed me
that I had tripped a bug in a program which resulted in my being double
registered, but *not* double billed.  They assured me that I was the only one
affected, and that the problem had indeed been resolved.

Today I received two separate invitations to participate in an upcoming
Software Engineering Process Group meeting.  I am not planning to attend this
particular event, but if anyone is interested in a "buy one, get one free"
offer, please give me a call!

Yeah, we've beaten 911 problems to death historically, but it's a change from
Clipper.  :=)

I have a friend.  His family and mine are quite close.  We call each other's
houses daily, sometimes multiple times in one day.  His phone number begins
591-1xxx.

As you guessed, about once a month, something happens with the phone company
switching, and we get 911--as a wrong number.  So far the emergency response
people have been quite nice about this, and I haven't seen any penalty-type
charges on our phone bill.

The risks:  
Aside from the obvious one, that we're discussing a safety-critical system, is
the sheer volume of calls this represents.  Ten thousand different phone
numbers could get automatically diverted to 911.  If we figure 500 hours each
month when people are awake and calling (that's 16 a day), and each one gets
redirected once a month, then 911 must be seeing a wrong number every three
minutes!

No wonder they're so nice about it...

<A HREF="/Risks/15.66.html">RISKS-15.66</A> included a brief from "Network World," which referenced a story in
the "Security Insider Report" suggesting that Aldrich Ames could have had
access to Clipper's classified SKIPJACK algorithm or Clipper keys.  A New York
Times reporter asked me about this rumor a few weeks ago, and the whole idea
struck me as so obviously absurd that I could hardly stop laughing.
Nevertheless, I did check it out with people who would know.  They confirmed
what I thought.  The whole rumor is total nonsense.

What I don't understand is why people persist is spreading rumors and
speculation that have no basis and don't even make sense.

&gt; From: "George Feil" &lt;feil@sbcm.com&gt;
&gt; A news bulletin just in: A fire in a Pacific Bell switching complex
&gt; has knocked out local phone service to most of Los Angeles, CA.

The fire's impact was considerably overstated by press accounts.  It
occurred in the downtown L.A. "Madison" C.O. complex (in particular,
LSAN-0470T), which is one of several downtown high-rise switching centers.
The fire knocked out primary and secondary power supplies that (unlike many
of the other supplies in the building, apparently) were co-located.

Failure of SS7 links caused disruption of interoffice service for
customers whose local subscriber lines were served by that office,
and wider disruption of 911 service throughout a broader portion
of the L.A. area, since the citywide 911 center is downtown.
There was also apparently some limited long-distance
access problems to some areas for some carriers.

Media and local telephone operators quickly began publicizing local
direct dial emergency numbers to offset the 911 failure.  There were 
no reports that I heard of any serious problems relating to the 911
disruption.  Some operations were switched to secondary facilities
in other areas.

Outside of the 911 problems, most areas of the city and the surrounding
metro area (except the immediate downtown area served by Madison) noticed
few obvious effects.

RSA DATA SECURITY ANNOUNCES DIGITAL SIGNATURE SOFTWARE THAT IS FREE AND LEGAL
WORLDWIDE

Information superhighway gets free tool to authenticate information;
an answer to Vice-president Gore's concerns over Internet break-ins

         ---------------------------------------------------------

Redwood City, Calif. (March 21, 1994) - RSA Data Security, Inc.  announced
today a first: digital signature software that is both free and legal
worldwide.

RSA applied for and received a "commodities jurisdiction," or CJ for a
software package called RIPEM/SIG, which was built with RSA Data Security's
RSAREF toolkit, a freeware package. A CJ, which is a ruling that the software
falls under the Commerce Department's jurisdiction as opposed to the State
Department, allows RIPEM to be freely and legally exported.  Further, RSA has
relaxed the use restrictions in its free crypto toolkit. RSAREF, and any
application built with it, may now be used in commercial settings as long as
it is not sold or used to provide a direct for-profit service.

Digital signatures are produced using the RSA cryptosystem, which is a
public-key cryptosystem.  Each user has two keys - one public and one private.
The public key can be disclosed without compromising the private key.  The RSA
cryptosystem was invented and patented in the late 1970's by Drs. Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Electronic documents can be "signed" with an unforgeable "signature" by using
a document/private-key combination to produce a signature unique to the
author/document.  Anyone, by using only RIPEM and the public key of the
author, can verify the authenticity of the document.

Applications of digital signatures are endless.  One reason that the paperless
office has never materialized is that paper must still be printed so that
handwritten signatures can be applied.  RSAREF and RIPEM solve that problem.
Expense reports, any electronic forms, administrative documents, even tax
returns can be electronically signed to speed electronic document flow and
eliminate fraud.  Information on the Internet can be signed and verified to
prevent spoofing.  Recently, unauthenticated messages at Dartmouth College
caused an important test to be cancelled; messages impersonating faculty were
sent out.

"Data mailed, posted, or put on servers on the Internet is inherently
untrustable today," said Jim Bidzos, president of RSA. "Tampering with
electronic documents takes no special skills, and leaves no trace.  With the
availability of a free, legal, and exportable tool such as RIPEM, there's no
need for such a situation to continue. It can be used by individuals,
corporations, and government agencies at no cost."

In a February 4th announcement, Vice-president Gore stated that the recent
Internet break-ins could have been prevented with digital signatures. "Here
they are," said Bidzos.  Recently, cryptography has caused clashes between
government and industry, over privacy issues, law enforcement concerns, and
export issues.  "The US government has approved this software for export,"
said Bidzos. "Clearly, it's no threat to them. And it's free."

Digital signatures can also be used to detect any virus before a program is
executed, since any change whatsoever is detected.

The RIPEM application was developed using the RSAREF toolkit by Mark Riordan
of Michigan State University. A Macintosh version, developed by Ray Lau of
MIT, the author of the popular "Stufit" program, is also available.  Versions
for DOS, Unix, and all popular platforms are supported. "PEM" stands for
Privacy Enhanced Mail, a published Internet standard for secure electronic
mail.  Other innovative applications can also be built with RSAREF and
distributed at no cost.  The full encryption-capable RIPEM is available only
in the US.

RSA digital signatures are a standard feature of Lotus Notes, the Apple System
7 Pro Operating System, Novell NetWare, Microsoft Windows at Work, Windows NT,
IBM System Security Products, DelRina PerformPro, WordPerfect InForms, SHANA
InFormed, BLOC F3 Forms, Fischer International Workflow, and numerous other
products. Over 3 million commercial products in the market today already use
RSA signatures under license from RSA Data. Other RSA licensees include
General Magic, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, Unisys, DIgital Equipment Corp,
Motorola, and numerous others.

RSA Data Security, Inc. designs, develops, markets, and supports cryptographic
solutions toolkits and products.  The company was founded by the inventors of
the RSA cryptosystem in 1982 and is headquartered in Redwood City, California.

CA-94:05                         CERT Advisory
                                 March 18, 1994
                                 MD5 Checksums

This advisory gives the MD5 checksums for a number of SunOS files, along with
a tool for checking them.  The checksums can be used to assure the integrity
of those files.

The CERT Coordination Center is distributing these checksums because of an
increasing number of incidents in which intruders who gain root access are
modifying system files to install Trojan horses.

Moreover, intruders are modifying files so that they have the same checksum as
the original file.  This is possible because the standard "sum" program that
comes with most UNIX systems was designed to detect accidental modifications
to files and is not strong enough to prevent deliberate attempts to yield a
specific checksum.  The MD5 algorithm by RSA Data Security, Inc. is
specifically designed to provide checksums that cannot be deliberately
spoofed.  We strongly recommend that sites install the MD5 software and use it
to validate system software.  More information on obtaining MD5 is given
below.

The list of checksums in Appendix B of this advisory is provided for your
convenience.  In addition, we are providing a program that can assist you in
checking your MD5 output against the values in the database.  This checksum
list is not complete.  We have begun with a number of the more common
locations for Trojan horses that we have seen in connection with the
continuing "sniffer" attacks reported in CA-94:01 "Ongoing Network Monitoring
Attacks."  We intend to work with all vendors to expand this list and make
more MD5 checksums widely available for anonymous FTP.

We encourage sites to consider installing a more complete package for
monitoring system integrity, such as Tripwire from the COAST project
(anonymous FTP on ftp.cs.purdue in "/pub/spaf/COAST/Tripwire") or the TIGER
system from TAMU (anonymous FTP on net.tamu.edu in "pub/security/TAMU").

We will maintain a file, CA-94:05.README, that will contain pointers to
additional databases and other updates as they become available.

  [The entire Advisory is in <A HREF="/Risks/15.67.html">RISKS-15.67</A>MD5.

For those with an interest in risks, the technology supplement to Forbes
magazine, Forbes ASAP, is a regular smorgasbord.  The 10/25/93 issue, for
example, includes an article about Bally's casinos' use of customer databases
to optimize their investments in "comping", the practice of offering free
drinks, hotel rooms, plane tickets, and what-not to high rollers.  Given
enough information about an individual's bets (regardless of whether they
win), a straightforward economic calculation can decide which level of 
comping is optimal.  (The full reference is: David H. Freedman, Odds man in
[Bally's Atlantic City casino], Forbes ASAP, 25 October 1993, pages 33-35.)

The problem is getting the information into the computer.  The Bally's casino
accomplishes this in two ways.  At roulette tables and the like, they simply
have someone watch the game and enter bets into a portable computer.  (This
computer can also determine how much credit to extend to a given customer.)
At the slot machines, they give each player a card with a magnetic strip that
goes into the machine for as long as the player is playing.  (They also offer
a strap to keep the card attached to your wrist, so you don't walk away from
the machine without it.)

The risks, of course, are obvious.  Rational gamblers can take advantage 
of competition between casinos, choosing the best comping deal.  But many
people are addicted to gambling, and these innovations also make it easy for
an addict on a binge to gamble away the maximum possible sum.  Furthermore, 
as the article points out, "the riot of blinking lights, the clacking of
spinning wheels, the absence of outside views or public phones -- all of this
encourages the otherwise solidly grounded visitor to lose track of time and
space, not to mention financial common sense".  Profit margins are high, and
investors are pleased.

The analogy to data-intensive marketing of cigarettes (see Risks 15.62) is
strong.  What's next?  How about a frequent drinker's club for premium brands
of liquor?  Or individualized advice for children, based on detailed family
demographics, about how to shame their parents into buying them expensive
toys?  It wouldn't be that hard.  You could actually get a toy to do the
explaining.  Each product from a given toy company would contain a single chip
with a small microprocessor, a simple RF receiver, some memory, and a speech
synthesis device.  When the toy goes through the checkout, an RF device built
into the cash register downloads the toy with a demographic profile of the
family derived from credit files pulled up through the purchase transaction.
Then, as the child plays with the toy, the toy explains to the child the
virtues of various other toys from the same company, along with suggestions
for persuasion tactics that consumer research has shown to work well on
parents in that particular market segment.  If the toys can send as well as
receive wireless data transmissions then newer toys can reprogram the older
ones.  Better yet, the child's videogame system, which will surely get its
software over phone lines in the near future, could also download all of the
child's other toys with new sales pitches, based on records of whether the
previous pitches worked, as well as the latest market research and television
and movie product tie-ins.

[From EDUPAGE...]

&gt; Problems with an automated baggage-handling system controlled by 100
&gt; computers is delaying the opening of Denver's new airport. It's the first
&gt; such system to serve an entire airport, the first to be run by distributed
&gt; desktop computers, and the first to use radio links. Despite his woes, the
&gt; contractor says the project's worth it: "Who would turn down a $193
&gt; million contract? You'd expect to have a little trouble for that kind of
&gt; money." (New York Times, 18 Mar 1994, C1)

Sure, he's getting his money -- what does he care if bugs prevent the
airport from opening?  I'd like to see the comments of the people who let
the contract in the first place.  On second thought, I probably wouldn't.
It'd probably be the usual uninformed pablum about how complex systems
"always" have a few "small" problems, and no thought given to how the
problems might have been prevented in the first place.

Anyone want to bet they hire this same guy to do the upgrade when it's needed?

Several years ago, I posted an amusing story in this journal about two
answering machines talking to each other.  It was a choice enough RISKS tidbit
to earn a place in Dunlop &amp; Kling's Compterization and Controversy.  I don't
expect my 15 minutes of fame from this next one, but it seems I'm doomed to be
the innocent witness while chatty answering machines interact with each other.

Imagine my surprise when I checked my answering machine at work and 
found a message which began "Hi, My name is [name].  I'm
not at my desk, but if you'll..." Whoa! This was the voice-mail message
of a friend.  This friend works for a certain large, blue computer 
company which shall remain nameless :-)

I was certain this was the work of a prankster for a few reasons:

1) I don't know her direct-dial number. I've don't think I've ever 
   called her at work, though I often talk with her husband who
   teaches at a nearby college.

2) We have an aging PBX.  No direct-dial to me.  Any call would
   have to be routed through our (very human) operator.

After a call to her to sic her company's phone-security cops on the
perpetrator, and one to her husband (to play the message and prove I wasn't
crazy) I had the weekend to ponder this odd event.  I realized that it's
entirely possible.

Here's how: Professor X calls my school, asks operator for my extension, gets
answering machine, hangs up. He then calls his wife, gets voicemail, and hangs
up.  His college's switchboard, though, interprets the first hangup as a
"flash," which means "forward this call to the next number I call"

The problem is a classical case of poor human-interface design -- the use of a
switchhook flash to mean "transfer this call" when a slightly-longer flash
means "hang up and give me new dialtone."

I can think of many grisly RISKs here, but for me the small but nagging one is
that my friends may have jumped to the most obvious conclusion -- that I was
the prankster.

Recently, RISKS carried a posting on how the IRS was bidding for Dialed
Number Recorders (DNRs) to record phone numbers.

The author suggested the IRS might be looking for a way to get the identity of
individuals who call for information.

Readers should be aware that DNRs record the numbers that are called out on a
target line.  They are generally used only in criminal investigations.

If the IRS wanted to get caller information, they could do what large
companies do today and get the caller ID (ANI) from each call that comes in on
an 800 line.  They would not have to go out and bid DNRs, the information is
already available for free with their 800 number.

Yesterday, leading Dutch newspaper 'De Volkskrant' reported that included into
a new bill that deals with telecommunication, is an article that will outlaw
cryptography in the Netherlands. One can apply for a waiver but they will want
to know why you want to use cryptography, and they want your keys.

It looks like the Dutch government is trying to slip this one behind the
backs of the voters just before the elections in may. Most stunning was that
the Green party and others considered the issue 'a matter of little
importance' and were not willing to do anything about it.

Lucklily the proposal is still in draft state, which means there is still time
to get something done about it, but only if people are made aware of the
consequences of such a law.

In "Funny Money" (_THE SCIENCES_ 34(2):6, March/April 1994), Brian Mono writes
about counterfeiting using off-the shelf hardware and software.  Nothing very
new for RISKS readers, but it's a good one-page summary of the problem for
novices.  In brief:

o	A report published in the autumn of 1993 by the National Research
Council warns that the U.S. government has not kept up with technology used by
amateurs to print counterfeit money.

o	Scanners, computers, colour printers and colour copiers [the
distinctions among all of these devices are fading fast] tempt more people
today to print small amounts of money.

o	Traditionally, counterfeiters have been few and concentrated in a few
areas such as New York City.  Casual counterfeiters are the opposite: many
people over an enormous area.

o	In 1991, there were about $6-$8 million of counterfeit money detected
by officials in the U.S. (only ~0.003% of the the Federal Reserve System's
yearly total of $265 billion in currency handled).

o	"The dollar amount of scanned and color-copied fakes has doubled in
each of the past three years...."

o	All countermeasures contemplated by the government must include
consideration of backward compatibility: money-changing machines and business
people have to be able to use both the older bills and whatever new ones
appear.

o	Some recent countermeasures have had little effect; e.g., many bills
have "so-called security threads, metallic polyester strips inscribed with USA
and the denomination of the bill."  Unfortunately, "hardly anyone outside the
Treasury Department is aware of their existence."

o	Proposed countermeasures include colour-shifting ink and aliasing (a
technique that tricks photographic reproduction machines into printing a line
along the intersections of sets of parallel lines which are offset from each
other at a particular angle).  Holograms are also a practical possibility to
deter amateurs.

o	One proposal from the NRC is that every copy machine print its serial
numbers on every copy it produces.  This technology is already in place in
Xerox Corporation's "MajestiK" colour photocopiers.  However, many observers
are concerned about privacy issues.  Norbert S. Baer, a member of the NRC
committee, asked, "Would the Pentagon Papers have been leaked if
identification numbers were implanted on them?"

[MK thinking out loud: AI pattern recognition algorithms coupled with a
library of currency images could permit a smart copier to blank out all
attempts to photocopy money.  Such a technique would drive criminal hackers
wild with the uncontrollable urge to crack the protection codes and actually
make the poor machine _print_ the currency images.  So the currency images
would have to be one-way encrypted.  But then the criminal hackers would try
to decrypt the images.  So there would have to be a cryptographically-sound
checksum that could permit identification but not reproduction.

A quick note to RISKS readers about a peripherally related subject--genetic
counselling.  This is a technique which far antedates computers, but today's
Human Genome Project is heavily computer-dependent for data collection,
analysis and storage of enormous amounts of information.

In a recent article (* see below), Robert Cook-Degan summarizes some of the
problems we face with the growing ability to detect "bad" genes before birth
as well as afterwards.  Should everyone know about their own genetic defects?
Always?  Sometimes?  What are the principles upon which to decide?  Who should
be allowed to know about _your_ personal genetic makeup?  Do employers have a
right to know that your family carries the gene for Huntington's chorea, which
leads to uncontrollable movements and frank insanity in middle life?  Do
insurance companies have a right to reject an applicant for life insurance
because of a family history of diabetes, breast cancer and alcoholism?

There's a section of the political debate between those who argue for abortion
of severely affected embryos (extremists argue for eugenic screening) versus
those who argue for a more inclusive, accepting, less demanding society that
can live with physical differences (extremists deny the existence of handicaps
of any kind).

Interesting reading.  It will be of special interest to those concerned about
personal privacy in the computer age.

In _THE SCIENCES_ 34(2):4 (March/April 1994), Derek Coleman writes about the
problem of interpreting machine-readable formatted text in archives.
Technology changes so fast that an archive created a decade ago may be
unreadable by programs running today.

Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  SGML includes standard
English-language tags (e.g., &lt;title&gt;, &lt;author&gt;, &lt;bold&gt; and so on) that can
easily by converted to any specific typesetting or word-processing system
using a table-driven program (input string -&gt; output string) or macro
facility.

Using SGML, one converts today's text into standard ASCII.  As long as the
storage medium is physically readable (something that can be ensured by
appropriate conversion over the years), SGML will permit a readable copy
including enhancements to be prepared at any time on any platform.

UK customs officers have just been issued by the banking industry with magnetic
card readers. The idea is that they will check suspects' plastic cards to make
sure that the magnetic strip details tie up with those embossed on the card
face. This is reported in a recent issue of `Banking Technology'.

Not only are faults in magnetic strips fairly common, but poor maintenance of
card readers has caused problems in the past. I have advised one man in the USA
who is suing his bank after being arrested for altering the magnetic strip on 
his credit card. It turned out that he had not done this; the read head in the 
merchant terminal was probably misaligned, but in any case there was an alarm 
from the bank which the police took at face value. In the event, it took him 
about a year to slog through the banks' denials, get access to the card and 
have it tested by VISA to prove his innocence.

The risk to travellers is that some defect, whether in your card or in the 
customs man's reader, could get you arrested for fraud. If you are not resident
in the UK, the courts might well refuse bail and keep you in jail for a year or
more awaiting trial. If you are lucky, the Home Office might just deport you; 
but even this might be serious if you have relatives or other interests here.

I just saw a report of a press release from Dassault Automatismes Et
Telecommunications, a French company that makes automated teller machines,
about their new secure indoor lobby ATMs. The spokesperson is quoted:

"What a lot of people don't realize is that, if a thief tries to use
 a card which has been stolen, our ATMs are programmed to lock
 the doors and call the police. Not only is the customer secure
 from muggers, but the lobby ATM prevents card fraud,"

So if you use one of their cards, you had better hope that there are no
data entry errors when a card with an account number similar to yours is
reported stolen. And will a bank be careful to verify that it is really you
calling to report your card as stolen and not someone who has decided to
make trouble for you?

I enjoyed the story told by Robert Telka (<A HREF="/Risks/15.65.html">RISKS-15.65</A>) but think there is more
to be learned from this almost comical series of events than "you are never
prepared enough".  The RISKS are procedural rather than technical, but still
related to IT.

The disk crashes caused Company P to be without IT services for several weeks.
This surely cost them a tidy sum.  Yet, recourse against the Plant Manager,
who was the senior staff member on the scene, is limited as the "rule" he
broke is unwritten.  Should the manager be sacked, any lawyer worth their salt
would make a good case for unfair dismissal.  "Unwritten rules" can be broken
as long as one doesn't do it in writing :-) . The RISK is that staff members
may not comply with the spirit.  (They obviously can't comply with the text.)

Furthermore, the fact that both the primary and backup disks were in the same
cabinet raises serious concerns about the contingency plans of the company.
Contingency plans are often written for specific scenarios, when in practice
nasty events such as these are never so neatly packaged.  The RISK is that IT
people are optimistic, causing them to underestimate threats, while Murphy is
an absolute S.O.B.  I would speculate that company IT management did not
consider all aspects of a head crash -- obviously cabinet movement would be a
likely cause....

IMO, the computer site should have been treated with more care and
respect, since it was used by the sales force and other plants.
RISK:  You lose your sales computer, maybe you lose your business.

Commentary on my earlier note on punctuation and the resulting errors in
spelling.

I have now received sufficient private and public messages to indicate that my
knowledge of the history of punctuation and English orthography is seriously
deficient: a clear example of the RISK that a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing. So, please disregard my explanation of the origin of the confusion
between the spelling of words of possession or that are contractions.

In my defense, however (the never-give-up defense), I still wish to argue
that spelling errors are a result of what would amount to "poor design"
were language and spelling actually designed.

the average speaker of English doesn't know the historical development of
punctuation symbols or spelling and so is forced either to memorize
apparently arbitrary and conflicting rules and examples or to construct a
mental model that makes sense of the underlying structure. In my case, I
constructed a mental model that has served me well in avoiding the common
confusions among "its" and "it's." Alas, when I shared that model with you,
the more scholarly among you were able to demolish its validity. This
doesn't change the main thrust of the argument: were English punctuation
and spelling designed with usability in mind rather than reflecting the
complex evolutionary factors of its historical and technological
development, we would have had less spelling confusions, especially of the
its-it's variety. I'll back down and apologize about my scholarship, but
not about the main point.

Animators have been putting 'easter eggs' like this into films almost since
"Steamboat Willie"; it's an industry in-joke. In addition to the scene with
Jessica Rabbit, there are also claims that a couple frames of the scene with
Betty Boop were retouched, and that in the scene in the rest room, the phone
number in the graffiti "For a good time, call Allisyn Wonderland XXX-XXXX" is
the real phone number for one of the head animators.

In fact, I think that it may be that slipping a few frames like this into an
animated production may have been easier when the shooting was all done by
hand -- you just swapped a couple of reworked character cels for the regular
ones while you're shooting a stack of cels onto film; when the tweening and
coloring and 'cel' combination is all done electronically, there's more work
involved in getting everything into the computer so you can tell it 'use
_this_ set of character cels in frames X through Y instead of the pregenerated
character cel sequence' without it being noticed.

In my opinion, anybody who takes this seriously deserves to.

Is there any interest in yet another ATM contribution? This one has all the
familiar elements plus a reward for honesty to at least one of the
participants (but not the other). Here are extracts from a newspaper story.
[Mark Connolly, Connolly Design Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada]

  Bank machine runs amok; Honest customer returns bag full of cash
  SouthamStar Network

  EDMONTON -- All Barry Inkster wanted when he slipped his bank card into the
automated teller was $200 to shop for a birthday gift for his wife. Instead he
got a Las Vegas-style payoff when the machine spat out nearly $5,000 in $20
bills ... "I grabbed all the money in a great big wad and walked to a doughnut
shop and asked them to give me a bag."... Inkster said he's been ripped off by
automated tellers in the past, only to be told by bank personnel that machines
don't make mistakes. ... the machine had been causing problems all weekend ...
a number of people complained ... the machine was subtracting their
withdrawals, but not handing out any money.  ... No one from the bank was
available for comment. A repair crew worked on the machine Monday morning but
obviously it didn't fix all the problems ...  Inkster called the bank, took
the money back and watched the tellers count about $4,800. ... "All I was
concerned about was if the transaction had taken $5,000 out of my account."
The bank assured him it hadn't. Inkster said he was well rewarded with a pen,
key chain and free dinner for his honesty.

  Disaster Checks (By ROBERT GREENE, AP Farm Writer)

  WASHINGTON (AP, 22 Mar 1994) -- The glitches stole Christmas from many Dade
  County, Fla., growers expecting disaster payments from the Agriculture
  Department.  Because of processing errors, many checks for those who
  suffered losses in Hurricane Andrew have been held up for three months.

The author explains that about 5,000 cheques (a total of about $25 million)
were to have been mailed in December.  However, staffers found serious errors
such as a $140,000 overpayment.  As a result of procedural and computer bugs,
"Of the $24.8 million in payments, $14 million has been reissued. And so far,
$1.8 million worth of payments has been canceled.  Another $11 million in
payments remains on hold."

  Survey: few merchants check conflicting credit-card signatures
  written by Peg Byron, edited by Harold H. Martin, in New York 

  NEW YORK (UPI, 21 Mar 1994) -- Credit-card fraud may get an unintentional
  boost from retailers, Money magazine reported Monday in a survey that found
  95 percent of clerks and cashiers they tested failed to check signatures on
  charged purchases.  Money magazine said signatures for purchases that
  conflicted with the name on the credit card seldom caused clerks or cashiers
  to check for fraud.

The article continues with details of the experiment.  Staffers used the wrong
cards or signed false names in 127 cases (they had letters authorizing them to
perform the experiment).

Only 5% of the store employees checked the signatures at all.  "In one case, a
male Money editor was not questioned even when he used a woman's card to
charge a $114 meal in a New York restaurant and signed the credit slip `Daffy
Duck.'"

The cost of such fraud, entirely passed on to consumers, is about $55 per card
user in the U.S.

Early last month, our local phone company (US West) replaced our "aging"
analog telephone switch with a new digital one, which was designed to bring us
"into the information age".

Well, no sooner was the switch installed, people started having problems
connecting to our dial-in service for home terminal support.  The current
system consists of a front-end box (made by Traqnet) and a Cisco terminal
server.

The problems seemed to be widespread but intermittent:

- Dropped connections
- Can't connect at 14.4 KB (drops back to 1200!)
- Can't connect at all

After some lengthy (and still ongoing) investigation, the problem
turned out to be that the time bases of 3 digital switches
involved are not in sync! The 3 are:

- The Rochester switch (run by US West)
- The IBM Rochester Local ROLM switch (local PBX)
- The NPN Switch (which connects IBM to the corp network run by Advantis, Inc)

Comments from our local communications rep:

"I have been told that there are 3 national master clocks. Each phone
company must sync their digital switch with one of these master clocks."

"U.S. West's switch is sync'd with a master, I don't know which."

"NPN's switch is sync'd with a master too, this may be the same master
that U.S. West is sync'ing to but, this is not important yet."

"Our ROLM switch is sync'd with NPN and cannot be changed."

BTW, the problem "seems" to be getting worse as time passes.

It would seem to me that this could become a widespread problem as more DSS's
are used. Is someone causes a master clock to become out of step, then you
could (potentially) disrupt communications over wide areas.

The following letter to the editor appeared in the March 23rd Globe and
Mail; a very eloquent response to what must have been a very upsetting
article.  

Another illustration of how the most noble of programming intentions can
backfire in the most unexpected ways due to an unforeseen bug:

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Letter header:  Software bug led to misunderstanding

     I was distressed to read Mark Charendoff's essay Dear WordPerfect: 
I'm A Jew (Facts and Arguments -- March 8).  Mr. Charendoff expressed
dismay that Grammatik, WordPerfect's grammar and style checker, responded
to the noun "Jew" with the message "Avoid this offensive term."
     Mr. Charendoff's dismay is understandable.  The message is absurd in
that context.  It was intended for "jew" used as a verb (e.g., "he jews
them down").  Grammatik's extensive dictionary contains two entries for
"Jew"; one, capitalized, for the noun, and another, labelled "offensive,"
for the lower-case verb.  When "Jew" or "Jews" occurs as the first word of
a sentence, a bug in the program is calling the lower-case entry instead
of the correct upper-case one.  Ergo, the message is erroneously output.
     The bug will be fixed.  Its appearance in a program that I helped
develop and am proud of is upsetting enough.  That it resulted from our
sincere efforts to identify and eliminate ethnic slurs troubles the whole
Grammatik development team.
     But other aspects of the situation disturb me personally as well. 
Please note that the opinions below are my own, not necessarily shared by
WordPerfect Corp.
     Mr. Charendoff remarks that many Jews he spoke with about this
argued that "Jew" really is an offensive term.  They tried to find some
rationalization for the message.  That troubles me.  A word which
identifies a whole heritage, a word as valid as "Protestant," "Buddhist,"
"Italian," or "Canadian," does not become offensive just because bigots
use it, whether to demean or even to decimate.  When Jews bend to that
point of view, they reflect the confusion of a people that has survived
oppression, only to be left with shame about its identity.
     The automatic assumption by Mr. Charendoff and others that the
message was an intentional racial putdown, not a mistake, bothers me too. 
Bugs occur often in software programs, especially those as complex as
Grammatik.  Parsing English is not easy.  Granted, a bug involving one's
religion may be hard to recognize as just an error.  Although I wish he
had written to us rather than The Globe and Mail, I cannot really blame
Mr. Charendoff for his indignation.
     Grammatik's goal has always been to help users find and fix problems
in their writing.  We think we have had good success so far, and we are
constantly working to improve our performance.  We are grateful that this
mistake has been found so that we can correct it.  But I would like the
record to be clear -- this bug resulted from trying to eliminate
prejudice, not propagate it.
     Note:  I come from a family of Orthodox Jews.  Most of the members
of my family who survived the Second World War now live in Toronto.

It gets even more interesting...

The 7 Mar 1994 issue of *Aviation Week* has a story on the airport's
yet-again-delayed opening. The hangup is indeed the complex automated
baggage-handling system. The article says that the underlying problem is
simply that system testing has not been completed in time, but it also
describes some specific problems that have arisen. One is that:

"When United ran its tests, ticket counter agents were generating on-line
printed baggage tags too rapidly, causing United's Apollo computer
reservations system to communicate improper data to [the baggage system
manufacturer's] baggage sorting computers. As a result, properly tagged
luggage were being routed to a manual hold station instead of the aircraft,
according to [the manufacturer's president]. 'It was mostly a training
glitch,' he said. After the agents slowed down, the system operated nominally,
he said."

While it's not entirely clear what "generating tags too rapidly" means here
from the limited information given, one can envision various ways in which
problems might arise. For those of us who spend all too much time in airport
waiting lines, though, it's naturally disconcerting to hear that the system
design requires the agents to work more slowly than they would like to!

It's even more disconcerting, however, to hear this described as a "training
glitch," rather than a system design problem. My first reaction was to
classify this as a typical case of blaming the user rather than the builder
for problems in system design or implementation. Consider the following
analogy, though: Airport check-in agents put luggage on a conveyor belt for
dispatch to the baggage-handling area. Suppose there were a problem with
agents "putting bags on the belt too rapidly" (i.e., piling bags on top of
each other so that they fell off the belt or jammed the mechanism). Assuming
that the belt speed was reasonably specified (based on other considerations),
wouldn't it be proper to classify that as a training or procedural problem? Is
that different from the overly-speedy tag printing?

Of course it is, and therein lies the key point. It's visually obvious what
the proper placement of the bags on the belt should be; is it also obvious
when the next acceptable tag-printing moment arrives? Suppose, only for the
sake of argument, that other reasonable design constraints sometimes produce a
significant communications delay between the two systems; that delay might
result in the reservation system being able to print a baggage tag which the
baggage system was not yet able to handle. In that case the real problem lies
in not showing the agents that the overall system was not ready to print a tag
or accept a bag. If, in fact, the agents can "generate tags too rapidly," then
there is almost certainly something other than a "training glitch" at work.
One might think either that the data generation or interchange timing is not
as it should be or that the design of the agents' terminals does not
adequately portray or control the effect of such possible timing problems.

	One thing that's particularly fascinating is that many of the problems
they are facing (conveyor problems, zebra tags getting ripped and damaged,
etc) are problems that Federal Express and UPS have apparently already solved.
I suppose UPS and Federal Express have the advantage that they can enforce
packaging size limits and so forth, but it seems to me that one of the big
RISKS we're seeing here is the ever-present danger of not doing your research.

You won't hear much griping from the politicians because *they* are the ones
to blame for the delay.  After the contract was signed, Denver kept asking for
change after change to the luggage system.  Nobody can develop a system on
time and on budget if what they're developing keeps getting redefined!

On top of that, Denver made certain technical promises (e.g., a "clean" power
supply) which it has been unable to fulfill.  This directly lead to the
failure of some of the early tests; a power surge would blow out circuitry,
overrun motors, etc.

&gt;It'd probably be the usual uninformed pablum about how complex systems
&gt;"always" have a few "small" problems, and no thought given to how the
&gt;problems might have been prevented in the first place.

It's pretty clear that Denver has a lot of airheads at the new airport.  My
favorite design flaw was the massive water sculpture directly over the main
power transformers... requiring a large stainless steel catch basin.

Another good one (not directly related to the airport) was the initial
proposal that one-way bus fare from Boulder to the airport would run about
$17.  In contrast, the current bus fare from Boulder to Stapleton is about
$2.50.  (The increase in distance would be about 30%).  Toss in high taxi
fares, and high car parking fees, and most people would choose to have a
spouse or friend drop them off and pick them up.  The impact on air quality is
obvious.

Just remember, the mayor of Denver who pushed this monstrosity on us is now
the Secretary of Transportation.

&gt;MK thinking out loud: AI pattern recognition algorithms coupled with a
&gt;library of currency images could permit a smart copier to blank out all
&gt;attempts to photocopy money.

It already exists.  Xerox demonstrated it I think within the past year or two.
When given money (both US and many non-US), it ignores it, and you end up with
a blank spot on the paper.

The risks are obvious (to me, at least) and many.

The new versions of the Canon Color Laser Copiers, the CLC 350 and CLC 550
(replacing the former CLC 300 and CLC 500) have exactly this type of

Such photocopiers are already in existence. I remember a demonstration in
the German "Knoff-hoff" TV show (an entertainment show dealing with
popular-science topics; and yes, the name is indeed derived from "know how")
about one or two years ago. On the occasion of the introduction of new
Deutsch-Mark bills at that time, the host explained the techniques that
were used to make the bills counterfeit-proof. He finally concluded the
discussion by taking a bank-note out of his wallet and laying it on a
photocopier that he announced to be one of the latest inventions regarding
the growing problem of counterfeit by use of those rapidly spreading
color copiers. He pressed the button, not forgetting to mention smilingly
that he was only allowed to do so because they had obtained a special
permission and with police officers sitting in the first row of the
audience, watching closely. What the machine produced was a verbatim
copy of the bill but with colors changed to brilliant pop art. The host
then showed a microchip that was the nucleus of the device that was said
to recognize some dozens of bills from various currencies.

I would not expect such a chip to contain any such thing as protection
codes to activate/deactivate the pattern recognition circuit, but instead
a non-alterable read-only memory holding the images of the bills. So the
difficulty isn't to protect the chip against being cracked but to prevent
that its inhibiting output signal be disabled by means of a simple short
cut. This can only be accomplished if some part of the system that is
essential to the copying process is incorporated within that same
microchip. The system has to be designed in such a manner that you cannot
get the copier working without that chip so that it has the power to decide
whether or not to copy. On the other hand, little can be done against a
criminal attempt to replace the entire electronic control circuit board.

A more severe problem seems to be the fact that every once in a while new
bills keep coming up which the device wouldn't yet be able to recognize. This
requires that it is ensured that of every such existing copying machine the
built-in firmware be updated (by replacing the chip with a newer version)
every time when new notes are introduced with (at least) any of the leading
currencies in the world.

&gt;In my defense, however (the never-give-up defense), I still wish to argue
&gt;that spelling errors are a result of what would amount to "poor design"
&gt;were language and spelling actually designed.

	How can something that wasn't "designed" be an example of poor design?

	Languages evolve (with exceptions like volapuk and esperanto) rather
than being created from whole cloth by some rational process.  Obsoleting a
"living" language is a lot harder than fixing a programming language -- the
installed base is potentially huge. Some legacy systems still actively
communicate using Latin.

	English, with all its commas and apostrophes and other bits of charm,
is the result of a process of *translation* between the street English of the
day and an approximation of written English. If I tried to write some of the
street speech from my neighborhood in ascii, it might look a lot like,
"yo'm'a, cah yuh spa' me a qua'tuh?"  Unlike compiled languages used by
computers, spoken languages don't *NEED* to be designed and probably never
will (the feelings of L'Academie Francaise aside).

	Human minds are flexible enough to cope with the vagaries of "badly
designed" languages. Spelling mistakes are a result of inattention to detail,
ignorance, or apathy. The good news is that generally, the listener/reader
will relatively painlessly absorb the error, rather than dumping core or
giving a cryptic error like my compiler does when I forget punctuation.

   THIS EXPLICITLY MARKED APRIL FOOL'S PIECE IS INCLUDED NOT FOR
   ITS SURPRISE VALUE, BUT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.  PGN]

Subject: April Fools on the Senate

Hello ACE,

In the April issue of PC Computing, John Dvorak's column describes a Senate
Bill, supposedly introduced by Senator Leahy and co-sponsored by Sen. Kennedy,
to keep people from being intoxicated on the information highway.  The column
is an April Fools hoax and I'm sure plenty of people will find it amusing (see
below).
  
Unfortunately there are also people that are actually believing it to be true.
Our office has received several calls from outraged constituents and I
understand Leahy's staff has as well.  I originally received the article via
e-mail, and I understand that the on-line rumors are flying leading some
people to learn about it without the benefit of the actual article (which when
read closely, reveals the hoax).

Congress has taken some great forwards steps recently, particularly through
the availability of the Senate and House gophers (gopher.senate.gov,
gopher.house.gov) and it would be unfortunate if people weren't aware of them.
I share this with ACE in hopes that you can help quash any of these on-line
rumors if you see them.  Feel free to put people in touch with me if they'd
like to hear more about what's happening in the cyber-Capitol :-)

Thanks for any help.  I enjoy April Fools gags, but a lot of folks just aren't 
getting this one! 

Regards,

Chris

   [RISKS MODERATOR'S NOTE:  THE FOLLOWING ITEM IS REPRODUCED IN THE
   RISKS FORUM WITH THE KIND PERMISSION OF THE AUTHOR, WHO HAS HIMSELF
   RECEIVED SEVERAL CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED THE SPOOFINESS.  John 
   is quite well known for his annual spoofs.  He noted to me that there 
   are (at least) four clues herein.  (See if you can find them, but
   don't bother informing RISKS.)  As we approach the big day, I note
   that this piece is akin to the 1984 Chernenko spoof (due to Piet 
   Beertema) and the "Spafford" spoof (due to Chuck von Rospach), the 
   latter (see <A HREF="/Risks/6.52.html">RISKS-6.52</A>, 1 April 1988) fully laden with self-referential 
   clues.  PGN]

&gt;Trust Congress? Not With This Unbelievable Lair of Slop
&gt;PC Computing, April 1994, page 88.
&gt;By John C. Dvorak
&gt;
&gt; When Vice President Gore began talking about the Information Highway,
&gt; we all knew the bureaucrats would get involved more than we might
&gt; like. In fact, it may already be too late to stop a horrible Senate
&gt; bill from becoming law.
&gt;
&gt; The moniker -- Information Highway -- itself seems to be responsible
&gt; for SB #040194. Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, it's designed to
&gt; prohibit anyone from using a public computer network (Information
&gt; Highway) while the computer user is intoxicated. I know how silly this
&gt; sounds, but Congress apparently thinks that being drunk on a highway
&gt; is bad no matter what kind of highway it is. The bill is expected to
&gt; pass this month.
&gt;
&gt; There already are rampant arguments as to how this proposed law can
&gt; possibly be enforced. The FBI hopes to use it as an excuse to do
&gt; routing wiretaps on any computer if there is any evidence that the
&gt; owner "uses or abuses alcohol and has access to a modem." Note how it
&gt; slips in the word 'uses'. This means if you've been seen drinking one
&gt; lone beer, you can have your line tapped.
&gt;
&gt; Because this law would be so difficult to enforce, police officials
&gt; are drooling over the prospect of easily obtaining permits to do
&gt; wiretaps. Ask enforcement officials in Washington and they'll tell you
&gt; the proposed law is idiotic, but none will oppose it. Check the
&gt; classified ads in the "Washington Post" and you'll find the FBI,
&gt; National Security Agency, and something called the Online Enforcement
&gt; Agency (when did they set that up?) all soliciting experts in phone
&gt; technology, specifically wiretapping.
&gt;
&gt; It gets worse. The Congressional Record of February 19, 1994, has a
&gt; report that outlines the use of computerized BBSes, Internet,
&gt; Inter-Relay Chat, and CompuServe CB as "propagating illicit sexual
&gt; encounters and meetings between couples -- any of whom are
&gt; underage...Even people purporting to routinely have sex with animals
&gt; are present on these systems to foster their odd beliefs on the
&gt; public-at-large." A rider on SB #040194 makes it a felony to discuss
&gt; sexual matters on any public-access network, including the Internet,
&gt; America Online, and CompuServe.
&gt;
&gt; I wondered how private companies such as America Online can be
&gt; considered public-access networks, so I called Senator Barbara
&gt; Boxer's office and talked to an aide, a woman named Felicia. She said
&gt; the use of promotional cards that give away a free hour or two of
&gt; service constitutes public access. You know, like the ones found in the
&gt; back of books or in modem boxes. She also told me most BBS systems
&gt; fall under this proposed statute. When asked how they propose to
&gt; enforce this law, she said it's not Congress's problem.  "Enforcement
&gt; works itself out over time," she said.
&gt;
&gt; The group fighting this moronic law is led by Jerome Bernstein of the
&gt; Washington law firm of Bernstein, Bernstein and Knowles (the firm that first
&gt; took Ollie North as a client). I couldn't get in touch with any of the
&gt; co-sponsors of the bill (including Senator Ted Kennedy, if you can believe
&gt; it!), but Bernstein was glad to talk. "These people have no clue about the
&gt; Information Highway or what it does. The whole thing got started last
&gt; Christmas during an antidrinking campaign in the Washington D.C., metro
&gt; area," Bernstein said, "I'm convinced someone jokingly told Leahy's office
&gt; about drunk driving on the Information High and the idea snowballed. These
&gt; senators actually think there is a physical highway. Seriously, Senator Pat
&gt; Moynihan asked me if you needed a driving permit to 'drive' a modem on the
&gt; Information Highway! He has no clue what a modem is, and neither does the
&gt; rest of Congress."
&gt;
&gt; According to Bernstein, the antisexual wording in the bill was
&gt; attributed to Kennedy's office. "Kennedy thought that technology was
&gt; leaving him behind, and he wanted to be perceived as more up-to-date
&gt; technologically. He also though this would make amends for his alleged
&gt; philandering."
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the public is not much better informed than the
&gt; Senate.  The Gallup Organization, at the behest of Congress, is
&gt; polling the public regarding intoxication while using a computer and
&gt; online "hot chatting." The results are chilling. More than half of the
&gt; public thinks that using a computer while intoxicated should be
&gt; illegal! The results of the sexuality poll are not available. But one
&gt; question, "Should a teenage boy be encouraged to pretend he is a girl
&gt; while chatting with another person online?" has civil rights activists
&gt; alarmed. According to Kevin Avril of the ACLU, "This activity doesn't
&gt; even qualify as virtual cross-dressing. Who cares about this stuff?
&gt; What are we going to do? Legislate an anti-boys-will-be-boys law? It
&gt; sets a bad precedent."
&gt;
&gt; I could go on and on with quotes and complaints from people regarding
&gt; this bill. But most of the complaints are getting nowhere. Pressure
&gt; groups, such as one led by Baptist ministers from De Kalb County,
&gt; Georgia, are supporting the law with such vehemence that they've
&gt; managed to derail an effort by modem manufacturers (the biggest being
&gt; Georgia-based Hayes) to lobby against the law. "Who wants to come out
&gt; and support drunkenness and computer sex?" asked a congressman who
&gt; requested anonymity.
&gt;
&gt; So, except for Bernstein, Bernstein, and Knowles, and a few members of
&gt; the ACLU, there is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law. You
&gt; can register your protests with your congressperson or Ms. Lirpa Sloof
&gt; in the Senate Legislative Analysts Office.  Her name spelled backward
&gt; says it all.

My records show this happened on 22 February 1994.
The risks we take using computers are one thing, but the risks government
officials take when talking about computers are extreme.  Here I am, at home
watching CSPAN.  The entire morning is devoted to the new regulations from the
Federal Communications Commission concerning cable television.  I find it
quite interesting.  Then the chairman of the FCC shows up in a news
conference.  He answers questions about the new rules and regulations.  The
chairman of the FCC then opines that information about and from the FCC will
appear on the "Information Superhighway".  He says to connect to ftp.fcc.gov
What follows is a near a quote as I remember his words: "G O V stands for
government.  F C C stands for [long pause] F C C.  I don't know what F T P
stands for."  Remember, this is the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission speaking live on CSPAN.  === Being a curious person, I made the
connection to ftp.fcc.gov and as of that morning, no FCC files were available
for FTP.  However, one directory, bearing a name which may have been the
initials of a system operator at the FTP site had something in it.  One file,
a GIF picture of actress Erika Eleniak, wearing most of her clothing, was
available for FTP.  So I grabbed it.  As of today (28 March) that directory
does not appear on the system, but there are directories containing FCC stuff.

Unlike [many others], I dutifully filed an IRS Form 942 for a nanny we
employed in the first quarter of 1992.  Unfortunately, my calculations were
too high by a dollar; I suspect human error.

The ever-vigilant IRS computer found my mistake and issued a $1.01 refund
check within a month, even adding that penny for interest.  Something about
having a $1.01 government check really tickled me, so I decided to just keep
it instead of cashing it.  Since the check expires after a year, I figured I
was doing my part to reduce the deficit.

This week, two years later, I get _another_ check for $1.01, with the same
notation ("F-942 REF 03/92") as the previous check. I'm not cashing this one
either; now I want to find out how badly they want to give me this money.

The current issue of New Scientist (26 March 1994, p. 19) includes an article
following up from the one I quoted (<A HREF="/Risks/15.56.html">RISKS-15.56</A>, 17 February 1994: Telephone
charges fail to fit the bill) regarding the overcharging on some telephone
bills in multiples of \pounds 420.

  ``Human error, not computer failure, was to blame for British Telecom's
  recent overcharging of some subscribers.  BT says that each case of
  incorrect billing was caused by ``an extremely unlikely combination of two
  human errors''.  The findings exonerate the computers, but indicate that BT
  staff sometimes ignore odd discrepancies in bills.

  The first error arose when an engineer working on a new digital exchange
  broke house rules and used a procedure borrowed from old analogue exchanges.
  He sent a handwritten note to BT's billing department, asking it to log the
  meter reading as zero on its computer.  The computer's software registers
  the last four digits of the meter reading, and on being given a reading
  ending in a string of zeros it deduced that the meter reading must have
  risen past 9,999 to 10,000.  When the time came to prepare the bill, the
  computer then took the same logic a stage further and added together two
  spurious quantities: one from the last real reading up to 10,000, and one
  from zero to the new reading.  Each unit costs 4.2p, leading to an
  overcharge of \pounds 420.

  The second error came when BT's automatic verification system correctly
  highlighted these figures as inordinately high compared with past readings
  on the same line.  But BT's staff ignored the warning and dispatched the
  bill, complete with errors.''

New Scientist made no reference to their last sentence of the original
article: ``[Insiders] believe that BT has a bug in its accounting software and
that the problem is thus much more widespread than has so far been
recognised.''

&gt;From the article as I understand it, it seems that the computer software has
difficulty in making the distinction between freshly reset meter readings, and
normal `clocked' meter readings.  This could be explained cleanly if it was
not possible (or unnecessary or difficult) to reset the meters of old analogue
exchanges.  The move to digital exchanges would therefore either need a change
in the software or a change in the procedures.  Ignoring my suppositions,
though, the system (including personnel and computers) is designed correctly
to cope with both analogue and digital exchanges.

I just got off the phone with my prescription plan holder, trying to find out
why my son Jason's deductible had not been fulfilled.  I picked up a
prescription for him last week and had to pay the full $43.95 cost of the
medicine.  My plan has a $50 deductible per family member but I was sure that
he had had several other prescriptions since the beginning of the plan year.
I check my records and, sure enough, the prescriptions totaled more than $50.
After checking back with the pharmacy, it was determined that although the
Jason's name was on the prescription, the prescription had gone toward
fulfilling my other son Graham's deductible.  The pharmacist had entered the
wrong code (02 rather than 03).  However, I was also sure that Graham had had
several prescriptions filled, so his deductible should already have been
fulfilled.  Further checking showed that Graham's prescriptions had been
charged toward my deductible (my code is 00).

Talking to the prescription plan representative on the phone, I declared that
this was a stupid way to do things.  The system ignored the name that was
entered and keyed only on the family member's number.  I was assured that this
was the best way to reduce the RISK of a mistake (he used that word).  I guess
the person who set up the system must have had several siblings with the same
name.

Fortunately, my wife keeps all our medical records in good order so we were
able to find documentation and figure out what had happened.  The monitary
cost to us would have been small if we had not sorted it out, but I can easily
see this happening where the costs could be much higher.

   VANCOUVER (Reuter) - A pesky pet played havoc with Canadian police who
   responded to an emergency call only to find they were barking up the 
   wrong tree.  A team of officers burst into a Vancouver home after
   receiving a 911 emergency phone call but found nothing more threatening 
   than a poodle inside, police said Wednesday.  The dog had knocked the 
   phone off the hook and hit an automatic dial button that called police.
   Police feared the worst when all they heard on the line was the dog
   barking.  ``We came screeching over. It was a bit silly,'' confessed
   police spokesman Joe Arduini.

They had 911 on speed dial?  Come on - that's inexcusable, given how easy it
is to accidentally hit the wrong button on a phone.  Do that many people die
because they never finish dialing all three numbers?  "Poor guy.  Would have
made it, but he was only able to hit 9-1."

I suppose the moral of this story is that the RISK isn't necessarily in the
technology but rather in the people (mis)using it.

Floyd concert tickets free to callers.  The offer was open from 6 pm.  The
station is on a specially equipped exchange, but an estimated 300,000+ call
attempts in an hour caused delayed dial tone and other problems from Cornwall,
Ontario to Pembroke, Ontario (about 100+ miles).  Ottawa is Canada's capital.

One story noted that some people (100 or so) called 911 to report telephone
trouble, instead of 611.  There were reports of actual outages, but it is not
clear that people were waiting for dial tone and not hanging up and trying
again.

Personal observation - I certainly had delayed dial tone, but only delayed 10
seconds or so.

One person I spoke to said that he had had seven phone lines active trying to
get the free tickets.

Very little is new here.  I leave the obvious pun for the moderator.

When 911 was first implemented (many years ago) here in Peoria IL, everyone
with a phone number of the form x91-1xxx was forced to change their numbers.

After a few years, though, the phone company started reassigning numbers of
this form.

   [In various old small-town switching centers, one could dial just the
   last four digits, or in some cases five digits, for local calls.  That
   led to similar problems when 911 was introduced, and has now disappeared
   almost everywhere in the U.S.A. (although for other reasons as well.) PGN]

1. I would think Frankfurt/Main airport (FRA) was the first to have an
integrated, computer-controlled baggage distribution system. For years I heard
they were the only international airport able to guarantee 45 minute
connections because of it.

2. When the system was installed (ca. '72), the contractor, AEG, required
something like six months past the deadline to get it running. In that time,
they reputably paid a penalty (or whatever you call "Konventionalstrafe" in
English) of DM 200K _per_day_. I don't think they made much profit on the
contract...

I cannot explain why the Highway Dept. chose to blow up the deceased whale.  I
can, however, explain why this problem fell to the Highway Dept.  Unlike most
states, which allow private ownership of beaches, Oregon has kept all its
beaches owned by the state.  The mechanism for this, curiously, is that the
beach is technically part of the of state highway system--although you
generally aren't allowed to drive on it.  So the whale shows up on a state
highway, and it's the Highway Dept.'s problem

Following the resent posting about how photocopiers prevent banknote forgery,
I wonder how many other readers' jaws dropped open at the suggestion that
there is a ROM inside a colour photocopier (such as the Canon CLC350/550) with
images of common banknotes in it. This just wouldn't make sense, aside from
the fact that it would rapidly go out of date - it would simply be too
computationally expensive to compare every image placed on the copier with the
images in ROM. The Canon machines in question can also be used as colour laser
printers in conjunction with special interfaces, so presumably any
anti-forgery computer inside the copier would also have to check that
banknotes weren't being scanned into a personal computer and then printed out
via the colour copier. This is absurd.

We have a CLC300 at work, and when an engineer came to fix it one day, he said
that the problems we were having (with jammed paper) were a design fault that
had been fixed on the CLC350. I asked what other features the 350 had, and he
said it had anti-forgery features - and proceeded to tell me the same story
about a chip with pictures of banknotes in it. I found this so hard to believe
that I asked around, and eventually someone gave me a more believable
explanation. Apparently the security measures depend on special inks used when
the banknotes are printed. These inks change colour when illuminated by the
scanner in the copier, and produce copies of the banknote with an obvious
colour shift. I don't know whether the 350 and 550 have a different kind of
bulb in the scanner or are able detect the special inks, but I have also heard
of other documents that won't copy properly because the copier thinks they're
banknotes. Rumour has it you can get round this by photocopying through very
thin tracing paper - which presumably works with banknotes as well.

Anyhow, perhaps someone at Canon can give us a definitive answer. On the other
hand, I wouldn't be surprised if they wished the status quo to continue, where
we all believe that copiers have chips with pictures of banknotes in them.
What makes me laugh is the message on the front panel of the CLC300, which
warns you not to copy money or certain other documents: "you *may* be
committing a criminal offense for which you *may* be prosecuted." Pretty
strong language, huh?

Once upon a time, long long ago in a galaxy far far away, an automobile
manufacturer known to all of its employees as "Generous Mother" began using
computers to control such things as mixture and spark advance and a host
of other variables. The maps for these variables were carried in 1k x 8 PROMS.

Certain individuals who shall remain nameless acquired the maps of these
programs for certain "performance" cars and designed their own maps. 

Unfortunately, these new maps, though amazing in improving performance
and efficiency were not what the manufacturer had certified.

So the aspiring young engineers replaced the 1k x 8 PROM with a 2k x 8 EEPROM
and a switch concealed under the dashboard. The lower 1k contained the stock
settings and the upper 1k, settings of a more "interesting" variety. For
roadside tests the switch was turned "off" and for normal driving "on".

I suspect that copiers that rely on "firmware" to block copying of bills
might soon acquire such switches.

Here's one paragraph of Erma Bombeck's humour column, The Kingston
Whig-Standard, 28 March 1994.

	"I dropped by an airport washroom.  In my stall, I wrestled
	with my jumpsuit, and in doing so the belt fell into the
	commode.  Before I could retrieve it, the automatic flusher
	sucked it away and into the sewers of San Jose.  I held my
	hands under the automatic water tap and went for a paper
	towel.  I turned in time to see my handbag fall into the
	sink and activate the water.  It proceeded to drown."

The column also enumerates many other more familiar problems with
automation.

Cable company adds unexpected Spice to subscriber's dinner hour.

A problem with a pay-per-view system caused all customers of the Greater
Media Cable TV service in Worcester Massachusetts to receive the unscrambled
broadcast of an Adult cable cannel offered by the system.  The Spice cable
channel was unscrambled for 90 minutes between 6:00pm and 7:30pm on Monday
March 28th.

	According to a representative of the cable company, Ed Goldstien, the
cause of the glitch was not known and an investigation was in progress.
Goldstien presented the cable company's apology and promise that it would not
happen again to subscribers over the local radio station WXLO.

The Greater Media Cable system uses a call in voice response system to allow
customers to activate the pay-per-view stations offered by the system.  The
activation code for the customer's cable box is broadcast over the cable
system to unscramble the selected pay-per-view offering.  RISKS readers could
speculate that this incident is an indication that a universal activation
code must exist for all cable decoders in the system.  We could further
speculate that the voice response system could have broadcast this code in
response to a pay-per-view request of a single subscriber if internal tables
were faulty.

The RISK here is dependence on an automatic system to save cost when the cost
of its failure is not taken into account.

Washington Post Staff Writer John Schwartz has published a moving and
insightful article entitled, "Game Boy."  It explores the life and death of
an eighteen year old man addicted to cyberspace role-playing.  I have asked
Mr Schwartz for permission to post the original article in its entirety.  For
the time being, here's a brief summary.

&lt;&lt;begin summary&gt;&gt;

Nathaniel Davenport was an unassertive, socially-isolated teenager who did
poorly in high school but had excellent S.A.T. scores.  He entered the
University of California at Santa Cruz autumn 92 and quickly became active in
AmberMUSH, a M.U.D. (multi-user dimension) loosely based on the _Amber_
stories of Roger Zelazny.  AmberMUSH "features a series of mirrors that you
walk through into different elaborate fictional situations: One is the ruins
of a city; another a rowdy Western town; a third, the smoky darkness of the
"World's End Bar," a cross-dimensional speakeasy. Wherever you go, other
players are there, gathered from around the world to engage in a collective
fantasy; you converse with whoever is in the `room' you are in at the time,
something like a pickup game in basketball."

Nathaniel became a M.U.D. addict.  He was asked to leave his university
because he had missed all of his classes while living in AmberMUSH.  Back in
Virginia, he continued his addiction through student terminals at George
Mason University, where he would spend entire days interacting with other
role players from around the world.

Nathaniel's persona in AmberMUSH was Sabbath, a beautiful seductress devoid
of empathy for the characters she manipulated.  For example, she spent months
seducing another character, only to goad him to his death in a battle with a
more powerful character.

After bitter arguments with his family, Nathaniel agreed to get a job.  He
began working at a computer company from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.  He incorporated
his new job into his frenetic role-playing life by skimping on sleep.  A week
after starting work, he apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his mother's
car and smashed head-on into a truck.  He died instantly.

When Nathaniel's father sent out requests for correspondence on the Internet,
addressing the AmberMUSH users his son had spent so much of his life with, he
was astonished at the volume and quality of the responses.

Over time, Tom Davenport came to believe that Nathaniel's interactions were
not futile game-playing or pornographic flirting.  "[I]n his quest to better
himself, Nathaniel had also turned to the tool he was most comfortable with:
He was using his character to explore social interactions, to learn to be
funny, charming, direct. `He was using the net,' says Davenport, `to work out
his life.'"

"Contacted via e-mail, AmberMUSH administrator Mark Grundy said the death of
Nathaniel Davenport has made him think hard about players' responsibility to
one another in the on-line society. `The future for human relationships in
the Communication Age seems particularly uncertain,' Grundy wrote. `For me,
the lesson that Tom has taught is that the answers can come, if you look for
them with the right heart.'"

&lt;&lt;end summary&gt;&gt;

This young man, isolated from a local community, unhappy in his own skin,
found happiness as a different person in a different world.  The pity is that
he lost touch with his own body's needs.

Like a rat on an endorphin high, poor Nathaniel died from addiction to his
own form of satisfaction.  Should we shrug and dismiss his death?  "It's his
problem--he was free to act as he chose."  Surely, but could anyone in his
cyberspace community have helped avoid this sad end, crushed uselessly at the
age of 18?  I wonder if cyberspace role-players will reach out to accept and
support the tangible person behind the electronic persona?  Would it have
helped if someone had asked how Nathaniel was doing instead of focusing only
on Sabbath?

As human beings interact electronically, we will be forced to integrate
morality and reason into cyberspace.  Cyberspace must not remain a moral
vacuum; common sense must grow to encompass all the ways we now have to touch
other people's lives and alter our own.

(GO ENS):

JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer, reports on the Software Publishers
Association's statistics concerning software theft.  Key findings:

o	Worldwide losses of $7.4 billion for business software in 1993.

o	Rate is down 25% from $9.7 billion in 1992.

o	Business software (spreadsheets, electronic mail, accounting and 
data base programs) sales revenues in 1993 were $6.8 billion.

o	Companies whose employees make unauthorized copies or put single-copy
programs on network servers account for the most frequent violations of
software copyright.

o	The SPA audited or initiated lawsuits against 245 companies, all of
which were resolved out of court.

o	Settlements totalled $3 million.

o	Manufacturers in the U.S. lost $1.57 billion; Japan lost $650 million;
France lost $435 million.

o	Software theft grew fastest in India and Pakistan (up 95%); Korea and
Brazil showed 89%, and Malaysia's theft grew 88%.

I was recently quite shocked (UK: gob-smacked) to find that an event 
connected with my spell checker could have put me at risk of losing my job. 
I was editing a publication to be sent to several hundred of my client 
contacts, and had made a series of trivial spelling corrections, the last 
being a  "replace".  Sitting poised over the replace button, I was presented 
with the suggestion that the word "Goldman" (as in a large company we all 
know) should be replaced with "goddamn". The word processor involved was MS 
Word for the Macintosh.  I then tested this on Word for Windows, and got the 
same result.  (I have the `always suggest' option selected) 
 
This event scared me greatly, because it is easy to go unconscious in front 
of the mouse and press "replace" one too many times without realizing the 
result.  I contacted my support agency and was told that "goddamn" is in the 
main dictionary, and that I could not delete it from the main dictionary.  It 
was suggested that I program Goldman as a replacement to goddamn. 
 
Of course, defining a replacement in this one case does not assure me that
the "bad" word will not be suggested in the future for other replacements.
And, I have not yet encountered other unprofessional and undesirable word
replacements which I would grudgingly agree that, in an academic sense,
belong in the dictionary, but are a risk to my job.  Yet, I wait in fear of
these discoveries.
 
My concern here is that products such as word processors that are sold for 
use in "business" applications should either not freely suggest profane words 
in the main dictionary, or should have an option to leave them out or supply 
an extra warning.  Obviously, the problem is further complicated by words or 
phrases that have different meanings in different countries even when the 
language seems otherwise equivalent. 
 
Has anyone else had problems similar to this?  Are there any alternative 
"business-oriented" main dictionaries which can be purchased to eliminate the 
risk?  And, should I be obligated to live-with/fix this problem when 
purchasing a "business" product?

The RISKS archives are full of cases such as transforming a Mafia "enforcer"
into an "informer", "payout" into "peyote", "back in the black" to "back in
the AfroAmerican", and many other garbles.  And I just happen to notice a note
from Abhijit Chaudhari &lt;abhijit@sware.com&gt; in the YUCKS digest (from
spaf@cs.purdue.edu) noting that NeXTSTEP 3.0 Webster's barfs on "UNIX", and
offers "unfix" instead.  That is not Unix-friendly, although I distinctly
recall Steve Jobs suggesting at the San Francisco birth announcement for NeXT
that NeXT was UNIX-emulatable and UNIX-friendly (but that nobody would care
once they had seen NeXT!).  I wonder what that spelling corrector does to
NeXT?  Maybe it gets turned into a NeWT.

A few years back, I was working as a student computer consultant at UC Santa
Cruz.  The San Diego Supercomputer Center was pulling itself up by its
bootstraps, and a few of the researchers at UCSC had won grants of CPU time
on SDSC's CRAY Y/MP.

SDSC sent some of their tech. support staff up to Santa Cruz to give our
researchers a quick introduction to UNICOS (CRAY's flavor of SYSV UNIX) and
SDSC's special features.  Needless to say, they didn't want to leave their
tech support people in Santa Cruz, so they gave us a small grant for our
consultants to use while learning their system.  I was one of the lucky
consultants who got to participate.

So far so good.

At the same time, one of my friends was finishing up his physics thesis (a
weird little study of aerodynamic surfaces), and had written a small flight
simulator to do some of his calculations.  This study was weird enough that my
friend was calling his programs 'funny', 'goofy', 'damgoofy', etc.  It was a
simple program which simulated the flight of a plane for a short duration, and
the user couldn't adjust any control surfaces after the program started.

As a favor to him and as a convenient way to learn more about the Y/MP,
I ported his program over to UNICOS.

The program normally asked the user for its parameters when it started up,
printed the results to the terminal, and waited for the user to hit return
before quitting.  The program was almost entirely math, so all I had to do was
convert it to batch processing.  Simple: just change a few scanf()'s to
fscanf()'s, tweak a few paths, and we're all set....  Or so I thought.
(ominous background music, please).

I ftp'd the files over to the cray, compiled them, and made a few short test
runs.  No problems.  So I set it up to calculate 30 seconds of flight at 1ms
intervals, and to print out the time when it started and stopped.  Then I set
it loose.  It was truly impressive watching those columns of numbers scrolling
by.  But alas, my next class was starting, so I couldn't wait for it to
finish.  I was capturing the output to a file anyway, so I just disconnected
and went to my class.

That was Friday evening.

Sunday morning rolls around, and I get rudely shaken from bed by a phone call
at 7am!  Imagine the nerve!  hmph.  It was SDSC's support staff calling.  It
seems that a renegade program had eaten up all the consultant's time grant
by running continuously (100% CPU usage) for 35 hours in the interactive
`batch` queue!  Clearly this program was intended as some warped prank,
considering it was called 'damgoofy'!  Uh-oh.  I was sure there was some kind
of mistake, so I rushed up to campus to see what had happened.

It turns out that I had forgotten to remove the program's last gets(): that's
the line which made the simulator wait for the user to hit return before
quitting.  That shouldn't have been a problem in itself, since the function
should've immediately returned with an error after it discovered it had lost
it's terminal (when I logged out).  It didn't.  No problem, right?  The
program should've just stopped waiting for input, consuming no CPU resources.
Nope.  Under that version of UNICOS, the program was waiting in a busy-loop,
uselessly using the CPU while it waited for input.  :(   Ooooops!

Luckily SDSC was nice to us, and the Y/MP was underutilized back then anyway,
so they just refunded the money, my friend got an impressive simulation, and
I got an anecdote.  :)

Two interesting newspaper articles on encryption policy recently appeared:

In The Australian, an influential national newspaper similar to The Guardian
in the U. K. or The New York Times in the U. S., a large article describes
the Clipper chip controversy including a bit more technical detail than is
common for U. S. newspapers.  Professor Bill Caelli of Queensland University
of Technology's School of Data Communications is quoted as saying "Is Clipper
the start of a more onerous agenda?  Does Clipper represent attempts to
outlaw the use of encryption in any form by the public unless he or she uses
an 'approved' (and breakable) cipher system such as Clipper?  This last
question is a far darker scenario and goes to the very heart of freedom and
privacy in a democratic society."  -- All this in The Australian of 29 March
1994.

In the New York Times of 26 March 1994, on the first page of the second
section and wrapping around to page 26, there is an article "Collisions in
Cyberspace on Data Encryption Plan" which starts "To paraphrase Oscar Wilde,
the Clinton Administration threw a couple of its lions into a den of savage
Daniels here this week" (now last week).  That refers to the Fourth
Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy in Chicago, and the article
appears under a wonderful photo of Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600, clad
in T-shirt, etc., taling with Frank Carey of Bell Labs, replete in coat and
tie, but holding beer bottle.  The article goes on to describe an arrest of a
man in the conference hotel (actually a conference attendee) who fit the
description of fugitive hacker Kevin Mitnick and the rough go Dave Lytel of
the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy had as the keynote
speaker trying to defend Clipper.

We felt the effects here in Tuscon, Arizona, 500 miles and another state away
from Los Angeles.  I went to the local grocery store to do some shopping and,
you guessed it, they couldn't take my charge card because of that fire (they
had notices posted throughout the store).

I guess it's not just earthquakes anymore that have a rippling effect all the
way to Arizona...

John Oram &lt;oramy92@halcyon.com&gt;, in RISKS 15.70:
&gt;They had 911 on speed dial?  Come on - that's inexcusable, given how easy it
&gt;is to accidentally hit the wrong button on a phone.

Not when the phone manufacturer provides speed dial buttons explicitly
labelled for that purpose.  I own a General Electric phone (purchased about
five years ago) that has three buttons on it labelled "Fire", "Police", and
"Ambulance".

There are other risks associated with such a phone, in addition to
that of pets (or small children) accidentally hitting one of those
buttons.  The buttons need to be programmed with the correct number,
since 911 is not (yet) universal in the US.  If the owner of a phone
does not set the numbers for those buttons - or worse, moves without
changing the numbers (where one of the old or new locations does not
have 911) - one could picture a scenario where a guest is present, the
phone's owner is incapacitated, and the guest tries to use the "Ambulance"
button to contact same...

In <A HREF="/Risks/15.70.html">RISKS-15.70</A>, Tom Standage noted that some color photocopiers prevent
forgery by reacting to the color shift in the ink.  This seems similar to how
our Xerox black-and-white copiers react to an American Express card.  The
cards apparently use two different inks for the pattern filling the face of
the card, one of which is invisible to the copier, although both inks look
identical to the eye.  When photocopied, the card image bears the word VOID
all over its face (this is the green card; haven't tried it with a gold or
platinum one).  Perhaps a similar technology is involved in preventing copying
of currency.

This is not a good idea. What happened to me, basically, was that I closed my
old VISA account with the State Bank Victoria (Australia) with 4 cents
credit, &lt;CREDIT, not debit&gt;, believing I was a good guy for not trying to get
the money out - after all, it probably costs VISA $x per transaction.  Some
years later I had occasion to apply for another VISA card...

When trying to use my bank DEBIT card to pay for petrol a security alert was
flashed to the operator and my card was seized. Using my ATM card showed no
funds and my ATM card was seized. My PASSBOOK account had a security trigger
fire when I presented it at the local branch... It was all caused by the
previous VISA account; the four cents was never allowed to be reabsorbed by
the bank and my application for a new card found a bug in the validation
software that said "there is a problem with this applicant".  This
automatically put a hold on all my finances! Even the home loan joint account
was frozen.  It took TEN WORKING DAYS for a human to finally backtrack to the
root cause (the security re-asserted itself each night) I did get an official
letter of explanation (I was beyond accepting apologies) on letter-head so
future repercussions could be minimised.

What may happen to "dwm" could be something bizarre like being arrested by
the IRS for undisclosed income, not so improbable as a friend had his 1987
tax refund assessed as income for 1988!

(Did I read in RISKS about a person having $1M accidentally transferred into
 their savings account, now fighting it out with the bank over the $50,000
 funds-transfer tax?) 

      [The original item was in <A HREF="/Risks/15.60.html">RISKS-15.60</A>.  I don't
      recall seeing the transfer-tax item before.  PGN]

Telephone service to thousands of MCI Communications Corp. East-Coast customers
was disrupted early in the morning of 30 Mar 1994 when a mud slide severed a
fiber-optic cable.  Calls into and out of the Washington D.C., Maryland, and
Richmond VA areas were affected.  Custromers in Miami, Atlanta, and St.
Petersburg also reported disruptions.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

The 30 March 1994 issue of the San Diego Union contained a Reuters story from
Land's End, England.  It reads in part:

   A mechanical sea monster designed to terrify tourists attacked and injured
   a set designer working on it ... the hydraulic tentacled beast went out of
   control because of a temporary fault in its computer program and held 
   designer George Thain in its 3-foot toothed jaws for nearly a minute."

The man was badly bruised, but otherwise unharmed. The story does not state
what corrective action is planned, but the town chairman ``assured visitors
they would have nothing to fear from the monster, which will be kept 3 feet
away from spectators.''

Final report blames Lucas design, Lockheed's procedures for HTTB crash

      Federal safety officials yesterday blamed an inadequate actuator
 design by Lucas Aerospace and Lockheed's failure to take account of its
 shortcomings for the crash last year of Lockheed's one-of-a-kind High
 Technology Test Bed plane.
      In its final report on the Feb. 3, 1993, crash at Dobbins AFB, Ga.,
 the National Transportation Safety Board said the plane lost all rudder
 control during a high-speed taxi test with a simulated No. 1 engine
 failure when an experimental fly-by-wire control system for the rudder
 disengaged.
      "The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the
 rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer," NTSB said.
      A design feature in the actuator removes hydraulic pressure if the
 rudder position commanded by the pilot exceeds the actual rudder
 actuator position for a specified time, and the rudder position trails,
 according to the report.
      Lucas Aerospace designed the package, a self-contained unit
 configured to be a drop-in replacement for the existing Hercules/HTTB
 dual tandem rudder actuator.
      The HTTB had recently been modified to evaluate power-by-wire
 flight control systems developed by Lockheed, along with some 50
 suppliers.  Lucas' package was demonstrated on two flights in March
 1992, which Lockheed, claiming success, noted was the first time the
 concept had been tested on a manned flight.
      Still, NTSB said that on at least one occasion the actuator had
 previously disengaged in flight, but "the company did not conduct a
 system safety review of the rudder bypass feature and its consequences
 to all flight regimes, nor of the (ground minimum control speed) test."
      The fact that neither pilot was trained as a flight test engineer
 contributed to the accident, the report said.
      "I do want to emphasize that the seven crew members were extremely
 qualified for the jobs they were doing," a Lockheed spokesman said in a
 prepared statement. "We still feel a great sense of loss for these
 colleagues and we praise their contributions to aviation. Beyond that,
 we prefer not to comment on the NTSB report, the investigation, or the
 accident."
      The highly modified L-100-20 Hercules transport was not programmed
 to become airborne, NTSB Chairman Carl Vogt said shortly after the
 accident (DAILY, Feb. 5, 1993, page 200). But an NTSB spokesman told The
 DAILY yesterday that "it is the analysis of the board that (the pilot)
 attempted to get the plane airborne at that moment," although to this
 day nobody knows why the takeoff was attempted.
      The report noted that the flight test plan specified that engine
 power be retarded if the rudder became ineffective. The aircraft was at
 full power but had not reached takeoff speed when it briefly became
 airborne, clipped a Navy clinic and crashed about 200 yards north of the
 runway, killing all seven aboard.
      Lockheed said it was reviewing the NTSB's data, adding that "action
 will be taken as appropriate."

The 3/30/94 New York Times includes two articles that illustrate the
vexatious trade-offs inherent in emerging computer-based systems.

  Matthew L. Wald, Two technologies join to assist lost drivers, New 
  York Times, 30 March 1994, page A13.

This article is about a computer system that Nynex is developing, and that
Avis will be testing, in which rental cars are kept in close contact with the
rental agency through wireless communication.  The technology is sold as a way
of protecting drivers such as the tourists who were attacked in Florida; the
cars will be equipped with "panic buttons" and the like.  The article also
says that drivers will be able to call in for directions on wireless phones,
with the phone operators having access to digitally encoded GPS information
plotted against detailed maps, enough to be able to say "take the next left"
remotely.

So far so good.  But, at least the way the article describes it, the system
will also allow the company to track all drivers for all purposes, regardless
of whether they are in danger or need directions.  A natural suspicion is that
this generalized tracking capability is a major part of Avis's actual motives
for promoting the systems.  Motives aside, the privacy concerns may be serious
in any case.  How might these concerns be weighed against the advantages?  How
might the system be designed to obtain the advantages without the
disadvantages?  The article contains no hint that such questions are being
asked, and this is unfortunate.

  Barnaby J. Feder, Sophisticated software set for exotic financial
  trades, New York Times, 30 March 1993, pages C1, C5.

This article concerns "a marriage made in techno-geek heaven" between computer
people and high finance, specifically software for analyzing and administering
complex financial transactions based on so-called "derivatives" (see Risks
15.66).  One virtue of these systems is that they reduce the possibilities for
error, which are pretty serious when these kinds of transactions are done by
hand.  At the same time, such systems allow derivatives to be traded in much
larger volumes, and in much more complex ways.

Much popular imagery associates derivatives with speculation, for example
high-stakes gambling in commodity futures, but the real issue is almost the
opposite.  The usual purpose of these transactions is to engineer little
islands of stability and predictability within the swirling chaos of global
financial markets.  Indeed the metaphor of "engineering" is frequently used --
the software discussed in the article is referred to as "financial CAD
(computer-aided design)".  The potential trouble comes when massive financial
edifices are engineered badly.  When a steel-and-concrete building falls down,
the earth is there to catch it and a limited number of people get killed.  But
that's not how financial engineering works -- one collapsing structure has the
capacity to take others down with it (again, see Risks 15.66).  Obviously it's
in their interest to be careful, but let's hope they know what they're doing.

  CANBERRA, March 24 (Reuter) - White-collar crime is the most costly crime in
  Australia, totalling as much as Australian $13.7 billion ($9.8 million) a
  year, according to a report on Australia's law enforcement agencies.

Key points:

o	Committee included "representatives from the Australian Federal
Police, the National Crime Authority, the Attorney-General's Department, the
Finance Ministry and the Prime Minister's office."

o	Most white-collar crime is fraud.

o	Fraud "imposes the greatest economic cost on the Australian community
of all forms of major and organised crime."

o	Annual cost of fraud A$6.9-A$13.7 billion (U$4.9-$9.8 billion) (about
2/3 of cost of all crime in Australia, estimated at A$11-20 billion)

My son (11) confronted a dial phone this past weekend and couldn't figure out
how to use it. He tried pressing the "buttons" but nothing happened. We
finally had to show him the concept of turning the dial. It took a little
practice to get it smooth.

I guess we've reached a milestone. What if he were confronted by the 
"anti-drug" pay phones with dials and had to dial 911? He'd be stuck.

In designing UI's we make assumptions about cultural norms or icons. Most 
people see the phone dial as a very obvious interface. It isn't, it's just 
something most of us learned at an early enough age to assume it is a part of 
the natural world.

Next time you get called into the bosses office, spare a thought for Juan
Pablo Davila, who WON'T be winning "Employee of the Month" at Codelco.

An extract from an article in THE ECONOMIST (p.66.Feb 12, 1994):

  SANTIAGO: Juan Pablo Davila claims that last September he made a mistake. He
  punched several 'sell' figures into his computer as 'buy', and vice-versa.
  Mr Davila was a fairly junior executive at Codelco, Chile's mammoth
  state-owned copper company. But he handled all Codelco's minerals futures
  contracts. By the time he noticed his slip he had already lost $40m. So he
  kept on dealing; when his credit lines finally ran out in January, his
  losses had reached $207m.

  Mr Davila's mistakes pose troubling questions for Codelco. Why did nobody
  notice the losses? Did his superiors fraudulently extend Mr Davila's credit
  lines? Can any money be recovered? On February 5th Codelco's president
  resigned, admitting that the losses exposed a failure of internal
  controls...

EFF SUMMARY

PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMIT: SHAPING THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

Hyatt Regency Hotel in Washington, DC, MARCH 29, 1994

OPENING REMARKS

Welcoming remarks were delivered by Andrew Blau from the Benton Foundation,
who expressed gratitude to the program sponsors and planning committee. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown delivered pre-taped opening remarks on
video, because he was in Russia at the time of the conference.  Secretary
Brown, who chairs the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF),
restated the Administration's commitment to universal service, emphasizing
that no one should be left standing on the side of the road.  


PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMIT PANELS

DELIVERING THE GOODS: MEETING PUBLIC NEEDS?

Moderator: V. Lane Rawlins, President, Memphis State University 
C. Everett Koop, Senior Scholar, Koop Institute
David Lytel, White House Office of Science and Technology 
Jean Armour Polly, NY State Research and Education Network
Anthony Riddle, Chair, Alliance for Community Media 
Connie Stout, Director, Texas Education Network
Patricia Waak, National Audubon Society

This panel discussed the ways in which the National Information
Infrastructure (NII) can improve education, health care, and the
environment by enhancing communication and decisionmaking within
communities, as well as within state, national, and international
boundaries.  There was strong consensus on the panel and from the floor
that teaching people to use the tools is as important as building the
tools.  Choosing the right regulatory model is a difficult issue, but David
Lytel said that the Clinton Administration is committed to making sure that
citizens can be information producers, as well as information consumers. 
He stated that the challenge is to make sure that the NII becomes more than
just a large pipe for television reruns and movies, home shopping,
electronic games, and gambling.  The architecture of the NII must guarantee
that needs outside the commercial marketplace, including cultural and other
public benefits, are met. 


A LINK INTO EVERY HOME: HOW, WHAT, AND WHEN?

Moderator: Allen Hammond, Director, Communications Media Center, NY Law School
Ron Binz, Director, Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel
Mark Cooper, Director of Research, Consumer Federation of America
Deborah Kaplan, Vice President, World Institute on Disability
Robert Larson, President/General Manager, WTVS-Detroit
Michael Nelson, White House Office of Science and Technology
Andrew J. Schwartzman, Executive Director, Media Access Project

The panel explored the challenges in applying the concept of universal
service to the NII to ensure access for everyone.  The panelists discussed
universal service funding mechanisms, the role of government in supporting
a diversity of voices, and the need for public interest advocacy before the
Federal Communications Commission.  Mike Nelson said that the
Administration's model for the NII is the Internet, and its goals for
universal service are to provide subsidies to enable open access for as
many people as possible, to adopt pro-competitive policies, to require
nondiscriminatory prices, to prohibit network providers from controlling
information, and to enhance interoperability and interconnection
requirements.  

Addressing the difference between the common carriage regime for telephone
companies and the market/consumer model for the cable industry, Andrew
Schwartzman argued for the common carriage model instead of the cable
model, because the cable model is passive and connotes people receiving
only limited services such as video-on-demand and home shopping.  Common
carriage would help NII users to be speakers as well as listeners, and
producers as well as consumers.  Ron Binz offered the phrase "Information
Superhypeway" and cautioned that a fully competitive telecommunications
industry is not right around the corner.  The key decision, according to
Binz, is whether to rely on taxing voice communications service to fund the
NII.  Binz also characterized as "industry propaganda" the view that
subsidies should be provided to enable access for as many people as
possible.  Mark Cooper challenged the widely cited statistic that 93% of
the population enjoys telephone service.  Instead, he stated that the 7%
"unsolution" is really closer to 30%, which includes individuals with
disabilities and low incomes.  He argued that those who cannot afford
access to the NII will be assured access if everyone who can afford to use
the NII is required to pay for it.  

Deborah Kaplan took the discussion beyond the issue of funding to the issue
of access.  She argued that the 7% of the population that is underserved is
a product of the market model.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and
policy input from low-income people is essential.  She raised the concern
that access to the NII for disabled individuals may be uniquely difficult,
especially if the NII architecture is modeled on voice-based telephone
service.  Schwartzman emphasized the First Amendment dimension of universal
service, including artistic speech, and the need to protect against any
form of censorship.  Bob Larson explained how public broadcasting's role in
promoting local service responsibilities and public service duties is a
model for what the NII can do to marshall local resources.  The NII could
augment public broadcasting's efforts aimed at reducing violence and
improving the well-being of young people.


SPEECH BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE

The Vice President was introduced by Peter Goldmark, President of The
Rockefeller Foundation, who emphasized the historical role of the NII in
charting the future of democracy.  Vice President Gore stated the
Administration's commitment to wiring every classroom, clinic, and library in
the United States to the NII within the next five years.  Every person will
benefit from the NII.  However, while we already have the technology, we do
not yet have the infrastructure.  The National Telecommunication and
Information Administration in the Department of Commerce recently announced
the availability of funding for some of the aspects of the NII and already
have received 3,500 inquiries.

Reforming telecommunications law is essential.  Universal service means
lower prices for everyone.  Open access means receiving and sending
information across the NII.  The future will look like the Internet if we
make sure the NII is open and accessible like the personal computer. 

Networked communities are consistent with our democratic form of government
and distinguish it from  communism and fascism.  We need to increase access
to government information to enhance community decisionmaking.  We are
increasing the availability of government information.  SeniorNet is
providing services to senior citizens.  The Environmental Protection
Agency's toxics release inventory is empowering citizens to ameliorate
environmental hazards in their communities.  HUD has begun to put
information about fair housing and fair lending on the net.  We can empower
our representative democracy.  People closest to the problems are the
smartest about the solutions.  


BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND THE ECONOMY

Alternatives
Morton Bahr, President, Communications Workers of America 
Cushing Dolbeare, President, Low-Income Housing Coalition 
Thomas Kalil, National Economic Council for Science and Technology
Anthony Pharr, Counsel, Office of Communication, United Church of Christ
Diana Roose, Research Director, National Association of Working Women
Randy Ross, Vice President, American Indian Telecommunications 

After brief introductory statements, the panelists discussed what the NII
means for generating jobs and economic benefits.  The goal is to use the
NII to create better, high wage jobs.  Development of information policy
must make sure that the NII is a tool for community planning. 
Telecommuting will have an impact on the national economy by enabling
people to live and work anywhere, including in other countries.  We should
use the technology that exists now in order to do the kind of planning
needed to make sure the new technologies produce advances in our national
economy.


MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK

Moderator:  Sonia Jarvis, Exec. Dir., National Coalition for Black Voter
Participation
Brian Banks, Policy Research Action Group
Jim Butler, Director, AARP/VOTE, American Association of Retired Persons 
Mitchell Kapor, Chair, Electronic Frontier Foundation 
Sally Katzen, Chair, Information Policy Committee, IITF 
Ralph Nader, Center for the Study of Responsive Law 
Nadine Strossen, ACLU

This panel addressed whether the NII can support increased civic
participation, free speech and assembly, and privacy.  Brian Banks stressed
the NII's ability to bring about a reconfiguration of hierarchies; enhanced
citizen participation in the decision making process would be the most
fundamental change.  Jim Butler revisited the NII's potential for community
development, educational opportunity, and access to government databases. 
Mitchell Kapor focused on the potential for achieving the Jeffersonian
principles of individual liberty and decentralization.  The Internet has
enormous democratic potential, but it is not easy to use.  The emphasis
should be on the Internet and interactivity, not on the Information
Superhighway and Hollywood reruns. Everyone should become hands-on, start
learning and interacting, and ask for help when needed.  The networks
should be easy to use, but we cannot wait for a national handout.  

Sally Katzen stressed the goal of economic sustainable development.  The
government should not be solely responsible for the nation's information
systems.  The toxics release inventory is a model that has worked well.  Ralph
Nader, who still uses a manual Underwood typewriter, questioned what all this
new technology will do about such problems as violence in the schools.  Will
it just put more people into the Office of Management and Budget and lead to
mega-billion dollar overselling of unused software?  While there needs to be a
window on government databases, there is not reason for them to be
overprivatized or overmonopolized.  Educational efforts, like liberal
arts-type courses, could motivate people to participate.  Nadine Strossen
argued that the common carriage model is important to ensure universal
access--but security and privacy are equally important.  We have to make
certain that there are no censorial controls over content.  All of us must
lobby for privacy protection -- and we must fight the clipper chip.

Stanton McCandlish * mech@eff.org * Electronic Frontier Found. OnlineActivist
"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."

While I was in Copenhagen earlier today, a Danish friend, who knows of my
interest in the A320, drew to my attention an item in today's issue of the
news magazine "Goddaj" (if I recall the spelling correctly - it means "Good
Morning"). A translation of the article follows (courtesy of my Danish
friend):-

   --------Translation of Article in "Goddaj", 1st April 1994 -------- 

                   Danish Firm Scores Notable "First"
                   ---------------------------------- 

Thor Avionics, one of Denmark's most advanced high-tech firms, has secured 
a contract which makes it the first software house in the world to provide 
"third party" maintenance on a major safety-critical software system. 

In order to reduce the maintenance costs on its fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft 
(the first type of civil airliner in the world to have a computer-controlled 
"fly-by-wire" system), Air France has placed Thor under contract to provide 
all future maintenance on the software of this highly-automated aircraft. 

Wolf Larssen, director of Thor, said "This is the first contract of its type, 
and it won't be the last. Users of commercial software long ago discovered 
that there are great savings to be made by getting a "third party" firm to 
maintain their software. I am only surprised that it has taken users of 
safety-critical systems so long to discover the advantages. I expect other 
A320 operators to be placing similar contracts before too long." 

A "third-party" in this context means a firm which is independent of both the 
user and the supplier. Such firms, being "lean and mean" are usually capable 
of providing a much better and more cost-effective service than the original 
supplier, since they have fewer overheads and are less stifled by bureaucracy. 
In the commercial world, such contracts have usually gone to small, dynamic, 
organisations, and it seems that the world of safety-critical software will 
follow suite. 

"We had to beat some stiff opposition from Sextant Avionique, Matra, Logica, 
and similar large firms." said Mr. Larssen. "The fact that the software on the 
A320 will need to be maintained indefinitely means guaranteed jobs for highly 
qualified Danish workers for a long time to come." 

M. Theophile Gautier, spokesman for Air France, said "We have the utmost 
confidence in Thor to deliver the goods, both in terms of reduced cost, 
improved system performance, and increased safety." 

The automated systems on the A320, particularly the flight control and flight 
management systems, have sometimes been called into question following the 
various accidents involving this type of aircraft, although the accidents 
have generally been ascribed to pilot error. Even so, there is an obvious 
question mark over the ability of a third-party firm to maintain the level 
of safety. 

When asked about this, Mr. Larssen said "Our software maintenance and 
validation process is second to none. Although Airbus Industrie have refused 
to release the source code, so that we will have to strip out the binary and 
work from that, we anticipate no problems. Most of the modifications we will 
be making are fairly slight, so that regression testing can easily be done 
on a software flight simulator running on an Apple MacKintosh." 

A spokesman for the JAA (Joint Aviation Authority, which is responsible for 
certifying that any new or modified design of aircraft is airworthy) said 
"The basic design has already been certified. All that Thor will be doing 
are minor post-certification modifications. Thor themselves have been 
certified as conforming to the ISO-9000 quality standard and to SEI level 2, 
so it should not be difficult for them to meet the requirements for our own 
certification, which is based upon an industry standard referred to as 
RTCA-DO/178B." 

In response to questions about what the maintenance would actually involve, 
Mr. Larssen said "Occasionally, Airworthiness Directives are issued by the 
JAA which require changes to be made to the design of an aircraft in order 
to correct a fault. Where this change involved modifying the software, Thor 
will be responsible for doing this. The beauty of software is that the 
modified version can be installed on all existing aircraft in seconds, simply 
by inserting a new eprom. In addition to this corrective maintenance, we will 
also be offering Air France enhancements to improve the performance of the 
A320. The practice of "chipping", or modifying the firmware in the engine 
management system of an automobile such as a BMW in order to make it go 
faster, is well established. I don't expect that we could make your A320 
perform like an F-111, but we could certainly extend the "safe flight 
envelope" beyond the rather conservative limits originally set by the 
manufacturer."

   [This is quite a Thor-ny piece.  Incidentally, I note that "goddaj" is
   really "good day" (albeit used in the morning, as in the case of Guten
   Tag), and April 1 is certainly a "goddaj".  Unfortunately, occasional
   adjacent-key typing errors might easily replace the "j" with an "m", which
   might be an appropriate reaction.  PGN]

The main risk is in relying too heavily on spell-checkers.  As people produce
more of their own documents, they no longer have someone who does most of the
proof-reading, and rely on a program instead.

Automation of other parts of document production has caused a change in the
type of errors that can get through.  Up until a few years ago, most errors in
trade books were switched letters ("b" for "d") probably caused by manual
typesetting.  Now one finds many more mistakes of a wrong word, no doubt from
a spell-checker substitution.  Perhaps we can ask, who checks the
spell-checkers?

By definition, a spell checker is a product which eliminates a large set of
errors in a text. It does not eliminate them all.  I would suggest that you do
not go onto "auto pilot" when using the spell checker.  Instead use the same
level of awareness that you do when your write.  In fact it makes sense to
examine the text around every place the spell checker stops.  There are a lot
of errors which can only be eliminated by human attention.  As far as I can
see your general problem would not be eliminated by getting rid of profanity.
Suppose you had a "Ms. Gorse" in your document.  A spell checker might offer
"Goose".  Your client (or boss) might be equally offended.

A company which sometimes competes with my employer sells a software
package which includes a spelling checker.  It flags &lt;our product&gt; as
a misspelling and offers &lt;their product&gt; as the suggested alternative.

The RISKs?  None that I can think of, but it's a nice anecdote.

Note this took out a reported 200+ DS3 circuits. That's ~~100,000+
voice-grade circuits (if all were such). 

Netcom's DC POP was one of the DS1's. They had leased the circuit from WilTel,
but WilTel in turn had subcontracted the facilities from MCI.  Further, while
MCI had the cable back up by 11pm, somehow WilTel did not communicate this to
Netcom. Thus the POP was not restored until the next morning. (Irony here -
WilTel got started pulling fiber through abandoned oil pipelines. Schedule 300
pipe provides much better than average protection against backhoe fade.)

Classic RISKs:
1) Too many eggs in one basket. While MCI surely has reserve capacity,
it does not seem to have 200 DS3's worth. No self-healing ring, it
seems.

2) Lost-in-translation syndrome - Once more than two organizations are
involved, the chances of getting any intact message from one end to the
other goes down as an exponential function of the number of hops.

ps: Ispell wants to turn "WilTel" into "Wilted"........

It is interesting that both of these incidents have a common thread - 
no feedback loops.

Way back in the '70s when I was part of the team that designed the full
authority digital flight control system for the AFTI F-16, we had a similar
problem: the system was so complex and so many people were involved that it
was easy to miss the change that Jon made today would affect Harold's system -
and this was during the design stage. In production, component substitution
could have the same effect, some so subtle that it would not be noticed until
a pilot found himself in an interesting situation.

One of my tasks was to develop the simulation software used in a 40 foot
Evans &amp; Sutherland dome &amp; as such with each revision of the flight control
software, the appropriate changes had to be fed into the dome system.

In order to maintain continuity we developed a "configuration control model"
that simply scanned the source code for all uses of a variable or subroutine
and provided a map of the points of contact for each variable.  When a change
occurred, it was a simple matter to report the change to each affected
engineer/programmer. It was also an excellent tool for reporting when someone
had accidentally used the wrong variable in an equation since it would
suddenly show use in a routine it had not been used in before.

This tool also made it possible to notify those responsible for affected
modules when a component change was made since the tree for the variables
used with the component was readily available.

The process was really simple but deductive rather than inductive: changes
were detected not by people submitting a change notice but by a comparison
of "current" versus "last", active configuration management rather than
passive. Several times changes were found before the paperwork arrived.

The simple fact is that any large system, from a telephone number list to
aircraft fight controls is subject to Chaos math: small omissions over time
will increase in effect. Murphy says that unknown effects will be destructive.
Multiple omissions multiply effects.

The most effective answer I have found is active feedback loops, something 
computers are very good at. Today one way I protect sites from intruder 
attacks is by requiring modem registration and briefing of owners. I also 
conduct random sweeps of the telephone lines looking for unregistered modems. 
Without the second, the first would rapidly become obsolete. This has two
advantages:
1) I find omissions quickly.
2) People are less likely to make omissions knowing that they will be noticed.

Over the last few years I have seem many instances in RISKS of problems with 
aircraft flight controls making the wrong decision or telling the pilot
the wrong thing and each time have wondered if active design or configuration 
management feedback loops could have prevented them.

I saw on San Francisco's channel 4 last night that a jail in Marin which
houses such people as Polly Klaus' killer has been having problems with
their cell doors.  Apparently, without reason, they would just open.
The prison said their was no danger in escape.  They blamed the problem
on "software errors".

How about that?

Man, just when I thought I understood this stuff.  I have condensed
this down to the following:

euclid% euclid% mkdir something_scwewy
euclid% cd !$
euclid% foreach i (a b c d)
? echo $i &gt; $i 
? end
euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -n1 more
./b
./c
./d
--More--(Next file: ./a)          # Hit &lt;SPACE&gt;
./a
::::::::::::::
a
euclid% 

Now, to my way of thinking, it should be executing the commands "more ./a;
more ./b; more ./c; more ./d".  Certainly I have had and come to expect this
sort of behavior from xargs in the past.  It seems to be a problem with
"more", because I get decent behavior with, say, "echo" and "cat":

euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -n1 cat
a
b
c
d

Yet:
euclid% find . -type f -print | xargs -t -n1 more
more ./a 
./b
./c
./d

BTW, if there are more than a screenful of files, I get prompted by
more to scroll through the list of them before it actually runs
more on the first file.  I don't get this at all.  This is on SunOS 4.1.3.

This is an example of a strange interaction of two bugs, one in `more' and one
in `xargs'.  All bugs are RISKS to some extent, its not clear how severe or
unusual they need to be to make it into RISKS...

There are two strange things occurring here.
1. When `more' is invoked with its standard input connected to something
   OTHER than a terminal, it treats `stdin' as the first file to display.
2. `xargs' doesn't close the input to the child it invokes.

So what happens is, `xargs' invokes `more ./a', and `more' reads everything
it can from its standard input, which connects to the `find'.  When
`more' finishes, `xargs' finds that its `stdin' is empty and exits.

To exercise these bugs separately, try:
echo a b c | more ./a
echo a b c d | xargs -n1 cat -

connection to the Internet (CHINANET; sub CHINANET to
LISTSERV@TAMVM1.TAMU.EDU).

The Chinese have named their new project to connect China to the Internet the
"Golden Bridge" project.  The following document purports to be the newly
developed "PRC Regulations on Safeguarding Computer Information Systems."  It
seems quite appropriate for RISKS.

As you read this, keep in mind that 1) in China accused persons are guilty
until proven innocent; 2) laws referred to in the document as ones applying in
certain circumstances are often harsh, subject to change without notice, and
so vaguely worded as to make easy the prosecutor's job, not of proving guilt
(not necessary), but of arguing why the penalty should be maximized; 3) the
"Public Security" laws referred to are the same laws that stipulate that the
families of serious offenders will be billed for the single bullet used in
judgement; 4) certain concepts (virus, special security products) are either
poorly defined or all inclusive; 5) in China when there is doubt as to the
legality of any particular act, illegality is assumed (this is important not
only in court, but also in normal life, where people tend to be more
conservative in part because of it.)

As we welcome this brave new domain into our net.universe, it will be
interesting, and perhaps surprising at times, to see how another set of
explorers on the electronic frontier are approaching the flow of information.
Golden Bridge, indeed.  As read, sending email without filing a customs
declaration, or accepting a shareware registration for an anti- virus product
could both be construed as being illegal.  There's a lot of room for
improvement here, imho.

The only risk I see in spelling checkers is that people may trust them too
much, or even expect too much of them.  This is a widepsread risk of every
technology.

 1) You suggest that "it is easy to go unconscious in front of the mouse
    and press 'replace' one too many times".  Surely a program which replaces
    words of your document without any knowledge of their meaning or intention
    is not one with which you should go "unconscious", especially when
    applying it to a document which, as you suggested, could lose you your job.

 2) Your use of "business" and "profane" are a bit misleading.  What you
    really want is a checker which does not suggest words which are
    inappropriate to the purpose of your document (making money from
    customers).  How is that possible ?  Whatever a document says, there are
    valid words which express the opposite ideas.  You cannot omit from the
    dictionary all the words which might cause offence to anyone doing
    "business".  Even if you did, add or omit the word "not" in a suitable
    place in a business proposal, and you could lose a customer.  Can a
    business document not contain profanities if it suits the purposes of the
    document ?

 3) Can you really blame the SPELLING checker for suggesting a common English
    word in place of a proper name ?  I have never seen a spell checker which
    did not allow you to augment the dictionary.  The first thing a company
    should do is add all the names and addresses of every organization it
    deals with.  Have you done that ?

I suggest that you have bought a useful tool (spelling checker), failed to
make the effort of tailoring it to your needs (adding your correspondents to
the dictionary), and expected too much of it (to provide you with a document
which fulfills your intentions, rather than merely one without spelling
errors).  Then you fed it a document with so many errors that you became
complacent about its power (not paying conscious attention to its prompts for
confirmation).  In spite of all this, it corrected your spelling mistakes and
you DID notice the "goddamn" suggestion when prompted, so you ended up with a
better document.

Where are the risks ?

  It seems that some RISKS contributors are engaged in an activity that should
not be discussed on a computer-related list such as this: spellcasting.
  However, it is obvious that they are using their computers to help with
their witchery, for they keep on mentioning using "spell-checkers".  At least
we know that modern technology is helpful to all, including spellcasters.
  On the side, I've never seen a "spell-checker" for sale in a computer store.
Are they commonly available in occult stores?  (Available on the Microsoft
Occulta CD?)

&gt; with the suggestion that the word "Goldman" (as in a large company we all 
&gt; know) should be replaced with "goddamn". The word processor involved was MS 

      ------From the Daily Mail, Friday April 1st 1994, p21------------ 

      Don't you dare be sexist says the PC PC, by Suzanne O'Shea 

The new computer program promised to help users write better English. 

But buyers have ended up with more than they bargained for. As well as a 
guide to glitch-free grammar and scintillating syntax, they get a lesson 
in political correctness every time they switch on. 

The use of words such as `wife', `policeman' and `housewife' meets with 
a sharp rebuke from the software, which flashes up a message that they are 
`gender-specific' then provides `gender-neutral' options such as `spouse', 
`police officer' and `homemaker'. 

Anyone foolish enough to test the PC personal computer with words such as 
`little woman' or `girlie' is sternly informed that they are `sexist 
expressions'. No alternative is offered here, only the ominous message: 
`Avoid using this word.' 

Computer writer Mark Smithson, 51, of Bedford, risked the wrath of the 
{pounds} 250 Microsoft Word 6 package when he typed in the word `freeman'. 
The computer promptly spat back `citizen'. 

`I couldn't believe it,' he said yesterday. `Then I started going through 
lots of other sexist and "gender-specific" words and, sure enough, the 
same thing happened. 

`It's like Big Brother. Manipulating what people write is a form of 
censorship. I am the last person to be deliberately sexist but this is 
downright frightening.' 

In the politically correct world of Word 6 - produced by an American firm - 
users are advised to replace `mankind' with `humankind' or `humanity' - 
although `womankind' passes through without a hitch - and to replace `fireman' 
with `stoker'. 

Its scope is limited when it sees words which it has not been told are sexist. 
While `little lady' may result in the reprimand `sexist expression, avoid 
using this phrase', followed by the explanation that `this term is considered 
by many to be inappropriate and belittling when used to refer to women', the 
word `floozie' is freely allowed. 

No mention of the programme's political correctness was mentioned 
[sic: Perhaps Ms. O'Shea should use a style checker! - PM :-) ] 
in publicity material when Word 6 was launched in Britain recently. Neither 
is the feature listed in the 830-page manual. 

A Microsoft spokesman - sorry, spokeswoman, we mean spokesperson - defended 
the program yesterday. 

`It does not force users to change what they write,' she said. `It simply 
highlights words that might be regarded as sexist and suggests alternatives. 

`Microsoft is trying to bring its programmes in line with real life and how 
people actually work. This type of thing is a sign of the times, as people 
do say chairperson instead of chairman nowadays.' 

  [Disclaimer: I don't *think* this is an April fool joke (if only because, if
  it were not true, Bill Gates would sue the Mail), but if it is, I didn't
  make it up! :-)  Peter Mellor, Centre for Software Reliability, City Univ.,

When cleaning up one day we found a portable spelling checker.  To test the
size of its vocabulary, we tried out some proper names.  We were dismayed to
find it suggesting "a**hole" [censored by PGN] as a correction for "Achille",
my housemate's name. This was particularly unimpressive, as "Achilles", the
more common spelling, was actually in its dictionary, but was not among any of
the alternatives, which included a number of other unflattering possibilities.

The earliest spelling checker was evidently one that was part of a pen-based
computer system for cursive writing recognition that I developed at MIT
Lincoln Lab in the 1959-61 time period.  It was set up to recognize the 10,000
most common English words.

Sometime in 1961 a film crew from BBC came to the lab and asked to photograph
the handwriting recognizer as part of a television program on advanced
technology, to which I agreed.  After setting up, they asked if the system
could recognize the word "television."  I agreed to give it a try but pointed
out that it sometimes listed more than one word if it wasn't sure.  After I
wrote the word on the CRT with a light pen, the system paused only a second or
two before responding:
  TEDIOUS
  TELEVISION

The film crew loved it and zoomed in for a close-up!  I've often wished
that I had asked for a copy of their film.

&gt;Spelling mistakes are a result of inattention to detail, ignorance, or apathy.

Which makes poor spelling sound like a deliberate decision.  I assure you I am
neither inattentive to detail nor apathetic about my poor spelling abilities.
I like to think I'm not ignorant...

In my defense, I'll note that there is some strong evidence that language is
based, at least in part, on genetics.  Thus some portion of language skill is
beyond the control of the individual.

Quoting from Jay Ingram's book, "Talk Talk Talk", pp.133-141, there is...

	"...a gene that makes it possible for most of us to be able to
	add an `s' to a word to make it plural, or choose `he' instead
	of `they' when it's appropriate, or add `ed' to a word when it
	happened in the past!  Apparently if you inherit a faulty
	version of this gene you will never be able to do any of those
	automatically.

	[...]

	These people aren't aware that they have a problem making
	plurals or past tenses, [...]

	[...]

	This discovery [...] makes it much more difficult to argue that
	language is simply a byproduct of learning, [...]

The defect occurs in non-English speakers also.  The gene seems to only
affect language, and only the ability to make plurals and past tenses.
If there's a gene for plurals, there are probably genes for other
components of language.

Aside from all the flames about whether spelling and punctuation
errors come from poor language design (:-) or poor user education or
differences in values, there *are* some new technology-related problems.
Many maga- zine articles, especially in the com- puter industry,
are suffering from leftover hyphen- ations, which come from re-for- matting 
word-processed text and not checking whether -'s at the ends of lines are 
intentional dashes or are hyphens put in to accommodate line-breaks before 
including the - and space in the new text.

"Wired" is one of the worst offenders, probably because most of its
authors use a variety of computer systems to write on.

I just picked up the Don Norman/Mark Jackson/Alayne McGregor exchange on
'its', 'it's', and English spelling design generally.

Don is right about bad spelling design being the cause of endless problems
of written English. But Halle &amp; Chomsky were wrong about underlying deep
consistency in English spelling. For one thing, their analysis ignored such
fundamental inconsistencies as &lt;ea/ee&gt; in 'speak/speech'. For another
thing, they ignored the whole historical dimension, which Don Norman
rightly alludes to.

The truth is that for 1,000 years no one has been able to ensure consistency,
deep or otherwise, in English spelling, ie since the Norman Conquest of
England in 1066, English spelling, unlike that of most languages, has not been
"designed with the user in mind", as Don Norman very sensibly puts it.
Webster's contribution was a small step in the direction of greater
consistency, which the British have still largely failed to follow. Various
people have tried using extra symbols (Benjamin Franklin was one), but they
have always run up against the problem of needing to teach all th millions
(billions?) of potential readers what these new symbols stand for.

As for the apostrophe,the deep INconsistency of English rears its head there
too. Mostly the possessive apostrophe precedes final &lt;s&gt; with singular nouns:
'the dog's kennel', but follows it in the plural: 'the dogs' kennels'. But
sometimes we find the reverse: 'men's' is plural, but 'Achilles'' is singular.
  
A different set of inconsistencies affects the possessive pronouns mentioned
by Mark Jackson. As he rightly says, most don't use apostrophes, so that we
write 'hers', 'ours', 'yours', 'theirs', and of course 'its', and not 'her's',
'our's' etc.  But 'one's' is an exception: for some reason we DO write that
with an apostrophe.  However, the craziest inconsistency is 'whose', where we
add an &lt;e&gt; at the end!

If Alayne McGregor implying that all languages are written as inconsistently
as English, he is mistaken. English is unique - as are its problems of
illiteracy.  Both the USA and Britain have recently published major reports on
its appalling extent.

We do need to get to grips with this question of spelling design. Let me now
attach a recent paper put out by the Simplified Spelling Society on the
subect.

CUT SPELLING

A Streamlined Writing System for English

a proposal for modernizing English spelling by removing redundant letters

THE BACKGROUND

Why reform English spelling?

English spelling is notoriously hard to master. It is a centuries-old writing
system whose contradictions and eccentricities were never designed for a fully
literate society. We all suffer from its clumsiness and inconsistency: it
takes far longer to learn than more regular systems; it limits people's
ability to express themselves; it causes mispronunciation, especially by
foreign learners; most people acquire at best an erratic command of it (even
skilled writers are prone to uncertainty and error); and many millions are
condemned to functional illiteracy. It is therefore small wonder there is such
concern about standards of literacy in English-speaking countries today. Yet
many of those countries have in recent decades seen the benefit of modernizing
equally antiquated systems of currency and weights &amp; measures. Similar
modernization of English spelling is badly needed.

Is reform possible?

Spelling reform is an unfamiliar idea to the English-speaking world, but other
languages show it is feasible and indeed a normal way of preserving a writing
system from obsolescence. The letters of the alphabet were designed to stand
for the sounds of speech, but pronunciation evolves in the course of time, and
confusion sets in when letters and sounds cease to match: the way we speak
words now no longer tells us how to write them, and the way they are written
no longer tells us how to speak them. That is the central problem of English
spelling. In the past century many languages have modernized their spelling to
improve this match between letters and sounds, and so aid literacy. To ensure
continuity, only small changes are usually made, and while schoolchildren
learn some new, improved spellings, most adults continue to write as before.
It may therefore take a lifetime before everyone uses the new forms. Ideally,
spelling reform needs to be an imperceptibly slow, but carefully planned and
continuous process.

Problems of regularizing

Many schemes have been devised for respelling English as it is pronounced, but
apart from some small improvements in America none has been adopted for
general use. Several fully regularized systems have however been tried in the
past 150 years in teaching beginners, with dramatic success in helping them
acquire basic literacy skills, the best known recently being the i.t.a.
(initial teaching alphabet). However, all these schemes have required learners
to transfer to the traditional irregular spelling as soon as they can read and
write fluently, and much of the advantage is then lost.
        Ideal though total regularization may ultimately be, the effect such
schemes have on written English is so drastic as to be a major deterrent to
their adoption. The following sentence, in the Simplified Spelling Society's
New Spelling (1948), perhaps the best thought-out and most influential of
these fully regularized orthographies, demonstrates the effect:"Dhe langgwej
wood be impruuvd bie dhe adopshon of nue speling for wurdz". Less radical
proposals have therefore been made since then, so as to avoid such visual
disruption, suggesting for instance that at first only the spelling of one
sound, like the first vowel in any, should be regularized; or a single
irregularity, like &lt;gh&gt;, should be removed.  However, the immediate benefit of
such a reform would be slight.
        A new approach is called for if today's readers are not to be
alienated, yet learners are to benefit significantly.

STREAMLINING

Cutting redundant letters

In the 1970s the Australian psychologist Valerie Yule found that many
irregular spellings arise from redundant letters. These are letters which
mislead because they are not needed to represent the sound of a word.  Writers
then cannot tell from a word's pronunciation which letters its written form
requires, nor where to insert them, while readers are likely to mispronounce
unfamiliar words containing them. A group within the Simplified Spelling
Society therefore decided to explore which letters are redundant in English,
and the effect their removal has on the appearance of the resulting 'cut'
text. This Cut Spelling (CS) is now demonstrated.

Esy readng for continuity

One first notices that one can imediatly read CS quite esily without even
noing th rules of th systm. Since most words ar unchanjed and few letrs
substituted, one has th impression of norml ritn english with a lot of od
slips, rathr than of a totaly new riting systm. Th esential cor of words, th
letrs that identify them, is rarely afectd, so that ther is a hy levl of
compatbility between th old and new spelngs. This is esential for th gradul
introduction of any spelng reform, as ther must be no risk of a brekdown of
ritn comunication between th jenrations educated in th old and th new systms.
CS represents not a radicl upheval, but rather a streamlining, a trimng away
of many of those featurs of traditionl english spelng wich dislocate th smooth
opration of th alfabetic principl of regulr sound-symbl corespondnce.

FURTHR ADVANTAJS

Savings

Th secnd thing one notices is that CS is som 10% shortr than traditionl
spelng. This has sevrl importnt advantajs. To begin with, it saves time and
trubl for evryone involvd in producing ritn text, from scoolchildren to
publishrs, from novlists to advrtisers, from secretris to grafic desynrs.  CS
wud enable them al to create text that much fastr, because ther wud be fewr
letrs to rite and they wud hesitate less over dificlt spelngs.  Scoolchildren
cud then devote th time saved in th act of riting (as wel as that saved in
aquiring litracy skils) to othr lernng activitis. Simlr time-saving wud be
experienced by adults in handriting, typng, word-procesng, typ-setng, or any
othr form of text production. Th reduced space requiremnt has typograficl
benefits: public syns and notices cud be smalr, or ritn larjr; mor text cud be
fitd on video or computer screens; fewr abreviations wud be needd; and fewr
words wud hav to be split with hyfns at th ends of lines. Ther wud also be
material savings: with around one paje in ten no longr needd, books and
newspapers wud require less paper (alternativly, mor text cud be carrid in th
same space as befor), and demands on both storaj and transport wud be less.
And th environmnt wud gain from th loer consumtion of raw materials and enrjy
in manufacturng and from th reduction in th amount of waste needng to be
disposed of.

Targetng spelng problms

Less imediatly obvius is th fact that CS removes many of th most trublsm
spelng problms that hav bedevld riting in english for centuris. Ther ar thre
main categris: ther ar silent letrs, such as &lt;s&gt; in isle or &lt;i&gt; in business,
wich ar so ofn mispelt eithr as ilse, buisness, or as ile, busness; th latr ar
th CS forms. Anothr categry is that of variant unstresd vowls, as befor th
final &lt;r&gt; in burglar, teacher, doctor, glamour, murmur, injure, martyr, wich
CS neatly alyns as burglr, teachr, doctr, glamr, murmr, injr, martr. Thirdly
ther ar th dubld consnnts, so ofn mispelt singl today, as found in such words
as accommodate, committee, parallel(l)ed; CS simplifys these to acomodate,
comitee, paraleld.


RULES OF CUT SPELLING

Cutting rules

These three problem areas of traditional spelling correspond to the three
main rules of Cut Spelling (CS).

Rule 1  Letters irrelevant to pronunciation

About 20 of the 26 letters of the alphabet are sometimes used with no bearing
on pronunciation at all. Some, like &lt;e&gt; in love, &lt;gh&gt; in though and &lt;w&gt; in
answer, were once sounded, but fell silent centuries ago. Others were taken
from foreign languages, like &lt;ch&gt; in yacht (Dutch), &lt;h&gt; in honest (French),
and &lt;p&gt; in psyche (Greek), but are always silent in English. Yet others were
inserted by analogy (&lt;gh&gt; in haughty to match naughty, &lt;l&gt; in could to match
would) or to show a dubious or imagined derivation (&lt;b&gt; in doubt, &lt;c&gt; in
scythe). Two vowel letters are often written when the pronunciation only needs
one; thus &lt;a&gt; in measure, &lt;e&gt; in hearth, &lt;i&gt; in friend, &lt;o&gt; in people, &lt;u&gt; in
build are all redundant. CS removes letters such as these from hundreds of
often common words; most strikingly, CS eliminates that most grotesque of all
English spelling patterns, the &lt;gh&gt;.

Rule 2a Unstressed vowels before &lt;l,m,n,r&gt;

Thousands of English words contain &lt;l, m, n&gt; or &lt;r&gt; after an unstressed vowel,
though the pronunciation fails to tell us which vowel letter to write. In
fact, it is often redundant and can be cut, as seen from such rhyming pairs as
apple/ chapel, centre/enter: CS Rule 1 cut the silent &lt;e&gt; in apple, centre,
and the resulting appl, centr show that unstressed &lt;e&gt; can be cut in chapel,
enter too, giving CS chapl, entr. Likewise the forms rhythm, mustn't show that
the unstressed &lt;o&gt; can go in fathom and the unstressed &lt;a, e&gt; in resistant,
insistent, giving CS fathm, resistnt, insistnt. Sometimes two letters can be
cut: CS reduces curtain, luncheon, fashion to curtn, lunchn, fashn. CS Rule 2
cuts a swathe through one of the areas of greatest uncertainty in English
spelling.

Rule 2b Vowels in certain suffixes

Similar is the cut of vowel letters in some major suffixes: the plural of
ax(e) is cut to CS axs, distinguishing it from the uncut plural of axis
(axes); the verb form learned is cut to CS lernd, but the adjective is
distinguished as lerned. Strange at first is the cut of &lt;-ing&gt; to just &lt;-ng&gt;
in verbs whose root ends in a consonant (waiting, hating diverge as CS waitng,
hating), but an important gain from this cut is that it allows numerous
troublesome doubled consonants to be simplified by Rule 3. A notable
simplification is that the confusing &lt;-able, -ible&gt; suffixes are mostly
reduced to just &lt;-bl&gt;, turning eatable, edible into CS eatbl, edbl.

Rule 3  Doubled consonants simplified

Doubled consonants sound like single consonants, so the writer cannot tell
when doubling is required: frequent errors are the inevitable result. CS
simplifies nearly all of them, as in CS abreviate, embarass,
omitd/comitd/benefitd, travld/ compeld and (by Rule 2) hopng/hoping for
hopping/hoping. The main exceptions are disyllabic words ending in &lt;y&gt; and
words ending in &lt;ss&gt;; furry, tinny, hiss, discuss therefore remain distinct
from fury, tiny, his, discus.

Substitution rules

The key feature of CS is that it removes rather than replaces letters.
However, 3 simple substitutions are also made:

1       When &lt;gh, ph&gt; are pronounced /f/, they are spelt &lt;f&gt;. This produces
forms such as CS cof, tuf, fotografy, sulfr.

2       When &lt;g, dg&gt; are sounded as &lt;j&gt;, they are spelt &lt;j&gt;. This produces
forms such as CS juj, jeolojy, jinjr.

3       When &lt;ig&gt; is pronounced as in flight, sign, it is spelt &lt;y&gt;,
producing aligned forms such as fly, flyt, sty, sy, syn.

THE CUT SPELLING HANDBOOK

This leaflet barely outlines the CS proposal for modernizing English spelling.
A full account is given in a three-part Handbook. Pt I (pp1-160) discusses the
rationale of CS, its main features, its advantages, its psychological,
linguistic and educational implications, and ways in which it could be
implemented; but above all Pt I gives a detailed analysis of the present
irregularities of English spelling and how cutting redundant letters improves
the crucial interface of writing and speech. Pt II (pp163-231) illustrates the
various cuts and provides exercises for literate adults to practise converting
traditional spelling to CS and writing CS for themselves.  Pt III (pp233-297)
is a dictionary of over 20,000 of the most common words with redundant
letters, giving their simpler CS equivalents. At the end is a bibliography of
works for readers planning further study of the complexities of English
spelling and the possibilities for its simplification.

Unfortunatly th first edition of th Handbook is now out of print.  A secnd
edition is now in prepration, but th publication date is not yet nown.

RISKS is always delighted to find cases in which the benefits of computing
technology manifest themselves in a critical way.  Here is such a case.

Jack Miller, a computer analyst from Paramus NJ, was experiencing severe chest
pains and called his doctor, who put him on hold.  As his condition worsened
to the point that he felt a strange coldness and could barely breathe, he was
just barely able to type a piece of E-mail to coworkers: HELP.  FEEL SICK.
NEED AID.  Apparently he had intended to sent it just to a few nearby
colleagues, but instead it appeared as an alert message on the screen of each
of the 80 people in his department.  Some of those who responded were trained
in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and his life was saved.  [Source: an AP item
in the San Francisco Chronicle, 2 Apr 1994, p.A1.]

Much of modern-day science relies on computer models for simulation and the
testing of various hypotheses.  The use of large scale simulations now
permeates many fields, from the Monte Carlo algorithms employed by physicists
and computer scientists to genetic mutation simulations performed by
evolutionary biologists.  As computers gain speed and data storage capacity,
science's dependence on simulation will only increase.

I see two grave risks in this trend.  First, the uses I mentioned above both
rely heavily on having a "good" random number generator.  But it is well known
that even the best pseudorandom number algorithms posses large amounts of
redundancy (and thus predictability) when viewed in high-dimensional spaces.
But this is exactly the regime in which they are mainly used in science to
simulate many-body dynamics.  The second edition of "Numerical Recipes"
discards its previous random number generator for a "better" one.  Should all
the thousands of simulations which used the first version now be redone?

The second potential danger is to the fundamental quality of scientific ideas.
How long should you think about a problem before letting the computer take a
brute-force crack at it for you?  As computers become more powerful the
temptation to stop thinking and start coding looms ever more prominently.  As
a high school computer nerd turned postdoc physics nerd, I am acutely aware of
this seduction.

One aspect of this problem is that we may not think as hard as we used to.
Another may be the predominance of work being on computer simulations rather
than basic ideas.  Since these simulations generally have many adjustable
parameters, the space of possible exploration is huge, and not all of it
relevant.  This also makes the interpretation of results that much more
difficult to grasp, since there is a large number of parameters to visualize.
Pedagogically speaking, simulations should be used sparingly either to
illustrate an idea or to perform an essential computation which cannot be
carried out analytically.  A proliferation of mediocre models with many
arbitrary parameters can only spell disaster for the industry.

The Daily Mail of 1st April 1994 carried a full-page report (p3) of a new 
design of mower called the Solar Turtle. 

This is a little robot that runs around your lawn on wheels, cutting the 
grass ALL ON ITS OWN! The picture that accompanies the article shows a 
low-profile object about 3 feet long by 2 feet wide, elliptical in outline, 
and with its top surface sloping down from about one foot at the front to 
6 inches at the back. (I am guessing: the exact dimensions are not given.) 
It is so light that "it can be carried by a child." It is also (mercifully!) 
almost completely silent. 

Its flat upper surface is covered with an array of solar panels which provide 
it with sufficient power to trundle around even on dull days, and charge its 
little batteries so that it can keep going if it runs into a shaded patch of 
garden. Its maximum speed is 1.8 kph (slower in the shade). Three separate 
electric motors drive its two front wheels and rotating cutting blade. Since 
it is intended to operate continuously, the grass never gets a chance to grow. 
Therefore trimmings are very fine, and are simply left on the lawn as a mulch, 
so that no collector box is required, and it doesn't even require periodic 
attention from the gardener to empty it. 

A single machine can look after 2000 sq. ft. of lawn. Price {pounds} 1,500 
to 2,000 (still TBA). Manufacturers are Husqvarna of Sweden, and the inventor 
is Andre Coles (Belgian). So far, it has been demonstrated at the Spring 
Gardening Fair at Olympia, London. Look out for it next at the Chelsea Flower 
Show. It will probably go on sale next year. (British outlet: Husqvarna 
Forest and Garden.) 

Risks? Well, what if it a) cuts your toe off, b) mows your prize dahlias, 
c) gets stuck, or d) gets nicked? 

This is where the relevance of all this to the RISKS forum becomes apparent. 
For the Turtle is controlled by (you've guessed it, folks!) "an on-board 
computer [which] analyses conditions 500 times a second, enabling it to adapt 
to the amount of light, humidity and temperature, and to negotiate slopes 
and particularly overgrown patches." 

a) Safety (1): If it hits anything (tree, chair, foot) "a shock detector stops 
it in its tracks". The picture shows a sort of white band around the front 
edge, which is presumably a collision sensor. Since it moves "backwards and 
forwards a few feet at a time", it presumably has a similar sensor at the 
rear. Its sensor seems to be a few inches off the ground. Could it give a 
sleeping cat a short back and sides? 

b) Safety (2): It will not operate outside an area delimited by a buried 
"boundary cable". An "electronic sensor" detects the cable, and "tells it 
to turn back". The article does not go into this, but (IMHO) this is a 
serious marketing weakness. The photo shows the Turtle standing proudly in 
the foreground with a smiling and highly photogenic young lady (who obviously 
never got her hands dirty with a bit of weeding in her life!) lolling in 
a deck-chair in the background. The scenery includes (as well as the happy 
Turtle user) about 50 acres of garden containing a lake, irregular patches 
of shrubbery, occasional trees, and artistically arranged lumps of rock. 
Even assuming the Turtle can negotiate the rocks, shrubs and trees without 
help, burying a boundary cable around that little lot must be a major 
logistical exercise. 

c) Reliability: This must depend on precisely how intelligent its program is. 
It can't simply stop when it hits a tree, so what does it do? Back up and 
charge again? Try a random turn? What happens if it hits your foot, and you 
then move out of the way? You can bet that even if you have more sense than 
to get in its way, your kids will have hours of fun trying to convince it 
that they are a tree! If it maintains a database of the terrain, this could 
seriously blow its tiny mind! :-) On the other hand, it must somehow avoid 
mowing the same little patch over and over again. Does it remember where it's 
been? (Software Engineering coursework assignment: "Design an algorithm using 
a pseudo-random number generator to ensure that a Turtle covers the whole of 
a piece of lawn 2,000 sq. ft. in area in a given time irrespective of the 
shape of the perimeter or the presence of interior obstructions." - That 
should keep the students busy! :-) 

d) Security: If the Turtle is picked up, "a loud alarm goes off ... and is 
turned off only when an individual code is punched in. And it cannot operate 
outside the electronic boundary." ("I say, Alice! What's the code for this 
****** Turtle? I can't turn the frigging alarm off!") Also, if it's *carried* 
outside the boundary cable, how does it detect this? Mmmm ... 

After all that, risks to the public? Err ... getting fat through not having 
to mow the lawn? :-) 

  [There is a disclaimer in the Mail article which states that 
  this is NOT an April Fool joke! :-) ]

The financial pages will be burning up with stories about a relatively small
investment fund called "Granite." The fund was set up by "really smart guy"
named David Askin to provide "RISK-free" investment in the the mortgage backed
securities market. As early as middle March, Askin was pretty sure that his
fund was still worth $600 million. Now it may not be worth anything. Poof. In
two weeks!

How could this happen? Everyone understands how money can disappear in the
stockmarket. But, the Granite fund was different. Askin et al.  used very
sophisticated models to figure out which morgage-backed securities were cheap
and which were dear. He would buy the cheap ones and sell out the expensive
ones. Eventually, the market would drive the price of the cheap and dear
securities together. Then the fund would close out the position and make money
based upon the original spread.

The great "strength" of plan was that it was supposedly interest-rate neutral.
If the rates went up, then both the cheap and the dear securities would lose
value in sync. They're both bonds so they tend to lose value as interest rates
rise. So any loss in the value of the "cheap" securities that the fund
actually bought was offset by a gain the value of the short investment in
"dear" securities that fund sold short. The same process would work in reverse
if interest rates dropped.

The main problem seems to be that no one was willing to buy any
mortgage-backed securities as the bond rates went through the roof.
The markets just froze. Plus, prices weren't behaving according to
the very careful models that he originally created. Bam.

Interested parties should check out the various articles in the NYT (April 5,
A1), Time magazine (cover), and other sources to find out more details.

The message for the comp.risks readers is the same old story of technical
hubris that we've grown to love. But it is even better than almost any other
case I've read about. People who use computers and mathematics on Wall Street
usually have a stronger arrogance than those who use the computers to guide
planes, run home security systems, run 911 systems or steer satellites. Why?
Derivative securities, like those bought by Granite, are sheer creations of
mathematicians. It is very tempting to believe that they're free from
real-world problems like wind, noise, pets or other gremlins that keep plenty
of engineers up late.

I've worked on Wall Street doing these sorts of things. The whole mathematical
foundation of the work made things both very fun and very certain. I've always
thought that mathematics was a very clubbish pursuit. The proofs were the
rites of initiation. Once you made it in you could be sure that you and the
other members of this club really did have a superior view of the world.
Unlike the all-male, all-female, all-whatever clubs, you had actually _proven_
the truths you held up as self-evident. The mathematicians running these games
are probably just as sure.

But, when the Bear putsch came to shove and the world tried to get out of the
stock market at the same time, all of the mathematical models started breaking
down. I can assure you that the people who bought into this fund probably
thought that they were buying a sure thing. They had probably worked through
the math themselves. There are probably lawyers combing the prospectus hoping
that the Granite partners were so sure of themselves that they didn't put the
usual disclaimers in the prospectus.

At this point, I'm wondering about of the dangers of using mathematics for a
guarantee of even things mathematical. The theorem that all maps can be
colored with four colors is widely known as the first example of
computer-based proofs. Many people don't remember that the theorem was
originally considered settled and true back at the turn of the century. People
believed the "proof" for several decades. Then someone stumbled upon a
loophole and it became famous again.

     The Under Pork Belly of Efficient Markets, or 
     How to Launder Money Using Cattle Futures
 
The great promise of electronic networks and virtual communities is a
collection of very efficient markets. In the future, information will be
moved, products will be sold and trades will be executed in a blink of an eye.
This efficiency is usually considered to be a pretty good thing by everyone in
business, in economics or in line at the video store. The underside of this
efficiency, though, is a blurring of the line between legitimate and
illegitimate business.
 
A good way to understand this effect is to study the case of how to launder
money using the futures markets. Laundering money is an age old problem for
people who want to move funds from person A to person B without leaving a
suspicious trail. Cash is the nieve approach and it has plenty of problems: it
is bulky, it can be lost or stolen, and most importantly it often leaves
people asking "Hey, where did that come from?"
 
The futures markets, though, make it simple to move funds in a way that is
indistinguishable from ordinary commerce. If it is done correctly, the
recipiant, person A, looks like a lucky stiff or a market savvy investor.
Person B is usually out of the picture or out of luck. The same games can be
played with almost any other market, but futures markets are so efficient that
the process is actually feasible and easy to do.
 
The basic transaction in futures is to buy or sell a contract for the delivery
of x pounds/barrels/tons/feet of some commodity at y dollars/yen/marks etc. If
you buy a contract, then you're obligated to actually cough up y dollars when
the contract comes due.  Most people don't hold on to the contracts long
enough for them to actually take delivery.  They sell another contract and the
futures market maintains a clearing house that is responsible for matching up
the contracts and cancelling them out. It's a great system. Very efficient and
very useful for farmers, manufacturers and others who actually produce and
consume commodities.
 
Futures markets are great for laundering money, though, because they can
generate big losses or big gains in a short amount of time. It is quite
possible for $100 to turn into a $5000 gain overnight. The downside is that it
can often turn into a $5000 loss in the same amount of time. In fact, the
market is a zero sum game. If you make n dollars, then there is someone out
there who just lost n dollars. The sum total of the losses and the winnings
equals zero.
 
This zero sum nature is the key to laundering the money. Person A and Person B
get together and guess that the price for a commodity is going to go up. That
means that who ever buys a contract will make money. So Person A, the intended
recipient buys a contract and Person B sells a contract. If they're right,
then Person A gets the money and Person B loses the same amount.
 
Bingo. The money moved from B to A and no one can trace how it got there.
Person A looks smart or lucky and Person B looks out of luck. There was no
direct connection between the two. There are thousands of other people out
there winning and losing money at the same time. The marketplace's central
clearing house arranges it so each wins and loses their rightful share.
 
You may wonder why B bothered to sell a contract and lose money. This is the
safeguard against guessing wrong. No one is correct all of the time. Even the
people who try and rig the markets and corner them get burned as often as they
succeed. The best investors in the futures markets, the ones who make money
time after time, are the arbitrageurs. They spot inefficient pockets and try
and remain neutral to the overall shifts in the market.
 
Person B sells the contract so that if the market goes down, i.e., the wrong
way, then A and B together have lost no money. It's a zero sum. Now they just
have to play the game a bit longer or for stakes that are twice as high. You
can think of the process as flipping a coin until you have encounter a heads.
 
Ideally, you play this game with two players with relatively deep
pockets. This means that A can cover the short term loses. This is a
bit of a disadvantage because many money laundering operations must
move cash from the rich to the poor. You can cover up this problem by
using the same broker for A and B. The broker executes the trades and
then assigns the winning trade to A and the losing trade to B. They
fill in the order books after the fact.
 
Using the same broker for A and B can be problematic because it may look too
suspicious if the mirrored trades appear on the same ledger. The beauty of
this system is that it can look quite indistinguishable from normal business
practices. Many companies actively enter the futures markets to hedge
themselves against foreign currency movements. Others actively enter the
futures markets to guarantee themselves a good supply of their raw materials.
 
The essential point of this lesson is that fast, efficient markets make it
possible to move money easily. The futures markets were designed so that is no
real other half to every trade. It's literally you against the world with
every trade. The RISKS, of course, is that accountability can vanish as the
size of the crowd grows to be as big as the world. There is no way to catch up
with this. The futures market are so great because there is no need to deal
one on one.
 
The effects of speed are not only apparent in big financial markets. Credit
cards and overnight delivery are a dangerous combination. You could steal
cards, order a fortune of stuff, arrange for it all to be delivered overnight
and then jump town quickly before people notice the card was gone. Suddenly,
merchants must deal with the fact that something that used to be complete
legitimate (exchanging cash for goods) is now a potential theft.
 
Of course, there are other crimes that lose their edge. It is much harder to
escape the law by heading to a new town. Computerized fingerprint files are
very, very efficient.

I think everyone felt that perfect, computerized markets would bring about the
right mixture of accountability and efficiency. It would be a perfect mixture
of Big Brotherly scrutiny would take care of everything. Every trade, after
all, is recorded in the futures market. Yet, the best mechanism for anonymous
fund transfer yet discovered exists here in the midsts of all of this record
keeping, legal scrutiny and oversight.

To add one more to your creative software disclaimers; I read this one in
WIRED magazine issue #2.01. It is reprinted without permission. It concerns
Haventrees Software's EasyFlow program.

  If EasyFlow doesn't work: tough. If you lose millions because EasyFlow
  messes up, it's you that's out the millions, not us. If you don't like this
  disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided
  by law, up to and including nothing. This is basically the same disclaimer
  that comes with all software packages, but ours is in plain English and

Certainly clarifies their position. In a strange, twisted, punkish kind of

With all the tribulations you have gone through in trying to mail stuff
properly through the various E-Mail systems I thought you might enjoy this
joke that was related by columnists Nicholas Petreley and Laura Wonnacott in
the March 28, 1994 issue of InfoWORLD:

A fellow goes into a bar and says to the bartender, "Hey, I just heard this
great E-mail gateway programmer joke."

The bartender replies indignantly, "Now, wait a minute. I used to be a gateway
programmer.  See that guy at the end of the bar? The guy at the other end?
Those two guys at the table over there?  They are all gateway programmers.
Now, do you still want to tell that joke?"

And the fellow says, "Well, not if I have to explain it five times."

Last weekend, March 27th I checked into a local Holiday Inn for an
overnight stay and was given only 1 credit card style mag-stripe key.
A few hours later I went back to the desk and requested another key
for my wife.  The clerk asked for my name and room number, pulled
something up on her computer, swiped a key through a card read
(writer?) and handed it to me.  No photo ID or other ID requested.

I asked if it is standard to not request ID for extra keys and was
told that is true.  I then asked her if she realized anyone could get
a key just by knowing the name of a person and what room they were in.
She seemed quite startled by this.

The RISK is quite obvious.

&gt;From the Associated Press newswire via Executive News Service on CompuServe
(GO ENS):

  Welfare Fingerprints, By KATHLEEN HOLDER, Associated Press Writer

    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP, 31 Mar 1994) -- Expanding the use of
  fingerprinting to flush out welfare cheats, Los Angeles County will soon
  start taking the prints of applicants for federal dependent children
  benefits.
    Officials said the requirement, which won state approval Wednesday, will
  be the nation's first use of fingerprinting to prevent fraud by applicants
  for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main federal-state welfare
  program."

The author explains the background and details.  Key points:

o electronic fingerprint scans of applicants are stored in computer database.

o fingerprint taken as unique authenticator of identity.

o Los Angeles has been using these techniques since 1991 for state general
assistance.

o Needed and received a waiver from federal govt to add requirement to federal
regulations for AFDC.

o These techniques will be implemented state-wide if they work.

o Several advocates for poor people's rights object to the stigma of
fingerprinting.

o "In the first six months after Los Angeles County began running fingerprint
checks for general assistance in 1991, the county reported cutting its costs
by $5.4 million, or more than half."

o "More than 3,000 people lost their aid for suspected fraud, and more than
200 applicants were denied assistance because they refused to submit their
fingerprints."

Q: What is WAIS? 
A: It stands for Wide Area Information Server. It's a pretty popular
standard for accessing text based information on the Internet. Anyone
can use readily available software to create an index for a collection
of texts and then make this available to the world on the Internet. 

Q: How do you use it? 
A: Get the right software, choose some data bases, type in some keywords
and press the button. WAIS will come back with a list of documents and
their matching quotient. You can then choose to read the entire text of
the documents.

Q: Why would RISKS readers care about this?
A: Comp.risks digests are indexed with a WAIS server. You can type in
"plane crash" and get more than enough information to keep you wondering
about one, two and three engine planes that fly-by-wire using code
written in Fortran and encrypted with Clipper to prevent terrorist
hackers.

Q: How can I get the software?
A: There are many different ways to access WAIS. Many GOPHER servers
offer it as an option. You won't even leave GOPHER to type your query.

You can also use TELNET to "quake.think.com" and log in as "wais" to use
their link. The interface isn't great, but it is not bad.

The best options seems to be to get a copy of the specialized software
written for different platforms. One package, which I've used
occasionally is called "MacWAIS." It is available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.tidbits.com.  You need to have a Macintosh computer with an Internet
connection using MacTCP to use this. There are other copies for NeXTs,
PCs and other machines at ftp.think.com in the "/wais" directory.

Q: Are there any tricky parts?
A: Well, it is pretty easy in some respects. You just type and go. I've
occasionally had trouble getting a good list of servers that are
available.  The WAIS folks were clever enough to make it possible to use
WAIS to search through the lists of servers. You just type in some
keywords and back comes a list of servers that have that keyword in their
description.

So, if you want to access RISKS, try searching the directory of servers
for the keyword RISKS. Once you find it, you will be able to save the
result on your machine and it will automagically know about the RISKS
server.

Another solution is to search through the directory of servers using
".src".  Several people have recommended this to me, but I've had trouble
getting it to work well for a number of reasons. First, it only searches
the description string of each server. If the author/creator of the
server was parsimonious with the description, then you might not even
find the world ".src" in there. I've tried all kinds of keywords, but
I've often felt like there are still many sources out there that I just
can't find.

This problem may be fixed or solved by now. (Please write if it has.)

  [This item may be old news now, but is included for the archives.]

Despite elaborate precautions designed to prevent such an occurrence, two
American F-15C fighter planes shot down two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk
helicopters in the no-fly zone over northern Iraq on 14 Apr 1994, in broad
daylight, in an area that had been devoid of Iraqi aircraft for many months.
One Sidewinder heat-seeking missile and one Amraam radar-guided missile were
fired.  The fighters were operating under the communication control of an
AWACS plane, which was the first to detect the helicopters, and instructed the
F-15s to check the situation out.  The helicopters were carrying U.S.,
British, French and Turkish officers from the U.N. office in Zakho, in
northern Iraq, and were heading eastward for a meeting with Kurdish leaders in
Salahaddin.  Both towns are close to the Turkish border, well north of the
26th parallel that delimits the no-fly zone.  All 26 aboard were killed.

Both helicopter pilots apparently failed to perform the routine operation of
notifying the AWACS plane after their last takeoff.  Both helicopters
apparently failed to respond to the Identification: Friend or Foe (IFF)
requests from the fighters.  Both fighter pilots apparently did not try voice
communications.  A visual flyby apparently misidentified the clearly marked
("U.N.") planes as Iranian MI-24s.  Furthermore, a briefing had apparently
been held the day before for the appropriate personnel of all of those
aircraft (F-15s, UH-60s, and AWACS).  There was speculation as to whether the
pilots of both helicopters might have neglected to turn on their transponders,
or whether the frequencies were set incorrectly, or whether both transponders
failed (or perhaps some hybrid scenario).  There was speculation that the
fighter pilots did not try all three of the IFF modes available to them.
There was also speculation that the Black Hawks may have visually resembled
Russian helicopters because they were carrying extra external fuel tanks.  But
the AWACS plane personnel should have been aware of the entire operation,
because they were acting as battlefield coordinators.

Perhaps someone panicked.  An unidentified senior Pentagon offical was quoted
as asking "What was the hurry to shoot them down?"

[Sources: various press reports in The New York Times and other papers,
15 Apr 1994 and 18 Apr 1994.]

"Friendly fire" (also called fratricide, amicicide, and "misadventure") is not
uncommon.  An item by Rick Atkinson in The Washington Post (15 Apr 1994) noted
that 24 percent of the Americans killed in action -- 35 out of 146 -- in the
Persian Gulf war were killed by U.S. forces.  Also, 15 percent of those
wounded -- 72 out of 467 -- were similarly victimized.  RISKS noted earlier
the British Warrior armored vehicles that, mistaken for Iraqi T-55 tanks, were
zapped by U.S. Maverick missiles, killing 9 men and wounding 11 others.
Atkinson's article noted that this is an old problem, citing a Confederate
sentry who shot his commander, Stonewall Jackson, in 1863, during the Civil
War; an allied bomber that bombed the 30th Infantry Division after the
invasion of Normandy in July 1944; and a confused bomber pilot who killed 42
U.S.  paratroopers and wounded 45 in the November 1967 battle of Hill 875 in
Vietnam.  The old adage was never more appropriate: With friends like this,
who needs enemies?

The Black Hawk incident also brings back memories of the Soviet shootdown of

RISKS received a huge amount of mail relating to the husband-and-wife Phoenix
immigration-law-firm, Canter &amp; Siegel.  Offering their legal services, they
posted an advertisement on 5000 newsgroups, and gave information on a
forthcoming lottery that will give out 55,000 green cards (granting permanent
residency in the United States).  C&amp;S received at least 30,000 responses,
mostly protesting their use of the Internet for advertising.

Internet Direct suspended the C&amp;S account for violation of the customer
service agreement.  I.D. had to put up with the thousands of pieces of
objections.  [This gives a new meaning to OBJECT-oriented E-mail.]  C&amp;S
threatened to sue for I.D. for $250,000 for the lost responses.  At least one
site crashed repeatedly because of mail saturation.

This reminds me once again of all the varied problems that I have with the
fly-by-night it's-not-quite-the-Internet providers.  One of them rejects mail
after you hit your quota of external mail for the month.  Some include the
entire mailing list on each RISKS mailing, as noted earlier.  Many do not
permit FTP, but offer thousands of users the opportunity to invoke the
almost-costfree availability of my pro-bono but not timefree services.  Is
regulation an answer?  I shudder at the thought.

I cannot begin to summarize the RISKS mail on this subject, and certainly
would risk losing most of our subscribers if I ran the whole collection.  The
issues include the usual stuff about whether the no-advertising policy even
exists, whether it is a per-newsgroup question or an Internet policy question,
who actually controls the Internet, and all those topics familiar to RISKS
folks.  Perhaps we are waiting in expectation of the ultimate scam from New
Haven, which might be considered a violation of Con-netiquette.

Data storage technique provides copy protection

Summarized and translated from
 "Intermediair", 1 April 1994, Vol. 30, Nr. 13, p. 35.

Universities of Plymouth (in the U.K.) and Washington DC developed a technique
to write five times as much information on magnetic media as floppy discs or
bank cards.  The magnetic layer is composed of small magnetic particles. Every
bit is "remembered" by polarising several thousands of them in the same
direction.  This is done to overcome noise, due to the random orientation of
the particles.  The new technique only uses a fifth of the number of particles
used in conventional techniques. It reads the information on the medium
directly after writing it. By comparing the real magnetisation with the
expected one, a chip determines the deviations in the medium. Based on that,
information about these deviations is also written on the medium. Later, this
enables flawless read out.  An extra feature of this technique is that the
information about the deviations is unique for every medium, comparable to a
fingerprint. This means that when a bank cheques this fingerprint, it can
detect fraud copies of bank cards.

The following is a slightly edited version of a report from the latest issue
of the Department of Energy Operating Experience Weekly Summary, which is a
vehicle for rapid dissemination to other DOE organizations and contractors of
occurrences at DOE facilities.

"On January 17, 1994, the earthquake in Southern California caused 
widespread power outages in the western portion of the United States, and 
commercial power was lost at a DOE chemical processing facility.  When 
commercial power was lost, a standby diesel generator automatically 
started and supplied power to critical loads.  During a power transient 
caused by starting a large load on the diesel generator, four electric 
motors dropped off line and did not respond to a start command even though 
individual controllers indicated a ready-to-start condition.  Facility 
personnel had to completely de-energize and then re-energize the motor 
controllers before the motors could be re-started. 

"After commercial power was restored, facility personnel determined that 
the porblem could not be duplicated for partially loaded generator
conditions or with commercial power supplying the standby motor control 
center.  Investigators determined that all the affected motors were 
connected to the same standby motor control center which was equipped with 
new digital motor protectors.  Facility personnel developed a series of 
test procedures to determine the cause of the problem.  After extensive 
testing, they determined that the motor protectors developed a software 
lockup after a power transient.  During a simulation of the loss of 
commercial power, investigators determined that there was a correlation 
between voltage swings caused by starting a large load on the standby 
generator and the software lockup of the motor protector.  The motor 
protector lockup resulted in the motor tripping off and not restarting
until control power was removed and re-applied.

"Facility personnel contacted the motor protector vendor with the results
of the tests conducted at the facility.  Vendor personnel confirmed
the test results and reported that they had isolated the problem to
specific units with firmware version F3, introduced in the fourth
quarter of 1991.  The vendor reported that units manufactured from
1987 through the third quarter of 1991 were not affected.

"The vendor also reported that the units operated properly if the control 
voltage is maintained within plus or minus ten per cent of nominal
voltage.  If the control voltage surges beyond this range, the motor 
protector may trip the motor and require a power down to reset itself.  
The vendor offered to modify the affected units to eliminate the power 
reset after a voltage surge. 

"DOE facility personnel are advised to inspect their facilities for the 
suspect motor protector and take appropriate corrective actions." 


The risk associated with this event is that a software modification in 
1991 rendered the standby electrical power system partially unable to
fulfill its safety function.  The root cause of this situation was that 
software engineer(s) involved in this modification (which was perhaps the 
initial digitally-controlled version of this component) were not fully
aware of the actual operating environment (in this case, voltage swings 
greater that +/- 10% when the standby power system was doing what it was 
designed to do) of the digitally-controlled component.

Some years ago I upgraded the operating system of a minicomputer. A few weeks
later a faculty member became very upset: his research results had changed.
Apparently the upgrade changed the random-number generator, which made his
statistical programs give a different result.  He demanded the original
generator be put back in again.

An MIT student was arrested today for having a BBS at the school that was used
by the participants to store and fetch commercial software.  This one made the
national news because of the promenance of the institution and the information
superhypeway, but this sort of arrest has been going on for years in the
"hacker" bulleting boards of the US.  There is now a substantial history of
these operators being convicted, but I have to question whether MIT should be
arrested for allowing the BBS to reside on its computers.  After all, if the
BBS superuser can be arrested for unknowingly having the software on their
BBS, why can't the institution be arrested as well?

	But the issue goes far deeper than this.  At its core, we have the
multitudes of people trying to tell us that the information superHW should
have public access points and public spaces, but what happens when a public
space is used for crime? The criminal is not arrested; instead, the person who
provided the space is arrested.  If we are to have public space on our info
superHW, we had better stop arresting those who provide it for the crimes
perpetrated in it.  Otherwise, there will be a chilling effect on those who
would provide it.

	How does this relate to RISKS? It should be obvious.  If you have a
party, and someone who attends commits a crime, you may be sent to jail for
it.  No precedent? Huh! If someone is drinking at your house or bar, and you
fail to prevent them, and they drive away and get in an accident, you may be
liable.

I anxiously await your responses on the policy issues at play here.  FC

A friend recently applied for a credit card from a major issuer.  Later he
received a call from the bank informing him that his card was in a batch that
was stolen somewhere along the delivery route.  Over $4000 had been charged to
his card in a 24 hour period.

This was once quite common.  However, most card issuers now use an automated
system to "activate" the card.  Usually it involves dialing an 800 number and
entering some "secret" information (e.g. your birth date, ssn, etc).

As it turns out, my friend's wife had received a phone call from someone
claiming to work for the issuer.  He said that they wanted to verify his
application and asked for the his full name and SSN, which she gave.

The automated authorization system of this issuer asks for the last four
digits of your SSN.  

I'm really curious what sort of success rate was achieved by the thieves.
Did they get fifty percent of the card owners to give their SSNs?  More?

Last week in the security track of the CardTech/SecureTech Conference, I heard
a presentation by a representative of the U.S. Postal Service on the "US
Card."  This is a piece of the national information infrastructure intended to
mediate all government services to and controls over the citizen.

It will contain health care data, financial data, tax data, and identity data.
It will contain a private key (digital signatures only), a PIN, and other
identifying data.  (While emphasizing that "open to new applications" was a
requirement of the system, he was silent on arrest record, voter registration,
gender preference, and previous condition of servitude.)

Use of the card will be "voluntary."  The government is doing this for us
because it will enable them to give us better service, because the citizens
require "one card," and to protect us from the "twenty million 'little
brothers'" that we now recognize as the "real threat to our privacy."  (He did
not claim that this would protect us from terrorists, child molestors, drug
dealers, or religious cults.)  (All of this was delivered with a perfectly
straight face and without challenge from the audience.)  Of course if we do
not like it, we can do away with it, right?

The official stated that the Postal Service is prepared to issue a ahundred
million of these cards within months of getting the go ahead.

Along with the net, "voluntary" fingerprinting of the poor, CLIPPER, and the
FBI's digital telephony initiative, what more could any citizen, not to say
government, ask for?  Law and order is just around the corner.

Aren't you glad to hear that Orwell had it all wrong?

The following is most of a letter I sent to my local Baby Bell recently after
receiving a marketing letter aimed at increasing calling card use.  I think
the risks of the mailing are fairly obvious from the letter...  ajm

I simply wanted to inform you that I was disturbed to find in my mail an
unexpected letter from you that contained my Ameritech Calling Card PIN.
My objections to this letter are as follows:

1) Since I was not expecting the letter, if it had been removed from my
   mailbox or the U.S. Mail before I received it I would have had no way
   of knowing that something was wrong until I got my next phone bill
   (complete with calls I hadn't made).

2) Increasing the possibility of delivery problems, the address on the
   envelope was, if not wrong, at least very nonstandard.  In
   particular, it had two different forms of the town name, both on
   separate lines.  If something this easy to catch made it through
   processing (presumably for many letters), what other errors might do
   the same?  My monthly phone bill is properly addressed.

3) [Given a name and address, anyone with reason (PIN possession) can
   get my phone number]

4) [I can call customer service and get a new PIN assigned if necessary]

5) Finally, the presence of my PIN on the letter is not necessary on
   what is obviously a letter intended to increase awareness of calling
   cards.  A note that I could contact Customer Service would have
   served just as well, without any of the security risks.

Since card number theft is a serious and reportedly increasing problem,
I am surprised to see Ameritech sending mailings that include
information that consumers are told to guard carefully.  If this mailing
does result in an increase in calling card fraud, is Ameritech intending
to absorb all fraudulent charges resulting from the careless
distribution of PINs? The letter also makes me wonder about the security
of my account with Ameritech.  How simple would it be for someone
looking for the ability to make a few free phone calls to simply look up
and write down a few number+PIN combinations?

Our contacts with the PRC government say that these rules do not exist.  While

these are the work of someone with a regional axe to grind.  Would you be

Note: this is somewhat political in nature, but I believe the RISKS are known
to all in any position of responsibility or power.

China opens the "Golden Bridge" to the Internet, and I see China still writes
laws like the following:

 &gt;Article 2. The computer information systems referred to in these regulations
 &gt;are man-machine systems, composed of computers and their allied and
 &gt;peripheral equipment and facilities (including networks), that collect,
 &gt;process, store, transmit, and retrieve information according to prescribed
 &gt;goals and rules of application.

And in all likelihood this law would cover a supermarket scanner and cash
register.  I'm not surprised.  Read any bill before Congress here in the USA
and you will find a similar lack of understanding, broadness of definition,
and lack of detail.

Perhaps a better example shows up daily in the newsgroups rec.guns and
talk.politics.guns, where laws as passed are picked at and it is generally
determined that the law outlaws anything not specifically mentioned as exempt.

The RISK?  When people write the rules we have to live by, often times the
spirit of the rule is lost in the letter, and the RISK of abuse is increased.
One has to wonder at some of the latest anti-discrimination laws that wouldn't
allow, say, a trucking company to not hire an applicant in an iron lung.  I'm
sure you can see your own pet versions of laws gone awry by creative
interpretation.  Finally, we're left with the axiom "You can't make it
foolproof because fools are so clever."  I submit that fools, lawyers, and
government share this same affliction, and if we're not careful we shall as
well, no matter our level of power over others.

Mostly, the problems with telephone numbers in the form x91-1xxx is the
possibility that the first digit was ignored because of a delayed dial-tone.

If the exchange is busy, and there are many people calling, the exchange may
not have enough "digit registers" to allocate. Then there is a delay before
the dial-tone appears. [Similar to what happened with the rock-concert ticket
giveaway and on Mother's day, etc.].  Since most callers often don't listen
for the dial-tone and dial anyway, dialing a number in the form of x91-1xxx
might get them 911.

As the number of central office codes (COCs), (the first three digits of a
7-digit number) is used within an area code increases, then these x91-1xxx
numbers need to be allocated. The central offices that handle the x91 COCs
need to have extra "digit registers' to lessen the chance for this problem.

I seek a literature reference.  The usual methods have failed so far - perhaps
someone can give me even an author, more precise subject or partial title
words?

I will persist by looking up the references in papers referring to student use
of calculators, but maybe this will ring a bell with you?

There was a study done, perhaps in the seventies, of the human tendency to
trust machines rather than our own judgement.

Subjects were given calculators, and pages of simple arithmetic problems.  The
calculators were wedged so that they gave incorrect answers sometimes.  Even
though the problems were simple enough that the subjects could figure them out
in their heads, the study showed that people will trust the machine even
though our own judgment tells us that the machine is wrong.

I want to use this as a reference in a paper I am writing on computer network
security, and another I am writing about why high-aenergy physicists should not
be so trusting of their results if they have been subjected to extensive
processing by complex, and poorly understood computer programs.

Thus, network administrators trust security software even when security
experts tell them it is easily penetrable, and physicists trust the results of
their calculations even when software experts tell them that their software is
bogus. ;-) (C'est Moi!  My own advisor does not believe me when I tell him the
results of my own work are wrong.  After all, they _were_ calculated on a
computer!)

This issue was addressed in a remarkable essay by the eccentric and
curmudgeonly fluid dynamicist Clifford Truesdell. The essay is called "The
Computer: Ruin of Science and Threat to Mankind", in _An Idiot's Fugitive
Guide to Science_, Springer_Verlag, 1984. If the title is not temptation
enough, the following is a list of subheadings in the essay, capitalization
intact:

  1. Spatial Flight would have been Impossible without Computers.
  2. Spatial flight would have been impossible without the Classic Equations
     of Motion
  3. Calculation without Classic Standards is Dangerous. A Computer is
     Incapable of Setting its own Standards.
  4. Computers have Harmed Science Already.
  5. Mathematics is the Science of Infinities. Computation is Essentially 
     Finite.
  6. Computers Bring Power and the Abuses of Power. Advocates of Computing
     Seek to Destroy Mathematics.
  7. Computing Promotes Factual Fraud. It has Harmed Experimental and Applied
     Science in the Past and is Copntinuing to do so. By its Emphasis on
     Application of the Already Known, it can Delay Basic Discovery and thus
     Reduce the Field of Applications in the Future.
  8. Classic Theories used Inductive and Deductive Models. Computing
     Encourages Floating Models.
  9. Computing Promotes Logical Fraud. Computers Programmed to Confirm False
     Theory can Destroy Mankind.
 10. Summary: Computers are Here to Stay. They Endanger Thought, Language,
     Science, and the Survival of Man. Like any other Dangerous Tool, they
     should be Put under Strict Controls.

  [OK, perhaps it's a bit overdrawn, but I think anyone who intends to use
  computers to model nature should have a look at this remarkable jeremiad. mt]

Dial-in Electric Meter Readings Sans Safeguards

My electric utility-- Madison Gas and Electric-- has embarked upon a new
meter-reading scheme that seems not to have been given a whole lot of thought.

Many of the electric meters in my neighborhood are not accessible from outside
the house, so the chances of meter-reader getting the data on a particular
visit are quite low in this era of double-income households.

In the old scheme, the meter-reader left a business-reply postcard after
ostensibly determining that the customer wasn't home to allow access to the
meter (in practice, the meter reader just leaves the card without notice,
apparently having determined that the route can be finished more quickly
without those pesky delays associated with actually determining that the
customer isn't home, but that's a flame for another forum).  The meter-reader
fills in the meter number section of the card-- a six-digit number that
uniquely identifies the meter-- the customer fills in the usage section of the
card and drops it in the mail, and MG&amp;E picks up the roughly $.30 tab for the
reply card postage.

The new scheme is similar, except that instead of leaving a mail-in card, the
meter-reader leaves a phone-in card.  Customers each got a sample card in the
mail the other day, and I decided to give it a trial run.  Here's how the
session went:

  I dialed the number printed on the card and listened while the friendly
  voice described how to punch in my six-digit meter number after the beep.

  Having failed to determine my meter number, I punched in "111111".

  The friendly voice asked me to verify that my street address was a 
  particular four-digit number (that is now lost to memory) by pressing
  a particular key.  It wasn't, of course, but I... ah... did.  This is
  just a test run, right?

  The friendly voice asked me to enter my meter reading.  I punched in "1111".

  The friendly voice thanked me for my cooperation and wished me a nice day.

Is it relevant that the rest of the day *was* relatively nice for me?

The upsides for The Company are quite apparent: the customer picks up the $.06
cost of the call, while the Company saves both the postage and keypunch costs.

The Big Risk that was apparent to me in this system was that the friendly
voice presented me with my street address and asked me to verify it, rather
than the reverse.  It's nice that they gave a bit of thought to verifying
input, but isn't this approach a bit like presenting a computer user with the
account password after the user name is typed and asking if it's correct?
While it is true that there is no computer account to be hacked on the other
side of this authentication mechanism (which is a strong malice motivator in
the case of computer accounts), it is also true that there are hearts full of
mischief in this world and big electric bills to be paid or protested if this
system is implemented as proposed.

BTW, in the same mailing was a proposal for an alternate meter-reading scheme.
The customer simply provides The Company with a copy of the key to the home,
and the meter-reader simply lets self into the home to read the meter as
necessary.  Who can spot the risks in this one?

AP and NBC reported recently on the use of REACT belts by police.  Strapped
around a prisoner's waist, the belts can deliver a 50,000-volt, 4-6 mA current
to the prisoner's back muscles, enough to incapacitate the prisoner.  They are
activated by "a remote control like a garage-door opener".  These belts are
used on prisoners in transit and in court.  The reports supplied no details
concerning the communication between the remote device and the belt.

I wonder how much thought the designers gave to the possibility of
unauthorized activation of the belt, e.g. by friends of the victim or simply
out of malice.  Judging by the footage on the NBC clip, it would be very hard
indeed to get the belt off a prisoner who was being zapped by some unknown
person.

If the remote device actively transmits start and stop commands, it might also
be possible for an associate of the prisoner's to inhibit or curtail
authorized activation; this would put the prisoner at a substantial advantage
in an attempt at escape, since prisoners wearing the belt are not hand-cuffed,
and are presumably not expected to make a run for it.

Can anyone supply technical details that would clarify the risks?

An article in the most recent issue of _Weatherwise_ magazine contained a
description of a system under development to send weather radar images to
general aviation via data compression.  One technique apparently used to
minimize bandwidth was to not provide distinctions between the highest radar
reflectivity levels, the idea being (according to the article) that you
wouldn't want to be in a light plane in any of them.  This neglects the RISK
that you already are in one of them.

A more insidious RISK was not noted in the article. Many image compression
methods result in images with misleadingly high amounts of detail.  Such
images could mislead pilots into making decisions based on false detail in the
decompressed images.  Image compression in safety-related applications clearly
demands caution.

Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed the TNG contest in the April 23-29
issue of TV Guide?

As contests go, it's nothing terribly special.  The winner(s) get flown out 
to Hollywood to watch the final episode.  The most interesting item follows,
directly out of the "Official Rules":

	...To enter the sweepstakes electronically:  Send your responses
	by April 29, 1994, to tvgtrek@delphi.com.  Include name, address
	and telephone number, along with the answer to each of the seven
	questions.  Sponsor not responsible for computer malfunctions;
	late, lost, or misdirected mail.

Earlier in the rules it states "Enter as often as you wish but limit one
entry per envelope."  The only "out" them might have is another line stating
that "No mechanical reproductions will be accepted."  But since they've 
explicitly stated that they're accepting electronic entries, I would think 
that it doesn't apply.

How many mailer daemons do you think will be spinning out there?  How soon 
will it be (if it hasn't happened already) before the mail spool on delphi
overflows?

Frederick B. Cohen, writing in the RISKS digest, muses about the case
involving the MIT student arrested for having a BBS at that made commercial
software available. Cohen implies that the student was unaware of the nature
of the material at the site, an implication that I cannot let go unchallenged.

According to news reports about details in the indictment, the student not
only was aware of what was being posted, but posted a public notice asking
that the existence of the site not be trumpeted. The indictment, according to
the reports, indicated he was more than just a "patsy."

Should MIT be "arrested," as Cohen suggested, because of the presence of this
site on their machines? No, anymore than a phone company can be arrested
because of telephone fraud. I've also seen comments on the Internet that those
who uploaded the software should be arrested, as well. That's probably true,
but it's not that easy. Again, according to news accounts, many of those who
contributed to "Cynosure," as it was called, used anonymous account services
to do so.

The RISK? Appear to be breaking the law, and you'll end up in a lot 
of trouble. It doesn't get much simpler than that.

Here is a pointer to information about the case of the MIT student who was
arrested recently. Although it is a solicitation for a legal defense fund, it
contains presentations from both sides of the case and will be of interest to
anyone who is interested in the broader political, moral and RISKy issues that
are involved. In particular, this is not a simple case of software piracy or
computer "hacking". The student is not being accused of copying copyrighted
software, but only of operating a BBS that others used for that purpose. He is
being charged under wire-fraud laws, being applied in a manner that is
unusual, to say the least.

The following can be accessed via Mosaic or other World Wide Web client
using the URL address

   <A HREF="http://martigny.ai.mit.edu/dldf/home.html">http://martigny.ai.mit.edu/dldf/home.html</A>

Here's a quote extracted from the home page so you can see what is available
there. In the actual Web version, the bulleted items at the end are hot links
to their respective files.  

  The David LaMacchia Defense Fund was organized to ensure that David
  LaMacchia gets a fair trial. LaMacchia has been indicted by the federal
  government for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. "This is the first time in
  Massachusetts that the wire fraud statute has been used in a computer
  bulletin board case," said Stephen Heyman, deputy chief in the US attorney's
  office.  That makes the case interesting, law-making, and very expensive. An
  unfortunate side-effect of our common law system, where laws are made by
  decisions in particular cases, is that an individual involved in a
  constitutional test case is faced with the certainty of staggering legal
  bills as well as the possibility of imprisonment and fines.

  Contributions to the Fund will be used to defray a portion of LaMacchia's
  legal expenses. The Fund spends nothing on advertising, salaries, promotions,
  etc.; 100% of contributions are used for legal defense.

  The Fund takes no position on the merits of either side's case.

PGN omitted the quantity of mail that indirect.com received; 100 megabytes!
They crashed of course as most systems would when presented with that kind
of a mail overload.  You also did not mention that this was the second time
that they'd tried this trick ( only about a hundred groups last time ) and
that they deliberately did not return the signed agreement that forbids
this kind of abuse.

Posting their local phone number and FAX !!!! number was kind of cute
though.  Many more calls and faxes are going to the Tenn. Bar Association
since that's where they are licensed.

By the way, you can add my (home) system to the "crashed" list.  I get about
35 meg of compressed news per day, it jumped to 45 meg compressed and I ran
out of inodes.  Loss of news is similar to a crash.  My down stream sites
aren't going to see it, so it's loss of service anyway. The minor 5000
crossposts could be absorbed (at my site), but the huge amount of complaints
in every bloody group killed me.  Reminds me of the ping-pong ball
demonstration of nuclear fission that was shown on TV when I was a kid.  One
ball gets tossed into a room full of ping-pong balls on mouse traps ... boom!

"Naissance d'un virus", Ludwig translated by Condat
 
I have previously reviewed Ludwig's original book (cf BKLUDWIG.RVW) and,
basically, everything applies to this as well.  I have only two brief comments
to make on the translation.
 
I am rather surprised that a publishing house with the stature of Addison-
Wesley took this on.  I note that the promotional material which came with the
book states that the original was banned for export from the United States. 
Even allowing for marketing hyperbole, they must have known that it would give
rise to some kind of difficulties.  As, indeed, it did:  a recent court
challenge has attempted to ban distribution of the book.  I haven't yet heard
the outcome.  (I also note that the book is supposed to help you choose
antiviral software:  didn't they even read it first?)
 
The second addresses the issue of the educational value of the book.  As
previously noted, the text sections leave a great deal to be desired in terms
of pedagogy.  The viral code, however, is intact, and unchanged.  All the
comments are still in English.
 
(I am very amused to note that the French translation of "computer virus"--
What?  No, of course not.  Don't be naive.--is CPA, standing for either "codes
sources autopropageables" or "codes parasites autopropageables".  This side of
the pond CPA means a different sort of parasite.)

The Tagespiegel reports today (20 April 1994) on the new, computerized traffic
light management system that the city installed at the large traffic circle
Ernst-Reuter-Platz. The 1.8 million mark (1.1 million $) system went on line
on Monday, and mastered the first wave of traffic well. After that, the
traffic jams swelled to beyond normal proportions.  Irate drivers complained
by telephone and mail, but officials insisted that since it was now
computer-controlled, it was okay. Apparently someone threatened legal action,
and the city traffic board dispatched people with stopwatches to test the
system. Sure enough, it was stuck in the early morning pattern, which was fine
for handling inbound traffic, but disastrous in the afternoon rush hour. They
have to go back to hand-switching the timing until they figure out what went
wrong.

I just caught this on TV news last night:

  A person won two consecutive keno games in the Montreal Casino. Since
  this is considered extremely unlikely, the police have been called in
  to investigate. The two games should have paid $400K, but the winner
  has not yet been paid. He is instead doing the talk show circuit with
  how he analysed the numbers. 

  Supposedly, in the history of Nevada,   the Keno jackpot has only been
  won once, which made his winning back to back somewhat unlikely. This
  happened on the electronic keno and has been shut down. The mechanic
  game is carrying on.

  A one line comment by the reporter claimed that "a bug" in the computer
  repeated the sequence of number exactly every 4,000 games. This may be
  a case of someone picking a poor random number generator; but may well
  be the basis for police action. I understood that electronic slot
  machines are free running, merrily generating random numbers all day
  long, and pulling the lever merely selects the current number. This
  seems quite robust.

RISKS readers will find this all too familiar...

&gt;From the April 19th, 1994 edition of NHK's "Today's Japan", broadcast on
 KCTS (Seattle's PBS affiliate) 0100h PDT April 20th (as remembered):

  Japan's weather bureau installed a new computer system for automatically
  generating tsunami warnings after earthquakes.  The story implied that the
  machine was connected to various sensors around Japan and was configured to
  generate and communicate these warnings automatically.  
  
  During installation testing simulated data was input to verify the 
  operation of the system.  Unfortunately the machine had already been 
  connected to the system that communicates tsunami warnings to the 
  government and media and no one disconnected this communications link 
  when the tests were run.

  The predictable happened.  The machine "detected" a potential tsunami, sent 
  out the appropriate warning and at least two broadcast stations interrupted
  their normal programming to announce the impending tsunami.  Obviously this
  caused some concern among the populace.

  The problem was detected five minutes after the warning was first 
  communicated but this was still sufficient time for the the warning to
  be broadcast.

[Source: The New York Times, 22 Apr 1994, p. B2]

The NYC subway has been introducing swipe cards which can be bought in
five-ride increments.  According to today's _Times_, citing an article in
Thursday's _Newsday_, many riders are swiping improperly, causing a fare to be
deducted from their card but not opening the turnstile.  There's a display
which instructs the rider to swipe again, but these are New Yorkers and have
already decided to try another turnstile.

Apparently, the designers anticipated this problem and put in a solution -- if
you swipe again at the same stile it doesn't deduct a second fare -- but
didn't anticipate that harried/hurried Nyawkas wouldn't stop to read the
display.

Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) is about to release a home entertainment
product called the Digital Satellite Service (DSS) under the RCA brand.  In
short, this product is a small satellite dish (18" in diameter) that will
allow customers to order video/audio programs from service providers.  At this
time the service providers are DirecTV (Hughes) and Hubbard (USSB).  The
system works as follows.

Upon purchase of a DSS system, the customer will receive a "smart-card" and
then subscribe to one or more service providers.  The customer can then view
programs and order pay-per-view programs.  The smart-card controls and tracks
all purchases made with the DSS system.  Information stored includes programs
purchased, whether or not the programs were viewed, and the time the programs
were viewed.  This information is then transmitted (via telephone) to the
service provider for billing purposes.  The RISK?  The service providers have
the ability to build large databases of information on household viewing
habits (e.g., John Smith views adult movies every Wednesday night between
10:00pm and 11:00pm).  This information could then be sold to direct marketing
firms, etc.  There are laws that prevent cable companies from selling or
releasing an individual's subscription information, but, to the best of my
knowledge, the service providers for DSS are under no such obligation.

I had a similar situation last year when leaving a super expensive garage in
downtown Chicago.  The rates were 22.00 for 7-9 hours, and 40.00 for 9-24
hours.  I had been there 8 hours and 50 minutes (I obviously was watching the
clock closely with these stakes).  When the attendant ran my timecard through
the computer, it came up with $40.00 as the rate.

The next 10 minutes I caused a significant backup as I refused to pay $40 when
the sign clearly stated the rate as 22. I got him to agree that the sign was
right, and that I was there for less than 9 hours, but he still insisted that
I owed him 40 ('cause the computer said so).  I asked him to call a manager,
he responded "I am the manager!!!!!".  I spent the next several minutes
describing to him the concept of rounding, and that the software obviously
stunk and was written by thieves (or idiots or both). With these rates, the
"thief" part was a given!

After a while he got the message that I was not going to pay more than 22, and
decided to let his office figure it out later.  After I paid him the $22, I
asked for a receipt.  "I am sorry sir, but that is printed by the
computer!!!". Another 2 minutes were spent figuring out how to write a manual
receipt (which he had, but had never used!!).

&gt;This issue was addressed in a remarkable essay by the eccentric and
&gt;curmudgeonly fluid dynamicist Clifford Truesdell. The essay is called "The
&gt;Computer: Ruin of Science and Threat to Mankind"

Something I have been noticing for some time is the loss of capabilities 
along certain lines of thought due to the dominance of others.

Actually the first evidence to me was when the hordes of Radio Shacks came
out and all of the small shops disappeared. Suddenly it was difficult to find
the "low volume" pieces amid the cheap plastic sound reproduction devices.

Later I became involved in a study of magnetic amplifiers and discovered that
research in this country had essentially died out around 1957. I suspect that
the rise of the transistor and integrated circuit which made no provision for
the "L" in a "RLC" circuit. Young electronic engineers look at me strangely
when I ask if they have heard of "Eli the ice man."

Think I'll hold onto my collection of steam engineering books 8*).

&gt;  5. Mathematics is the Science of Infinities. Computation is Essentially 
&gt;     Finite.

I suspect this is the real threat. In all of the cases mentioned above,
dominance of the field has resulted in a reduction of the field as promising
technologies are shunted aside for reasons other than technological. In the
mid 1800s Samuel Colt might not have achieved prominence if it were not for
the Czar's purchase of the entire output of Smith &amp; Wesson for several years.

What if Motorola had not been inundated by orders for CPUs by General Motors
in 1980 and the IBM-PC had been 68000 based with a 32 bit flat memory model ? 
What if CPM/86 had been available (PC-DOS was actually choice four of three)? 
Should we "Think of it as Evolution in action" or "blind chance" ?

  In a previous incarnation, I designed the graphical output of a weather
radar system.  As you can imagine, it was filled with concessions for the
viewer's pleasure (mostly researchers, but some airports too).

  At best, the output was lossy.  Take a float, run it through an algorithm,
convert it to a signed byte (+/- 127), and scrunch that down until you had
about 16 possible different colors, many of which were set to the same value
(usually about 8 different colors total).  Why?  Storms were easy to spot,
useful data crunching really couldn't be done with the eye because it was a
slice through a cloud formation (particular in real-time PPI displays), etc.
The expectations of researchers hadn't caught up with the physical &amp; economic
reality involved with the displays.

  The end result was easy to use picture that could tell you where the wind
was moving, usually involving about 8 different colors, often with lots of
empty space (clear days were very boring).  This data would compress quite
well without data loss.  I wouldn't have expected anyone to match high
(towards) and low (away) velocity colors since they could mean a great deal to
a pilot, especially in a small plane, but you certainly wouldn't like being in
either situation.

  The algorithms and noise present in the uncompressed data should warn anyone
away from using the data too literally.  You'd be surprised at the number of
sites that planted a radar-blinding pole right by the dish, resulting in a
large pie-shaped wedge taken out of every piece of data they ever generated.

The following two articles appeared immediately following one another in
RISKS 15.75:
&gt;From: pcw@access.digex.net (Peter Wayner)
&gt;Subject: God Grants Granite Gift to RISKS Punsters 
&gt;Subject: The Soft Pork Underbelly of Efficient Markets

The first article was about the inability of mathematical models to deal
with the hairy edges of reality in the financial markets.  The second article
was about a way to use the futures markets to launder money in a way that
was (the author claimed) essentially untraceable.

The irony of this juxtaposition is striking (so striking, in fact, that I
am wondering if this is a coincidence or a masterful display of editorial
subtlety) because the money-laundering scheme proposed by Peter Wayner
won't work, despite the seemingly rock-solid mathematics that underlies it.

Wayner proposes to use the zero-sum property of the futures market to transfer
money from A to B through the use of balanced trades.  A and B respectively
buy and sell an identical futures contract and then wait until market
volatility has caused A to lose (and B to gain) the amount of money to be
transferred, at which point A and B simultaneously get out of the market.

Some subtle clues leading to a reductio ad absurdum proof that this scheme is
flawed can be found in the original text.  For example, Wayner suggests that A
and B use different brokers so that the coincidental trades will not be on the
same set of books.  So the scenario he proposes goes something like this: A
and B agree to a symmetric trade to be liquidated when the market reaches some
predetermined price point, at which point money will have effectively
transferred from A to B.  After the initial agreement, there is no further
communication between A and B.  In fact, neither has any way of knowing
whether or not the other party has in fact executed their side of the bargain,
and it doesn't really matter.  B's financial position depends only on the
state of the market, which is not affected by whether or not A is playing
(assuming the amounts of money involved are not extremely large).

In fact, B doesn't have to talk to A at all.  There doesn't even have to be an
A.  B can just *pretend* that there is an A out there somewhere who has agreed
to transfer money to B using Wayner's scheme, play the market, and make money.
Or can he?  The critical flaw in this scheme is in the following paragraph
where Wayner describes (fleetingly) what happens when the market doesn't do
what A and B expected it to:

&gt;Person B sells the contract so that if the market goes down, i.e., the wrong
&gt;way, then A and B together have lost no money. It's a zero sum. Now they just
&gt;have to play the game a bit longer or for stakes that are twice as high. You
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;can think of the process as flipping a coin until you have encounter a heads.

This little detail reveals this to be just another incarnation of a well known
gambling system where bets are successively doubled on an even bet until you
win.  The problem with the scheme is that even a short run of losses requires
a TREMENDOUS amount of capital to finance the exponentially increasing stakes
required to stay in the game.  In fact, you *can* make money using this scheme
for a little while.  The problem is that when you make money you don't make
very much.  When you eventually (and inevitably) encounter a long run of
losses or unexpected market moves, you lose really big.

Laundering money through electronic markets works only if you can reliably
predict the direction of the market.  If you can do that, you don't have to
launder money.  On this particular RISK I think we can all rest easy.

Double or Doublecross? Your choice.

First, forget about thinking like a mathematician, a gambler or an upstanding
citizen of Wall Street. You are some guy A who wants to move money to some guy
B and you want to do it in as untraceable a way as possible. You're willing to
pay extra for something that looks respectable and guys on Wall Street look
real respectable in their braces and bespoke suits.

The old standbys, gold and gems, are fine, but they are hard to move safely.
Plus you need an "explanation" for how you got them.  Strange business
contracts are okay, but they demand some sort of front operation which takes
time and money to run effectively.

So you turn to the futures market for the first try. Lets say you want to move
n dollars. Luckily, both A and B have enough cash and borrowed funds on hand
to sustain a loss of up to (2^i)n dollars. Let i=4 for the rest of this
example, i.e. 16n dollars of loss reserves.

In 15 out 16 times, the progressive doubling system will work.  The
transaction will be close to untraceable. The only way that anyone would be
able to prove that the transaction occurred would be if they could assemble
both trading records and then match the trades. This can be shielded very
effectively by trading in different countries with different exchanges and
relying on arbitrageurs to keep the markets in line, but it tends to cost much
more in transaction noise.

In 1 out of the 16 tries, things will go wrong. You might say they would go
terribly wrong if you're a nervous criminal B who is afraid that A is going to
doublecross him. Now A needs to get 16 n dollars fast.  This is the big reason
why A doesn't want to play the game alone or try and trick B into playing
without A. If A mirrored the trades, the 16n dollars aren't in the pockets of
a casino or the state lottery. They're just in A's pockets not B's.  In
reality, A and B are back where they were before futures markets were
invented.  They just need to move 16 times more money.

Your reaction to this depends upon the marginal cost of going back to the old
fashioned money laundering tricks.  I think at this point you just take a
bigger truck to haul the gold.  You do some trades with Van Goghs and
Rembrandts instead of Cassats or Sisleys.  In general, many of the transaction
costs for security and other stuff are pretty fixed. Just remember that
auction houses like Southeby's try to take 10% commissions, but they can be
negotiated to be much lower for expensive works. Exciting record breaking
prices attract attention and news.

The futures game is not perfect by any means. There _are_ transaction costs
and problems in logistics. It works best if A+B can lock in exactly the same
price on their trades. But when it is done, you can look at the world and say,
"Gosh, I was completely at RISK!  Thank God my Martingale scheme worked after
all!" All the really smart mathematicians and sober IRS guys who never gamble
because they know the odds will just accept it and think you're crazy to be
doing this with your money. It comes with a built in insanity plea.

So, if your going to do this, choose i to suit your cash/RISKS profile.  If
you have more cash available, then you have a better chance of success.  But
hey, that's life.

The message from Michael Enlow announcing an "information resource" is
junk mail which apparently has been broadcast widely on the Internet.
My wife and I both received copies of this message. Neither of us has
expressed any public interest in the topics Enlow mentions. Melynda
attempted to reply to the email, asking why it had been sent to her
unsolicited; in reply she received a listing of information from a
mailer daemon. I wrote the "From:" address in the header asking the
same question and have received no reply. I suspect that it was sent to
RISKS by accident, simply by picking up the submission address in some
dragnet for email addresses.

Enlow claims to be retired, but the listing sent by the "info" daemon lists
two apparently active businesses. The info listing does not contain any
advertising or solicitation. I have not retrieved any of the files listed, so
I cannot comment on their value or on whether they contain advertising, except
for one file which is clearly labeled as a catalog. The other files, from
their titles, would appear to promote private investigation in general but not
a specific business.

Enlow's information resource may valuable, but I object to his use of junk
email to publicize that resource. That fact that he did not reply to my
individual request makes me suspect his motives.

  [The 19 Apr 1994 New York Times Business Day section has a lengthy story
  entitled An Ad (Gasp!) in Cyberspace, by Peter H. Lewis, about the Green 
  Card ad as its lead story.  Here are some relevant details, via PGNed
  abstracting... For earlier details, see <A HREF="/Risks/15.76.html">RISKS-15.76</A> and 77.  PGN]

Laurence A. Canter was quoted as saying, "We will definitely advertise on the
Internet again.  It appears to be a very profitable venture and a very viable
vehicle for advertising a variety of things. I'm sure other businesses will be
advertising on the network in the very near future."

Jeff Wheelhouse, system administrator for Internet Direct, Inc., was quoted as
saying.  "They will not be back on our system," He also said he would not be
deterred by Mr. Canter's threat to sue Internet Direct for $250,000 unless he
is reconnected.  "They crashed our computer about 15 times -- that's when we
stopped counting -- because of the volume of incoming complaints," Mr.
Wheelhouse said. "I lost an entire week dealing with this." 

Wheelhouse said Internet Direct would remain firm, despite Canter's threat to
sue Internet Direct for $250,000 and restoration of their electronic mail
privileges.  That amount was what prompted Canter to say, "Conservatively,
that's the amount of business we feel we will get out of this from the ad."

"The Internet is changing," Mr. Canter said. "People don't like the invasion
of what has been their private world.  But as long as it's set up the way it
is, where anyone has access to it, it's a public forum, and they have to
accept anything that comes into it.  "In fact," Mr. Canter added, "I've
received a lot of calls from people who want to know how to do it."  So
pleased is he with the response, in fact, that he said he planned to write a
book on how to advertise on the Internet.

   [However, this suggests a grand strategy.  Run an offensive ad, get chopped
   off, and then sue for the profits you did not make.  PGN]

The most fun response to the Green Card Flap that I saw was in
rec.games.bridge, where someone said "I don't understand why this was posted
here; in this newsgroup we're only concerned with red and black cards"!

(There were followups, but you'd have to be into duplicate bridge to

According to the April 25/94 Globe and Mail:
Canadian Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy is embarrassed by the leaking
of a sensitive working paper to the press.  It concerns government plans and
"specifically indicated that Quebec wasn't going to get full control over job
training any time soon."  Unfortunately, an operator did not press the 0-2-1
fax code that would have sent it to English speaking provincial government
offices.  By hitting 1-2-1 instead, the working paper went to eight French
language newspapers in Quebec, two of which eventually published stories on
it.

Some are questioning whether it was indeed an error or the work of a saboteur.
Reporters "marvel that a document of particular sensitivity to Quebec
accidentally went to Quebec newspapers only."

Several years ago a similar faux pas occurred in the Canadian parliamentary
press gallery when a young woman sent a detailed account of her romantic
exploits of the past weekend by email to a female friend.  She accidentally
filed it with every newspaper's parliamentary reporter, but they were
gentlemen and did not publish it.

   Inmates-Computers, By MARIA S. FISHER, Associated Press Writer 

   KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP, 18 Apr 1994) -- The letter startled Nick Tomasic. It
   was from a prison inmate; other fellow prisoners, assigned to computerize
   records, had taken a Social Security number from an accident report and
   tried to sell it.  Tomasic is the district attorney for Wyandotte County.
   It was his number.

The author makes the following key points:

o    29 states and the federal government use prisoners for data entry.

o    The National Correctional Industries Association in Belle
Mead, NJ scoffed at the potential risk of misuse, saying that in 12
years, there have been no cases of abuse.

o    Tomasic warned that criminals could determine addresses and phone
numbers of witnesses and victims during data entry.

o    In Johnson City, KS, Sheriff Kent P.  Willnauer is looking into
allegations that a prisoner passed Social Security numbers and other
data to a confederate who opened fraudulent bank accounts.

o    Kansas State government officials insist that the data entry program
saves taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and that there is no
danger to privacy or safety of residents.

Message Posted On Internet Spurs Probe; Jokes, Threats Directed At African
Americans 

   By John Burgess, Washington Post Staff Writer, 25 Apr 1994
    
   The sordid side of the emerging electronic culture got a very public
   airing at the University of Michigan this month. Officials there are
   investigating an incident involving a stolen computer password and a death
   threat against African Americans that was sent over the global Internet
   computer network.

The author continues with the following key points:

o    the perpetrator is still unknown.

o    On April 5, someone using a University of Michigan email address sent
the offensive message to 30 newsgroups on the Net.

o    "Purporting to come from a group called the Organization for the
Execution of Minorities, the posting was a lengthy collection of jokes and
riddles directed against black Americans. It also contained rambling
threats of death and injury."

o    The host system was immediately flooded with angry protests from
around the Net.

o    The supposed originator protested his innocence and repudiated the
message and its content.

o    Campus computer security specialists think the student may have been a
victim of a classic Trojan Horse which collected logins and passwords by
spoofing the login screen and writing the ID/password pairs to a file for
retrieval.

o    International users also received the posting and criticized Americans
for racism.

</i><PRE>

We just finished a pretty strange case.

A woman came in a reported that her estranged husband was stalking her.  The
officer that took the call started an investigation for the alleged stalking
and contacted our County Attorney, (DA to most folks).

While investigating the matter the suspects lawyer turned over email from 
the wife to the husband soliciting contact.  It started to look like a 
normal domestic situation where the complaint matches the mood.

Sgt Banks brought me the email so I could verify it and move on to other 
things.  As I started looking into it things got strange.  One of our campus 
systems is an Alpha running VMS and we have a special NEWUSER procedure 
which allows staff to create their own accounts, providing they know all of 
the important information about themselves.

As I investigated the accounts I found that the suspect and victims account
were created within a few minutes of each other.  I placed a trap on the
logins to both accounts and soon learned that every access to her account was
immediately preceded or followed by an access to his account and from the same
computer.

Over the next several months I tracked the access to both accounts and 
watched as the suspect turned over more and more email from his wife.  This 
guy was pretty creative in that he wrote long letters to himself and even 
changed his writing style to mimic hers.

We had a pretty solid interference case for the false evidence he was 
creating but it was only a misdemeanor.  We really wanted to put together a 
felony due to some other crimes the suspect had committed, which were 
pending prosecution.

Finally, the wife decided to take a computer course on campus.  The first day
of class the students were told to create accounts on the campus computer
system.  Our victim went to the computer lab and followed all of the
appropriate steps only to find she couldn't create an account because her
authorization had been used already.  Confused she went to her assigned User
Consultant and complained that she was denied access.

The consultant, not knowing about my investigation, disusered the fraudulent 
account and helped the victim get a new one.

The gig was up since I was certain the suspect would realize we were watching
him now.  Fortunately, denial of computer service is a felony in Wyoming. We
then pursued the arrest warrant.  Several days later our suspect was arrested
at his office on campus.  When arrested he asked if he could call his
attorney.  When we said yes, he led us down the hall to a locked computer lab.
He entered the code on the door and walked to the phone which sat two feet
from the very computer that had been used to generate many of the fraudulant
messages.

By now our case was pretty solid.  The suspect was charged with Computer 
Crimes: Crimes Against Computer Users which carried a three year felony 
term, ten years if intent to commit fraud is proven.

Kinda heavy but pretty funny when you face the guy and he lies through his 
teeth.  He thought he was dealing with a couple of Barney Fife's and he 
treated us like we were stupid.  Obviously we didn't know what we were 
talking about and he had received all of the mail from his wife.  We booked 
him and went back to work.

As it turned out, the joke was on us.  On the day of the preliminary hearing 
the suspects lawyer arrived with a sworn affidavit from the wife.  She 
decided that she had not been stalked and that her husband had not denied 
her of any computer service.  It appears a reconciliation is in the works.

Naturally we decided not to pursue prosecution with a hostile victim and our
case was dropped.  Really a shame considering the hours we had invested.  The
suspect has some federal time hanging over him on some other crimes but I
really would have liked to see him lie on the stand about his computer feats.

Oh well.  I never thought I'd have a computer-domestic disturbance.

INDUSTRIAL SPY'S LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO BE CLOSED

Britain's industrial spies enjoy a legal loophole.  If they access a computer
to which they are not authorised, they can be found guilty under the Computer
Misuse Act, 1990.  If they manage to deceive an authorised user into giving
them information from that computer, they almost certainly commit no offence.
The UK government signaled on March 24th 1994 that it would introduce remedial
legislation.  However the precise form is still unclear and there appears to
be no date for implementation.

English Law knows no concept of information theft - you can steal pieces of
paper and data media containing information but there is no specific law
protecting commercial secrets.  The law is more concerned with catching the
means of industrial espionage: bugging and tapping are criminal offences,
respectively under the Wireless Telegraphy and Interception of Communications
Acts. The Computer Misuse Act punishes unauthorised access without, in section
1, caring what the reason was.

Recent coverage by the BBC-TV's leading current affairs show Panorama and by
the London Sunday Times has revealed that 200 UK pounds is the average rate
charged by private detectives to assemble a dossier of an individual's bank
balances, medical records and tax status.  Nearly all of the information comes
via abuse of this loop-hole. The technique is variously called the pretext
call, the voice-hack, the imposter and the masquerade.  The private detective
assumes whatever "official" identity is necessary to mislead the bank clerk or
government employee.  Recently one "detective agency" has been circulating
leading figures in the UK with offers to obtain critical data on any
individuals in whom they were interested.

If any offence is being committed, it is probably by the computer owners, who,
under the Data Protection Act, have an obligation to take appropriate steps to
secure data under their control.  (Eighth Principle, Data Protection Act,
1984).  Data Protection obligations apply within the European Union.

A case in a magistrate's court (lowest level) last December suggested that
there might be a way of extending the Computer Misuse Act to cover such third
parties.  Malcolm Farquharson induced a female employee of a cellular phone
company to obtain details of cellular phone numbers and their ESNs (Electronic
Serial Numbers) so that he could fraudulently clone phones.  The numbers were
held on a computer to which the female employee had authorised access.
Farquharson, but not the employee, was found guilty and sentenced to six
months in prison although he had never touched the computer.

However legal experts believe that this case would not survive appeal to a
higher court.

The UK Home Office say that the loophole will probably be closed by means of
an amendment to the Data Protection Act but have so far produced no wordings
nor a timetable.  On April 10th, Home Secretary Michael Howard said that the
Government was considering a new offence of gaining information by deception.

Even when the loophole is closed the abuse is likely to continue - enforcing a
law where a telephone-based perpetrator is already doing a good job pretending
to be someone else is never going to be easy.

I have owned four combination locks in my life.  All of them were made by
'Dudley', a Canadian company.  Admittedly, these are not top of the line
locks.  They were, however, the brand of lock officially "endorsed" by my
school in grade 7 when I first got a locker.  That was in 1979.  I owned that
lock until 1991 when it was broken into at the local gym.  I immediately went
out and bought the first 'Dudley' lock I picked out of a basketful in front
of the local bookstore checkout counter.  By mere coincidence, this lock had
the same combination as my old one.  I treated this as fortunate happenstance.

Later, I lost the new lock and was forced once again to replace it.  Again, I
selected the first lock in the basket.  This time it had a different
combination which I promptly forgot when the lock lay idle for six months.  So
this time, I purposely searched through the basket for a lock with MY
combination on it.  I found one in less than thirty seconds.

The locks are of the tumbler variety with markings from 0 to 59.  I've tried
my lock and I can be off by one marking when dialing the combination.  Still,
considering that I have successfully obtained 3 of 4 locks with the same
combination, I'm tempted to go home tonight and try to "find" the combination
I lost.  Perhaps I'll even time myself.

In their Internet advertising, Canter and Siegal are ignoring some fundamental
characteristics of the net as currently constituted.  I think they'll find
their attempt at Internet advertising will fairly quickly become ineffective -
though many people may be annoyed along the way.

The relevant characteristics of the Internet are (a) the anonymity; (b) the
low cost of generating any particular kind of message.  What, after all,
prevents anyone from taking a C&amp;S ad, modifying it slightly - changing the
addresses and phone numbers, for example - and posting it back as widely as
the original?  If only a few people do this, it will be impossible to tell
which are the real ads and which are fakes - short of calling a phone number
and finding that it terminates, say, at the Bar Association rather than C&amp;S.

Of course, ads that mention price will raise even more severe problems.  If
the spoof suggests a completely unreasonable price, the business can probably
disclaim it.  But what happens when the spoof suggests a reasonable-looking
price that happens to leave the advertiser with no profit?  He is left the
the choice of accepting the price, and losing money, or disclaiming the ads,
damaging his own reputation.

Traditional printed ads can, of course, also be spoofed.  However, attempts
to do so are rare.  First, it's very expensive to do; second, the traditional
at least attempt to verify the identity of advertisers.  Neither of these
constraints apply on the net.

It's true that a careful reading of the header lines will often reveal which
are the true ads, and which are the fakes.  But why should the people who the
ad is trying to reach bother to check header lines?  The whole point of an ad
is to communicate information quickly.  The same reasoning shows that digital
signatures wouldn't help.  Who would bother to check them?  Only those who
have an established relationship with the sender of the ad would likely even
have a quick ability to verify the signature - and that's not the population
a broadly distributed ad is trying to reach.

When the spoofers are traceable - and it's well known that it's often
impossible to trace a message, much less *prove* that a particular individual
sent it - the legal situation might get rather interesting.  Even ignoring the
very broad protection the courts have recently granted to parody, why is the
spoofer's message any less legitimate than the original?  If the spoof ads
look entirely different, refer to "Carver and Siegalman", and have different
addresses and phone numbers, just what right to "Canter and Siegal" have to
complain?  They are not being directly referred to or identified.  If they
have a problem establishing a unique identity in the noise of the marketplace
- and no one ever said that all marketplace participants have to be genuine -
that's not the law's concern.

I've been closely following the accounts of this case in the Boston
Globe and The Tech (a student-published newspaper at MIT).  Until your
report, I had not heard any assertions that the student had actually
been arrested.

According to an article in The Tech on Friday April 8th, 1994:

    "A federal grand jury charged an MIT student yesterday on a felony
    charge for allegedly allowing the piracy of over $1 million in
    business and entertainment software using Athena workstations."

According to an article in The Tech on Tuesday April 12th, 1994:

    "David M.  LaMacchia '95, who was indicted last Thursday for
    conspiracy to commit wire fraud, will be arraigned this Friday at
    the U.S.  District Courthouse in Boston, according to LaMacchia's
    lawyer Harvey Silverglate."

Other than Cohen's article, and a couple of followup articles in RISKS DIGEST,
I've seen no report that he had been actually arrested.  I cannot imagine why
he would need to be arrested.  (I would expect that if he already has a
lawyer, and the lawyer knows of the scheduled arraignment three or more days
beforehand, he would most likely show up in court.  Maybe I missed something.
What was your source?)

In his post, Fredrick Cohen states "An MIT student was arrested today
for having a BBS at the school that was used by the participants to
store and fetch commercial software." and goes on to paint the student
as practically an innocent bystander caught up in other peoples crimes
by happenstance.  If one is to believe any of the reportage on the
real incident, the student was anything but innocent.

All the reportage in the Boston Globe, not known for its great sympathy with
law enforcement, made it quite clear that the student actively advertised his
BBS as a place to upload and download pirated software.  He went out of his
way to personally solicit software on at least some occasions (according to
the reports).

In this, he would be guilty of various crimes regardless of the means he used
to carry the crimes out.  While I feel a little sorry for him, in that he
probably felt he was carrying on some idealistic fight, I don't feel
particularly sorry for him, and he deserves to be prosecuted.

Let's save our righteous indignation for the truly innocent,
wrongly accused and persecuted by people in power.

Okay, so how exactly is it possible in this system for the turnstile to
(a) deduct the fare from the card, and (b) identify whose card it was,
so that it won't deduct it again if the same card is re-swiped -- and yet
not figure out that it now has to unlock itself?

By the way, what happens if the turnstile does unlock, and the rider hands the
card back across the barrier to someone else?  Will the second rider get
admitted without a second fare being deducted, because the same card was used?

I can't let this pass without comment.  Clearly this system was designed
by someone obsessed with the RISKs of free rides.  The only way I can imagine
this kind of failure mode occurring is if they are doing something along
the lines of &lt;read&gt;&lt;alter&gt;&lt;verify&gt;&lt;open&gt; with the improper swipe somehow
interrupting the process in the middle.  Now, granted, they probably teach
in transaction school that you must always make these things fail in your
favor, but it seems a bit overkill for a subway.  In any case, with
the chance to swipe again, I suspect a true cheat would find a way to
substitute a different card (if even that is really necessary)...

DMV careens into $44 million dead-end
By Gary Webb, Knight-Ridder News Service
(From the San Diego Union, April 27, 1994, page A-3)

SACRAMENTO - The California Department of Motor Vehicles has informed a
flabbergasted legislative committee that it has spent $44.3 million on a
computer modernization program that will never work.
    "This is unconscionable to me!" Assemblywoman Valerie Brown, D_Santa Rosa
spluttered. "I can't even explain this to people!"
    DMV Director Frank Zolin muttered: "I'm having a difficult time explaining
it myself." [...]
    "The department's position is that the software maker isn't responsible,
the hardware maker isn't responsible, and the taxpayers are just going to eat
the cost", Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz, D-Panorama Ciry,
said after the Monday hearing.  [...]
    The DMV started the project in 1988 and has been quietly spending millions
of dollars a year on it with little oversight - and even less success.  ...
Dan Foulk, a Sacramento computer consultant who has been working with the DMV
on the ill-fated venture, called it "a combination of errors from the
beginning".  Faulk said that the plan - to invisibly convert a circa-1965
database to a modern relational database using Tandem Cyclone mainframes - was
"too giant a leap of technology" and involved insurmountable incompatibilities
beween hardware platforms and program code.  [...]
    The $7.5 million the DMV was requesting in next year's budget was to be
used to start redesigning the database from scratch, records show. But Zolin
said that it is "not exactly" a back-to-square-one proposition.
    "We've learned a lot from mistakes we made", he said.

                          ==============
 
  (Excerpt from the San Jose Mercury News, April 27, 1994 online version:)
  Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting and consulting firm hired to oversee the
  five-year project, was fired by the state in June 1990 after just eight
  months on the job.  DMV then took on the task of project management itself
  -- a herculean undertaking that legislative analysts now say was well beyond
  the department's ability.  ...

We've all seen this before, this is just larger and more public than many.

  "Casino finally pays big keno winners: Montreal computer analyst hopes
  $620,000 jackpot will give others hope.  By Andre Picard, Quebec Bureau.
  The _Globe and Mail_ (Canada), 28 Apr 1994, p. A6 [MK comments in brackets]

     Montreal -- Daniel Corriveau said he hopes that his 'victory over the
system will give hope to others.'
     The computer analyst and his family received more than $620,000 [1C$ =
U$0.75], including interest, from the Montreal casino yesterday, weeks
after they overcame odds of one in six billion and beat an electronic keno
game three times in a row."

The author explains the following key points:

o Corriveau used an "antique 286" computer to analyse 7,000 combinations from
  the keno game, [which uses an electronic pseudo-random number generator].

o Corriveau noticed that the electronic game was repeating numbers in a
  predictable pattern.

o Corriveau and several family members bet on what they predicted would be due
  to come up; they won three times in succession.

o The Casino managers shut the game down and called the police.

o The Surete du Quebec [provincial police] fraud squad investigated; Corriveau
  and his family even took polygraph tests.

o The president of Loto-Quebec, the Crown Corporation which owns the Montreal
  Casino, admitted that the problem was theirs: they had failed to test the
  electronic game before using it.

o The keno game is missing its clock, [used to reset the pseudo-random
  number generator]; therefore it started all over again every time it was
  powered off.

o Police are continuing their investigation to find out if the clock was
  missing when the game was delivered or whether it has been stolen.

[Sigh... quality assurance rears its missing head once again.  And bravo for
the successful time-series analyst.  Wonder if he'd like to have a go at the
Clipper Chip?]

I am a member of a mailing list covering motorcycling and related topics. 

Recently much discussion revolved around the issue of drinking (alcohol) 
and driving, and what, if any, the limit of alcohol allowed in the blood 
should be. Discussion seemed to revolve around the point that the effect 
that alcohol has varies with a number of individual factors. 

One comment however I think is of interest to this forum. 

The comment was made that alcohol in whatever quantity, affects your ability 
to judge whether you are fit to perform an act such as driving. The example 
used to illustrate this was that electricians never touch any of their work 
that might involve high-voltage electricity after they have been drinking, 
because of the possible consequences. 

Extending this argument to computing. How many people would be happy flying 
in a plane, or placing their trust in a software controlled system if they 
knew that it had been written, reviewed or tested after a Friday lunchtime in 
a pub. To the electrician the possible are obvious and immediate. To 
programmers etc. the consequences may be neither obvious nor immediate. 

Should there be an offence of "drunk in charge of a computer"? Probably not. 
But I think that this sort of issue be addressed, and any legal implications 
considered, possibly in professional codes of conduct?

The following, which claims to be an internal Silicon Graphics memo, has
already seen fairly broad network distribution.  I have no way of verifying
that it is what it claims to be, but (a) I'm told by someone with close
dealings with SGI that it fits with what he's heard; (b) if it's a fake,
someone put a huge amount of effort into producing it.

I forward it to RISKS as a wonderful record of what goes wrong with large
software projects, and why.  It would be as useful if all the names, including
the company and product names, were removed.  This memo should not be seen as
an indictment of SGI, which is hardly unique.  There is good evidence that
Sun, for example, had very similar problems in producing Solaris; and I
watched the same thing happen with the late, unlamented DEC Professional
series of PC's, and something like it almost happen with firmware for DEC
terminals a number of years back.

I hope that Tom Davis's position hasn't been badly hurt by the broad
distribution of his memo - but based on the traditional reaction to bearers of
bad news, especially when the bad news becomes widely known, I can't say I'm
sanguine about it.

 			 Software Usability II
 			    October 5, 1993
 			       Tom Davis

 Last May, I published my first report on software usability, which
 Rocky Rhodes and I presented to at Tom Jermoluk's staff meeting (with
 Ed, but without Tom).  Subsequently, I made it available to quite a few
 other people.

 This sequel is to satisfy all those people who have urged me to bring
 it up to date.  I begin with a summary; details follow.

 Please read at least the summary.

     SUMMARY

 Release 5.1 is a disappointment.  Performance for common operations has
 dropped 40% from 4.0.5, we shipped with 500 priority 1 and 2 bugs, and
 a base Indy is much more sluggish than a Macintosh.  Disk space
 requirements have increased dramatically.

 The primary cause is that we attempted far too much in too little
 time.  Management would not cut features early, so we were forced to
 make massive cuts in the final weeks of the release.

 What shall we do now?  Let's not look for scapegoats, but learn from
 our mistakes and do better next time.

 A December release of 5.1.2 is too early to fix much -- we'll spend
 much more time on the release process than fixing things.  Allow enough
 time for a solid release so we don't get: 5.1.2.1, 5.1.2.2, 5.1.2.3, ...

 Let's decide ahead of time exactly what features are in 5.1.2.  If we
 pick a reasonable set we'll avoid emergency feature cuts at the end.

 Nobody knows what's wrong -- opinions are as common as senior
 engineers.  The software environment is so convoluted that at times it
 seems to rival the US economy for complexity and unpredictability.  I
 propose massive code walk-throughs and design reviews to analyze the
 software.  We'll be forced to look closely at the code, and fresh
 reviewers can provide fresh insights.

 For the long term, let's change the way we do things so that the
 contents and scheduling of releases are better planned and executed.
 Make sure marketing and engineering expectations are in agreement.

     INTRODUCTION

 We've addressed some of the problems presented in the original May
 report, but not enough.  Most of the report's warnings and predictions
 have come true in 5.1.  If we keep doing the exact same thing, we'll
 keep getting the exact same results.

 I'm preparing this report in ASCII to make it widely available.  It's
 easy to distribute via news and mail, and everyone can read it.

 An ASCII version of the May 12 report can be found in:

     bedlam.asd:/usr/tmp/report.text

 The included quotations are not verbatim.  Although the wordings
 are inexact, I believe they capture the spirit of the originals.

     BLOAT UPDATE

 	    "Do you want to be a bloat detective?  It's easy;
 	    just pick any executable.  There!  You found some!"

 		-- Rolf van Widenfelt

 In the May report, I listed a bunch of executable sizes, and pointed
 out that they were unacceptable if we intended to run without serious
 paging problems on a 16 megabyte system.  Between May and the 5.1
 release, many have grown even larger.  IRIX went up from 4.8 megabytes
 to 8.1 megabytes, and has a memory leak that causes it to grow.  Within
 a week, my newly-booted 5.1 IRIX was larger than 13.8 megabytes -- a
 big chunk of a 16 megabyte system.  It's wrong to require our users to
 reboot every week.

 There are too many daemons.  In a vanilla 5.1 installation with Toto,
 there are 37 background processes.

 DSOs were supposed to reduce physical memory usage, but have had just
 the opposite effect, and their indirection has reduced performance.

 Programs like Roger Chickering's "Bloatview" based on Wiltse
 Carpenter's work make some problems obvious.  The news reader "xrn",
 starts out small, but leaks memory so badly that within a week or so it
 grows to 9 or 10 megabytes, along with plenty of other large programs.
 But what's really embarrassing is that even the kernel leaks memory
 that can't be recovered except by rebooting!

 Showcase grew from 3.2 megabytes to 4.0 megabytes, and the master and
 status gizmos which are run by default occupy another 1.7 megabytes.
 Much of this happened simply by recompiling under 5.1 -- not because of
 additional code.

 The window system (Xsgi + 4Dwm) is up from 3.2 MB to 3.6 MB, and
 the miscellaneous stuff has grown as well.  As I type now, I have the
 default non-toto environment plus a single shell and a single text
 editor, jot.  The total physical memory usage is 21.9 megabytes, and
 only because I rebooted IRIX yesterday evening to reduce the kernel
 size.  Luckily, I'm on a 32 megabyte system without Toto, or I'd be
 swamped by paging.

 Much of the problem seems to be due to DSOs that load whole libraries
 instead of individual routines.  Many SGI applications link with 20 or
 so large DSOs, virtually guaranteeing enormous executables.

 In spite of the DSOs, large chunks of Motif programs remain unshared,
 and duplicated in all Motif applications.

     PERFORMANCE UPDATE

 	    "Indy: an Indigo without the 'go'".

 		-- Mark Hughes (?)

 	    "X and Motif are the reasons that UNIX deserves to die."

 		-- Larry Kaplan

 The performance story is just as bad.  I was tempted to write simply,
 "Try to do some real work on a 16 megabyte Indy.  Case closed.", but
 I'll include some details.

 In May, I listed some unacceptable Motif performance measurements.
 Just before 5.1 MR, someone reran my tests and discovered that the
 performance had gotten even worse.  Some effort was expended to tune
 the software so that instead of being intolerable, it was back to
 merely unacceptable performance.

 We no longer report benchmark results on our standard system.  The
 benchmarks are not done with the DSO libraries; they are all compiled
 non-DSO so that the performance in 5.1 has not declined too much.

 Before I upgraded from 4.0.5 to the MR version of 5.1, I ran some
 timings of some everyday activities to see what would happen.  These
 timings were all made with the wall clock, so they represent precisely
 what our users will see.  I run a 32 megabyte R4000 Elan.

     Test		    4.0.5                 5.1         % change
     ----                    -----                 ---         --------

    C compile of	a	    25 sec              35 sec          40%
     small application

    C++ compile of a	    68 sec              105 sec         54%
     small application

    Showcase startup,	    13 sec              18 sec          38%
     May report file

    Start a shell	    &lt;2 sec              ~3 sec          ~50%

    Jot 2 MB file	    &lt;2 sec              ~3 sec          ~50%

 What's most frightening about the 5.1 performance is that nobody knows
 exactly where it went.  If you start asking around, you get plenty of
 finger-pointing and theories, but few facts.  In the May report, I
 proposed a "5% theory", which states that each little thing we add
 (Motif, internationalization, drag-and-drop, DSOs, multiple fonts, and
 so on) costs roughly 5% of the machine.  After 15 or 20 of these,
 most of the performance is gone.

 Bloating by itself causes problems.  There's heavy paging, there's so
 much code and it's so scattered that the cache may as well not be
 there.  The window manager and X and Toto are so tangled that many
 minor operations like moving the mouse or deleting a file wake up all
 the processes on the machine, causing additional paging, and perhaps
 graphics context swaps.

 But bloat isn't the whole story.  Rocky Rhodes recently ran a small
 application on an Indy, and noticed that when he held the mouse button
 down and slid it back and forth across the menu bar, the (small) pop-up
 menus got as much as 25 seconds behind.  He submitted a bug, which was
 dismissed as paging due to lack of memory.  But Rocky was running with
 160 megabytes of memory, so there was no paging.  The problem turned
 out to be Motif code modified for the SGI look that is even more
 sluggish than regular Motif.  Perhaps the problem is simply due to the
 huge number of context swaps necessary for all the daemons we're
 shipping.

 The complexity of our system software has surpassed the ability of
 average SGI programmers to understand it.  And perhaps not just average
 programmers.  Get a room full of 10 of our best software people, and
 you'll get 10 different opinions of what's causing the lousy
 performance and bloat.  What's wrong is that the software has simply
 become too complicated for anyone to understand.

     WHAT WENT WRONG IN 5.1?

 The one sentence answer is:  we bit off more than we could chew.  As a
 company, we still don't understand how difficult software is.

 We planned to make major changes in everything -- a new operating
 system, new compilers, a new user environment, new tools, and lots of
 new features in the multi-media area.  Not only that, but the new stuff
 was promised to do everything the old software had done, and with major
 enhancements.  (Early warning:  version 6.0 promises to be even more
 disruptive.)

 About 9 months ago, Rocky and I pointed out the impossibility of what
 we were attempting.  Rather than reduce the scope of the projects, a
 decision was made to hire a couple of contractors (who know nothing
 about our system) to handle the worst user interface problems in the
 Roxy project.  In addition, promises were obtained from various
 executives that a significant effort would be made to improve software
 performance.

 Management was basically afraid to cut any features, so we continued to
 work on a project that was far too large.  The desperate attempt to do
 everything caused programmers to cut corners, with disastrous effects
 on the bug count.  And the bug count was high simply because 5.1 was so
 big.

 Only when the situation was beyond hope of repair did we start to do
 something.  Features and entire products were removed wholesale from
 the
 release, and hundreds of high-priority bugs were classified as
 exceptions, so that we could ship with "no priority 1 and 2 bugs".  We
 did, however, ship with over 500 "exceptions".  The release was deemed
 too crummy to push to all our machines, but was restricted to the
 Indys, the high-end machines, and a few others where new hardware
 required the new software.  Due to the massive bug count, virtually no
 performance tuning was done.

 When the schedule is impossible as it was in 5.1, the release process
 itself can get in the way.  The schedule imposes a code freeze long
 before the software is stable, and fixing things becomes much more
 difficult.  If you know you're going to be late, slip before the code
 freeze, not after.  We're trying to wrap up the box before the stuff
 inside is finished, and then trying to fix things inside the box
 without undoing the wrapping -- it has to be less efficient.

 Management Issues:

 There was never an overall software architect, and there still is not,
 and until Way Ting was given the job near the end, there was no manager
 in charge of the 5.1 release, either.

 I wrote a note in sgi.bad-attitude about the "optimist effect", which I
 believe is mostly true.  In condensed form:

     Optimists tend to be promoted, so the higher up in the organization
     you are, the more optimistic you tend to be.  If one manager says
     "I can do that in 4 months", and another only promises it in 6
     months, the 4 month guy gets the job.  When the software is 4
 months
     late, the overall system complexity makes it easy to assign blame
     elsewhere, so there's no way to judge mis-management when it's time
     for promotions.

     To look good to their boss, most people tend to put a positive spin
     on their reports.  With many levels of management and increasing
     optimism all the way up, the information reaching the VPs is very
     filtered, and always filtered positively.

 The problem is that the highly filtered estimates are completely out of
 line with reality (at least in recent software plans here at SGI), and
 there are no reality checks back from the VPs to the engineers on the
 bottom.  I think it's great to have aggressive schedules where you try
 to get things out 20% or so faster than you'd expect.  The problem is
 that in 5.1, the engineers were expected to get things out 80% faster,
 and it was clearly impossible, so many just gave up.

 We certainly didn't win any morale prizes among the engineers with
 5.1.  It's the first release here at SGI where most of the engineers I
 talked to are ashamed of the product.  There are always a few, but this
 time there were many.  When engineers were asked to come in over the
 weekends before the 5.1 release to fix show-stopper bugs, I heard a
 comment like: "Why bother?  SGI's going to release it anyway, whether
 they're fixed or not."

 I'm not blaming the engineers.  Most of them worked their hearts out
 for 5.1, and did the best they could, given the circumstances.  They'll
 be happy to buy into a plan where there's a 20% stretch, but not where
 there's an 80% stretch.  They figure: "It's hopeless, and I'll be late
 anyway, and I'm not going to get rewarded for that, so why kill
 myself?"

 Marketing - Engineering Disconnect

 	    "Marketing -- where the rubber meets the sky."

 		-- Unknown

 There's a disconnect between engineering and marketing.  It's not
 surprising -- marketing wants all the whiz-bang features, it wants to
 run in 16 megabytes, and it wants it yesterday.  Although engineering
 would like the same things, it is faced with the reality of time
 limits, fixed costs, and the laws of nature.

 It's great to have pressure from marketing to do a better job, but at
 SGI, we often seem to have deadlocks that are simply not resolved.
 Marketing insists that Indy will work in 16 megabytes and engineering
 insists that it won't, but both continue to make their plans without
 resolving the conflict, so today we're shipping virtually useless 16 MB
 systems.  Similarly for feature lists, reliability requirements, and
 deadlines.

 Well, at least we met the deadline.

     WHAT TO DO -- SHORT TERM (5.1.2)

 	    "We should sell 'bloat credits', the way the government
 	    sells pollution credits.  Everybody's assigned a certain
 	    amount of bloat, and if they go over, they have to purchase
 	    bloat credits from some other group that's been more
 	    careful."

 		-- Bent Hagemark

 There are problems in both performance and bugs, and we'd like to fix
 both.  In addition, the first thing we should do is decide exactly
 what's going into release 5.1.2.

 If we are serious about a December all-platforms release, there may be
 very little we can do other than keep stumbling along as we have been.
 Three months isn't much time to do anything, considering the overhead
 of a release, where perhaps half of the time will be spent in "code
 freeze".  After 5.1, many engineers are exhausted, and it's
 unreasonable to expect them to start hard work immediately.  500
 outstanding priority 1 and 2 bugs is a huge list, and we haven't even
 begun to hear about customer problems yet.

 What Should be in Release 5.1.2:

 I'm afraid the answer is going to be "everything that didn't make it
 into 5.1".  I know that won't be the case, but I hope that we will
 carefully select what goes in now, rather than hack things out in a
 panic in December.  The default should be "not included", and we should
 require a good reason to include things.  Let's make sure that there's
 a minimal, solid, working set before we start adding frills.

 Improving Performance:

 	    "SGI software has a cracked engine block, and we're trying
 	    to fix it with a tune-up."

 		-- Mark Segal

 As stated above, we don't even know exactly what's wrong.  We probably
 never will, but we should start doing things that will have as much of
 an impact on the problem as possible.  I don't think we have time to
 study the problem in detail and then decide what to do -- we've got to
 mix the research with doing something about it.

 Before we begin, we should have definite performance goals -- lose less
 than 5% wall-clock time on compiles of some known program over 4.0.5,
 have shells come up as fast as in 4.0.5, or whatever.

 Some people claim that we need new software debugging tools to look at
 the problem, and that may be true, but it's not a short-term solution,
 and it runs the risk of causing us to spend all our time designing
 performance measurement tools, rather than fixing performance.

 In fact, I don't really believe that simple "tuning" will make a
 large dent.  To get things to run significantly faster, we've got
 to make significant changes.  And we can't beat the "5% rule" by just
 speeding up all the systems by 5% -- if everything is exactly 5%
 faster,
 the overall system will be exactly 5% faster.

 There's a strong tendency to look for the "quick fix".  "Get the code
 re-arranger to work", or "Put all the non-modifiable strings in shared
 code space", for example.  These ideas are attractive, since they
 promise to speed up all the code, and they should probably be pursued,
 but I think we're not going to make a lot of progress until we identify
 the major software architectural problems and do some massive
 simplification.  Remember that DSOs were the last "quick fix".

 There's got to be more to it than tuning; there must be some amazingly
 bad software architecture -- from a novice's point of view, a 4 MB
 Macintosh runs a far more efficient, interesting system than a 16 MB
 Indy.  The Mark Segal quote above sums it up.

 Code walk-throughs and design reviews are in order for most of our
 software.  The attendees should include not only people working in the
 same area, but a small cross-section of experienced engineers from
 other areas.  Get a pool of, say, 20 experienced engineers and
 perhaps 3 at a time would sit in on code reviews together with the
 other people working in that area.

 Code reviews will help in many ways -- the engineer presenting the code
 will have to understand it thoroughly to present it, others will learn
 about it, and outside observers will provide different ways to look at
 the problems.

 The most important thing should be the focus -- we're trying to make
 the code better and faster, not to make it more general, or have new
 features, or be more reusable, or better structured.

 For complex problems, the walk-through should also include some general
 design review.  Are these daemons really necessary?  Do we really need
 this feature?  And so on.

 Fixing Bugs:

 The code walk-throughs will obviously tend to turn up some bugs, so
 they'll serve a dual purpose.

 With 500 or so priority 1 and 2 bugs, we must prioritize these as
 well.  A bug that causes a system crash only on machines with some rare
 hardware configuration is properly classified priority 1, but it's
 probably less important than a bug in a popular program like Showcase
 that causes you to lose your file every tenth time, which would
 normally rank as priority 2.  The effort involved in the fix should
 also be taken into account.  For bugs of equal frequency of occurrence,
 it's probably better to fix 20 priority 2 bugs than 1 priority 1 bug if
 the priority 2 bugs are 20 times easier to fix.

 A bunch of bugs can be eliminated by getting rid of features.  Let's
 have the courage to cut some of the fat.

     WHAT TO DO -- LONG TERM

 	    "Software quality is not a crime."

 		-- Unknown (seen on a poster in building 7)


 It's easy to go on forever here, but I'll try to limit it to a few key
 ideas.  We don't have to do all these at once, but we'd better start.

     Have an overall SGI software plan.

     Let's get an architect, or at least a small group of highly
     technical people, not just managers, to agree on plans for
     releases.  In fact, since the release is a company-wide project,
     there ought to be company-wide participation in the decisions of
     what's in a release.  The group should include marketing,
     documentation, engineering, and management and should come up with
     a compromise that's reasonable to all.

     In every case, some attempt must be made to check reasonableness
     all the way to the bottom.  There's a long series of excuses,
     "Well, that's what my junior VPs told me.", or  "That's what my
     directors/managers/lead engineers/engineers told me."  We get
     killed by the optimist effect, and a disinclination to listen
     seriously to anyone but our direct reports.  Try to imagine the
     guts it takes for an engineer to go to his director and say: "My
     manager's out of his mind -- I can't possibly do what he's
     promised."

     Let's try to concentrate on performance and quality, not on new
     features, especially for the 5.1.2 release.  I know from my own
     experience that when I write good code, I spend 10% of the time
     adding features, and 90% debugging and tuning them.  It's the only
     way to make quality software.  In SGI's recent releases, the
     opposite proportions are often the rule.  It's much easier to add
     100 really neat features that don't work than to speed up
     performance by 1%.

     Aim for simplicity in design, not complexity.  Make a few things
     work really well; don't have 1000 flaky programs.

     Be willing to cut features; who's going to be more pissed off:  a
     customer who was promised a feature that doesn't appear, or the
     same customer who gets the promised feature, and after months of
     struggling with it, discovers he can't make it work?

     Get better agreement between the top level VPs and the lowest
     engineers that a given schedule is reasonable.

     For new development, continue the formal design reviews and code
     walk-throughs.  These shouldn't just happen once in the development
     cycle -- things are bound to change, and code reviews can be very
     valuable, even for our experienced programmers.
