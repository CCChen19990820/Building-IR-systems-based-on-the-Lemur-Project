<DL><DD>
225 Illinois Compiled Statutes 345 (Water Use Act of 1983)
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Any business (such as golf courses, orchards, nurseries, crop production or any business using  large amounts of water) planning to drill a water well with an expected use of 100,000 gallons a day must notify the local Soil and Water Conservation District of its intent to be a substantial user of water.   In the counties of Kankakee, Tazwell, Iroquois, and McLean, businesses must register any new well.<P> 

In  emergencies (such as drought) the Department has authority to restrict groundwater withdrawals in those 4 counties.  Failure to notify the Soil and Water Conservation District of a proposed new point of withdrawal (a well), or any business failing to register a well in the 4 counties named above, or a business failing to restrict withdrawals if required to do so by the Department, is guilty of a petty offense.  If convicted more than once, violations become a Class C misdemeanor.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Notice to the local Soil and Water Conservation District Office of the intent to be a substantial user of water may be by phone or in writing, but must be given before  construction of  the well begins. The Soil and Water Conservation District then notifies the Illinois State Water Survey, which conducts an investigation to determine the impact the proposed groundwater withdrawal may have on other water users.  The conclusions of that investigation are published in a general circulation newspaper. The Soil and Water Conservation District informs any local units of government that might be affected by the proposed groundwater withdrawal.  The review must be completed within 30 days of receipt of the notice. 
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A permit to drill a well is required by  Illinois EPA and Department of Public Health statutes. The drilling company normally complies with those requirements (although it is the responsibility of the business to be sure that they do) and to provide a "well log" to the State Water Survey.   The business must make pumping data available and allow the Department and/or Soil and  Water Conservation District employees access to private property to conduct investigations.
</DD></DL>

(Exceptions to these requirements are banks and insurance companies, or businesses exempted from the requirement by an Administrator appointed by the Attorney General.)  Registration of a franchisor and the disclosure statement shall continue to be effective until the Administrator suspends, terminates, or denies registration or sale of a franchise.  A person selling a franchise in Illinois without registration, or who files a false or misleading disclosure statement, is guilty of a class 2 felony and may be fined up to $50,000 per violation.

Franchisors must register by completing and filing an application and financial disclosure statement.  The Administrator may require additional information of the applicant to protect the public interest.   The registration becomes effective 20 business day after filing, unless the applicant is otherwise notified.  If the Administrator determines that additional information or further modifications are required, he or she may suspend a franchisor's right to sell until specified deficiencies are cured.  An Administrator may require an escrow account be established and impound fees or other funds until all obligations have been fulfilled, or a surety bond is furnished.  Registration may be denied, or registration suspended or terminated by an order of the Administrator, if an application/registration form is incomplete or if an annual report disclosure statement is deficient. In such a case the Administrator gives written notice to the  applicant or registered party, who may then request a hearing to modify or vacate the Administrator's order.

In order to be designated as a Qualified Solid Waste Energy Facility (QSWEF), electric generating facilities fueled by either methane gas from a landfill or from the incineration of solid waste must meet specific criteria.

The public utilities who purchase the electricity are entitled to tax credits equal to the difference between the amount paid for electricity and the amount that they would have otherwise been required to pay such facilities for electricity under the federal law (federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978). At the end of its contract, a QSWEF is required to begin repaying the State for the tax credits taken by the utility for purchasing its power.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must file a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking a determination that the facility meets the criteria for QSWEF status. The Commission will hold a public hearing to determine whether the facility qualifies.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must be able to demonstrate compliance with the requirements for QSWEF status that are set forth in the Public Utilities Act and Local Solid Waste Disposal Act, and if QSWEF status is granted, file reports with the Illinois Commerce Commission demonstrating their continuing compliance with such requirements.<P>

<HR>
<H3>VII.	Fees:</H3>

There are no filing fees.

<DL><DD>The purpose of EPCRA is to provide
information to the public that can help protect private citizens and
property against adverse effects of an inadvertent release of an extremely
hazardous substance into the environment and to minimize the likelihood of
such an occurrence. The Act requires businesses to file reports identifying
hazardous substances, chemical locations, chemical properties, etc., at
their facilities in amounts above established threshold quantities.  EPCRA
requires the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and the Local
Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to make these reports available to the
public upon request.  Because this information is accessible and useful, it
provides local citizens and local government officials an opportunity to
mitigate and prepare for any contingency involving a release of a hazardous
substance into the environment.  A business must notify immediately the
National Response Center, IEMA and the LEPC, and give pertinent information
about any inadvertent release of a hazardous substance into the environment
in reportable quantities.</DD></DL>

<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD>The purpose of the ICSA is to establish an
orderly system to assure that owners and/or operators of business
facilities are adequately prepared to respond to a release of chemical
substances into the environment and to improve the ability of State and
local authorities to respond to such releases.  Businesses subject to ICSA
regulations are those assigned or included within the Standard Industrial
Classifications (SIC) named in the Act 430 ILCS 45/3.  The requirements of
Act also apply to businesses that are subject to the provisions of Section
302 of the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA) of 1986 and  use, store and/or manufacture a chemical substance in
a quantity that poses a threat to the environment or public health.  The
ICSA requires business owners/operators to prepare a written Chemical
Contingency Safety Plan (unless exempted by the statute), to maintain a
copy of it on the business site, and provide copies to the local emergency
response agencies.  These businesses must certify in writing to IEMA that a
Chemical Contingency Safety Plan has been developed and provided to the
local planning and response agencies and the dates that the plans were
delivered to local officials.</DD></DL>

<DL><DD>None.  However, the IEMA may issue an exemption from
these requirements for chemical substances used or stored in innocuous
amounts that are not likely to result in a release that threatens the
environment or the public health.  Exemptions are issued on the basis of an
on site inspection of a facility.</DD></DL>

  To hire an alien, an employer must demonstrate that no U.S.  workers are available, and that the employment of the alien will not adversely affect working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. 

As a first step in the U.S. Immigration process, an employer must file a Labor Certification request with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), the agent for the U.S. Department of Labor (IDOL).
Hiring an alien without  authorization subjects an employer to fines (and in some cases is a felony).  
          </DL></DD><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:      </H3>
                                 <DL><DD>
Application forms ETA 750 and ETA 750A must be completed and filed with the Illinois Department of Employment Security, Alien Labor Certification Unit.

The average processing time for applications is between 6 months and 1 year.

An employer must specify the job description, job hours, the prevailing wage and education requirements on Form ETA 750, and the alien's education and experience on Form ETA 750A.

The employer must post the position within his company, enter a job order into the Statewide Job Service system, and advertise the job in a publication identified by the Alien Certification Unit. The employer will be sent resumes of U.S. workers submitted through IDES and must interview qualified applicants.

If an employer fails to hire U.S. workers referred by IDES or any individuals submitting resumes, he/seh will be directed to document, in detail, why the U.S. worker had been rejected. IDES will follow-up with those applicants referred for their insight into the interview with the employer. If an employer fails to comply with the directives of IDES, the case will be referred directly to the U.S. Departmen of Labor Certifying Officer for a ruling, thereby delaying the hiring process. If the Labor Certification for an alien worker is not granted by the USDOL, the employer may appeal directly to the USDOL, Alien Labor Certification Unit.

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Permits may be required of any business that has emission units (stationary equipment, operations and associated control systems) that have the potential to emit any regulated air pollutant (particulate matter, volatile organic material, and nitrogen oxide). Businesses usually required to have these permits are steel mills, manufacturing plants, electric utilities and chemical plants, as well as certain smaller businesses like hospitals, dry cleaners, grain terminals, print shops and electroplating shops. <P>

Construction Permits are required for the construction of new
emission units and modifications to existing units if those
changes increase emissions, and are valid for 1 year. <P>

Operating Permits  include four (4) types:  Smaller Source
Permit, State Operating Permit, Federally Enforceable State
Operating Permit (FESOP) and Clean Air Act Permit (CAAPP).  The
type of operating permit needed depends upon the amount of
regulated pollutants emitted and the geographical location of
the business and commonly are valid for 5 years. To determine
which Permit is needed, ask for "Does Your Business Need an Air
Pollution Control Permit?", from the Agency.<P>

If both are applied for at the same time, they both commonly are
valid for 5 years. Operating without a Permit may result in
fines.  Permit holders failing to comply with the Act are
subject to penalties that vary with the severity and duration of
their actions.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Construction Permits and Operating Permits Permit applicants must submit an application package, consisting of a plot plan/map, appropriate application forms for the specific operation, all relevant drawings, calculations and
other pertinent data, to the Bureau of Air. The Agency is allowed 90 days to respond to applications when public notice is not required.  However, when public notice is required (e.g., FESOP, CAAPP & significant or major construction), the Agency is allowed 180 days or more to respond. Permit applications are reviewed by Agency engineers and are approved if the application shows that the emission units comply with all applicable air pollution control regulations. <P>

Applications can be denied if non-compliance is shown or if insufficient information is provided in the application. Permit denials can be appealed through the Pollution Control Board. <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Permits may require record/report keeping.  Annual Emission Reports are required by May 1 of each year for every facility that has an Operating Permit.  Site fees must be paid before a new Operating Permit will be granted to a facility.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII.	Fees:</H3>

Mine Related Water Pollution</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD><P>The purpose of the permit program is to
provide assurance that planning is provided for proper environmental
safeguards for the location, preparation, operation and abandonment of
mining, mining related activities and mine refuse disposal operations in
order to prevent pollution of waters within the state.  Mining and mining
related activities include the surface or underground extraction or
processing of natural deposits of coal by the use of any mechanical
operation or process.  The term mining also includes the recovery or
processing of coa from a mine refuse area.

<P>Related activities refers to all activities at a facility which are
directly in furtherance of mining, including activities before, during and
after mining.  Such related activities include but are not limited to coal
refuse disposal and coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal.  The term mining
related activities does not include land acquisition, exploratory drilling,
surveying and similar activities.  Also included in the Mine Pollution
Control Program permit process is coal transfer facilities and coal storage
yards (exluding consumer stockpiles) which is defined as any areas where
coal is transferred from one mode of transportation to another or where
coal is dumped, piled, stored or blended.

<P>Coal docks, blending yards, conveyor belts and pipelines are also included
herein.  Conducting Mining or Mine related activities without a permit is a
civiil penalty punishable by a fee of not more than $10,000/day that
violations are occuring.  The permit generally remains effective for a
period of 5 years at which time a renewal is required.  If a renewal
application is submitted at least 180 days prior to permit expiration, a
standard condition will allow the permit to remain effective until such
time as the renewal is addressed.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>

<DL><DD><P>In order to obtain a permit (Subtitle D or NPDES),
an application must be completed and submitted directly to the IEPA.  In
instances of a new facility construction or significant revisions to
existing facilities, a permit is not only required by the IEPA but also
from the Illinois Department of Mines & Minerals (IDMM).  If this is the
case, the application to IDMM may be used as a joint application to the
IEPA, if so indicated.  All applications to the agency, whether a direct
submittal or submitted as a joint application to IDMM/IEPA, shall be
complete and include all items and requirements identified in Title 35,
Illinois Admin. Code, 405.104.

<P>All applications are reviewed by the IEPA for completeness, accuracy and
compliance with mine related environmental regulations.  Reasons for denial
of a permit from the IEPA -Mine Pollution Control Program would include any
proposed activity that threatens or allows the discharge of contaminants
into waters of the state.  Any permit denial can be appealed to the
Illinois Pollution Control Board.  The average processing time for a new
locations is generally quite timely and by comparison, shorter than for
renewals.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>

<DL><DD><P>All applications
submitted shall be signed by a principal executive officer of at least the
level of vice-president or his duly authorized representative, if such
representative is responsible for overall operation of the facility.

<P>All plans, reports, specifications and applications submitted shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer when required by the
Illinois Professional Engineering Act.  Monitoring and reporting of surface
discharges to indicate compliance with applicable effluent standards
Submission of groundwater monitoring reports as required.  All facilities
must provide access for agency inspections.</DD></DL>

<HR>

coal mine related facilities by the IEPA - Mine Pollution Control Program.</DD></DL>

</DD></DL>

<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A license, a permit and/or a certificate is required for projects that will cause a discharge into streams, wetlands or other bodies of water.  Federal permits are issued by the Corps of Engineers under the Dredge and Fill program.  Licenses are issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for hydroelectric power facilities.  Certificates issued by the Agency confirm that a proposed project may be constructed and operated in compliance with the applicable water quality standards established by the State.  Dredging, placement of fill, draining or other similar actions in streams, lakes, canals and adjacent wetlands must be authorized by the Corps of Engineers and the Agency under the Section 404 and 401 permit/certification program.  Causing a discharge into streams, wetlands and other bodies of water without the proper permit is subject to fines up to $50,000 plus $10,000 for each day the violation continues.  Permits remain effective until a project is completed.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file a "Protecting Illinois Waters" form including a description of the proposal and copies of plans and drawings of the project with the Corps of Engineers.  For projects requiring an individual permit, the Corps will issue a public notice jointly with the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Agency describing the project and offering the public an opportunity to comment and to request a hearing on the matter.  At the end of the public notice period the Agency will review all comments and evaluate the water quality aspects of the proposal.  If disputed issues arising from the impact of the proposed project and the public can be resolved, certification will be issued, usually within 30 days of the end of the public notice period.  The Corps usually acts within 3 to 6 months after an application is received.  
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Additional Agency permits may be required for sanitary sewers, water mains, landfills and other treatment facilities.<P>

Projects involving dredging and disposal of sediment in a confined facility may require an analysis of the dredged material as a part of the application, and monitoring of the facility effluent is usually required to ensure compliance with the water quality standards.  <P>

</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Permits are required to construct and operate a community public water
supply (CPWS) that serves 25 or more residents or that has 15 or more
residential service connections. (The Illinois Department of  Public Health
regulates smaller water supplies.)  A permit may be issued only to an owner
or official custodian in charge of the water supply.  The purpose of a
permit is to insure that installations, changes or additions to a CPWS do
not adversely affect the sanitary or mineral quality, or the adequacy of a
water supply.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>

<EM><STRONG>Construction Permit:</STRONG></EM> Applicants must submit an Application for Construction
Permit, together with construction drawings (bearing the seal of an
Illinois registered engineer or architect), specifications and an
engineer's design summary.  Applications are reviewed and approved by
Agency engineers if the proposed work will  not adversely affect the
sanitary or mineral quality and adequacy of the water supply. Law requires
the Agency to respond to applications for a permit within 90 days unless a
fee is required, in which case the Agency must respond in 45 days.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Operating Permits:</STRONG></EM> A permit to operate is required before improvements to
an existing water supply may be put in service.  The Agency provides the
required form at the time the construction permit is issued.  The official
custodian of the CPWS must sign the form and confirm that a certified
operator is responsible for the water supply system. The permit holder must
provide satisfactory water sample test results to the Agency.  Applications
are sometimes denied because a CPWS has reached it's expansion limit,
because of  technical flaws in the proposed construction, or because the
CPWS is in violation of a water quality standard.  If denied, an
application may be appealed to the Illinois Pollution Control Board.<P>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Owners and official custodians of CPWS must register with the Agency.  A
CPWS must be under operational control of a certified operator in
responsible charge of the water supply.  Owners/official custodians of a
CPWS are subject to monitoring and reporting requirements administered by
the Agency's Bureau of Water, Compliance Assurance Section.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Application fees for permits to construct,  install or extend water mains:<P>

From 200 to 1,000 feet = $120.<P> 
From 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet = $360.<P>
Over 5,000 feet = $600.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A Development Permit authorizes the construction or installation of a "unit" (meaning any device, mechanism, equipment or area used for storage, treatment or disposal of waste, prior to September 18,1990).   An Operating Permit authorizes the use of a waste treatment, waste storage or waste disposal operation.  An Experimental Permit authorizes use of a process or technique that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in this Section when the applicant submits proof that the process or technique has a reasonable chance of success and the environmental hazards are minimal.<P>

A Supplemental Permit is the mechanism by which these permits are modified to reflect changes in the facility or regulations under which the facility operates.<P>

The permits apply to facilities that receive wastes from off-site.  Storage, treatment and disposal, within the site where such wastes are generated, are conditionally exempt from Permit requirements. However, the agency may require a Permit for these activities through enforcement proceedings if conditions warrant it.<P>

Conducting these activities without a permit may result in civil suits by the State's Attorney, the Attorney General's Office or any third party alleging violations of the Act.<P>

Development or Operating Permits don't expire. Experimental permits may be valid for up to 2 years. Landfill and composting permits are valid for up to 5 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Development Permit must file Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA3, LPC-PA8 and LPC-PA16. <P>

(For oil storage facilities, substitute Form LPC-PA13 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
(For "potentially infectious medical waste", substitute Form# LPC-PA17 in place of  LPC-PA3.) <P>

(For landfills, substitute LPC-PA2 instead of LPC-PA3.) (For composting, substitute LPC-PA6 instead of LPC-PA3.) <P>

For landscape waste composting, substitute LPC-PA12 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
Guidance is available for "land treatment of petroleum contaminated soils" and should be considered before submitting an application for that activity.  <P>

Applications for an Operating Permit must include Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA4 & LPC-PA16. Applications for an Experimental Permit require the same forms as a Development or Operating Permit, together with an explanation of the proposed experimental process and proof or reasons why the process should be allowed and why the process poses a minimal environmental threat..<P>

Applicants for Supplemental Permits must submit the forms appropriate for the type (i.e. development or operating or experimental) of permit being modified. <P>

The Agency has: 1) 90 days to reach a decision on solid waste permits (nonhazardous), but usually reaches a decision in 60 days; 2) 45 days for operating permits (where construction has been completed), but the Agency usually reaches a decision within 30 days. The review period for an existing landfill (which was not required to go through siting), and new landfills, will be 180 days.Permits for the management of non-hazardous solid waste (i.e., storage, treatment or disposal) of off-site generated wastes.<P>

The most common reasons Permit applications are denied is due to technical deficiencies such as not providing secondary containment around tanks and/or containers. <P>

If an application is denied, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Pollution Control. In the hearing the burden of proof is on the applicant. The denial may be resolved through negotiations with the agency before the Board holds the hearing. The negotiations may result in a revised permit.  <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Facilities managing waste received from an outside source must receive local siting approval before a Permit application may be filed with the Agency.<P>

Technical data, such as design drawings, specifications and engineering studies which accompany applications must be certified and sealed by a  professional engineer licensed to practice in Illinois.<P>

Facilities accepting nonhazardous special waste, must file an annual report with the Agency by February 1 of each year, specifying the quantities and disposition of the waste accepted during the previous year. <P>

Permits will usually specify inspection requirements, groundwater monitoring (in some instances), financial assurance for closure (for landfills) and soil testing (for remediation  of contaminated soils). <P>

</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file a Form # LPC-37. The Agency usually processes applications in about two weeks. Common reasons applications are denied include previous violations of  laws, regulations or ordinances governing the operation of waste disposal sites, felony convictions; or gross carelessness in handling, storing, processing, transporting or disposing of hazardous wastes. If the Agency denies an application or imposes conditions on a Permit, the Applicant may appeal the decision and petition for a hearing before the Pollution Control Board.  Before the hearing date the parties are free to negotiate terms of the dispute which may result in a revised permit.  In a hearing before the PCB, the petitioner has the burden of proof.

<DL><DD>
This Act  requires employers to pay employee wages and final compensation within a prescribed number of days following the pay period in which they were earned. The Department can assist employees in the collection of wages or final compensation due them. The law applies to all employers doing business in the State of Illinois, except State and Federal governments, and prohibits the deductions from wages or final compensation (except as specified in the Law). Underpayment or the refusal to pay 	wages, or the false denial of the amount or validity of wages due is a Class C misdemeanor and each day during which a violation of the Act continues is a separate offense. Failure to 	pay wages in 15 days after an order by the Department may result in a penalty of 1% per calendar day to the employee (up to twice the amount due the employee).<P>

A permit is required to breed, hatch, propagate or raise aquatic life species including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, mussels, clams, gastropods, fish and aquatic plants.  

Permits are issued for one year, and are valid from February 1 of the year issued and expire the following January 31.
</DD></DL><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:</H3>
                           <DL><DD>
A permit will be issued by the Department upon receipt of a completed and signed Application for Aquaculture Permit, together with the necessary fees.  

Applications require approval by a Department biologist, which includes an inspection of proposed facilities if an application involves a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  

Applications may be denied (or consideration of an application may be postponed) if applicant has not provided sufficient information regarding risks associated with a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  In such instances, applicant may appeal the denial to the Chief of Fisheries.

The Department cautions applicants that no authority is granted to operate an aquaculture facility until a permit actually is issued.  The mere filing of an application or  possession of a canceled check representing payment of fees does not entitle a person to operate an aquaculture facility.

IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
                                  <DL><DD>
A permit from the Department is required for any individual to "hold, possess or engage in the breeding or raising of live fur-bearing mammals".  A permit must be obtained before purchasing a species and species can be obtained only from another licensed breeder.  

Only eleven species are authorized for possession by this permit.  They are: Badger, Beaver, Gray Fox, Red Fox, Muskrat, Mink, Raccoon, River Otter, Opossum, Least Weasel and Long-tailed Weasel.

It is illegal to take a species in the wild, and this permit does not authorize taking animals from the wild.  (Note:  1. A Permit does not authorize possession of striped skunk, bobcat or coyote, and possession of those fur-bearing species is prohibited.  2. A permit may not be required for breeding, raising and producing in captivity, and marketing by the producer, of Mink, Red Fox or Arctic Fox as live animals or as animal pelts or carcasses.  Such activity may be deemed to be an agricultural pursuit and persons so engaged may be considered "fur Farmers".  For complete details consult the Department at the address shown above.)

Permits are issued for a period of up to one year and expire on March 31 after the date of issue.
       </DD></DL><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:   </H3>
                              <DL><DD>
Applicant must complete and file with the Department a "Fur-Bearing Mammal Breeder/Possession Permit Application", together with the required fees. Applicant must swear that the information contained thereon  is true and accurate. False or deceptive information may subject applicant to arrest and revocation of license privileges for up to five years.

Licenses are issued approximately two weeks after a properly completed application and fees are received by the Department.  Common reasons for denial are applications that name a species not authorized a species obtained from an unlicensed breeder, and incomplete applications.
                                      </DD></DL><HR><H3>

Applicants must file an application including background environmental data, legal information regarding an applicant's right to mine, any past violation history, corporate structure (if applicant is incorporated), maps and detailed engineering drawings prepared by, or under the direction of, and sealed by a qualified, registered professional engineer licensed in Illinois. <P>

Applicant is required to place a newspaper advertisement for 4 consecutive weeks, describing the type of proposed activity and location. Anyone who believes he or she may be adversely affected by the proposal may request a conference or hearing.  <P>

Based upon OMM's internal technical review, and comments received from the general public and Interagency Committee, a decision to approve, deny or modify the application is issued. (In nearly all cases, the Department issues a decision requiring the applicant to modify the application.) If the applicant responds positively to OMM's request for modifications a permit may be issued.  Generally, applications take 1-2 years to process. A permit may be denied to anyone "blocked" on the Applicant Violator System, a computer network of mine operators with compliance problems.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. 	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
OMM may not issue a permit until an applicant posts a performance bond guaranteeing reclamation of the site. <P>

Coal mine sites require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit from the Illinois EPA. Additional permits may be required from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources - Office of Water Resource Management, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if floodplain disturbances are planned or if a large impoundment is proposed to be constructed, and the federal Mine Safety & Health Administration.  Operators are obligated to adhere to performance and monitoring requirements. <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
$125 per acre for all land within the permit boundary to be surface mined. $5 per acre for each year the bond is in force for all non-surface mined land within the permit boundary.<P>
</DD></DL>

radioactive material, such as those found in home smoke detectors or
luminous dial watches, are exempt.  Other small quantities, such as some
gauging devices, only need to be registered.)  Businesses that want to use
radioactive material that is not exempt, or quantities and forms other than
those requiring registration, must obtain a Radioactive Materials License.<P>

Typically, Licenses are required for medical use, research, and
manufacturing of items containing radioactive material.  Entities using
measuring and gauging devices (moisture/density gauges, lead paint gauges,
etc.) must also obtain a Radioactive Materials License prior to receiving
and using them.   Anyone may contact the Department to determine if a
license is required for a particular use. Using radioactive material
without a license is a Class B misdemeanor.  Licenses are valid for 5
years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Radioactive Materials License must file an application.
The Division of Radioactive Materials will provide assistance in preparing
a license application.<P>

Applicants must describe the type and quantities of radioactive material to
be used and the procedures to be followed for the safe receipt, use,
storage and disposal of radioactive material.<P>

If the Department review determines that the proposed program of radiation
safety is adequate to protect public and worker health and safety, a
license will be issued in 30 to 90 days.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
License holders  may be inspected periodically to ensure the requirements,
regulations & conditions of the license are being met. Licensees also must
comply with regulations concerning accreditation of technologists for
medical use of radioactive materials and certification of industrial
radiographers.  Licensees may also be subject to low-level radioactive
waste reporting requirements.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The various fees associated with licensure are specified in Title 32,
Illinois Administrative Code, Part 331.  They cover the cost of routine
licensing and inspection activities performed by the Department and vary
according to the degree of complexity of the license. Licensees and
applicants for a radioactive materials license can contact the Division of
Radioactive Materials for detailed and specific information regarding fees
for a particular use of radioactive material.  There also are fees
associated with Technologist accreditation, Industrial Radiographer
certification and generation of low-level radioactive waste.

<H3>IV.Requirement Description:</H3>
<dl><dd>
Federal and state law require judges in domestic relations cases to order employers to withhold a portion of an employee's income for payment of child support. Whenever an Order for support is entered, a separate Order for Withholding must be entered also. The Order for Withholding is served on the employer immediately unless the parties agree and an alternative arrangement that insures payment of support is secured. An employer may not fire, discipline, deny employment or otherwise penalize an employee because he or she is subject to an Order for Withholding. Employers have 10 days after being served with the Order to comply. Non-compliance with the Order may result in a fine on the employer of $100 per day plus payment of the amount of the order.
</dd></dl><hr>
<H3>V. Approval Process:
</H3><dl><dd>
Illinois courts, the Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA), or administrative agency or court of another state may issue a Support Order and an Order for Withholding and have it served on an employer. Upon receipt of a Support Order and an Order for Withholding from another state, an Illinois employer must treat it as if it had been issued by an Illinois tribunal, provide a copy of the order to the employee, and distribute the funds as directed in the order.<P>

The employer may withhold from the employee's pay the amount(s) stated in the Order, but not more than the limit allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (FCCPA). Some Orders will state that the employer must enroll minor children as beneficiaries in the company's health insurance plan. The employer must send withheld child support amount(s) to the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA, the court or administrative agency of another state and/or the child's custodial parent, as directed in the Order. The withheld insurance premium is sent to the insurance carrier.<P></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<dl><dd>
In cases where insurance coverage is mandated, employers must notify the custodial parent, IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state, of the date when coverage begins, information on the dependent coverage plan and all necessary claim forms within 15 days of enrollment (or upon request).  Employers must notify the office that served the Order when an employee is no longer employed. If available, employers must provide a new address, name of a new employer and other information that may be necessary to continue the withholding process. If health coverage is terminated or changed for any reason, the employer must notify the custodial parent, the IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state of the change and any conversion privileges within 10 days of the change date. For each deduction, the employer must provide the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA in direct pay cases, or the court or administrative agency of another state with the date the employee was paid. The employer must pay the amount withheld to the custodial parent, IDPA, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, or the court or administrative agency of another state in accordance with the court's Order or Administrative Order for Withholding, within 10 calendar days of the date the employee is paid.<p></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<dl><dd>
An employer can deduct a fee of up to $5 per month for each Order for Withholding. The fee is to be deducted from the employee's remaining pay (wages excluding the amount withheld). This fee must be within the limits of the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.

<HR>
<H3>IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A License is required to contract and conduct lead mitigation activities in dwellings and day care facilities. Mitigation activities requiring a license include the destruction or disturbance of any leaded surface. These services must be conducted by  licensed lead abatement workers under supervision of a licensed lead abatement contractor/supervisor. Providing these services without a license, is a Class A misdemeanor.<P> 

Licenses are valid for one year, and expire May 31.<P> 

Licenses that have been expired for 3 years or less may be reinstated upon application.  Licenses expired for more than 3 years are not eligible for reinstatement, but require a new application.<P> 
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must submit an application to become a licensed lead abatement contractor together with other information including a certificate of financial responsibility documenting liability insurance, a letter of credit or bond (minimum $250,000), a copy of a valid Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor's License issued to the contractor or the name of a Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor employed by the contractor, the contractor's written statement that only licensed lead workers will be employed, a copy of the contractor's written standard operating procedures and employee protection plans, which include specific reference to medical monitoring and respirator training programs as required in OSHA regulations at 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.62 (1993), and; a description detailing all legal proceedings, lawsuits or claims which have been filed or levied against the contractor or any of his past or present employees or companies in regard to construction related activities. Applicants licensed or certified as Lead Abatement Contractor in another state may request reciprocal licensure. IDPH evaluates the requirements for licensure in the other state and issues a license if IDPH determines that the requirements for licensure in the other state are equal to the requirements for licensure in Illinois. If an application to become licensed is denied, the applicant may attempt to correct any deficiencies found in the application and then reapply. To renew a contractor license, applicants must submit an application and a certificate of completion of an Illinois-approved refresher Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor 8-hour (1 day) course that is issued to the contractor or a contractor/supervisor employed by the contractor. The average  processing time for the contractor license is approximately 1 week. The most common reason for denial of the license application is missing or incorrect information provided with the application. 
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.   Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:  Co-Requisite:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Information submitted with the initial application must be kept current or updated where necessary. A current certificate of insurance shall be on file with IDPH at all times. Post-requisite: The contractor shall notify IDPH of any change in the status of the insurance certificate which has been filed, including expiration, renewal, or alteration of the terms of the certificate. 
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII.   Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must submit to IDPH, a non-refundable fee of $500 for a Lead Abatement Contractor license. Out-of-state applicants who request a reciprocal license must submit a non-refundable fee of $250, plus an additional $500 non-refundable license fee. The annual non-refundable renewal fee for a lead abatement contractor licensure is $500. If a renewal application is received after April 30, the applicant must pay a non-refundable late fee of $100 in addition to the renewal fee of $500. Reinstated licenses are $100 plus all lapsed license fees.

<DL><DD>86 Illinois Administrative Code 1/500.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:  </H3>
<DL><DD><P>A Motor Fuel Use Tax is imposed on interstate carriers operating commercial motor vehicles* on highways in Illinois. There are two Motor Fuel Use Taxes programs: 1.) the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) and, 2.) the Illinois Interstate Motor Fuel Use Tax.  Illinois based carriers who operate one or more commercial motor vehicles in at least one other IFTA jurisdiction can apply for an IFTA license and decals.  A carrier based in a non-IFTA jurisdiction, who wishes to operate in Illinois, can apply for an Illinois Interstate license and decals.

<P>An Illinois license and IFTA decal allows a carrier to travel in all IFTA jurisdictions and to file a single return with the Department, reporting miles traveled, gallons used and gallons purchased in each jurisdiction.  The carrier then pays the net due, or receives a refund, whichever applies.  An Illinois Interstate license and decal only allows the carrier to travel through Illinois. If a carrier qualifies as an IFTA or Illinois Interstate licensee but does not wish to participate in either program, a single trip permit (valid for 72 hours) must be obtained from the Department or from a wire service to travel through Illinois.

<P>Operating a commercial motor vehicle in Illinois without displaying a valid motor fuel use tax license, a decal, or a single trip permit, is a petty offense. A commercial motor vehicle found operating in Illinois without registering and securing a motor fuel use tax license or single trip permit is subject to a penalty of $1,000. Operating as a motor carrier without a valid motor fuel use tax license or a single trip permit is a Class A misdemeanor, and each subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Applicants for a Motor Fuel Use Tax license and decals must complete and file application Form # MFUT-12 with the Department.  Licenses and decals are valid for a maximum of one year, from January 1 through December 31.  Applications for licenses and decals are processed in approximately two weeks, but may take longer during renewal season (October through February).  Carriers may be required to file a bond if they have failed to pay taxes, file timely reports with the Department, or an audit indicates it is appropriate to protect the interests of member jurisdictions.  Common reasons for denial of licenses are if the carrier:  Is revoked in Illinois or another jurisdiction, the application is not signed by an owner or corporate officer, has failed to file returns, has a balance due of over $50.00.  Carriers may appeal denial of an application.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Carriers must file a quarterly return.  Form (MFUT-15) with Fuel Summaries must be completed by Illinois IFTA carriers.  Form (MFUT-16) must be completed by Illinois Interstate Carriers.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VII.	Fees:  </H3>

<DL><DD><P>There are no application or renewal fees.  However, the fee for decals is $3.75 per set for each calendar year.  Checks must be made payable to the Illinois Department of Revenue.

<P>*A commercial motor vehicle is defined as: Having two axles and a gross weight or registered gross weight exceeding 26,000 lbs.; having three or more axles regardless of weight, or a vehicle used in combination when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 lbs. gross weight or registered gross weight.

<P>Exempted from this definition in Illinois are:  motor vehicles operated by the State of Illinois or the United States, recreational vehicles, school buses, commercial motor vehicles operated solely within the State of Illinois.  (Exempted under the International Fuel Tax Agreement are:  Recreational vehicles.)</DD></DL>

The Illinois Income Tax Act (IITA) and the Retailers Occupation Tax Act (ROTA) impose a liability obligation upon the purchaser of assets* of a business for any unpaid sales, withholding, income, or excise taxes from the seller.

Also, a requirement is imposed on the purchaser to withhold funds from sale proceeds. This acts to limit the amount of transferee liability the purchaser may be held liable for.  A release of transferee liability is issued when the seller's accounts are clear or the purchaser has paid the funds in escrow.<P>

<DL><DD>
Every motor vehicle owned by a resident of the "original inspection area", other than an exempt vehicle, is subject to inspection under this program.  The "original inspection area" means Cook county and portions of DuPage, Lake, Madison & St. Clair  counties. <P>

The purpose of the program is to reduce the emission of pollutants by motor vehicles.    <P>

<H3>V.  	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Vehicle inspections may be performed only by inspectors who have successfully completed an approved training course and at official inspection stations with equipment that has been approved by the Agency.<P>

Inspections consist of an exhaust gas analysis and, if required, a tamper check.  Vehicles will be deemed to have passed such tests if the exhaust gas sample indicates that the concentrations of pollutants emitted by the vehicle do not exceed the standards set for vehicles of that type.  If all required tests are passed at the time of the inspection, the owner of the vehicle (or his/her agent) shall be entitled to an emission inspection sticker.<P>

The owner of a vehicle to be inspected may not be expected to wait more than 15 minutes from the time of presenting the vehicle for inspection and the actual start of the inspection.<P>

An owner or lessee of a fleet of 15 or more vehicles subject to inspection may apply to the Department for a permit to establish and operate a Private Official Inspection Station. <P>

<HR>
<H3>IV:  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The purpose of this Act is to regulate persons who directly communicate with legislators, constitutional officers, and other officials, such as agency directors, deputy directors, and general counsels, for the ultimate purpose of influencing an executive, legislative, or administrative action.  This Act may affect any business that does business with the State.  A business may be required to register if any salaried or contractual employee, as any part of their job duties, undertakes to influence the outcome of an executive, legislative, or administrative action.<P>

The employee would be required to register as an attachment to the
business' registration.  (Section 560.210 of the Code explains exemptions
from the Act).  The Secretary of State's Office does not have the statutory
authority to make the determination as to whether a business falls within
the purview of the Act and parties unsure as to whether the Act applies to
their business should consult with their lawyer. All registration
statements expire on December 31, and must be renewed by January 31.  The
primary purpose of this Act is to disclose expenditures (travel and
lodging, meals, beverages, entertainment, gifts and honoraria) on behalf of
officials by businesses subject to the Act.  Violations are a business
offense; parties convicted may be prohibited from lobbying for 3 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Registration Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Businesses must file a Registration Statement with an attachment for each employee who lobbies solely on behalf of the business.  It is not necessary to file an attachment for contractual lobbyists who are registered on their own or with another entity. (The Index Department provides a free "lobbyist packet" which contains rules, registration and reporting forms, and "A Guide to Lobbyist Registration and Reporting," with a copy of the Act.)
</DD></DL>

<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registered, authorized agents are responsible for filing a semi-annual expenditure report by July 31 for the period of January 1 through June 30, or the final day of the General Assembly session, and an annual expenditure report by January 31 for the entire previous calendar year. Reports must be filed even if the business did not make reportable expenditures.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII.  Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registration fee for the business: $50, plus $50 registration fee for each salaried employee lobbying on behalf of the business (contractual lobbyists with other clients pay in conjunction with their own registration).  Registration statements and expenditure reports received within 15 days of a filing deadline must be accompanied by a $50 late filing fee.<P>

Registration statements and expenditure Reports received after 15 days of a
filing deadline are subject to an additional $100 penalty.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The purpose of the Illinois Vehicle Safety Inspection Program (IVSIP) is to test all second division vehicles with a gross weight of over 8,000 lbs.,  trailers with a gross weight of over 5,000 lbs., school bus, religious organization buses, pole trailers, ambulances, tow trucks and limousines for certain mechanical and structural integrity ensuring safe vehicles on the highways of Illinois.  Certification allows individuals or business entities in private enterprise to receive monetary compensation for conducting vehicle inspections.<P>

Conducting inspections without a Certificate is a petty offense and subject to a fine of $5 to $100 for a first offense, $25 to $200 for a second offense, and $100 to 300 for the third offense.<P>

Certification is valid for one year and may be renewed.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file an application consisting of a completed personal history questionnaire, photographs of the building and all entrances, all necessary equipment needed to conduct the inspections (brake testing machine, side-slip indicator, floor jack), an insurance bond and identification of all proficiency-tested and certified individuals wishing to conduct the inspections.<P>

Applications, proposed building sites and all equipment are inspected by Department personnel who also administer a written exam and proficiency test to those wishing to become testers.<P>  

The approval process depends upon the timely manner in which the applicant submits all required items and how quickly they become familiar and proficient with the rules, policies and procedures.  Generally, this takes about one month, but can vary depending on many things including how quickly the applicant completes the paperwork, passes the test, and properly prepares the premises. The most common reasons that applications are denied are building restrictions, inoperable testing equipment or lack of proficiency on the part of testers.<P>

<DL><DD>
Testers must possess a valid drivers license for the state in which he/she legally resides.<P>

<center><h3>TIPS for using the WORD SEARCH function</h3></center>

Be careful spelling the word(s) you enter!  It will search for exactly what 
you specify.<p>  

The search is not case sensitive.  For example, if you type 'INCOME', the 
system will return a list of documents that have 'INCOME', 'Income' or 
'income'.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>

1996 Outstanding Year for Film, Television Production in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO,  ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that 27 film and television productions provided temporary jobs for more than 25,000 Illinois residents and pumped $100 million into the state's economy in 1996.<p>

"The Illinois film industry is thriving," the Governor said.  "We are seeing the results of the rebuilding efforts of the Illinois Film Office in film and television productions such as 'Chain Reaction,' 'A Thousand Acres," 'My Best Friend's Wedding,'  'ER,' 'Early Edition,' and 'Chicago Hope.'  Hollywood is investing in Illinois because of our willingness to accommodate the demands of the film marketplace and the excellent cooperation between labor unions and state and local governmental bodies to meet the industry's needs."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the film industry makes a significant contribution to the state's economy.<p>

"This is only the second year in the 20-year history of the Illinois Film Office that revenue has reached $100 million in actual cash expenditures in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Since 1976, the motion picture and television industry has contributed more than $800 million to the state's economy and provided more than 250,000 temporary jobs."<p>

Some of the highlights of 1996 include "A Thousand Acres," filmed in Rochelle, Creston, and Mendota in September, and "35 Miles from Normal," filmed last summer in Pontiac.  Chicago productions include "Michael," due for release at Christmas; recently released "The Chamber." and 1997 releases such as "Love Jones," "Dogwater," "Hoods," "Reach the Rock," "Home Alone 3," and "My Best Friend's Wedding."<p>      

In addition to big Hollywood productions, which clearly boost the Illinois economy, the Illinois Film Office is seeing strong growth in independent film productions originating in Illinois, a major indicator of the future health of the local film industry.<p> 

The Illinois Film Office, a division of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, is responsible for attracting productions and promoting the film and television industry in Illinois.  Activities include location scouting, acting as a liaison between state and local governments, and providing information that outlines available film facilities and services, ranging from accountants to screenwriters.<p>

Governor Releases $1 Million in Emergency Heating Funds to Help Low-Income Families Re-Establish
Utilities Service
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today released $1 million in state emergency heating assistance to help low-income Illinois families and individuals re-establish utility services.<p>

"With the onset of frigid winter temperatures, thousands of Illinoisans who can't afford the cost of utilities may well find their lives threatened by the bitter cold," the Governor said.  "I have asked that state government tap all available resources to help low-income citizens currently without heat for their homes." <p>

The $1 million released today comes from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Nearly half -- about  $465,000 -- would go to residents of the City of Chicago and Cook County.  The rest will be distributed throughout the state to areas with the greatest need.<p>

Up to $500 a year in emergency funds is available to households that have had utilities disconnected or that fuel suppliers refuse to serve without immediate payment.  The funds also can be used to help pay for repair or replacement of heating systems that do not work.<p>

To qualify, applicants must show that they are low-income households and that they are responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or fuel vendor.  They must also show they have paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

About 6,000 residents already have received emergency assistance through state and federal programs this year.  An additional 95,000 have received one-time payments toward their energy bills.<p>

Additional information about the program is available by calling DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline toll-free at 800/252-8643.<p>

</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL. </strong> --  Illinois communities interested in participating in the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) are encouraged to attend one of three workshops to be held next week.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Edgar's senior advisor for economic development, said the program is designed to give local governments the tools to help themselves become more competitive. <p>

"The Competitive Communities Initiative is one of  DCCA's most popular local government programs," said Kustra.  "Economic development opportunities often hinge on how prepared a community is for growth.  A community of any size or level of economic development sophistication that is determined to improve itself can benefit from the rigorous self-assessment and action plan developed as the result of this program."  <p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said the program is already successfully in place in 30 communities throughout Illinois.<p>  

"CCI helps communities focus on leadership, assess their foundations for growth and build upon past economic development efforts," said Whetstone.  "Mayors and other local leaders have told us that their participation in CCI has helped them identify local development issues and develop consensus."<p>

Application workshops will be held in three different locations during the week of November 18, 1996.  At the workshops, CCI staff members will give a brief description of the goals and objectives of CCI and answer any questions concerning the application process.  Communities do not have to attend a workshop in order to submit an application.<p>

Applications are due no later than December 16, 1996 at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, Office of Local Initiatives, 620 E. Adams Street, Springfield, Illinois  62701.<p>

The workshops will be held at the following locations:<p>

Governor Awards $41.5 Million in Grants to Improve Public Infrastructure in 157 Communities Throughout Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded grants worth $41.5 million to help 157 Illinois communities improve and expand public water and sewer systems to meet the demands of economic growth while protecting the state's environment.<p>

"If Illinois communities are to thrive and grow, they must have adequate and safe water and wastewater treatment systems," the Governor said.  "Through the Community Development Assistance Program, smaller communities throughout Illinois can get the help they need to pay for costly improvements to public infrastructure, a financial challenge that few smaller communities can meet on their own.<p>

"Beyond demands of economic growth, improved water and sewer systems also are crucial to protecting the Illinois environment and the health and safety of Illinois residents.  We want to help Illinois communities build a brighter economic and environmental future."<p>

CDAP grants are available to most Illinois communities with populations of 50,000 or less.  The grants are administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

The Governor pointed to projects in Hillsboro and Carthage as examples of improvement needs funded across Illinois.<p>

The City of Hillsboro will receive a $375,000 grant to help improve sand filters at its wastewater treatment plant.  The city has not met Illinois Environmental Protection Agency standards because wastewater volumes have overtaxed the existing filter system.  The improvements will eliminate the discharge of inadequately treated wastewater and bring the plant into compliance with state environmental guidelines.<p>

The City of Carthage will receive $50,000 in CDAP grant funding to help replace a key sewer main.  The existing line is too small to handle current sewage volume.  It is deteriorating and is exposed in several locations along a drainage ditch.  Sewage backups have occurred in several homes in the service area, creating hazards to public health and safety.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the funding is a sound investment in the future of Illinois.<p>

"Smaller communities must be prepared for economic expansion," Kustra said.  "Infrastructure improvements set the stage for development, improve the quality of life, and protect the health and safety of our citizens."<p>

DCCA officials received 308 requests for CDAP funding, totaling $89.7 million.<p>

CDAP grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to cities outside the seven most populous Illinois counties.  Low to moderate income benefit is a primary factor in awarding the grants.<p>

A list of project grants awarded today is attached.<p>

Governor Announces Third Consecutive Decrease in High-Risk Workers' Compensation Rates
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois workers' compensation insurance rates among high-risk employers will be reduced for the third consecutive year in 1997.<p>

"Lower workers' compensation insurance rates help strengthen the Illinois business climate," the Governor said.  "This 10.1 percent rate decrease for 1997 and similar decreases over the past two years are lowering the cost of doing business in Illinois.  That allows business owners to reinvest the savings in their companies, their workforces and our economy."<p>

The rate reduction, requested by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), is expected to save $15.5 million for Illinois manufacturers and businesses involved in the Illinois Workers' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan.  NCCI administers the high-risk pool for about 300 insurance companies serving employers who are unable to buy workers' compensation insurance through the voluntary insurance market.  The high-risk pool insures more than 9 percent of the total Illinois workers' compensation market.  Workers' compensation rates for high-risk employers decreased 6.8 percent in 1995 and 13.6 percent in 1996.  Rates generally are based on the frequency and severity of recent claims.<p>

Illinois Director of Insurance Mark Boozell approved NCCI's rate reduction request today, assuring an overall average 10.1 percent rate decrease next year for companies in the high-risk pool.  The new rates take effect Jan. 1.<p>

NCCI recommended a corresponding 10.1 percent rate decrease for employers in the voluntary market.  "Insurance companies must file their voluntary rates with the Department of Insurance on an individual basis," Boozell said.  "Although voluntary rates can fluctuate above or below the recommended decrease, the level of competition in the market will ultimately determine how much companies charge."<p>

Rates in the voluntary workers' compensation insurance market are roughly 20 percent lower than rates in the high-risk pool, Boozell said.<p>

Governor Announces Auto Part Company will Locate New Plant in Lawrenceville; State Helps to Create About 125 Jobs
</h3>

<strong>LAWRENCEVILLE, ILL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Trim Masers, Inc., an automobile parts manufacturing company, will locate a new plant in Lawrenceville with assistance for the state. <p> 

"I am delighted that Trim masters has joined many, many other companies that have decided to invest in Illinois and create jobs here because of our excellent business climate and quality workforce, " the Governor said.<p>

"More than 360,000 new jobs have been created in our state in just the last four years, reflecting our retooled and re-energized efforts to make Illinois a place where businesses want to expand and locate," Edgar said.<p>

Kentucky-based Trim master will employ about 125 and invests as much as $12 million in the 100,000 square-foot facility at Lawrenceville.  At least two other states were competing for the plant.  Construction will begin next May and is expected to be complete in December 1997.  Trim Masters manufactures seat trim covers, door trim and complete seats for automobiles.<p>

The state, through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, will provide $187,000 in job-training funds and $500,000 in infrastructure assistance to help fund water and wastewater projects.  The City of Lawrenceville will donate the plant site.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the state worked with Lawrenceville area officials to make the project a reality.<p>

"This project was a team effort," said Kustra.  "Assistance at the state and local level was needed to bring Trim masters to Lawrenceville, and we are pleased to see much-needed jobs come to this community."<p>

Lawrenceville Mayor Jerry Harper said residents are excited about the jobs that will be created.<p>

"This announcement gives Lawrenceville an economic shot in the arm," Harper said.  "We wouldn't have been able to land this project without the assistance of the State of Illinois.  The help provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs clinched the deal to bring Trim Masters here, and we are very appreciative."<p>

Philip Ashcraft, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Trim Master, said the company is looking forward to working with the community.<p>

"The enthusiasm of the people in Lawrenceville area was one of the reasons we chose to locate here," said Ashcraft.  "that local support, combined with an excellent labor pool and the incentives offered by the State of Illinois, helped to make locating in Lawrenceville an easy decision for Trim Masters."<p>

Governor Congratulates Eli's Cheesecake Co. on Opening of New Headquarters
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with business and civic leaders in Chicago to celebrate the grand opening of the new $9 million bakery and headquarters for Eli's  Cheesecake Co. in Chicago Industry-Tech Park on the city's northwest side.<p>
  	    
"This opening represents an economic development milestone for the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois," the Governor said.  "First, Eli's reputation is much of the reason people across the country think of Chicago and Illinois when they think of fine cheesecake, and this opening certainly reinforces that connection.  <p>

"But the opening also represents the first project in a plan to redevelop the former Chicago-Read Mental Health Center site.  That creates exciting new opportunities for businesses to relocate and grow within the city of Chicago at costs competitive with the surrounding suburbs.  Eli's is to be commended as the first company to recognize the potential of Industry-Tech Park with the opening of Eli's Cheesecake Co."<p>

The Edgar administration will provide Eli's with a $300,000 Small Business Development Loan for the project through the state Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>  

Eli's Chicago's Finest Cheesecake President Marc Schulman said his company is proud to open Eli's Cheesecake Co. in Chicago.<p>

"The support of the city and the state and the loyalty of our customers made possible the achievement of our dream to build a state-of-the-art facility," said Schulman.  "We appreciate the opportunity to relocate in our current neighborhood, and we have built a true showcase for food products made in Illinois."  <p>         

"Today's event is just the latest example of how our investments in revitalizing economic development throughout Illinois are benefitting our businesses and our citizens," Edgar said. <p> 

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the development of Industry-Tech Park is a true partnership.<p>

"Public and private interests at the state and local level have a stake in realizing our goal of developing Industry-Tech Park," Kustra said.  "With Eli's Cheesecake Co. as an anchor we will continue to work together to build on our initial success."<p>        	

Chicago Industry-Tech Park was formally created in June of 1995 when the state agreed to provide 73 acres of surplus land that was part of the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center campus.<p>        

The redevelopment project is expected to take six to eight years and yield 580,000 square feet for modern industrial facilities, including processing, light-manufacturing and assembly facilities.  When fully developed, DCCA has estimated the park will generate more than $36 million in retail sales, $2.6 million in net state revenues, $2.8 million net local taxes and $100 million in payroll earnings.<p>

Governor Announces $5 Million Investment to Expand, Push Marketing of Illinois Coal
</h3>

<strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a sweeping multi-million-dollar plan to expand markets for Illinois coal and improve the state's coal transportation, export and delivery systems.<p>

"The Illinois coal industry faces some tough challenges.  By moving forward with a sharply focused and aggressive marketing effort, we believe Illinois can solidify and expand its coal market opportunities," the Governor said. <p>

Edgar announced the state will spend $5 million to support coal marketing and transportation improvements, including $2 million for the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign. The grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs goes to the Illinois Coal Development Board.<p>

The proposed Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign includes two main components:  The Market Development Program and the Strategic Projects Program.<p>

The Market Development Program includes coal market research and analysis.  Analysts will identify promising domestic and international markets and provide the Illinois coal industry with information and strategies to tap those markets and to increase the value of Illinois coal.  Market Development analysts also will evaluate improvements needed to more efficiently transport Illinois coal to U.S. and global markets.<p>

The Strategic Projects Program will analyze infrastructure needs to improve coal transportation, export and delivery systems in Illinois.  State dollars will be used to leverage private and public investment to improve infrastructure and to increase coal shipments from Illinois.<p>

For instance, the Strategic Projects Program will look at ways to improve Illinois rail and barge loading facilities.  The idea is to move ore coal at lower costs to the Gulf of Mexico and on to international markets.<p>

"We have an opportunity to greatly expand our domestic markets as U.S. electric utilities restructure to comply with Clean Air Act rules," the Governor said.  "In addition, the global market potential for coal is only beginning to be realized as the demand for coal increases, particularly in developing countries.  This strategic marketing plan will help the Illinois coal industry take full advantage of changing market conditions around the world."<p>

State Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) joined the Governor in announcing the marketing plan.<p>

"I am proud to work with the Governor in developing this plan," Luechtefeld said.  "Coal production is the major economic force in many of the Southern Illinois communities I represent.  This plan will push us toward our goal of developing new markets for Illinois coal and developing systems for the most cost-efficient movement of coal to foreign markets."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said international markets show great promise. <p> 

Working with leaders of the Illinois Coal Association and the United Mine Workers of America, Kustra last year created the Illinois Coal Strategy Group, whose goal is to seek ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and ensure positive impacts on local communities.<p>

"Illinois coal exports are up," Kustra said.  "Exports in 1995 increased 10-fold over 1994 levels and current analysts' projections indicate that we could double foreign export sales by the year 2000."<p>

The Governor asked that the Illinois Coal Development Board act quickly to approve the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign.  The board reviews and approves all coal research, development and demonstration projects, as well as all expenditures from the Coal Technology Development and Assistance Fund and the Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund.<p>

Governor Announces Grant to Boost Economic Development in Red Bud
</h3>

<strong>RED BUD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $500,000 grant that will aid a business development in Red Bud, creating at least 15 new jobs and retaining more than 50.<p>  

"Red Bud is poised for economic growth," the Governor said.  "This Community Development Assistance Program grant is expected to help the city retain one of its most important employers and create exciting opportunities for new businesses to locate in Red Bud." <p>

The $500,000 grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will go to the City of Red Bud.  The city will loan the money to TPC Properties, L.L.C., to purchase the building that houses Total Process Corp., a manufacturer of structural steel, piping and electrical components.  Two Red Bud banks will lend TPC Properties $1.3 million to complete the purchase.  The city of Red Bud will loan TPC an additional $200,000 at no interest to renovate the building.<p>

After acquisition and improvements are completed, Total Process Corp. will sign a long-term lease with TPC Properties and other tenants will be actively recruited for remaining space in the building, now owned by Inter-City Products.<p>

"There is tremendous economic development potential in small communities throughout Illinois," Edgar said.  "My administration is committed to helping small towns and cities realize that potential."<p>

Red Bud Mayor Clement L. Esker said the project will renew optimism in the community's future.<p>

"Red Bud is turning around," Esker said.  "We appreciate the efforts of the Edgar administration to help put our community on the comeback trail.  Red Bud is ready to move on to a brighter future with new growth and job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, called the project an excellent example of public-private cooperation.<p>

"The Edgar administration is a partner in economic development with local governments and the private sector," Kustra said.  "All of us must work together to accomplish our common goal of improving the quality of life for citizens across Illinois."<p>

Governor Commends International Partnership that Resulted in Reopening Sparta Printing Plant
</h3>

<strong>SPARTA, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with community leaders, area residents and Mexican dignitaries in celebrating the re-opening of a printing plant that has employed thousands over the years in Sparta.<p>

"With the opening of Sparta International Printing Co. we congratulate a community and region that never lost hope despite the serious economic setback suffered early this year," the Governor said.  "We also pay tribute to our international partner in this endeavor, Grupa Serla of Mexico, which saw the wisdom in establishing a new printing firm here."<p>

Sparta International Printing Co. (SIPCO), a subsidiary of Grupa Serla, will employ 24 initially and as many as 200 within a year.  The printing plant formerly housed Spartan Printing Co. which went out of business in February after 47 years.  The shutdown put 850 employees out of work.<p>

SIPCO officials say they intend to hire as many dislocated Spartan workers as possible into the new jobs.<p>

The Governor joined other state officials, local leaders, plant workers, officials from Grupo Serla, and Mexico Consul Humberto Zamora-Trevino for the ceremony commemorating SIPCO's opening.<p>

Edgar commended the community for its efforts in finding a buyer for the idled plant.  "You never gave up," he said.  "My administration has bee there for you and, together with our friends at Grupa Serla, we got the job done."<p>

After the Spartan plant closed, the state made available $1 million in Job Training Partnership Act funds to help employees who lost their jobs.<p>

To help the new firm get started, the Edgar administration offered up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program funds for worker training.  The administration also provided $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program funds to the City of Sparta for infrastructure needs at the plant.<p>

"Things looked bleak last winter, but this opening represents a solid beginning on the long road back," Edgar said.  "We owe a lot to the opportunities presented by the NAFTA agreement in 1993.  NAFTA made the result we see here today possible.  We've heard concerns about jobs leaving the United States.  Here's the reality:  A Mexican firm reopens an Illinois plant, hires Illinois workers and looks forward to years of growth.  That's real progress."<p>

DCCA Sponsors Events to Celebrate Illinois Recycling Day
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is sponsoring events in West Peoria and Genoa to celebrate Illinois Recycling Day, October 1, 1996.<p>

"Illinois is proud of its many outstanding recycling programs," said DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  "Our efforts to reduce waste and encourage recycling in our homes, schools, offices and factories are increasingly successful, as these events demonstrate.  Illinois Recycling Day is another opportunity to highlight state programs aimed at producing a better environment for all Illinois citizens."<p>

In West Peoria, a ribbon cutting ceremony is scheduled to kick-off West Peoria's new curbside recycling program.  The City of West Peoria, Illinois' newest municipality, used an $18,000 DCCA grant to purchase recycling bins and to support the project's educational and promotional efforts.  The bi-weekly program will provide all residents of West Peoria the opportunity to recycle a full spectrum of recyclable commodities, including newspaper, plastics, glass and metals.<p>

In Genoa, a ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony is planned at Pace Mat, Inc., a scrap tire-derived material mat production facility.  Pace Mat received a $500,000 DCCA grant to purchase hydraulic presses, tool and die equipment and other related equipment to produce scrap tire-derived mats and mat type products, including gymnasium mats and noise reduction flooring.  Pace Mat has matched DCCA's grant with more than $1.2 million worth of related equipment, engineering and design work and cash.<p>

"The market for recycled products is growing," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Jim Edgar's senior advisor for economic development.  "State government will continue to work with the recycling industry to develop innovative new ways to meet consumer demand, and at the same time improve the environment for our citizens."<p>

As the lead agency charged with supporting waste reduction and recycling efforts in Illinois, DCCA administers a variety of waste management programs, including the Materials Recycling Grants Program, the Used Tire Recovery Program and School Recycling Grants Program.  For more information on recycling programs, call DCCA at 217/785-2800 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

Local Officials Urged to Attend Revolving Loan Fund Workshops
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Public officials, bankers, economic development professionals, revolving loan fund administrators and others involved in financing for economic growth are encouraged to attend one of a series of workshops on the management of a successful revolving loan fund system.<p>  

Effective use of revolving loan fund dollars is critical to stimulating job creation and retention in an era of limited financial resources for economic development.  The one-day workshops have been developed to assist administrators and community representatives in designing and administering a successful revolving loan portfolio at the local level.          
Topics to be covered include revolving loan fund design, credit analysis based on sound lending principles, loan closing and documentation, servicing the loan portfolio and tips on working with problem loans.<p>

The first workshop was held September 17 in Crystal Lake.  In addition, workshops are scheduled on October 9 in Effingham, October 23 in Peoria and November 6 in Carterville.<p>

Each of the workshops will cover the same agenda, with representatives from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association available to answer questions and discuss strategies.  DCCA and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association are sponsors of the workshops, in cooperation with Western Illinois University.<p>

Governor To Lead Trade Mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced he will lead a trade mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong in an effort to solidify relations and expand markets for Illinois firms.<p>

The Governor, First Lady Brenda Edgar and representatives from more than two dozen Illinois businesses, trade organizations and labor groups will meet with business and government leaders in the four countries.<p>

Becky Doyle, Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and Norman Sims, Executive Deputy Director of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, also will be among those accompanying the Governor.<p>

"This mission represents an excellent opportunity for Illinois firms -- large and small -- to explore new market opportunities," the Governor said.  "The countries we'll be visiting are particularly interested in Illinois products and technological assistance in a variety of industrial areas, including our state's number one industry, agriculture."<p>

In each country, the delegation will meet with industrial leaders whose firms have facilities or subsidiaries in Illinois, or who seek to expand trade with Illinois firms.<p>

The delegation leaves for Japan on September 15.  The Japan visit includes a tour and address on the campus of Southern Illinois University - Nakajo campus.  SIU President Ted Sanders will host the Governor's visit there.<p>

Edgar and the Governor of Niigata, Japan, are expected to reaffirm the Niigata-Illinois Educational and Economic Development Council agreement that was signed during the 1980s.  <p>

The slate of industrial meetings in Japan includes talks with leaders of Koito, parent company to Illinois-based North American Lighting, and of Mitsubishi Motors, which oversees several Illinois-based facilities.<p>

In South Korea, the Governor will meet with Prime Minister Soo Sung Lee, and with U.S. Ambassador James Laney.<p>

In South Korea, the mission also will meet with the chairman of Samsung, which recently announced a distribution center in Bolingbrook, and with the chairman of Lucky Goldstar, which owns controlling shares in Zenith Corporation, a Chicago-based firm.<p>

The trip to China includes meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and a Chinese vice premier.<p>

In China, the delegation's schedule includes visits with officials from Motorola, Deere & Co., and Ameritech.<p>

In Hong Kong, Edgar will meet with Gov. Chris Patten, and British Trade Commissioner Francis Cornish.<p>

The delegation also has meetings scheduled with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, and China Aerospace International Holdings.  Edgar also will witness the signing of an agreement between DCCA and the Hong Kong Metal Merchants Association.<p>

The delegation is scheduled to return to Illinois September 28.<p>

"We expect this trip, like our previous trade missions to Mexico, Europe and the Middle East, to broaden our export horizons, a long standing priority of our administration," Edgar said.<p>  

"We were pleased to be invited by leaders of each of the countries we'll be visiting.  As we improve our business relations abroad, Illinois' export industry should grow.  That means a stronger Illinois economy, and more good-paying jobs for Illinoisans right here at home."<p>

Edgar Administration Announces Grants to Aid Small Manufacturers in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- The Edgar administration announced today that a $2.67 million grant from the National Institute for Standards and Technology, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants, will enable the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center to expand and improve its technical assistance for small- and mid-sized manufacturers throughout Illinois.<p>
 
IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The grants mean greater access and more comprehensive support for all of the nearly 9,700 small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area that are not currently served by the federal government.  The federal grants supplement existing state programs that serve all 24,000 industrial firms in Illinois.<p>

"The manufacturing sector in Illinois is of critical importance to the future of the state's economy," said Dennis Whetstone, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, which will provide $600,000 of the state's commitment.  "At the same time, small and medium-sized manufacturers employ large numbers of Illinois workers.  By providing greater support for this crucial segment of our manufacturing base, we will both improve the state's economy and increase the number of good jobs available to Illinois workers."<p>

"The state of Illinois with support form NIST, has invested for more than three years in developing the state's manufacturing service system," said Bob Weinstein, interim executive director for IMEC.  "These investments and the grants announced today will let IMEC be established as an independent, not-for-profit corporation to provide substantive assistance to Illinois manufacturers."<p>

The $2.67 million NIST grant, through the U.S. Department of Commerce, can be awarded annually for up to six years.<p>

The balance of the $1.2 million commitment from the Edgar administration comes through the Illinois Board of Higher Education.  The center also gets about $200,000 in cash grants and fees from private firms, along with about $1.3 million through in-kind contributions from private firms.<p>

The total $2.7 million in state and local support represents the matching funds needed to qualify the center for the $2.67 million federal grant announced today.<p>

The president of the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Sally Jackson, applauded the public-private partnership that resulted in the center's expansion.  "I commend Governor Edgar for his strong leadership in forging innovative public-private alliances that will assure continued economic expansion in Illinois," Jackson said.<p>

Bradley University President John Brazil commended the cooperative effort among Illinois businesses, institutions of higher education and the state and federal governments that led to the establishment of IMEC.  "Bradley is proud to have been able to play a facilitating role in the creation of the IMEC," Brazil said.  "We are committed to the success of IMEC and pledge our full cooperation and continuing support for the fulfillment of its mission."<p>

IMEC will be based in Peoria, with sub-centers on the campuses of Bradley University in Peoria, Rock Valley College in Rockford, and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  Field extension offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, and Edwardsville.<p>

The federal grant announced today doubles the center's annual budget.  It will help the center expand its offerings in existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  Areas under consideration for the new offices include Champaign-Urbana, Decatur, Effingham and Quincy.<p>

The expansion means that more than 80 percent of the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers outside the Chicago area will be within 40 miles of an IMEC office.<p>

"In the first year, we expect to reach at least 1,000 manufacturers in providing some level of service," Weinstein said.  "We expect to link with all the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers at some point.<p>

"Being part of the national network with NIST allows us to meet the specific needs of our area's smaller manufacturers while leveraging national resources that previously had not been available to us.  In addition to these national resources, the establishment of IMEC brings together a partnership of Illinois higher education institutions, research laboratories, business assistance centers, employer and trade associations and private sector companies who are committed to the continued growth and vitality of Illinois manufacturing," Weinstein said.<p>

Edgar Statement about State & Federal Grants for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Centers
</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar issued the following statement about the state and federal grants announced today for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center:<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger.<p>

"Only a diverse and supportive economic climate for small businesses can create the good-paying manufacturing jobs Illinoisans need and want.<p>

"This first-year federal grant for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center, coupled with the Edgar administration's financial support over the past few years, means our state's small- and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

"The establishment of the center as an independent, not-for-profit corporation, and its planned expansion to better serve companies across the state shows the positive impact of public/private partnerships as we in Illinois continue to lead in our efforts to foster innovative, cost-effective ways to help Illinois businesses improve."<p>

Governor Visits Excel Railcar; Notes NAFTA's Benefits to Company
</h3>

<strong>KENNEY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today commended Excel Railcar Corporation on its success in promoting trade between Illinois and Mexico.  The company, one of the fastest-growing Hispanic companies in the U.S., has been a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).<p>

On a tour of the firm's plant in Kenney today, the Governor also announced new agreements the firm has signed, which will enable Excel to begin exporting Illinois grain and grain products to Mexico next year.<p>

"In supporting passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we were convinced that the agreement would be important, not just for large exporters, but also for small businesses like Excel Railcar Corporation," the Governor said.  "Excel's experience has shown that our convictions were right on target.  The company is one of our state's most enthusiastic partners as we promote trade between Illinois and Mexico. <p>

"Illinois offers a wide range of personalized assistance to help companies develop their export potential.  From one-on-one assistance through our network of International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, to participation in trade and catalog shows and trade missions coordinated through our International Business Division and its foreign offices, Illinois is linking businesses with the resources they need to become successful in the global marketplace."<p>
 
Eugene Constance, President of Excel Railcar Corporation, often serves as a consultant to other small businesses entering the Mexican marketplace.  Constance said the state has been instrumental in helping his company broaden trade relationships. 	<p>

"I had the privilege of attending a trade mission to Mexico with Governor Edgar in March," he said.  "The contacts I made during that trade mission have already resulted in inquiries from Mexican companies and other U.S. firms, particularly Illinois firms, that have an interest in exporting to Mexico.  The state's trade office in Mexico City also has been extremely helpful.  Its director, Raymundo Flores, truly has a finger on the pulse of the business climate in Mexico."<p>

Excel Railcar Corporation, headquartered in Naperville, was founded in 1980 to provide railcars on full-service leases for the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets.  Since then, the company has leased more than 1,500 new and refurbished railcars to companies using them for international service between the U.S. and Mexico.  Its Mexican customers include Cemex (cement), Vitro (glass) and Apasco (cement).  Excel this year also entered the U.S. railcar leasing market.  <p>

Growth led Excel to reactivate its railcar repair facility at Kenney in 1995, enabling the company to refurbish and repair its own fleet and other railcars.  The Kenney plant employs seven and expects to expand to 15 employees in late 1997.  Excel also employs 14 at its Mexico City subsidiary.<p>

Zenith to Expand in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined Peter S. Willmott, Chief Executive Officer and President of Zenith Electronics Corporation, in announcing the company's plan to build a $100 million state-of-the-art, picture tube manufacturing facility in Woodridge, creating about 280 full-time jobs.<p>

The company also will invest $80 million in its Melrose Park manufacturing facility to automate existing television picture tube production lines and to install a new line for computer display tubes (CDTs).  The expansion and modernization program is expected to create 120 new jobs in the Melrose Park plant, where the company currently employs more than 2,800 workers.<p>

"For nearly eight decades, Zenith has been an important member of the Illinois business community," the Governor said.  "In that time, the company has grown to be a worldwide electronics leader that employs more than 4,000 workers in Illinois.<p>

"Obviously, in choosing a location for this expansion, Zenith had many options, both in the U.S. and Mexico.  Its decision to expand in Illinois proves once again that our state has the skilled workers, excellent infrastructure and positive business climate needed by companies growing for the future."  <p>

Willmott commended state and local authorities on their assistance in making the firm's expansion plan possible.  "We at Zenith are proud of our reputation as an Illinois business leader, a reputation that no doubt will be enhanced by our new state-of-the-art operation in Woodridge," Willmott said.  "We appreciate the tremendous assistance from the State of Illinois, Will County and the village on this important Zenith competitiveness initiative."<p>

The new Woodridge facility will enable Zenith to add a new production line in Illinois to make 32- and 35-inch color picture tubes, and ultimately, wide-screen tubes for digital and high-definition television sets.  This, coupled with improvements in the company's Melrose Park plant, will help Zenith be more competitive.<p>

Both the Governor and Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, met with Zenith officials as the company considered locations.  Kustra said Illinois will provide job training assistance, road improvements and tax incentives to assist Zenith with the expansion.  <p>

"Our state is committed to helping businesses expand and grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "We have developed programs to build upon our excellent resources to ensure that Illinois remains the location of choice for tomorrow's business leaders."<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $600,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) grant funds over the next two years to assist the company in training its workers.  In addition, the Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT) will provide up to $429,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the cost of construction of an access road from Internationale Parkway in Woodridge to the new Zenith site.  The Village of Woodridge will also contribute to the road funding and will provide utility tax rebates to the company.  Will County and Valley View School District #365 also have granted property tax relief to Zenith.<p>

The new Woodridge facility will include 325,000 square-feet of floor area on a 70-acre site.  The Melrose Park plant is being expanded by 70,000 square-feet for the new CDT line.  The modernization program there also will include automating various          components of the existing picture tube manufacturing lines.<p>

Zenith Electronics Corporation employs more than 15,000 workers worldwide, including 4,000 in Illinois.  U.S. operations include the company's corporate headquarters and research center in Glenview, the Melrose Park color picture tube plant, and a printed circuit board fabrication plant in Chicago. <p>

Construction is expected to be completed in 1997.<p>

Breakfast Meetings Help Small Businesses Learn About Environmental Compliance, OSHA
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Environmental regulations, safety and health requirements, plus many other local, state and federal requirements, are often seen as burdensome to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  In an effort to help ease compliance and understanding, the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is teaming with the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) to host a series of regulatory compliance breakfasts in nine locations around the state.<p>

At the breakfast meetings, experts from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; Illinois State Fire Marshal's office; and DCCA's On-Site Health and Safety Consultation Program, Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and First Stop Business Information Center will discuss environmental compliance and OSHA's most frequently cited standards.  Topics include safety and health training, hazard identification, emergency preparation, the impact of the Clean Air Act amendments on small business, underground storage tank requirements for 1998, an update on the status of the LUST fund, and the new Brownfield legislation's impact on cleanup.<p>

After the presentations, participants will be able to discuss their concerns one-on-one with the regulatory experts.  These informal, confidential consultations will be for informational purposes only.  No punitive actions will be undertaken as a result of the consultations.<p>

The breakfast meetings will begin at 7:30 a.m. and conclude at noon.  Cost to attend is $25.00 per person and  pre-registration is suggested.  To register, or for further information, contact Dave Voepel of the NFIB at 217/523-5471 or Annette Lingleo of DCCA at 800/252-3998 (TDD users call 800/785-6055). <p>

DCCA Welcomes State Fair Visitors to the Ethanol Exposition
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) invites fairgoers to visit the Fifth Annual Ethanol Expo and register for a chance to win a John Deere Gator all-terrain vehicle provided by the Illinois Corn Growers' Association, CIBA and Brownfield Network.<p>

The Ethanol Expo will provide fairgoers with free popcorn and ice water, courtesy of Archer Daniels Midland Corporation; Growmark, Inc.; the Illinois Corn Growers' Association; DCCA; the Illinois Department of Agriculture; Midwest Grain Products, Inc.; and Pekin Energy Company.<p>

"Illinois is the leading producer of ethanol fuel in the country," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "This exhibit gives visitors a chance to learn more about this clean alternative fuel, and our aggressive promotion and demonstration programs."<p>

Fairgoers can take a break from the heat by sitting in the comfort of the air-conditioned "Corn Bus," one of the 14 ethanol-powered buses currently operating in Peoria.  The Greater Peoria Mass Transit Authority is the first in the nation to use ethanol-fueled buses for transportation.  The Corn Bus operates on 93 percent ethanol and is painted to resemble an ear of corn, serving as a moving reminder of the benefits of ethanol fuel.<p>

Friday August 16, the Expo will feature Ford Motor Company.  On display will be the 1996 flexible-fueled ethanol-powered Ford Taurus.  In addition to the Taurus, the Expo will also feature Ford's recycling display and one of its flexible-fuel vehicle engines.  Ford Motor Company is one of the leading manufacturers using recycled materials in the production of its vehicles.  The Expo also will feature the pre-production E-85 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and several E-85 Chevrolet Lumina autos.<p>

The Ethanol Exposition is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily throughout the 1996 Illinois State Fair, August 9-18.<p>

GRANTS AVAILABLE TO ENCOURAGE YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM IN ILLINOIS
</h3>




<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</STRONG> -- Not-for-profit organizations may receive financial assistance to help them create opportunities for young people to assist with community service work, under a grant program being administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

The Learn and Serve Program grants, awarded to DCCA through the Corporation for National Service, encourage youths to volunteer their services, while helping to improve a community's public safety and increasing young peoples' knowledge of health and wellness issues.<P>

DCCA has received $64,792 to fund the grants, which will pay for activities conducted during the fall and winter months.       "Volunteers are the foundations of our communities," said Dennis R. Whetstone, DCCA Director.  "Service learning programs like this one link academic learning with volunteer community service.  In doing so, we help to instill in our young people an understanding and appreciation of their communities and help them increase their self-esteem and develop the skills they need to become future leaders."<P>

Not-for-profit (IRS 501(c)(3)) organizations are eligible to apply for the grants.  Eligible applicants must partner with a school (K-12) and a for-profit business to ensure community-wide support.  Selected programs are expected to meet a community need by raising safety awareness, decreasing the opportunity for criminal activity, or increasing the knowledge and participation in health and wellness activities in the community.  <P>

The average grant award will range from $2,000 to $7,000.  Eligible applicants must provide a cash or in-kind match of 10 percent.<P>

Applications are due August 30, 1996.  Programs will operate between October 1, 1996 and March 15, 1997.<P>

To apply, or for further information, contact the Illinois Commission on Community Service at DCCA, James R. Thompson Center, 100 W. Randolph St., Suite 3-400, Chicago, IL 60601, phone 800/592-9896 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION GRANT FOR DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
</h3>





<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $3 million grant to help offset the City of Chicago's expenses for hosting the 1996 Democratic National Convention, bringing the state's total contribution to the event to nearly $7 million. <P>

"Illinois is fortunate to have an opportunity later this month to showcase our State and the City of Chicago to the world," the Governor said.  "It should be a major boost for the local economy, as well with the 35,000 visitors we expect producing $360 million in economic benefits.   <P>

"Our investment in helping the city put on a premier event will pay immediate dividends as the convention takes place.  In the future, tourism should increase because of heightened interest in Chicago and Illinois as travel destinations."<P>

The $3 million grant to the City of Chicago was awarded through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.  <P>

In addition to the fiscal year 1997 grant announced today, the City of Chicago received $2.75 million in fiscal year 1996 and $1.2 million in fiscal year 1995 for convention activities and planning.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant program is designed to help attract national and international events to Illinois. <P>

"Tourism is a $16 billion industry in Illinois," Kustra said.  "To help keep those numbers growing, this supports public/private partnerships that are key to bringing major conferences, conventions and sporting events to our communities."<P>

The private sector grant program, funded entirely by taxes generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for tourism promotion.  Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment.<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES CREATION OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL
</h3>

<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the creation of the Illinois Small Business 100, a council of small business owners who reflect the unique diversity of the 617,000 small businesses in Illinois.<P>

"Small businesses are the backbone of the state's economy," the Governor said.  "They play vital roles as job creators, employing millions of Illinois citizens, and they provide tremendous opportunities for those who have the determination to work hard and succeed.  And we are seeing some of the most dramatic growth in small businesses owned by women and minorities.	<P>

"Through this council, my administration is forging an even stronger relationship with small business--one that is designed to foster a better understanding of the ongoing issues and challenges facing this important segment of our economy.  We will work together to promote business growth and expansion in a low-tax, common-sense climate that does not choke economic growth."   <P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the small business council will have the ability to communicate the most pressing concerns of small business directly to state government.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will develop a site on the World Wide Web for the council that will include links to the members' E-mail, business pages, chambers of commerce and trade organizations," Kustra said.  "Members will be regularly polled on regulatory and small business issues, creating a sounding board for sound economic development policies."<P>

In conjunction with announcing the creation of the council,  the Governor also today presented the first Governor's Illinois Business Leadership award to Campagna Turano Bakeries, Inc. of Berwyn.  <P>

In the nearly half century since it was founded, Turano has grown from a small family business into a nationally known company, servicing accounts ranging from fast food outlets to fine dining establishments and from small neighborhood grocery stores to the largest supermarket chains.<P>

ALCOA CHOOSES DANVILLE FOR NEW PLANT SITE
</h3>





<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Alcoa on the company's decision to invest $48 million in a 165,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Danville, initially creating 35 new jobs with the potential for further growth.<P>

"Illinois is beating the competition for new industry," the Governor said.  "Alcoa reviewed more than 100 sites in five Midwestern states before making a final decision, and we are delighted that this facility is coming to Danville.  Our commitment to providing a skilled workforce and maintaining a high quality of life in our communities played key roles in Alcoa's choice of location."<P>

Alcoa's Aerospace/Commercial Rolled Products Division has purchased nearly 96 acres of land south of I-74 in Danville's Southgate Industrial Park.  The facility will house an automotive aluminum sheet finishing operation and feature state-of-the-art technology and equipment.<P>

Tim Wilkinson, Vice President of the Division, indicated that a site search had been underway since May.<P>

"Our need was for speed and Danville is a community with a vision and the strategies to meet our needs," Wilkinson said.  "The educational facilities are exactly what we need and there is a strong sense of family values here.  Danville is clearly the number one place to build a facility in the Midwest."<P>

Danville Mayor Robert E. Jones and Vicki Stewart, President of the Danville Area Economic Development Council, praised the team effort that brought the facility to Danville.<P>

"Funding and timely completion of all infrastructure to the site was of vital importance to this project," said Stewart.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide funding totaling nearly $1 million for road, sewer and water line development.  DCCA also has committed to provide up to $70,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds for worker training at the new facility.<P>

Alcoa's expansion is prompted by expected growth in the North American automotive market.  The Danville facility will provide just-in-time delivery to customers in the U.S. and Canada.  <P>

A groundbreaking for the facility is planned later this fall.<P>

WEBER TO EXPAND IN ILLINOIS, CREATE 225 JOBS
</h3>





<STRONG>HUNTLEY, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Palatine-based Weber-Stephen Products Company will invest up to $14 million to build a 300,000 square-foot manufacturing and distribution facility for its barbeque grills, creating 225 jobs and significantly expanding the company's presence in Illinois.<P>

"Illinois continues on a record-setting pace for business expansions and relocations," the Governor said.  "Weber is the most recent company to recognize that our friendly business climate, sophisticated transportation system and support of worker training are excellent reasons to stay and grow in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, unveiled the project at ceremonies in Huntley.<P>

"We weekend barbecue experts look for the best grills for our backyards.  When Weber looked around for the best place to expand, Weber found it right in its own backyard.  Today's announcement is a tribute to the strength and productivity of the Illinois workforce," Kustra said.<P>

"We are delighted to be expanding our operations into Huntley and look forward to a long relationship with the village of Huntley," said Jim Stephen, President of Weber-Stephen Products Company.  "We are thankful to the State of Illinois for its assistance."<P>

Huntley Village President Jim Dhamer commended the cooperation of state and local officials in putting the project together.  "Everyone involved in bringing this facility to Huntley put in long hours and showed tremendous determination.  I am thrilled that the Weber-Stephens project will soon become a reality."<P>

In conjunction with The Prime Group, Inc., Weber will build a combined manufacturing facility and Midwest/international distribution facility on the 33-acre site, located two miles north of the Northwest Tollway and Illinois Route 47 in Huntley.  Construction will begin this month with completion of the buildings expected in the second quarter of 1997.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide a $287,500 Industrial Training Program grant for worker training at the new facility.  In addition, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide $530,000 for improvements to Illinois Route 47 and construction of Oak Creek Parkway from Rt. 47 to the site.<P>

George Stephen invented Weber Kettle in the late 1950s.  Now headquartered in Palatine, Weber-Stephen manufactures charcoal and gas grills and accessories that are internationally distributed.<P>

<H3 align=center>GOVERNOR AWARDS GRANTS TO ASSIST HOMELESS ILLINOISANS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced nearly $1.7 million in grants to assist 50 not-for-profit organizations in 34 communities in providing emergency assistance to homeless people.<P>

"Homelessness is a tragedy that exists in both urban and rural areas," the Governor said.  "We are fortunate to have a number of excellent organizations that provide homeless people with both temporary shelter and services that can help them become self-sufficient.  These grants will help many of the organizations continue to provide these valuable services."<P>

A Hillsboro project is an example.  A Salvation Army survey of agencies and law enforcement officials in Montgomery County found nearly 275 cases of domestic violence had been reported, and more than 300 orders of protection filed during 1995.  The closest available shelter for victims of domestic violence is more than 50 miles away.  The Salvation Army will receive a $73,799 grant to assist in renovating the second floor of its building in Hillsboro to serve as a shelter facility for victims of domestic violence.	<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants were awarded through the Emergency Shelter Grants Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"Without these grants, many facilities would find it difficult to provide services," Kustra said.  "The grants not only help with essential operating costs, but also help underwrite some of the expenses for food, transportation and medicine, as well as programs designed to help homeless people identify and address their problems."<P>

Federally-funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program provides funding for projects that help homeless people in communities outside Cook County.  Grants are awarded on a competitive basis to projects that demonstrate clear need, an immediate ability to utilize the grant, and complement existing homeless shelter activities.  The maximum grant is $75,000 and must be matched by an equal amount from other sources.<P>

A list of grantees is attached.<P>

<H3 align=center>GRANTS HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
REMOVE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. </STRONG>-- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $1 million to help 15 Illinois communities renovate public buildings to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.<P>

"Many small communities face financial hardships in renovating public buildings to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act," the Governor said.  "These grants provide local governments with the funds they need to proceed with the necessary renovations.  We want to ensure that regardless of their disabilities, all citizens may access public services."<P>

The grants are made available through the Removal of Architectural Barriers component of the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  <P>

Projects to renovate the Tuscola Public Library and the Joy Village Hall are examples.  <P>

Tuscola's library was built in 1903 with funds from the Carnegie Foundation.  The historic building is a two-story structure accessible only by stairs, with floors connected by narrow, steep stairways.  The City of Tuscola will receive a $145,000 CDAP grant to assist with the costs of installing an elevator, accessible restrooms, and constructing an accessible parking area.  <P>

Joy's village hall is the location for village board meetings and is the office of the village clerk and president, police department, and maintenance superintendent.  Citizens also pay village utility bills in the building.  The village will receive a $15,000 CDAP grant to install an entrance ramp and handrails, renovate the restroom to make it accessible, and install accessible parking.<P>

"CDAP grants are one of Illinois' most important tools to help small communities meet the needs of their citizens," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "This component was developed to ensure that even in small communities, public buildings comply with the provisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act."<P>

The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Applications for ADA grant funding were awarded following a competitive review that looked at a community's justification of project need, financial need, and eligibility of the activities outlined in the project implementation plans. <P>

Funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), CDAP grants are awarded by DCCA to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under this component is $150,000.  <P>	

A list of communities receiving CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants is attached.<P>

<H3 align=center>OUTDOOR RECREATION SUPER STORE EXPECTED TO BOOST ILLINOIS TOURISM</H3>

<STRONG>GURNEE, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World on the company's decision to build a 125,000 square foot super store featuring shopping and entertainment facilities at Gurnee Mills Mall.<P>

"Tourism is an important industry in this state and contributes nearly $16 billion to the Illinois economy every year," the Governor said.  "Gurnee Mills Mall has quickly become a leading travel destination, and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will lend new appeal for those who enjoy the abundant natural resources of Illinois and the entire Upper Midwest.<P>

"My administration and Bass Pro Shops also share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation.  Since 1991, we have significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling, and acquired and begun the development of site M in central Illinois, at more than 15,000 acres the largest property for outdoor recreation owned by the state.  Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a perfect match."<P>

In addition to separate departments for activities such as fishing, hunting and camping, the store will feature such attractions as a four-story natural stone waterfall and a rough-hewn log cabin with a turning waterwheel and stocked trout pond.<P>

The store will be the company's third in the nation and first in the Upper Midwest.  It is expected to open next spring and will employ about 300 workers.<P>

My administration and Bass Pro Shops share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation," Edgar said.  "Since 1991, the state has significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling.  In addition, we have acquired and begun the development of more than 15,000 acres of site M in central Illinois, the largest property for outdoor recreation and nature presenvation owned by the state.<P>

"Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a good match because we understand the importance of preserving open space and recreation opportunities for future generations," the Governor said.<P>

The Gurnee Mills Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will be modeled after the company's flagship store in Springfield, MO, ranked as Missouri's number one tourist attraction with more than four million visitors annually.  Bass Pro also supports numerous conservation efforts at the state and national levels. 	<P>

John L. "Johnny" Morris, President of Bass Pro Shops, said the company conducted an  extensive search of the Chicago and Milwaukee markets and chose Gurnee Mills as the best possible location for the new store.<P>

"There are significant numbers of fishing, hunting and outdoor enthusiasts in these markets, and we look forward to providing them with a great retail experience," Morris said.<P>

Laurence C. Siegel, Chairman and CEO of the Mills Corporation, said, "Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will be a great addition to Gurnee Mills.  It's a terrific blend of entertainment and shopping, with a great commitment to customer service."<P>
  
Developed in 1991 by the Mills Corporation of Washington, D.C., Gurnee Mills Mall is the Midwest's largest enclosed discount/outlet center, combining manufacturer's outlets, department store outlets, specialty store outlets and value discount retailers.<P>

Governor Announces $1.3 Million in State Recycling Program Grants
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced more than $1.3 million in grants to help Illinois communities, businesses and organizations expand or establish recycling programs.<p>

"Recycling is an important part of our effort to promote a clean environment," the Governor said.  "These grants will help us reduce our reliance on landfills by encouraging the collection and processing of recyclable commodities and supporting the practice of recycling in the home and workplace."<p>

The grants provide capital needed to improve and expand recycling services to Illinois consumers.<p>

Administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), the grants will fund 30 projects, including residential recycling projects such as curbside and multi-family collection programs, commercial programs for business, health care, educational and recreational facilities, and primary processing facilities.<p>

Grants are awarded competitively and may total no more than 50 percent of a project's cost.  Individuals may receive up to $50,000 for a residential or commercial project, while primary processing facilities may receive up to $100,000.  An amount equal to 10 percent of the money awarded must be used to purchase products containing recycled materials.<p>

DCCA's recycling programs are funded through the Solid Waste Management Fund.  Revenues in the fund are generated by a surcharge on the tipping fee on landfill disposal and are earmarked specifically for the programs. <p> 

Since the recycling grants program began in 1987, more than $12 million in state grants has been awarded to 316 recycling projects -- projects which have attracted more than $52 million in matching funds.  The 30 new projects are expected to attract more than $12.5 million in matching funds.<p>

Governor Announces Grant to Help Displaced Coal Miners
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the U.S. Department of Labor has approved his request for $5.7 million in federal job training assistance to help more than 400 workers dislocated by the closings of five Southern Illinois coal mines.<p>

"Although we agree that a clean environment is important, the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have had a devastating effect on the Illinois coal industry," Edgar said.  "We are working diligently to find new markets and explore clean coal technologies that will enable us to regain our market share.  In the meantime, we must ensure that miners who have lost their jobs can receive the training and other services they need to continue to be productive workers."<p>

The $5,755,360 grant was approved by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and was allocated from Clean Air-related national reserve funds under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  <p>

The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 416 miners dislocated from the Zeigler Coal Company's Old Ben Mine #24 near Benton and #26 near Sesser, Arch of Illinois' Captain Mine in Percy, Freeman United Coal Company's Orient Mine #6 in Waltonville, and Consolidated Coal Company's Rend Lake Mine near Sesser.<p>  

Job skill assessment, career counseling, job search assistance, relocation assistance, vocational/occupational skills training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance will be available to dislocated workers.  Because the dislocation was related to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, eligible workers also will receive needs-related payments.  <p>

These payments enable dislocated workers enrolled in training or education programs who have exhausted their unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to continue receiving an amount approximately equal to the UI benefit or the poverty level, whichever is higher.<p>

Training will be administered through the Management, Training and Consulting Corporation (MAN-TRA-CON) Service Delivery Area #25 in Zeigler.<p>

Grant to Help Displaced AATCOM Workers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois will work with the State of Missouri to administer a $5.85 million federal grant intended to provide job training and assistance to workers dislocated by the closing of the Army Aviation and Troop Command facility in St. Louis.<p>

"Last year, when the Department of Defense issued its recomendations for base closures, we successful argued the case for keeping several Illinois military facilities open, including Scott Air Force Base and the Rock Island Arsenal," the Governor said.  "Because approximately 800 of the 4,200 workers employed at the AATCOM facility were Illinois workers, we also teamed with the State of Missouri to try to keep that facility open, to no avail.  Now we must do all we can to help the workers being dislocated to find new employment.  <p>

"Illinois officials worked closely with their Missouri counterparts to pursue federal assistance for the workers who will lose their jobs as a result of this closing.  This grant ensures that these workers will be able to access the services they need to find new, productive employment."<p>

Edgar was notified of the grant's approval by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  Funds were allocated from Title III Defense Conversion Program funds under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 workers who do not transfer to other defense installations or retire.<p>  

Under terms of the grant agreement, the State of Missouri will receive the grant, and will contract with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to provide services to the Illinois workers affected by the closing.  <p>

Services to be provided include assessment of job skills, career counseling, job search assistance, job development and placement, classroom training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance. <p>

Because the dislocation was related to a base closing, workers can be eligible for assistance up to 24 months prior to the closure date.<p>

Training will be administered through Madison County Employment and Training Department (Service Delivery Area 22) and the St. Clair County Intergovernmental Grants Department (Service Delivery Area 24). <p>

Closure of the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command in St. Louis is slated for completion by December 15, 1997.<p>

Governor Approves Sales Tax Break for Oil Drilling, Exploration Equipment
</h3>

<strong>MT. VERNON, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation eliminating the sales tax on equipment costing less than $250 used for oil field exploration, drilling and production. <p> 
 
"This legislation will save companies involved in Illinois oil-drilling about $1 million a year, giving them new funds to maintain and expand their investments in Illinois," the Governor said.  "It gives this industry the same tax benefits other industries in Illinois already enjoy."<p>

The legislation, similar to a bill the Governor signed on Monday for the coal industry, eliminates the sales tax on equipment in the oil exploration industry costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

Chief sponsors of the measure, House Bill 2703, were Reps. John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon), Terry Deering (D-DuBois), Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Ron Stephens (R-Troy), Gwenn Klingler (R-Springfield) and Thomas Holbrook (D-Belleville) and Sens. Harry "Babe" Woodyard (R-Chrisman) and William O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon).<p>

It is effective immediately.<p>

Edgar Signs Kustra-Backed Coal Legislation; Measure Provides Tax Relief
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today lauded Governor Jim Edgar for signing into law coal legislation granting tax fairness and relief to Illinois' coal producers.<p>

The legislation is a product of Kustra's "Coal Strategy Group" formed in 1995 to identify ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal.  The group is comprised of leaders of the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies.<p>

"Our coal producers and miners are doing their best to meet the current challenges of today's marketplace," said Kustra.  "The tax savings will help to make the cost of Illinois coal more competitive with Western coal and encourage coal producers to invest in new equipment."<p>

The legislation signed by the Governor removes a current 6.25 percent tax on purchases of coal mining equipment and spare parts valued at less than $250.  Kustra noted that similar thresholds on the purchase of farm and manufacturing equipment were removed by the legislature in the 1980s.<p>  

"Today we are extending the same tax fairness enjoyed by other Illinois industries to coal.  I am grateful to Governor Edgar, the legislature and members of the Coal Strategy Group for making today's signing a reality," said Kustra.  "The elimination of this use tax is the first of many recommendations the strategy group will make as we look to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and work to ensure its positive impact on our local communities."<p>

Kustra also commended the legislation's chief sponsors, Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) and Representative Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro) for securing legislative passage of the measure.<p>

Governor Signs Tax Relief Bill for Illinois Coal Industry
</h3>

     <strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation saving Illinois coal producers about $2.5 million a year by eliminating the remaining sales tax on coal mining equipment and spare machinery parts.<p>

     "The coal industry in Illinois continues to face some very tough challenges," the Governor said.  "This legislation gives our coal producers the same tax benefits other industries already enjoy, and these tax savings will free up capital resources for maintenance, investment and potential expansion."<p>

     The legislation, developed by a coal task force organized by Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, eliminates the sales tax on coal mining equipment costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

     "This legislation is good for Illinois coal miners, it is good for Southern Illinois, and it is good for Illinois as a whole," Edgar said.<p>

     Edgar noted the Illinois coal industry has annual sales of about $1.5 billion and employs more than 6,600 workers in the state.  Another 20,000 jobs are supported by the coal industry.<p>

     "Today's bill signing is the best example of the good that comes when industry, labor and government work together to keep our workers and industries competitive," Kustra said.  "I am grateful to Gov. Edgar, the legislature and members of the coal strategy group for making this a reality."<p>

     Chief sponsors of the legislation, Senate Bill 1361, were Sens. Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville), Bill O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon), and Jim Rea (D-Christopher) and Reps. Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Bill Black (R-Danville), Terry Deering (D-Nashville), John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon) and Ron Stephens (R-Troy).<p>

     It is effective immediately.<p>

State to Assist Mine Workers Affected by CIPS Fuel Switch
</h3>

     <strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) to move immediately to assist workers affected by Central Illinois Public Service Co.'s plan to cease taking delivery of high-sulfur coal from the Delta mine near Harrisburg.<p>

     "Our response to this announcement is already underway," the Governor said.  "State government agencies will coordinate efforts to begin providing unemployment and job training assistance to the Delta mine workers, and we have applied for federal assistance under provisions of the Clean Air Act.<p>

     "While we applaud CIPS's effort to lower customers' utility costs, we are disappointed that it comes at the expense of Illinois mine workers and their families.  My administration is committed to finding new markets and exploring new technology that will shape a brighter future for the Illinois coal industry."<p>

     CIPS announced today that it will switch to burning out-of-state coal at its Newton Power Station Unit 1 in Jasper County.  CIPS had purchased 1.3 to 1.5 million tons of coal annually from the Delta mine of Amax Coal Co., a Cyprus Amax Minerals company.<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, explained that once the displaced workers are identified, DCCA will deploy a Rapid Response Team to visit the Delta mine and conduct pre-layoff meetings.<p>

     "Services provided to Delta workers will include assessments of job related skills, job development, search and placement, and supportive services such as child care and transportation allowances," Kustra said.  "Workers will also have access to classroom and vocational training, and IDES will make staff available for on-site filing of unemployment claims."<p>

Governor Congratulates Illinois Company for Largest Stamping Press Built in North America
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL. </strong>- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulaed Chicago-based Allied Products Corporation on the production of the largest automotive production presses ever built in North America, an order that added 100 jobs to the company's payroll.<p>

Three of the giant "A"-sized presses will be manufactured by Allied's Verson Division on Chicago's southeast side, two for shipment to a Chrysler production plant in Mexico and the third for use at Chrysler's Belvidere plant in northern Illinois.<p>

"The critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement argued it would cause the United States to export jobs across the border," the Governor said.  "Today is proof that NAFTA is creating good jobs for Illinois workers.  We are producing the goods that are necessary to produce goods throughout the world."<p>

"Illinois is an international powerhouse in the production of industrial machinery," Edgar said.  "Allied has made a tremendous contribution to our global reputation by being the first North American manufacturer of the "A"-size press, the largest machine tool made."<p>

Stamping presses make parts, such as fenders and hoods, from flat sheets of metal, usually steel.  The size and weight of 12 railroad locomotives, the presses are used primarily to make large body parts for automobiles and trucks.<p>

"We are also proud that Chrysler plans to use one of these presses at the Belvidere plant right here in Illinois and that two Illinois-made presses will be shipped to Mexico," Edgar said.   "This is a significant example of how the lowering of trade bariers is creating economic opportunity for Illinois companies and their workers."<p>

In 1995, the export of industrial machinery by Illinois companies reached $8.3 billion dollars, a 15 percent increase over 1994.<p>

Allied Products CEO Richard A. Drexler said the quality of the Illinois workforce has been a leading factor in the company's success.<p>

"Allied Products has been headquartered in Illinois for more than 30 years," Drexler said.  "The superb teamwork of our employees and our suppliers, coupled with the support of state and local governments, has enabled us to attain this milestone."<p>

The Verson Division of Allied Products Corporation is the only remaining American-owned-and-operated builder of heavy metal-forming presses.  Approximately 650 people are employed at the company's Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility.<p>

Hometown Awards Honor Contributions of Local Volunteers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Gov. Jim Edgar tonight congratulated winners in the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards, which recognize volunteer efforts that better the quality of life in Illinois communities.<p>

"Illinoisans have a strong sense of community," the Governor said.  "If there is a problem to be solved, or work to be done, we accept the challenge of changing things for the better.  Even the simplest project can make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens. The volunteers honored with these awards have planted gardens, tutored students, sponsored plays and festivals, and built libraries, shelters and police stations.  They are an inspiration to us all, and this is our opportunity to show our appreciation for their efforts."<p>

The Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy, was awarded to Woodford County for its "Heart House" project, selected as this year's project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism in Illinois.<p>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a homeless shelter in Woodford County.  Funded with donations, Heart House was opened in a former fraternity house near the Eureka College campus.<p>

When the fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  The result is a homeless shelter valued at more than twice its cost that provides needed services totally without tax support.<p>

In all, the Governor presented awards to 73 projects.  In addition, a special award was presented to Palos Hills, which has received an award every year since the program's inception.<p>

The Governor's Hometown Awards competition is administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

More than a hundred applications were submitted applications for this year's awards.  A group of volunteer judges reviewed the applications, judging them on the basis of local need and participation, continuity of the project and results.  The judges personally visited the communities they selected as finalists before making the final ranking decisions.<p>

Awards were presented in eight categories based on community participation.  Eligible projects involve economic development, community service, community facilities, human enrichment, achievements for or by youths and achievements for or by senior citizens.<p>

First place winners of general awards, youth awards, senior awards and economic development awards received commemorative plaques and road signs recognizing their achievements.  Second, third and fourth-place winners received plaques.<p>

Governor Announces Water and Sewer Planning Grants
</h3>

SPRINGFIELD, IL - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 26 communities throughout Illinois will share $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund planning activities for local water and sewer system improvements.<p>

"Adequate infrastructure is the foundation of community development," the Governor said.  "Improvements to local water and sewer systems enhance a ocmmunity's quality of life and its ability to attract and retain business.  These planning grants help local governments through the first stage of that improvement process."<p>

Edgar said a project in eastern Illinois is an example.<p>

Champaign County applied on behalf of the unincorporated area of Wilbur Heights for a sewer study.  The low-income neighborhood of approximately 80 homes is served by private septic systems, which are experiencing difficulties due to the soil type and small lot sizes.  Alternatives to the individual septic systems will be studied, including connection to existing treatment facilities in a neighboring city.<p>

Units of local goverment may apply ofr up to $25,000 for planning activities which will result in infrastructure improvements to water, sanitary or storm sewer systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said CDAP funds are especially important to smaller communities.<p>

"Infrastructure improvements are expensive," Kustra said.  "This program helps to remove the financial barriers a small community may face in upgrading their water and sewer systems."<p>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with population of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<p>

At least 51 percent of a proposed project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<p>

A list of communities receiving CDAP Planning Assistance is below.<p>

Governor Joins in Groundbreaking for $37.5 Million SuperValu Distribution Center
</h3>

     <strong>OGLESBY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined company and local officials in breaking ground for a $37.5 million Supervalu Inc. regional distribution center in Oglesby, serving a dozen states and creating more than 275 new jobs.<p>

     "This project is a terrific example of the economic development potential of Illinois' smaller communities," the Governor said.  "Our central location, high-quality transportation system and commitment to investing in infrastructure improvements continue to be major factors in attracting distribution centers and other facilities to Illinois. <p>

     "Supervalu expects to become the largest employer in the Oglesby area, with the likelihood of additional expansion.  State and local officials worked closely with this company to give Oglesby and the entire Illinois River Valley a significant economic boost."<p>

     Plans call for the 308,000 square-foot facility in LaSalle County to distribute more than 11,400 general merchandise and health and beauty care items to 1,500 stores in 12 states served by Minneapolis-based Supervalu, a leading food distribution company and the nation's 14th largest food retailer.<p>

     Jeff Noddle, President and Chief Operating Officer of Supervalu's wholesale food companies, said the new facility is an essential component in the company's plans for the future.  <p>

     "Supervalu's new multi-tiered distribution network will make major changes in the way food is distributed to our customers, and we believe ultimately this will have an effect on food distribution in this country," Noddle said.  "Today we celebrate the realization of many hours of hard work and much support from the State of Illinois, Oglesby Mayor Greg Cullinan, and many other representatives of Oglesby."<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the resources of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) were tapped to assist in the project.<p>

     "Our assistance with these infrastructure improvements was one of the key factors in bringing Oglesby and Supervalu together," Kustra said.  "Sanitary sewer, water main and roadway improvements are required to build and operate this facility."<p>

     DCCA will award the City of Oglesby a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to help fund the improvements.  <p>

     The Illinois Department of Transportation has committed $1.2 million in Economic Development Funds toward the cost of improving County Highway 23 and Mallick Road that will provide access to the Supervalu facility.<p>

     The roadwork includes intersection improvements at County Highway 23 and Mallick, new traffic signals and drainage work along Mallick Road.  In addition, a Tax Increment Financing District was created at the local level to facilitate the project.<p>

     The Midwest distribution center is the second of three Supervalu regional distribution facilities to be developed as part of the company's strategic reinvention, a multi-year process called ADVANTAGE from Supervalu.<p>

     Construction on the Oglesby site will begin immediately.  The company expects to begin shipping from the new facility in early 1998.<p>

</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today urged established Illinois exporters as well as companies considering marketing their products or services abroad to attend the second annual "Crossing International Borders" conference May 16 in Chicago.<p>

"Illinois exports are at an all-time high," the Governor said.  "Our efforts to provide export assistance to Illinois companies helped boost sales of Illinois products in the global marketplace to more than $32 billion in 1995, as increase of 23.6 percent.  This conference is part of my administration's commitment to continued export excellence and even greater success for Illinois business."<p>

Highlights of the conference include presentation of the 1996 Governor's Export Awards to outstanding Illinois exporters and the keynote luncheon speech by Casey Cowell, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of U.S. Robotics.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, will open the conference.<p>

"The international marketplace holds tremendous opportunities for Illinois companies," Kustra said.  "Whether a business is a new to exporting or a sophisticated global company, 'Crossing Illinois Borders' is designed to help them explore the potential for overseas investment and export growth."<p>

The conference is the result of a public/private partnership between the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and Arthur Andersen, the leading global accounting firm.<p>

Sessions will be led by experts in the international investment and exporting fields, including directors of the State of Illinois foreign offices, Arthur Andersen professionals and Illinois business executives.<p>

In addition, Illinois non-profit and government organizations, as well as companies providing services to Illinois exporters, will be available for consultation at the Illinois Export Forum, held in conjunction with the conference.<p>

Governor Joins in Opening of New Ameritech Cellular Services Facility
</h3>

<em>RANTOUL, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined in ceremonies marking the official opening of a $2 million Ameritech Cellular Services call center at the former Chanute Air Base in Rantoul that is expected to create as many as 200 new jobs.<p>

"This facility is another milestone in Chanute's economic comeback," the Governor said.  "Working as a team, we have made aggressive efforts at the state and local levels to market the redevelopment potentials of Chanute, and those efforts are being rewarded with the creation of new jobs.<p>

"Ameritech has also cited the quality of the workforce in the Rantoul area as one reason it chose to locate here.  I am delighted that a company with Ameritech's record of excellence in customer service has given central Illinois worker such a strong vote of confidence."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the opening of the Ameritech facility is another indicator of the healthy economic climate in Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech has recognized our efforts to make Illinois a great place to do business for their company, and for the increasing number of companies which rely on access to state-of-the-art communications technology," Kustra said.  "Our strong economy has helped companies such as Ameritech market their products to Illinois customers, which in turn has produced the need for expansion, and new job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Explosive growth in the number of cellular and paging customer s in central Illinois prompted Ameritech Cellular Services to search for a site for the call center.  Chanute's 90,000 square foot former weather training facility underwent extensive renovation to create the new center.<p>

"Rantoul is thrilled with Ameritech's investment at the Aviation Center," said Rantoul Mayor Katy Podagrosi.  "I hope that Ameritech Cellular continues its growth here and throughout the region."<p>

The center is expected to provide 150 jobs by the end of 1997, and eventually in expected to employ as many as 200 people.<p>

"Ameritech's growth and investment in Rantoul reflects the leadership of Gov. Edgar and the General Assembly in developing a fully open and competitive telecommunications marketplace," said Doug Whitley, president of Ameritech Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech commends that leadership and the investment that the state itself is making to help train our expanding work force in Rantoul."<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $210,000 in worker training funds through the Industrial Training Program (ITP).<p>

Responding to billing inquiries and fulfilling customer requests such as the addition of new cellular features are among the services to be provided by Ameritech paging and cellular associates.  Requests from central Illinois customer were previously routed to operations in Chicago.<p>

Lt. Governor Kustra Announces Production of Chrysler Neon for Overseas Markets
</h3>

<em>BELVIDERE, IL</em> - Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today joined Chrysler officials at the Belvidere Assembly Plant to unveil a new right-hand-driven Dodge and Plymouth Neon designed for export to overseas markets.<p>

"Consumers in the global marketplace have come to expect quality and value when they purchase products made in Illinois," said Kustra, who heads economic growth and job creation efforts in Illinois.  "With record-setting exports in 1995 of $32.6 billion, Illinois has become a leader in producing the goods and services in demand abroad.  I am confident the new Neon will be another example of the manufacturing excellence of our Illinois companies and workers."<p>

The Belvidere Chrysler facility will be able to produce approximately 90 right-hand-drive models daily, or 32,000 annually, for shipment to markets in eight counties: Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, Cyprus, Cayman Islands, and Thailand.<p>

Chrysler invested more than $500 million in the plant to produce the first Neon, which rolled off the Belvidere assembly line in November of 1993.  The company subsequently announced plans to invest an additional $20 million in capital improvements and add 300 jobs at the Belvidere facility.<p>

Kustra noted that the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has provided $5.9 million dollars in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds to ensure employees of the Belvidere plant have the necessary skills to work in state-of-the-art auto plant.<p>

"Chrysler made a tremendous commitment to Illinois when the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the Neon," Kustra said.  "Our commitment was to provide Chrysler workers with the hi-tech skills needed to build the best possible automobiles.  It was a win-win proposition, and we are seeing the results in this announcement."<p>

The Chrysler Belvidere plant currently employs 3,700 workers and produces approximately 267,000 Dodge and Plymouth Neons annually.<p>

"The addition of right-hand-drive Neons to Belvidere will add incremental units to our production, but it means more than that," said Belvidere Assembly Plant Manager John Felice.  "Our ability to produce left and right-hand drive vehicles on the same line affords us additional flexibility in terms of responding to the global marketplace." <p>

Governor Announces Buyer for Spartan Printing Plant
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that a Mexican company will invest $6 million in the purchase of the former Spartan Printing facility in Sparta, Illinois, creating 300 new jobs and ensuring the continued  economic health of the southern Illinois community.<p>

"This is great news for Sparta and southern Illinois," the Governor said.  "The closure of Spartan printing was a severe blow to this small community, but our determination to find a buyer for the facility and provide new job opportunities for the affected workers has paid off.<p>

"My administration has also recognized the importance of maintaining excellent economic relationships with our top trading partners, including Mexico.  I am pleased that those ties have contributed to creating more Illinois jobs."<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will invest $1 million in the purchase of the Spartan Printing facility.  The company will also invest a minimum of $5 million in the purchase of state-of-the-art printing equipment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will be eligible for up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Grupo Serla will be encouraged to make every effort to re-employ individuals previously employed at the Spartan Printing Company.  In addition, DCCA will provide a list of those employees to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. for consideration for re-employment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. is also eligible for up to $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) funds.  The funds would be granted to the City of Sparta, which in turn would loan the funds to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V.<p>

Spartan Printing shut down earlier this year, laying off more than 800 workers by early February.<p>

DCCA has received $1 million in federal emergency funding from the U.S. Department of Labor to assist dislocated workers in returning to the workforce.<p>

Governor Edgar directed his staff to become personally involved in the negotiations leading to the purchase of Spartan Printing, including traveling to Mexico City to conclude an agreement.<p>

Lt. Gov Awards Grants for Multi-Company Network Demonstration Project
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL </strong> --  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra has announced that multi-company network demonstration project grants have been awarded to the Center for Governmental Studies at Northern Illinois University and the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.<p>

"This initiative is designed to improve the competitiveness of Illinois' small, medium-sized and mature firms," said Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "In multi-company networks, firms join forces to accomplish what they cannot do on their own." <p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) administers the program.  DCCA Director Dennis R. Whetstone explained that two key types of assistance are emphasized in the projects.<p>  

"Network broker training will prepare individuals to act as leaders in establishing manufacturing networks," Whetstone said.  "The brokers will link manufacturing firms to each other in order to promote cooperation.<p>

"Network planning and development will provide for activities which increase the capacity of firms across the state to establish networks or better operate existing networks, which then link them to key markets or public sources of assistance." 	<p>

The Illinois Chamber will oversee the Southern Illinois Linkage Study Project, which will receive $85,000 to inventory, classify and analyze the existing products, manufacturing processes, inputs and outputs of the manufacturing sector in the southernmost 30 counties in Illinois.<p>  

"Assisting businesses in the Southern Illinois region is a major priority for the Illinois Chamber," said Sally A. Jackson, President and CEO of the Chamber.  "We commend the participants for taking this progressive step in economic development.  More business and job creation are our goals, and we are very happy to have a leadership role in this effort."<p>

The results of the inventory will be linked to DCCA's Industry Analysis System, in order to provide a more comprehensive database for brokers and firms to use in building networks.<p>   	

The project is a partnership between the Illinois Chamber, Southern Illinois manufacturers, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Illinois Power, GTE, Carbondale Business Development Corporation, Williamson County Marketing Committee, and the Electric Cooperatives of Southern Illinois.<p>  

The Center for Government Studies at Northern Illinois University will receive $69,920 over two years to deliver broker training services.  The Center will utilize the services of USNet, a program which will supply consultants to train brokers and Center staff.  The Center will coordinate and facilitate broker training, provide technical assistance to networks, and conduct other activities to encourage the development of multi-company networks across the state.<p>  

The grant also serves as the required matching funding for a federal grant which has been provided to USNet to assist states in multi-company network development.<p>

Once the demonstration projects are concluded, the techniques learned will be transferred to local and regional economic development organizations to help them incorporate network development in their day-to-day operations. <p>	  

Anyone interested in further information about the demonstration projects may contact DCCA's Office of Program and Policy Development at 217/524-5696 or TDD 800/785-6055.<p>

Governor Unveils New Economic Development Web Site
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> -  Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a World Wide Web site that puts Illinois' technology and economic resources at the fingertips of manufacturers.<p>

"Illinois is becoming a national leader in developing unique ways to encourage economic development," Governor said.  "The new Illinois web site, using the technology of the Internet, will help companies locate and utilize sources of technical and business modernization assistance that can help them become more competitive.<p>

"It will help market the products of Illinois suppliers to manufacturers in the state and throughout the world.  It promotes economic development through a unique partnership between the public and private sectors, and it sends a clear signal that Illinois cares about manufacturing and is open for business."<p>

The site, designed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is the first of its type in the country to be electronically connected to a major on-line manufacturing publisher.<p>

The URL address for the site is http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/illcoalition.  Under an agreement with Thomas Regional Directory Company, Inc., Illinois will be the first state in the nation to connect its technology and business resources for manufacturers to the new on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Directory for the North Central Tri-State Region, the publisher's popular industrial buying guide for Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.<p>

"When I talked about this new venture in my State of the State address in January, I said i  will help attract new industry and jobs to Illinois by publicizing the expertise and skilled workers readily available from our universities and colleges, Argonne, Fermilab and other institutions," Edgar said.  "I am confident this one-stop shopping site will help make Illinois even more attractive to business expansion and job growth."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the site creates a virtual work space for manufacturers.<p>

"When fully completed by June, the site will enable interested companies to learn about the broad range of technical and business modernization assistance offered to small and medium-sized manufacturers through COMPETE, Illinois' statewide manufacturing extension network," Kustra said.  "Another highly innovative feature of the site is its direct connection to an electronic database providing a comprehensive listing of the technology resources in Illinois of use to manufacturers."<p>

The database is being developed with $175,000 in state grant funds by Argonne National Laboratory and more than 30 universities, community colleges, laboratories, research institutions and industrial organizations, collectively called the Manufacturing, Engineering, Research and Training Coalition (MERTC).  When finished this summer, the MERTC database will enable manufacturers to search a broad range of topics, such as computer-aided design, environmental issues in manufacturing, quality control and ISO-9000 certification.<p>

Users visiting the on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Network Directory (TREND) industrial buying guide will be able to review and order the products and services of thousands of Illinois manufacturers.  They will also be able to click on buttons throughout the site marked "Illinois Manufacturing On-Line" that connect them to the COMPETE web site.  Likewise, manufacturers using the COMPETE web site can directly connect to TREND.<p>

"The two-way Internet traffic between TREND and COMPETE will increase the use of both sites and will make it easier for manufacturers to access the Illinois resources and products that can help improve their business performance, " Edgar said.  "This project is the ultimate in one-stop shopping and confirms that Illinois is a leader in the use of technology to encourage job creation and economic growth.<p>

KUSTRA ANNOUNCES JOB RETENTION INITIATIVE
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Citing recent pro-business legislation and national studies that rank Illinois as a top location for business expansion, Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today announced a new initiative to retain Illinois jobs by alerting companies to new advantages to staying in Illinois.<p>

"In recent weeks, three national surveys ranked Illinois and the Chicago area among the top locations for business growth, "Kustra said.  "A few months ago, Industry Week magazine did the same.  There has been a sea-change in business that keeps getting better."<p>

"Illinois companies considering a relocation or other change affecting Illinois jobs could be strongly influenced by the vote of confidence expressed in these impartial survey results.  In the next year, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will contact 1,000 Illinois businesses to make sure they've heard about the great new business climate in Illinois, the new legislation enacted and the consistently high rankings we have earned.<p>

"By analyzing Dunn and Bradstreet data and looking at sales trends, we will target companies that are likely to outgrow their current facilities or show other potential need for the state's attention.  We'll make sure they know what they already have here in Illinois, and we'll make sure they know how DCCA can help them prosper in the years to come."<p>

The surveys reflecting Illinois' economic strength are:<p>
	
CFO Magazine, in January 1996, ranked Illinois among the top ten states for effective business retention strategies.  Said CFO: "Some states are doing a better job at (business retention) than others... While there is no way to scientifically rank the quality of retention efforts... 10 states, based on interviews with tax experts, stand out for their diligent efforts to cater to home-based companies."<p>

Site Selection Magazine last month published its annual survey of business relocations and expansions.  Illinois ranked in the top five, up form 21st just two years ago.  The Chicago metropolitan area ranked first in the nation among metro regions.<p>

Atlas Van Lines, the moving company, in recent weeks released a study of corporate executive relocations it was hired to perform.  The Chicago metro area ranked among the top destinations for corporate executives.<p>

Industry Week Magazine last summer surveyed its readers.  Illinois was preferred as a relocation and expansion site more than any other Midwest state, ahead of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.  Chicago was ranked as the third-most-popular city in the nation, beating out 16 other cities.<p>
	
"Taken together these surveys show an indisputable trend," Kustra said.  "We are reaping the benefits of our economic development policies emphasizing the things most important to business retention growth-including worker training, infrastructure improvement, export development, regulatory reform, and high-technology initiatives.<p>

"New legislation enacted in Springfield has given our state the most aggressive business growth strategy in a generation.  We are attacking unemployment insurance and workers comp cost. We are putting a stop to silly lawsuits without sacrificing legitimate legal rights.  We are holding the line on taxes.  Illinois has a whole new environment for business growth and we need to make sure business knows it," Kustra said.<p>

COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS TO INVEST IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, WORKER TRAINING AND TOURISM
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today recommended a $774.6 million budget for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to help Illinois businesses continue to thrive and increase their export capability in a strong and expanding state economy.<p>

The budget will provide additional assistance to business, invest more dollars in worker training, maintain community development projects and promote tourism throughout the state.<p>

"The Illinois economy is very healthy," the Governor said.  "In the past year, we have seen our unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in two decades.  Some of our most prominent corporate citizens, including Motorola and McDonald's, have announced major expansions, and national studies have ranked Illinois and the Chicago metropolitan area among the most attractive in the country for business expansions and relocations.<p>

"To continue our economic momentum and increase our competitiveness, we must be willing to renew our commitment to invest in the services and programs that have encouraged growth.  This budget allows us to train more Illinois worker, improves our ability to help companies and communities seeking assistance and expands our highly successful tourism promotion efforts."<p>

The Fiscal Year 1997 budget request includes $40.2 million in general revenue funds.  The budget also includes $600.4 million in federal funds and $134 million in other state funds.<p>

A highlight of the fiscal 1997 budget request is $39.2 million to fund business development programs.  The Regional Industry Development and Building and Sites initiative is designed to enhance DCCA's working relationships with local economic development officials and improve responsiveness to all in-coming business expansion, retention and location inquiries.  The Building and Sites component will allow the department to more accurately represent facilities and development sites to business prospects.<p>

"This budget makes an important investment in our businesses and our workers," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "Increased funding for worker training will help keep businesses in Illinois and make our workforce more competitive.  Worker training funds suffered severe cuts in the early '90s, but this increase recognizes many of our recent successes are due in large part to productive and well-trained workers."<p>

The high quality of the Illinois workforce is a key factor in business expansion and retention.  To keep pace with the demand for worker training, funding for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) will total $15 million, and increase of $2.75 million.<p>

"As technology in the workplace has advanced, so has the need for worker training," said DCCA director Dennis Whetstone.  "The ITP program has been highly successful in ensuring that the quality of Illinois workers is second to none, providing direct grants to individual companies and supporting multi-company networks of small and medium-sized suppliers.  This increase will give nearly 5,000 workers at approximately 350 companies the opportunity to upgrade their job skills."<p>

DCCA's International Business Division will use a budget allocation of $3.5 million to promote the exporting of Illinois goods and services throughout the international marketplace.<p>

An additional $200,000 in funding is provided to continue technology transfer and business modernization efforts provided for in the state's Technology Advancement and Development Act.<p>

The request also includes $2.3 million to fund the state's network of Small Business Development Centers, which provide one-on-one assistance to entrepreneurs.<p>

In addition, DCCA's fiscal 1997 budget request projects $237.2 million for federally funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, which assist dislocated workers, economically disadvantaged youths and adults, older workers, and other who face barriers to employment.<p>

Tourism and film programs will receive $33.4 million under the Governor's budget proposal.  An increase of $1.4 million in tourism promotion funds, generated exclusively by the Illinois hospitality industry, will be used by the Bureau of Tourism to attract major national and international events to the state, develop a heritage-cultural tourism program, increase individual contact with Illinois travelers through a direct marketing effort and handle increasing call volume to the 1-800-2CONNECT hotline.<p>

In addition, $13.6 million has been allocated to administer the Office of Energy Conservation, promoting the efficient and environmentally safe use of Illinois' energy resources.<p>

Appropriations for community development programs that assist low-income Illinoisans and provide services to local governments are proposed at $376.7 million.<p>

The budget proposal also includes $17.8 million for Coal Marketing and Development, of which $2 million will leverage more than $9 million in federal funds for a low emission boiler demonstration project to promote the continued use of Illinois' vast coal resources.  The budget also includes $600,000 in coal bond funding for an ethanol-powered fuel cell bus project and a corn-to-ethanol research pilot plant.<p>

GOVERNOR'S EXPORT AWARDS
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today urged Illinois businesses and trade organizations to apply for the 1996 Governor's Export Awards.<p>

"International trade is one of the foundations of the Illinois\rquote  economic growth," the Governor said.  "The Governor's Export Awards recognize companies that have made outstanding contributions to this key segment of Illinois' diverse economy and encourage other firms to expand into overseas markets."<p>

"Our aggressive export assistance programs aid Illinois firms in trading with new established markets.  A recent $450,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development, one of only eight such grants awarded this year, will help businesses target emerging markets, including China And Mexico.  All of these efforts reinforce Illinois' status as an important presence in the global marketplace."<p>

"Illinois products are recognized throughout the world for their value and quality.  Once again this year, the Governor's Export Awards will honor our most successful Illinois exporters and encourage other firms to enter the global marketplace."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said Illinois continues to be a national leader in the export field.<p>

"Illinois firms have what it takes to compete in the global marketplace," Kustra said.  "More than one-half million jobs in Illinois are related to exports, and one in four manufacturing jobs here are tied to exports.  Illinois exports consistently outpace the nation, thanks in part to our commitment to helping businesses maximize their export opportunities."<p>

The Governor's Export Awards program is administered by DCCA.  Awards will be given in three categories:  New to Export, awarded to Illinois companies that have successfully exported Illinois products for one to five years; Continuing Export Excellence, awarded to Illinois companies successfully exporting for more than five years; and Export Awareness and Development, recognizing Illinois-based not-for-profit organizations involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export awareness.<p>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES ENERGY GRANTS TO HELP 13 HOMELESS SHELTERS
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar announced today that $259,000 has been awarded to 13 homeless shelters to reduce their utility bills.<p>

"This is the fourth consecutive year the state of Illinois has provided funds to make homeless shelters more energy efficient and less expensive to operate, the Governor said.  The money saved on heating and lighting bills can be put into services that help homeless families and individuals get back on their feet.<p>

Support for the energy grants comes form the Homeless Shelter Energy Conservation Program operated By the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and taxpayers' contributions to the Homeless Assistance Fund administered by the Department of Public Aid.<p>

"The combined effort of DCCA and Public Aid allows the State to upgrade homeless shelters and  reduce their annual operating expenses, which frees up funds to serve people in need every day of the year," said State Public Aid Director Robert W. Wright.<p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said, "The cost of major energy improvements often exceeds the financial means of community organizations.  Offering this assistance is an investment in the future of these facilities and the homeless families and individuals they serve."<p>

Frank Marshall, operations manager for the Chicago Christian Industrial League, said, "A portion of the grant will allow us to insulate on of our nine buildings that was constructed more than 80 years ago.  We expect a major energy cost savings which we'll be able to reinvest into our job training programs."<p>

"A new, efficient lighting system that we will install will mean a savings of $7,400 a year," said Russell Kinzinger, executive director of the Home Sweet Home Mission in Bloomington.  "Money provided by the state for these improvements allows us to replicate savings over the years."<p>

Rebecca Payne, executive director of the Woman's Center in Carbondale, said, "We're delighted to receive funding from the state, which has been instrumental in supporting homeless shelters with these energy grants."<p>

Since fiscal year 1993, the state has provided a total of $1.1 million for 64 energy conservation projects at homeless shelters.<p>

This year taxpayers can again help the homeless by contributing $1 or more to the Homeless Assistance Fund on line 15d of the 1040 - Illinois individual income tax form or on line 7d of the 1040EZ form.  Taxpayers using the Illinois Department of Revenue's TeleFile program also cam make a contribution.<p>

Contributions are either deducted from a tax refund or added to the taxes owed.<p>

CHICAGO METRO AREA RANKS FIRST IN NATION FOR FACILITY LOCATION AND EXPANSION; ILLINOIS IN TOP FIVE
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the Chicago metropolitan area is ranked first in the nation in the categories of metropolitan area new/expanding facilities, and new manufacturing plants, in a n annual survey conducted by Site Selection magazine.  Illinois as a whole ranked in the top five in both categories.<p>	

"Illinois isn't just a great place to do business, it is becoming the place to do business," the Governor said.  "We offer manufacturers the advantages of a central location, an excellent transportation system and a superior workforce.  We invest in highly valued infrastructure improvements and worker training and we have enacted significant pro-business reforms that encourage growth.<p>

"Hundreds of companies have located new or expanded facilities in Illinois during the past year, more than half of them in the Chicago metropolitan area.  These expansions have created thousands of job opportunities for our citizens.  There is no better testimony to the overall success of our economic development policies."<p>

Site Selection ranked the Chicago metropolitan area first among metropolitan areas for new and expanded facilities with 265, and first in metropolitan area new manufacturing plants with 101.<p>

In the category of statewide new and expanded facilities, IIlinois is ranked fifth, with 451.  In the category of statewide new manufacturing plants, Illinois ranks fourth, with 142.<p>

"During the past two years we have seen our rankings improve dramatically, reflecting the economic comeback that Illinois has made," Edgar said.<p>

The survey also notes the strongest regional contender for new plants and expansion was the East North Central Region, led by Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.<p>

The Site Selection rankings echo the recent findings of other national surveys.  Illinois was first in the East North Central region in a relocation and expansion study conducted for Industryweek.  The same study ranked Chicago second only to Atlanta when companies were asked what major cities they would consider for new or additional sites.  In addition,  Illinois remains the corporate-transfer capital of the Midwest, according to a survey of household-goods shipments by Atlas Van Lines.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has worked diligently to assist companies expanding or locating new facilities in Illinois.<p>

"It's clear our efforts to build public/private partnerships and be more responsive to our business customer have paid off, " Kustra said.<p>

Published by Conway Data, Site Selection has tracked industry location trends for more than four decades.  The annual tally is based in the company's New Plant Database, which counts new and expanded corporate facility investments of at least $1 million, involving at least 20,000 sq. ft. and employing 50 or more workers.  The annual survey of new and expanded manufacturing facilities appears in the February issue.<p>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO ASSIST SPARTAN PRINTING WORKERS
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the state has received $1 million in emergency funding to assist the more than 800 workers affected by the closure of Spartan Printing in Sparta.<p>

"The shut down of Spartan Printing is a severe blow to the residents of Sparta and Randolph County," the Governor said.  "Last month my administration began the process of offering assistance to spartan workers and immediately set in motion the steps to secure the release of emergency funds to continue that effort.<p>

"This grant will support the operation of the Sparta Career Center, where those affected by the shut down will have access to a full range of services, such as job search classes and placement services.  I have also directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to seek additional funding that will provide dislocated worker services through 1998."<p>

The $1 million grant is being provided through the federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), administered in Illinois by DCCA.<p>

Participants will be provided with a full array of services, including basic readjustment, assessment and job development.<p>

Vocational training, G.E.D. classes and on-the-job training will also be offered, and participants will be able to apply for assistance with transportation and child care.  The Sparta Career Center will also offer ongoing stress counseling in the form of workshops and on an outreach basis.<p>

GOVERNOR APPROVES U.I. TAX CUT FOR BUSINESS
</center></h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation he called for in his State of the State message to help spur business growth and expansion through a $128 million cut in unemployment insurance taxes.<p>

"Coupled with an automatic $123 million reduction through the existing tax rate formula, this legislation means a savings of a quarter billion dollars this year for Illinois business," the Governor said.  "That money can bolster business growth and expansion rather than sitting idle in a government trust account."<p>

Illinois employers will save an average of 18 percent on their 1996 unemployment insurance tax bills because of the reduced rates.<p>

"With the state's unemployment levels at a 21-year low, we had fewer unemployment insurance claims, leaving a higher-than-expected balance in the U.I. trust fund, "Edgar said.  "This legislation strengthens our economy and gives Illinois employers a competitive edge -- without jeopardizing the fund or benefits for the unemployed."<p>

The year-end trust fund balance was $1.6 billion, $600 million higher than projected in 1992, based on a consensus of economic forecasts.  Unemployment insurance taxes are collected quarterly from employers and deposited in the fund, which can only be used to pay benefits to unemployed workers.<p>

"We will begin immediately to process the new tax rates, and statements will be mailed to all Illinois employers before the end of the month, " said Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Illinois Department of Employment Security.  "The new rates apply for the entire year of 1996."<p>

Under the legislation, the minimum rate is decreased to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent, and the maximum rate drops to 6.8 percent form 8.2 percent.  The rate applies to the first $9,000 in annual wages paid to an employee.<p>

The legislation is effective immediately.<p>

Chief Sponsors of the measure, House Bill 1740, were Reps. Terry Parke (R-Hoffman Estates), Verna Clayton (R-Buffalo Grove), Bernard Pedersen (R-Palatine) and Ann Hughes (R-Woodstock)  and Sens. Chris Lauzen (R-Aurora), Dave Syverson (R-Rockford), Martin Butler (R-Park Ridge), Dick Klemm (R-Crystal Lake) and Dan Cronin (R-Elmhurst).<p>

GOVERNOR UNVEILS PLAN TO ENHANCE CHICAGO'S POTENTIAL FOR ATTRACTING MEGA CONVENTIONS, ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS AND ATHLETIC EVENTS WITHOUT RAISING OR ADDING TAXES
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled his plan to enhance the potential for attracting mega conventions, entertainment shows and athletic events to Chicago by further expanding the McCormick Place complex.<p>

"Without raising taxes or creating new taxes, we have a tremendous opportunity to build a facility that will create thousands of jobs and bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy of the Chicago metropolitan area and the State of Illinois each and every year,"  the Governor said.<p>

Edgar pointed out that Chicago currently does not have the facilities to accommodate many of the largest conventions and assemblies.<p>

He said the entertainment and convention center he is proposing could allow the city to attract national and international meetings of such groups as the Promise Keepers, which would bring nearly $70 million into the city; Alcoholics Anonymous, which would bring nearly $50 million; the Youth Gathering of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which would bring more than $40 Million, and the Lions International convention, which would bring more than $30 million.<p>

"A super city should be able to host a Super Bowl.  The enclosed facility I am proposing will accommodate a Super Bowl, the Final Four and other events that could bring tens of thousands of people to Chicago.  These events would showcase a world-class city and a great state."<p>

Edgar said, "The facility also would offer the Chicago Bears a state-of-the-art home in which to battle for a Super Bowl berth.<p>

"As I have said repeatedly, I want to keep the Bears in Chicago, but I don't want to subsidize a professional sports team or build a football stadium.  Under this proposal, the Bears will help pay for a facility that can be used for many, many other purposes -- a facility that will attract millions and millions of people to events that have nothing to do with shoulder pads and helmets and pay huge dividends for the city and the state."<p>

The Governor said he is counting on the Bears to help fund the extension of McCormick Place.  "We need the backing of the Bears.  We need the backing of the Legislature.  And we need the backing of the Mayor of Chicago," the Governor said.<p>

"I am optimistic that support will be forthcoming.  It is difficult to imagine that we would not seize this great opportunity to launch an initiative that will create thousands of jobs."<p>

The Bears and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would share the cost of constructing the center, which is expected to take four years.<p>

The Bears would provide $175 million, and the authority would provide $185 million.  In addition, the authority would construct and operate a $50 million parking garage and garner all the revenues from it.  It also would contribute $5 million in construction-related administrative costs.<p>

The City of Chicago and the State of Illinois would contribute $25 million each for land acquisition and infrastructure costs.<p>

"The state has provided infrastructure for economic development initiatives throughout the state and typically called upon local governments to do their share.  This is consistent with that policy.  It is consistent with what we did at the United Center, and we will work together with the United Center to assure that it will continue to realize its full potential."<p>

The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would fund its share by fully utilizing revenues from taxes paid primarily by visitors to Chicago.  The taxes were supported in 1991 by the Governor, the Mayor and the Legislature to expand McCormick Place.  They are pledged at their current rates to bond holders through the year 2029.  However, they will produce a surplus that can be used to add the enclosed facility proposed by the Governor without raising or creating any new taxes.<p>

GOVERNOR TARGETS HEATING ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO EMERGENCY RECONNECTIONS DURING FRIGID WEATHER
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today ordered that $5.2 million in heating assistance funds be targeted toward re-establishing utility service for low-income Illinois households that are currently without heat.<p>

"This week's record-setting bitter cold has dramatically heightened the urgent need for emergency heating assistance," the Governor said.  "For those with no utility service, the frigid weather is life-threatening.  Our immediate priority must be to reconnect low-income residents who do not have the financial means to re-establish electrical and heating service on their own.<p>

"I have directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to work with local organizations to meet the current demand for emergency services before making funds available for other forms of assistance."<p>

Of the $5.2 million in Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $1.8 million will be allocated to the City of Chicago.  The remainder of the funds will be distributed throughout the state on the basis of population, poverty, heating degree days and fuel costs.<p>

"Emergency assistance is available to eligible households that are disconnected from their primary and/or secondary utilities, or where a supplier has refused to deliver fuel without immediate payment," Edgar said.  "This assistance may also be available to help households with repair or replacement of inoperable heating systems."<p>

The amount of emergency assistance is the minimum amount necessary for reconnection of energy services.  Emergency assistance payments may not exceed a total of $500 per year per household, and eligible households are limited to one emergency assistance payment for the primary energy source and one for the secondary energy source.<p>

Applicants must prove that they are low-income, responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or the delivered fuel vendor and have made a "good-faith effort" to maintain their energy services.  A good-faith effort is defined as having paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

LIHEAP funds may also be used to provide a one-time payment to utilities on behalf of eligible households.  The payment is applied toward a participant's energy bill.<p>

Including the $5.2 million, Illinois has received $50.2 million in federal LIHEAP funding to assist low-income residents during the current winter.  Approximately 7,000 residents have already received emergency assistance.  An additional 140-,000 have received energy assistance.<p>

Even with the addition of the latest round of funding, the federal government has provided only two-thirds of last year's funding, when $74.7 million was used to assist 13,000 residents with emergency reconnection assistance and 210,000 residents with energy assistance.<p>

For information about the program, residents may call DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline at 800/252-8643 or 800/419-0667 (TDD).<p>

<h3>GOVERNOR AWARDS REHABILITATION GRANTS TO IMPROVE HOUSING IN 31 ILLINOIS COMMUNITIES</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded $7 million in grants to assist 31 Illinois communities in efforts to renovate substandard housing.<p>

"Safe, decent housing is important to the well-being of all Illinois families," the Governor said.  "home repairs, such as replacing a roof for making plumbing and electrical improvements, are often beyond the budgets of low-income families, as well as too costly for those with disabilities and senior citizens surviving on fixed incomes.<p>

"These grants will help smaller communities throughout the state rehabilitate hundreds of aging and unsafe homes.  They represent an investment in better living conditions for thousands of people, and they represent a commitment to a better overall quality of life in Illinois."<p>

Examples of the grant program include rehabilitation projects in Carbondale, Newton and Monmouth.<p>

Carbondale will receive $350,000 to assist in rehabilitating 28 homes.  This year's grant continues efforts to improve housing the northeast section of the city, where nearly a third of the homes are more than 40 years old.  Improvements will include roof repairs, upgrading electrical and plumbing systems and correcting other deficiencies.<p>

Monmouth will use $188,000 to implement a housing rehabilitation program.  Twenty home located in the south central section of the community are targeted for assistance.  Nearly half of the homes in the neighborhood were constructed prior to 1940, and lower income residents have had difficulty in maintaining the integrity of their homes.  Improvements are designed to bring the properties up to code.<p>

Newton, in Jasper County, will use $194,500 to undertake the second phase of a housing rehabilitation project for 15 owner-occupied homes.  Local officials surveying the targeted area reported extensive deterioration of the modes, single-family frame structures.  All of the homes have common problems such as damaged roofs, inadequate wiring and out-dated plumbing and heating systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the housing rehabilitation grants represent just one component of the Community Development assistance Program (CDAP) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

"Smaller communities across Illinois continue to benefit from this program," Kustra said.  "CDAP grants are awarded for a number of different purposes - they include making public infrastructure improvements, encouraging business development, and providing greater accessibility to government buildings.  Today we are announcing assistance to upgrade substandard housing.<p>

"All of these components fit together to help local governments make their communities better places to live, work and raise a family."<p>

The community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD. The maximum grant is $400,000.<p>

<h3><center>January 8, 1996</center></h3>

<h3>GOVERNOR APPLAUDS PRODUCTION OF NEW ETHANOL POWERED FORD; ALSO AWARD JOB TRAINING GRANT</h3>

CHICAGO, ILL. --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined officials from Ford Motor Company and the corn industry in launching production at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant of a redesigned flexible fuel Ford Taurus optimized for the use of ethanol.<p>

The Governor also awarded the company an $800,000 job training grant to upgrade the skills of nearly 3,000 workers at the plant, the Chicago Stamping Plant and five supplier companies.<p>

"Illinois continues to be the nation's leader in promoting the production and use of ethanol," the Governor said.  "Illinois has the largest government fleet of ethanol-powered cars in the country.  We are the top producer of ethanol fuel, and motorists in Illinois pump more ethanol blended-fuel into their gas tanks than in any other state.<p>

"Ford's production of a new vehicle designed specifically for optimal operation with ethanol is another milestone in efforts to increase the use of this clean, renewable fuel derived from corn.  We are especially proud that a vehicle that can run on ethanol produced from Illinois corn is being manufactured by Illinois workers right here in Chicago."<p>

The new flexible fuel Tauruses are optimized for the use of E-85 fuel, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline.<p>

Rand Griffin, Chicago Assembly Plant manager, said "The Taurus in known to meet a wide variety of customer needs, a tradition that has made it America's best selling car for four years in a row.  With out latest flexible fuel Taurus, customers will have another way of making this car fit for their lifestyles."<p>

The Illinois Department of Central Management Services (CMS) has already ordered 40 of the flexible fuel Taurus models, and additional orders are expected.  Currently, there are 139 ethanol-powered vehicles in the state fleet.  Local governments throughout the state have purchased an additional 25 ethanol vehicles through CMS.  The state has also established 11 ethanol refueling stations for the government vehicles.<p>

 Vic Riddle, President of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, voiced appreciation for Edgar's efforts on behalf of ethanol.<p>

"The Governor has been a champion for this Illinois-made fuel.  He has put the backing of his administration and his political influence behind ethanol at the state and national level,"  Riddle said.<p>

Up to 6,000 of the ethanol-powered vehicles are expected to be produced.  The Chicago Assembly Plant produces a total of more than250,000 vehicles a year which are distributed throughout the United States and 17 other countries.<p>

The $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant will be used by Ford to train employees in areas such as the use of technical equipment, preventive maintenance and leadership skills.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant strengthens the state's partnership with Ford.<p>

"The Edgar administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge."<p>

The Industrial Training Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), is a state-funded program that assists employers with the training and retraining of their workforce.  ITP grants may be awarded to individual employers, as well as multi-company employee training projects.<p>

</h3>





<EM>MOLINE, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined local officials in announcing a $38 million development project that will create 260 jobs in the Quad-Cities area and rejuvenate Moline's downtown area with the headquarters for John Deere Health Care.<P>

"This development project will pump millions of dollars into the Quad-Cities economy," the Governor said.  "The jobs to be created will provide opportunities for area citizens in field ranging from health care administration to retail, hotel and restaurant management.<P>

"There was intense competition from other states for the centerpiece of this development, the headquarters for John Deere Health Care, but this fast-growing corporation preferred to stay in Illinois.  Our willingness to make the needed investments in infrastructure improvements and worker training to help the Illinois economy grow has once again made the difference.  We are proving yet again that Illinois is a good place to do business."<P>

Richard Van Bell, President of John Deere Health Care, said the company was pleased to be located in a state with progressive job training programs for its citizens.<P>

"We commend Governor Edgar and the State of Illinois for supporting this project, which is an example of what government can do for the common benefit of its people," Van Bell said.  "This is a cost-effective way to upgrade the skills of our employees, which will improve their service and productivity, therefore having a strong impact not only on John Deere Health Care, but also our community and the state of Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said there was outstanding community cooperation in bringing the project together.<P>

"The public/private partnership we have seen demonstrated in pulling this complicated project together is a tribute to the leadership of those involved," Kustra said.  "All of the components in the development fit together to produce a complex that will create jobs and spur economic development."<P>

The development plan calls for the construction of a 100,000-square-foot building to serve as John Deere Health Care's corporate headquarters.  It will house 300 current employees, as well as another 100 employees to be added later.<P>

Another 160 jobs created by the development will be in the tourism-driven retail, hospitality and restaurant industries.<P>
	
Adjacent to the office building will be a 15,000-square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion that will serve as a destination point for the company's out-of-town visitors.  The pavilion will feature displays and historic exhibits and is expected eventually to draw up to 400,00 visitors.<P>

The development also includes a new Community Transportation Center that will serve as an intercity bus transfer center and a staging area for bus tour groups.  A first-class hotel is also planned to accommodate overnight visitors to the downtown area.<P>

The City of Moline, the Rock Island County Metropolitan Transit District, Renew Moline and the Quad Cities Civic Center Authority are all committing substantial resources to allow the development plan to move forward.<P>

The State of Illinois is providing more than $1 million toward the project, including a $600,000 loan to the City of Moline through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' public infrastructure program.  Up to $300,000 in job training funds also will be allocated over three years to assist John Deere Health Care with Worker training.  In addition, DCCA also has approved a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant for the program to rejuvenate the downtown area.<P>

Robert Growney, Executive Vice President, Motorola Inc., and President and General Manager of MIMS said, "the anticipated growth of Messaging, Information and Media Sector compelled us to find a site where we could support this opportunity.

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, said the facility will be a tremendous asset to the area.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) worked diligently to make this project a reality," Kustra said.

Illinois Communities Awarded Grants to Upgrade Public Water and Sewer Systems                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 87 communities throughout Illinois will share more than $22.6 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund improvements to local water and sewer systems.<P>

"Public health and safety, and the potential for economic growth, depend on our ability to maintain adequate public infrastructure systems," the Governor said.  "My Administration has made infrastructure improvement one of the cornerstones of Illinois's' overall economic development policy.  These grants will provide cities and towns with the financial tools to make much-needed improvements.<P>

Edgar said a project in Fulton County is an example.<P>

Boil orders are often issued in the city of Farmington because of severely encrusted watermains that frequently break or lose pressure.  Farmington will receive a $350,000 grant combined with city funds to make the necessary water system improvements including replacement of water mains and construction of a new water tower.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said growth in rural areas depends in part on maintaining Illinois' high standards for public infrastructure.<P>

"Adequate water and sewage treatment systems are an important selling point for communities hoping to attract new economic development to their areas," Kustra said.  "Assisting local governments in making these improvements is a sound investment in the future of our state."<P>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds form the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the six large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<P>

A list of the communities receiving CDAP public facilities and design engineering grants may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142. (TDD 800/785-6055).<P>

          Governor Announces $2.75 Million Tourism Grant to Help Chicago Host Democratic National Convention          
</h3>




<EM>CHICAGO, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $2.75 million tourism promotion grant to assist the City of Chicago with expenses in hosting the Democratic National Convention next summer.<P>

"The 1996 Democratic National Convention promises to showcase Illinois to the 35,000 delegates, alternates, staff, guests and media representatives expected to attend, and to an international audience following the activities," the Governor said.  "This grant is part of our commitment to the City of Chicago to be a partner in hosting a world-class event.<P>

"Sixteen cities competed for the economic benefits and prestige that hosting the convention will bring.  A spirit of teamwork in the public and private sectors helped win the convention for Chicago, and we will continue to work together to prove that Chicago was the right  choice, "Edgar added.<P>

The economic impact of the convention is expected to reach an estimated $122 million.  The grant to the City of Chicago Office of Budget Management is made through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.<P>

Other grants through the program this year include:<P>
<ul>
<li> $25,000 to the City of Chicago/Department of Cultural Affairs to assist with costs from hosting the fourth International Congress of Educating Cities<p>

<li> $28,961 to the Rockford Area Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs form hosting the 1996 ASA Men's Nationals 40 & Over Softball Tournament<p>

<li> $25,546 to the River Bend Growth Association, headquartered in Alton, which will assist with the expenses of hosting the 1996 U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Golf Championship.<p>

<li>n $18,400 grant to the Quad Cities Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs associated with hosting the NCAA Division I Women's National Invitational Softball Championship was announced earlier.<p>
</ul>
Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the grants are an important part of Illinois' overall tourism promotion effort. 
"Tourism continues to set new records in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Last year alone, travelers to our state spent nearly $16 billion and the travel industry employed more than 240,000 workers.  It just makes sense to encourage development of more public private partnerships to keep those numbers growing."<P>

The Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, funded entirely by revenue generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for the Tourism Promotion Fund.<P>

Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment for efforts to attract major national and international events to Illinois.<P>

Wal-Mart to Build Distribution Center in Olney
                    
</h3>




<EM>OLNEY, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will build a Midwestern Distribution Center in Olney, creating up to 250 new jobs within 18 months and as many as 400 fully operational.<P>

"Illinois is a leader in the warehousing and distribution field," the Governor said.  "our strong central location, coupled with an excellent transportation network, has already made Illinois the choice for nearly 300 Fortune 500 companies that have major regional or national distribution centers in our state.<P>

"One of the world's premier retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is known for carefully scrutinizing every detail when making location decisions.  I am delighted that the company's exhaustive review found Olney and Illinois to be the best location for this new facility."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, praised the public/private cooperation that made the project possible.<P>

"Officials for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) worked closely with Olney Mayor Tom Fehrenbacher and Stan Wieber, Director of the Richland County Development Corporation, to pull together state and local resources to help this company make its decision," Kustra said.<P>

City officials, the Richland County Boar, the Olney Township Board and Road Commissioner, the East Richland School Board and the Illinois Eastern Community College Board also assisted in making needed Enterprise Zone changes.<P>

The private sector played a crucial role in making the project possible, as well.  Central Illinois Public Service Company, the local GTE office and Norris Electric Coop all agreed to make utility improvements necessary to service the facility.  The First National Bank of Olney agreed to provide temporary office and storage space to Wal-Mart to enable the project to get up and running quickly.<P>

"This type of cooperation between the state, the community and the private sector demonstrates the depth of Illinois' commitment to helping businesses achieve success," Edgar said.<P>

DCCA will award a $640,000 Community Development Assistance Program grant to the City of Olney, which will be combined with $900,000 from the City to extend water and sewer lines to serve the new facility.  DCCA will also provide a grant of up to $250,000 from the state's Industrial Training Program to assist in training the new workers.<P>

IDOT will provide $300,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the roadway improvements needed to serve the site.  The improvements will include the construction of turn lanes form U.S. 50 into the Wal-Mart facility, and an eastbound truck acceleration lane from the site onto U.S 50.  The Department will also provide $90,000 for the necessary engineering and plan preparation for the project, as well as construction supervision.<P>

In addition, city and county officials have agreed to extend the Olney/Richland county Enterprise Zone to include the site, a move that will enable Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to benefit from state and local sales tax exemptions and other incentives.<P>

The 830,00-square-foot warehouse and food distribution center will serve Wal-Mart's Supercenter grocery stores throughout the Midwest.  Construction is expected to begin next spring, with completion slated for spring 1997.<P>

  Illinois Film Office Sets New Hi-Tech Production Guide Standard                 
</h3>




Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs director Dennis Whetstone announced today that the Illinois Film Office, working with Chicago based Brand X Filmworks, will soon distribute the Illinois Production Guide on CD-ROM.<P>

"The Illinois Film Office is responsible for ringing motion picture and television production to film on-location in Illinois.  Illinois is the first state in the country to digitize their resource manual, vastly expanding the amount and accessibility of information available to national production executives," said Whetstone.<P>

Brand X Filmworks has developed a custom application as an alternative to the printed 250 page Illinois Production Guide.  The CD-ROM offers easy reference on the set, on the road, or anywhere.  The user still has access to the names of local companies and individuals, in addition to newly enhanced information including catalogs, credits, and photographs.  Thousands of easily searchable answers will be at the film industry's fingertips.  Filmmakers will now be able to customize their resource information which can then be printed or saved.<P>

Beginning in October, 2500 discs will be distributed free of charge to motion picture and television industry leaders around the country.  The list will include production executives at the major studios in Los Angeles, independent production companies nationwide, cable producers, location managers, production managers, producers, directors, anyone who might have a say in deciding where a picture will shoot.<P>

"As the competition for on-location production dollars continues to grow, the Illinois Film Office must take an increasingly pro-active position in the marketplace," said Suzy Kellett, director of the Illinois Film Office.  "In addition to offerings the local production industry the opportunity to use the cutting edge technology of CD0-ROM to sell themselves more effectively, the Illinois and Chicago Film Offices have been actively promoting the State through other mediums."<P>

The first Illinois/Chicago Screenwriter Competition has just been completed to rave reviews.  In October, the Film Offices and Chicago labor leader conducted 22 meetings in Los Angeles on a joint sales trip.  Recently a 15-member industry Task Force Was formed to examine the local filming infrastructure and develop an industrywide national marketing campaign.  The Illinois Film Office has dedicated a staff member to be a Community Liaison responsible for monitoring locations and maintaining relationships with location contacts.<P>

All of these activities are designed to keep Illinois in the limelight as an on-location filming choice, because Kellett believes, "If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes."<P>

   Illinois Chosen to Implement One-Stop Career Center Network                
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</EM> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois is one of seven states chosen by the U.S. Department of Labor to implement a One-Stop Career Center Network.<P>

Illinois was awarded a grant of nearly $6.7 million form the U.S. Department of Labor to fund activities during the first year of the three-year project.<P>

"Illinois has always been at the forefront in designing services to help our citizens prepare for rewarding, productive careers," the Governor said. "It is natural, then, that our state should be leader in implementing the new One-Stop Career Center Network concept.<P>

"Two years ago, we started initial planning to consolidate career-related services administered by various agencies and educational institutions under one roof.  Our goal is to make it easier for people who need these services.  Rather than driving all over town, people can visit one place to get the information they need about a wide range of services, from unemployment assistance to job training and educational programs.<P>

"Already, we have opened full-service centers in Decatur, Rockford and Mattoon, and are well on the way to consolidating services in dozens of other communities around our state.  This grant will help us speed up that process so that people throughout our state will benefit from One-Stop Career Centers."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said state officials worked closely with local service providers to design the Career Center Network.<P>

"Although each center will be customized to fit local labor market conditions and customer needs, they will offer a standard set of high quality employment, unemployment and training services.  They also will make maximum use of computer and telecommunications technology to link center, increase program access and ensure efficient service."<P>

During the three-year implementation period, Illinois plans to establish 55 full-service centers and 93 satellite offices.  It is anticipated that 40 new centers will be operational by the end of the first year.  At the end of the three-year development period, people throughout the state are expected to be served by a Career Center.<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs, which administer Illinois' Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, said the centers will build upon JTPA's programs to help displaced and disadvantaged workers train for new employment.<P>

"Besides making services convenient to clients, we have built in a new component to tailor our services to the needs of the business community,"  Whetstone said.  "These centers will offer businesses and clients easy access to labor market information, making it possible for clients to match their skills with the places that need those skills.  Center staffers will also work with local businesses to ensure that participants are being trained in skills that those businesses need."<P>

Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Department of Employment Security (IDES), said the success of the early one-stop centers has been encouraging, both for the public and for the staff people who work in the centers.<P>

"Illinois has worked hard on its plan for a one-stop system of employment and training centers, and we are proud to have been selected as one of the states to fully launch this program, which offers comprehensive services in one location and also provides cost savings for the people who foot the bill, the Illinois taxpayers," Doherty said.<P>

Armstrong to Expand In Kankakee                    
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated officials of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. on their decision to undertake a $36.5 million expansion at the company's Kankakee facility, retaining 350 jobs.<P>

"My administration has made economic development a top priority in Illinois," the Governor said.  "In our efforts to convince Armstrong to expand in Illinois, we have seen a strong partnership both between state agencies and between state and local government to keep jobs in Illinois.  By choosing Kankakee over other sites, Armstrong has signaled its confidence in our quality workers, our excellent infrastructure and our competitive business climate."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, personally worked with Armstrong World Industries Inc. to help convince the company to choose Illinois for its expansion.<P>

"We have many tools to help companies grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "From enterprise zones to low-interest loans, infrastructure assistance and workforce training programs, our programs are designed to meet the needs of individual employers, both new companies and firms expanding for th future.  The bottom line is job - retaining jobs for current workers and attracting new jobs for tomorrow's workers.  I am pleased our negotiations with Armstrong World Industries Inc. have resulted in today's announcement."<P>

The Kankakee plant, located at Hobby and Brookmont Avenues, is among Armstrong's oldest vinyl tile production facilities, in operation for more than 47 years.<P>

The project will include construction of a new distribution center and a new commercial floor tile line.  Improvements are slated for completion during 1996.<P>

Several state agencies and officials were involved in the negotiations with the company.  The final incentive package is expected to include tax benefits from the company's location in the Kankakee River Valley Enterprise Zone and worker training assistance through the state's Industrial Training Program administered by the Department of commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

In addition, the company is expected to receive financial assistance through the Linked Deposit Program administered by State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, as well as low-interest financing through the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  The Illinois Department of Transportation is working with the company to meet its roadway needs.<P>

The City of Kankakee also has offered assistance through local Enterprise Zone benefits and tax increment financing (TIF).<P>

Steve Husak, Armstrong's Kankakee plant manager, thanked state officials, Mayor Don Green and the plant's employees for their interest and support.
"Without all their help, these projects would not have been approved for our plant," Husak said.  "These projects are very important to the future success of the tile business.  All of us should be proud the Kankakee plant has been selected for these investments."<P>

Governor Announces Infrastructure Grants                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced $2.9 million in grants it help 10 Illinois communities improve their public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is among government's most important responsibilities," the Governor said.  "Citizens turn to government to ensure that the water they drink is healthy and plentiful, and that waste is safely treated.  These grants will help these 10 communities address infrastructure needs that pose a threat to the health and safety of their residents."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants are awarded through the federally funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

"This program is among our most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and economic development needs," Kustra said.  "With these grants, communities have the funds necessary to undertake public facilities improvement projects needed to preserve the quality of life and help attract new development."<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) which administers the grants, said the 10 projects will be funded through moneys left unspent from other CDAP components.<P>

"These grants are funded through the community Development Block Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development," Whetstone said.  "When we draw up the budget, we allocate our block grant funds among several CDAP components that fund public facilities improvements, planning, housing rehabilitation, economic development opportunities, emergency public facilities needs and other projects.  This year, we determined that the best use for any unspent CDAP funds is to provide grants to deserving communities with qualifying public facilities projects."<P>

Whetstone cited a project in Jerseyville as an example.<P>

Jerseyville's central water supply began operations in 1923.  The average age of water lines in the community is 50 years.  One section"washed out" in 1989 due to its proximity to Otter Creek, and other sections often experience breaks, threatening the reliability of the city's water supply.<P>

Jerseyville will receive a $360,000 CDAP grant to assist with installation of new transmission mains, valves, hydrants and other system needs.<P>

CDAP grants are provided to communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under the Public facilities component is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

A list of communities receiving funds may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142 (TDD 800/785-6055). <P>

Hoopeston Foods Acquires Pillsbury Plant; Project Will Retain 50 Jobs in Vermillion County                    
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated company officials on the announcement that Hoopeston Foods, Inc. will purchase the Pillsbury plant in Hoopeston, retaining 50 jobs with plans for further growth in the future.<P>

"The City of Hoopeston has a long and proud tradition in the food processing industry," the Governor said.  "When Pillsbury announced plans earlier this year to close its Hoopeston plant, we began working with local officials and economic developers to find a buyer for the facility.  Thanks to this close cooperation, coupled with innovative programs from both the state and community, Hoopeston Foods will keep the food processing tradition alive in Hoopeston."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the project was made possible inpart by a $650,000 Participation Loan provided by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"This program enables the state to work with private lenders to make capital available to businesses like Hoopeston Foods that are creating and retaining jobs in our state," Kustra said.  "Our funds made it possible for the company to obtain conventional financing at a rate favorable enough to make the project feasible."<P>

The company will also receive a $100,000 participation loan from the Vermilion county Community Development Corporation, and a $100,000 loan form the city's revolving loan fund.  American National Bank and Trust, Chicago is the primary lender.<P>

John Steele, Hoopeston Foods, Inc. President, said the state and local support was critical to the project.<P>

"Financing of this project would not have been possible without a great deal of state and local assistance," Steele said.  "It has been a true public-private partnership to retain and grow a long-standing business in this community."<P>

Steele also thanked Hoopeston Mayor Robert Ault and the Hoopeston City Council, and Vicki Stewart of the Danville Area Economic Development corporation for their Assistance with the project.  Stewart, who said the state's involvement with the project was responsible for retaining invaluable manufacturing jobs for the Hoopeston community, commended Senator Harry "Babe" Woodyard and Representative William B. Black for their support.<P>

Hoopeston Foods, Inc. plans to establish a core business canning and labeling private-label dry-pack beans.  The company also plans to expand into a variety of food categories to complement its core product offering.<P>

        Twenty-seven Communities Awarded Grants; Funds Help Plan Public Facilities Improvements            
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $500,000 to help 27 Illinois communities initiate formal planning for future improvements to public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is one of the foundations of economic development," the Governor said.  "While Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) public facilities grants can help many smaller communities fund critical improvement sot water and sewer systems, some communities lack even the funds necessary to compile the plans needed to seek the grants.<P>

"For that reason, we have developed a separate CDAP component specifically to help fund these planning efforts.  Once plans have been developed, the communities will be in a position to seek future assistance to actually undertake the improvements needed to meet their public facilities needs."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the need is always great.<P>

"Communities know when they have a public facilities problem; however, finding the best and most efficient solution to the problem may not be within their reach," Kustra said.  "Through this program, we can provide assistance that will enable many smaller communities to investigate the various alternatives and develop plans to solve their water and sewer needs."<P>

Projects in Biggsville and Stockton are examples.<P>

Biggsville, population 349, has no sewer system.  Many of the existing septic systems discharge into a community tile constructed in the 1920's, creating a hazard to public health and safety.  The village will receive a $10,800 grant to study various alternatives to collect and treat the sanitary sewer discharge.<P>

The wastewater treatment plant in the Village of Stockton is inadequate to meet its needs, placing the community on restricted development status.  Its water system is also insufficient, causing a threat to public health and safety.  Two major employers are particularly affected.  An egg washing and separating plant that has large wastewater treatment needs has been forced to cut back production and lay off workers to reduce its wastewater discharge.  An automotive systems manufacturer moved some of its production to another community because Stockton's labor force was insufficient - a problem made worse by a shortage of available housing in Stockton and the village's inability to undertake additional housing development to attract new residents.  The village will receive a $21,200 grant to review existing water and sewer facilities and develop alternatives to solve the problems.<P>

CDAP grants, funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are administered by the Department of Commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).  DCCA awards funds to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly form HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available under the CDAP Planning Assistance Grant component is $25,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

     Governor Helps Cut Ribbon on New Motorola Manufacturing Facility               
</h3>




<EM>MCHENRY, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined company officials in ceremonies officially opening Motorola's new multi-million-dollar Cellular Infrastructure Group manufacturing facility in McHenry.<P>

"Motorola is truly an Illinois success story,' the Governor said.  "Headquartered in Schaumburg, the company is known worldwide for its leadership in the fields of wireless communications, semiconductors an advanced electronic systems and services.<P>

"Through the years, Motorola and Illinois have forged a strong partnership based on our state's ability to provide the infrastructure, skilled work force and business climate conducive to growth.  Today, the company employs more than 20,000 Illinois workers, and will create up to 500 new jobs at this facility.  I am delighted that Motorola continues to grow in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said, "This is a great example of our state government working in partnership with local communities and businesses to create economic expansion."<P>

The state provided more than $1.1 million in infrastructure improvements to assist with the project.  The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) provided a $315,000 Public Infrastructure Program grant to the City of McHenry for water and sewer improvements.  The Illinois Department of Transportation contributed $800,000 i matching funds through its Economic Development Program to provide access to the site, which was matched by a $400,00 grant form the City of McHenry and $400,000 form Prime Commercial Corp., the site's developers.<P>

The 217,000 square-foot facility is located on 20 acres in the McHenry Corporate Center.  The new plant will manufacture cellular infrastructure equipment for customers worldwide.<P>

Motorola has facilities in Arlington Heights, Schaumburg, Northbrook, Libertyville, Itasca, Buffalo Grove, Grayslake, Urbana, Vernon Hills and McHenry, and is currently constructing a $100 million cellular phone manufacturing facility in Harvard.<P>

The company also has facilities in Florida, Texas, New York and Arizona.  Motorola's major equipment businesses include cellular telephones and equipment, two-way radios, pagers and data communications, automotive, defense and space electronics and computers.  Communications devices, computers and millions of consumer products are powered by Motorola semiconductors.  The company's 1994 sales totaled $22.2 billion.<P>

<h3>AMERICORPS--HELPING PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

AmeriCorps, a national service initiative administered in Illinois by DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity, is much more than just another service program.  It's a movement that unites diverse Illinoisans in efforts to improve neighborhoods and the quality of life for their residents.<p> 

AmeriCorps seeks to strengthen communities by providing manpower to help meet local educational, human, environmental and public safety needs, particularly those affecting children and young people.  Programs selected for funding recruit and train individuals who are willing to devote at least one year to serving as AmeriCorps members.<p>

Non-profit organizations, units of local government, state agencies, institutions of higher education or partnerships among such organizations are eligible for AmeriCorps participation.  Organizations submit proposals, which are reviewed by the 25-member bi-partisan Illinois Commission on Community Service (ICCS) and then sent for final approval and funding to the federal Corporation for National Service.  Successful proposals outline ways to meet identified needs, develop capacity by involving community volunteers, and have measurable outcomes to benefit the community.<p>

Organizations may apply for one of three different types of grants.  Planning grants provide organizations with up to $35,000 to plan an operational program.  Operating grants require a program design using 10 to 20 members and include funding for member support costs, staff salaries and administration.  The average size of operating grants is $250,000.  Education grants include awards for post-service education.<p> 

Participating organizations must operate an AmeriCorps-type program and bear total cost for the program.  This includes modest living allowances and health coverage for volunteers participating in the program.  Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds.  After completing a year of service (at least 1,700 hours), AmeriCorps volunteer members receive an education award of $4,725 which can be used to help pay off student loans or finance college, graduate school, or vocational training. <p>
 
To date, ICCS has awarded more than $3 million to 13 grantees to develop programs through non-profit and state government agencies.  More than 300 people have been employed as AmeriCorps members throughout Illinois.  These volunteers have renovated 12 homes, tutored 1,500 children, cleaned five Illinois streams, trained 44,000 people in health and  safety, provided 4,000 day care referrals, and delivered case management and assistance to more than 200 homeless individuals.<p>

The ICCS has been assured that funds will be available for AmeriCorps operational grants for the 1997-98 program year.  For further information about AmeriCorps, contact the Illinois Commission on Community Service at 800/592-9896 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS KEY TO THE ILLINOIS ECONOMY</h3>

The Illinois travel industry is flexing its muscles.  Recently, DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism reported that the growth rate of Illinois tourism matched or exceeded the U.S. growth rate for the 13th consecutive time.  By establishing new partnerships within the public and private sectors, expanding the use of technology, and administering an award-winning advertising campaign, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism expects to continue this outstanding growth.<p>

Tourism's success reflects positively on the overall Illinois economy.  During Calendar Year 1995 (the most recent data available), domestic and international travel within Illinois showed a direct economic impact of $16 billion -- a 3.2 percent improvement over the $15.5 billion spent in 1994.  This includes an 8.75 percent increase in international travel to Illinois, which is now the sixth most popular U.S. state for overseas visitors.<p>

Besides the direct economic impact, tourism generates jobs; in fact approximately one in 10 Illinois workers is directly or indirectly dependent on tourism for employment.  In 1995, the Illinois travel industry employed 335,500 workers and contributed to the need for another 354,700 indirect jobs.  The travel-generated payroll in Illinois was $5.8 billion, an increase of 3.8 percent over 1994.<p>  

Travel is also good for the state treasury.  Travelers in Illinois contributed $3.7 billion in taxes during 1995.  State hotel/motel taxes, a portion of which fund all Illinois tourism programs, were up 10 percent during that time, reaching $111.7 million.<p>

The Illinois Bureau of Tourism is working with its Illinois travel partners to continue this record of success.  In addition to the successful "Million Miles from Monday" campaign, the Bureau administers a sophisticated travel counseling system that enables customers to customize travel plans with a simple phone call (1-800-2-CONNECT, TTY users call 800/406-6418); a web site (www.enjoyillinois.com) that gives users trip ideas, trip planning opportunities and updates on festivals and events; and an ambitious international marketing initiative that targets travelers in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The Bureau also administers the Tourism Matching Grant program, the Tourism Private Sector grant program, and the Illinois Convention and Visitors Bureau grant program, which provide assistance to local units of government and local organizations to help promote and market travel-related activities in their areas.<p>

New technologies being implemented by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism enable the Bureau to identify Illinois' best tourism customers, thus making it easier to target efforts toward motivating them to travel in Illinois.  These technologies, combined with the Bureau's other activities, should help to keep Illinois at the forefront in travel industry growth.<p>

<h3>ENERGYWISE HOMES OF ILLINOIS GETS TOP BILLING IN SUN-TIMES ARTICLE</h3>

DCCA's EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program recently received front-page status in the Chicago Sun-Times weekend HOMELIFE section.  The story, which pointed out ways the program can help homeowners save substantial dollars while promoting energy conservation, has been a real boost to efforts to educate the general public about the benefits of home energy conservation.<p>

The story, written by Hilary Anderson, focused on energy-efficient mortgages that use standardized ratings to determine the energy efficiency of both newly-constructed homes and existing dwellings.  By qualifying for an Energy Edge Mortgage (EEM), those who purchase energy-efficient homes often can extend their debt ratios, thus enabling them to purchase a higher-priced home because of its lower monthly energy costs.  Energy Improvement Mortgages (EIMs) that finance improvements that make existing homes more energy efficient also are available to many current homeowners and those seeking to purchase such homes.<p>

To qualify for the special mortgages, homes must undergo an energy audit, conducted by a certified home energy rater.  These raters collect data on the home's energy efficiency and enter the data into a computer at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling.  DCCA then issues a home energy rating and a report that recommends areas where energy improvements could be made.<p>  

The ratings may be used by homeowners or builders to assist in qualifying for the special loans, but they also can be used as important informational tools in helping homeowners identify ways to increase a home's energy efficiency.<p>

For more information about the EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program, contact John Marley at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling at 217/785-2007 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>IMA ANNOUNCES TEAM EXCELLENCE AWARD COMPETITION</h3>

Move over Bulls, Blackhawks and Bears -- a whole new kind of team spirit is sweeping Illinois, and it's saving Illinois companies thousands of dollars every year.  Employees of Illinois companies are teaming together to develop innovative ways to improve quality, reduce costs and build enthusiasm on the job.  These impressive efforts are deserving of recognition, and they're getting it through the Illinois Team Excellence Award.<p>

The Illinois Team Excellence Award was founded by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association to provide a forum for Illinois employees to show how their involvement, teamwork and innovation make Illinois businesses more competitive and successful.  In the past four years, nearly 100 companies have illustrated their team projects in 15-minute presentations to audiences of peers, program judges and the public in the competition for this Illinois team-based quality award.<p>

Everybody wins in the Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Team players whose ideas have worked to better the company take to the stage with their projects and shine in the spotlight.  Companies supporting teamwork demonstrate and publicize their commitment to employee empowerment.  The program is an active exchange among the state's most innovative companies and employees, sharing ideas for a strong and healthy business climate in Illinois.<p>

Since excellence knows no boundaries, the program welcomes all Illinois businesses, be they manufacturing, service, government agencies, educational institutions and health care providers.<p>

This year, the Illinois Team Excellence Award program culminated in the IMA's Quest for Excellence, a day of teaching, training, learning and celebrating people and quality held in October in Rosemont.  Nine teams that had advanced from the regional stage of the competition polished their team presentations for one more performance to a record-breaking crowd.  While teams presented their projects throughout the day, breakout sessions featured expert speakers on issues such as management practices in the 21st Century, organizational survival in the next century, recognizing and rewarding employees and continuous quality improvement.<p>

In the end, Motorola, Quartz Products Division, of Schaumburg claimed the large company title, and Craftsman Custom Metal Fabricators, Inc. of Schiller Park netted the top small company prize.  The silver medal in the large company division went to Caterpillar Inc.'s Aurora plant, and bronze to Brach and Brock Confections of Chicago.  Rockford's Zenith Cutter Co. claimed the silver in the small company division, and Alpharma of Chicago Heights took home the bronze.<p>

Companies of all shapes and sizes with a plant or headquarters in Illinois are invited to participate in the 1997 Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Entry forms will be available in February.  A video of the 1996 Illinois Team Excellence Awards also is available from the Illinois Manufacturers' Association at a cost of $9.00.  <p>

For an application or more information about the Illinois Team Excellence Award program, contact Jane Frech, vice president of Public Affairs, at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, 220 E. Adams St., Springfield, IL  62701-1123.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS KEY TO THE FUTURE OF ILLINOIS COAL</h3>

Developing new export markets for Illinois coal is key to the future of the coal mining industry in our state, according to a new report, Export Markets for Illinois Coal, prepared for DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).<p>

The report notes that global demand for coal will rise dramatically over the next decade as more countries turn to coal for electricity generation.  In particular, the Atlantic market is expected to grow by 20 to 30 million tons.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Gov. Jim Edgar's senior adviser for economic development, said, "Our goal should be to identify where Illinois coal can be competitive and target those markets.  There are some 'niche' markets we should be able to penetrate -- markets where Illinois producers can deliver the coal efficiently and where the quality of our coal matches the demand of the buyers."<p>

Aggressive industry marketing resulted in a ten-fold increase in Illinois coal exports in 1995, reaching a record 2.7 million tons, with Morocco, Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark as major buyers.  Kustra noted that a new $2 million initiative, recently announced by Gov. Edgar, will be instrumental in OCDM's efforts to further market Illinois coal to prospective buyers.  The funds will be used to develop information and contacts that Illinois coal producers can use to target specific foreign markets.  <p>

"The Illinois coal industry continues to face many challenges," Kustra said.  "We are committed to working closely with the industry to help promote Illinois coal exports.  Exports represent not only a realistic marketing objective, but a potential stabilizing force in these challenging times."<p>

<h3>FEDERAL GRANT HELPS EXPAND TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED ILLINOIS MANUFACTURERS</h3>

Small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois just got a better tool to help their efforts to utilize new technologies to modernize and expand for the future.<p>

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recently awarded a $2.67 million grant that, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants and in-kind contributions from private resources, will help the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center (IMEC) expand and improve its services. IMEC, located at Bradley University in Peoria with sub-centers on the campuses of Rock Valley College in Rockford and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, is part of DCCA's statewide Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois.  IMEC field offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield and Edwardsville.  DCCA was a partner both in the creation of IMEC and in the preparation of the successful grant application.  <p>

IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The federal grant will help IMEC expand its offerings at existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  The goal is to ensure that 80 percent of the state's small and medium-sized manufacturers can access an office within 40 miles of their locations.<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger," said Gov. Jim Edgar.  The Governor pointed out that the grant, coupled with his administration's financial support over the past several years, will mean that the state's small and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

IMEC and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois replace the pilot "Project COMPETE" technology extension effort.<p>

<h2 align=center>December, 1996</h2>
<HR>

<h3>JTPA WINNERS DEMONSTRATE ILLINOIS' "CAN-DO" ATTITUDE</h3>

The Twelfth Annual Illinois Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Awards Banquet, held in Springfield in October, demonstrated once again why Illinois' workforce development efforts consistently lead the nation:  the attitude of JTPA's administrators, participants and the employers whose support of the program makes it all worthwhile.  Those employers include Kraft Foods, Inc. and WQAD-TV, winners of the 1996 JTPA Private Sector Awards.<p>

Kraft, nominated by the Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County (PIC), sponsors numerous programs designed to promote workforce development efforts.  From an education/teacher training program that encourages minorities to pursue careers in education and provides funds to institutions that concentrate on these programs, to contributing staff, funds and products to support PIC's efforts, Kraft has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to the betterment of the state's workforce.  Kraft also is a significant contributor to the Resource Development Campaign, a pool of funds contributed by private sector firms to provide scholarships for people who do not wish to seek public assistance but need financial aid to pursue skills training.  Kraft's leadership has been instrumental in convincing other companies to participate in the workforce development system.<p>

WQAD-TV, Channel Eight, takes its public service commitment to the Quad Cities area seriously.  When Special Projects Director Clifford Brockman heard that federal funding for the area's Summer Youth Program was unlikely, he approached the Workforce Employment and Training Center with a strategy.  The "Kids Count Job Exchange," using television to match job seekers with available jobs, was born.  WQAD staffers wrote scripts, traveled to local high schools to shoot video resumes from participating youths, amd approached businesses to encourage their participation as employers or sponsors.  A live broadcast, backed by phone banks, featured the video resumes and fielded calls from youths and potential employers.  The Kids Count Job Exchange helped ensure that many Quad City-area youths found the jobs they needed.<p>

Businesses like Kraft and WQAD-TV are instrumental in Illinois' efforts to build a skilled, productive workforce.  Also key are the efforts of individual programs, program staffers and participants.<p>

The TARGET program, operated by DuPage Job Training, is an example.  TARGET is designed to give women the ability to set realistic goals and plan a career path leading to economic independence.  The program includes career guidance, employment and training opportunities, life skills training and job search/placement assistance.  TARGET successfully graduated 93 percent of those enrolled in its 1995 program, with 77 percent of those entering employment.  Thirty-four percent were trained and obtained employment in a non-traditional job, far surpassing the U.S. Department of Labor standard of 6 percent. <p> 
Martha Kahle, Field Office Supervisor for the Northwest Suburban Employment and Training Center, Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County, is one of the JTPA staffers singled out for recognition this year.  As Supervisor, Martha has instituted policies in the Center to ensure that clients are served in a professional, courteous environment.  But beyond her administrative duties, Martha often works 12 hour days, Saturdays and Sundays to accommodate the needs of her clients.<p>

Typical of this year's participant winners was Angela Bowers, a single mother of two.  Although she worked in housekeeping at a local hotel, Angie's salary was not enough -- she needed public assistance to feed and support herself and her children.  Angie realized that her high school diploma would not qualify her for the kind of job opportunities she needed.  With the help of the Business Employment Skills Team, Inc. (BEST), the JTPA  provider serving Bureau, LaSalle, Lee and Putnam counties, Angie enrolled at Sauk Valley College studying medical transcription.  Despite her many responsibilities and the tragic death of her father in an automobile accident, Angie earned high grades.  Today, Angie has realized her dream and is employed full-time as a medical transcriptionist at KSB Hospital.<p>

JTPA's stories are often inspirational and always gratifying.  In Illinois, the private sector, state government, area service providers, staff and participants are dedicated to the concept that training, hard work and opportunities can keep Illinois' workforce among the best qualified in the world.<p>

<h3>MAPPING PROGRAM WINS NATIONAL RECOGNITION</h3>

The Mapping the Future of Your Community Program, administered by the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs (IIRA) at Western Illinois University and sponsored by DCCA and the Governor's Rural Affairs Council, recently received the 1996 Innovation Award from the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO).<p>

MAPPING, which is an acronym for Management and Planning Programs involving Non-metropolitan Groups, is a series of community-based strategic visioning and planning sessions designed to help rural community leaders create a long-term focus ad action plan for community and economic development.  Since its inception, the program has worked with approximately 50 communities, as well as more than 20 school districts and health agencies to help them develop integrated decision-making plans.<p>

Norman Walzer, IIRA Director, said MAPPING is an exciting program because it is based on local initiatives and incorporates University talent in addressing local needs.  "We're trying to create a seamless approach," Walzer said.  "We start with the MAPPING program to help a community set its vision.  This can lead to participation with DCCA's Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) or Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra's Main Street program, helping community leaders take the necessary steps to develop that vision.  Another step may be to bring in a Peace Corps Fellow to provide the necessary technical expertise to help the community further develop its goals and objectives."<p>

Steve Kline, director of the MAPPING effort, said the program often works with clusters of communities rather than individual communities.  "We try to get communities with shared interests to work together; for example, communities within a large rural school district might work together to develop a regional vision, as well as a vision for each community." <p>

Kline said the enthusiasm generated within the communities is encouraging.  "In Havana, community leaders wanted to open a shuttered movie theater.  With permission from the owner, they went in, cleaned up the theater, and held a community meeting there.  They turned on the lights, popped popcorn, and attracted more than 200 people who could see the vision in action and find a way to participate."<p>

IIRA staff work with about six new communities and five school districts each year, as well as following up with technical assistance to communities that have completed the MAPPING program.  A current project involves working with rural communities to help them create community home pages on the World Wide Web.<p>

MAPPING was featured at the NADO national conference as a model program and also will be highlighted in a special report to be distributed to community development professionals throughout the U.S.<p>

Gov. Jim Edgar visited the SIU-Carbondale campus in October to announce a $2 million coal marketing initiative to be administered by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  The new program will help Illinois coal producers expand their sales into growing domestic and international coal markets, and also address infrastructure limitations that affect the production and movement of coal within and out of Illinois.  Illinois coal exports increased to 2.7 million tons in 1995, up from 236,000 tons in 1994.  The new initiative is expected to increase coal exports to 5 million tons by the year 2000.<p>

<h3>APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE FOR GOVERNOR'S HOME TOWN AWARDS</h3>

It's time once again to think about honoring the commitments made by volunteers in Illinois communities by nominating their efforts for recognition in the 16th Annual Governor's Home Town Awards program.<p>

Any local government, community-based organization or volunteer group within Illinois is eligible to enter the competition.  Successful entries typically involve volunteer efforts to make their communities a better place to live, work and do business.  Projects must demonstrate broad volunteer support and participation.  Although projects that span more than one year are acceptable, judges will only examine activities accomplished within the most recent calendar year.<p>

Projects are judged using four criteria:  addressing a specific community need; heavy involvement of volunteer resources; generating results; and community support.  Projects compete against those conducted in communities of similar population size.  Each population category includes specific categories under which projects may apply.  These include General Awards (efforts on behalf of the community at-large), Youth Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's youths and/or projects that directly benefit youths), Economic Development (projects involving volunteers that help create or retain jobs in the community), and Senior Citizen Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's seniors and/or projects that directly benefit senior citizens.)<p>

Communities compete for first, second, third and fourth place awards in each of the categories.  First-place winners compete against each other for the coveted Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy awarded each year to the project most representative of Illinois volunteerism during that year.  Judging is done by a group of volunteers who represent organizations that have won Governor's Home Town Awards in the past.  Awards are presented during a recognition banquet, which will be held in Springfield in June 1997.<p>

The deadline to apply for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards is February 21, 1997.  For further information or an application guidebook, contact Lou Ann Ladage at DCCA, phone 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>1997 COAL CALENDARS NOW AVAILABLE</h3>
<h4>by Barbara Antonini, Office of Coal Development and Marketing</h4>

The 1997 Coal Calendars are now available!<p>

Each year, hundreds of fifth- and sixth-grade students from throughout the state submit essays and art work about the Illinois coal industry and its importance to our state.  The winning work is displayed in the Illinois Coal Calendar, showcasing their efforts.<p>

This year's calendar, the eighth annual calendar, is particularly noteworthy.  J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health at the U.S. Department of Labor, said the calendar reaches out to the mining community and is a daily reminder of the need for safety in our mines.  In fact, McAteer was so impressed with the calendar that he requested the original art work be available for display at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia.  Each poster has been matted and placed in an oak frame for the display, which provides an opportunity for many industry students and international visitors to the Academy to view the ways that young Illinoisans communicate important safety messages.  McAteer also sent personal congratulatory letters to the 25 students whose essays and art work are reproduced in the calendar.<p>

The 1997 Coal Calendar Contest was co-sponsored by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, and the Coal Research Center, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  To request a calendar or for further information about the contest, contact Barbara Antonini, DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, 325 W. Adams, Springfield, IL 62704, phone 217/524-3280 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA EFFORTS RECOGNIZED BY ILLINOIS EPA</h3>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN) recently received 1996 Certificates of Commendation from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) for their work in helping implement the "Clean Break" environmental amnesty program in Illinois.<p>

Clean Break, a recently-completed initiative enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, gave auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties resulting from environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program was founded on the theory that most small business owners want to comply with environmental regulations but need help to determine what those regulations are.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program served as an initial contact for the program, enabling business owners to seek information on a confidential basis.  The Illinois Small Business Development Center Network sponsored numerous local seminars to explain Clean Break and helped with intake.<p>

The IEPA's Certificate of Commendation recognizes individuals or groups for outstanding contributions to protection of the environment or other significant achievements in Illinois.  DCCA also receoved a Certificate for its work during 1995.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS F.I.R.S.T. PROMOTES ILLINOIS' POSITIVE BUSINESS CLIMATE</h3>
<h4>by Peter W. Ramirez, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. (Focused Industrial Retention Support Team) is off and running.  Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a joint effort that brings together the resources of DCCA and Argonne National Laboratory, NORBIC (North Business and Industrial Council), Chicagoland Enterprise Center, ComEd, People's Gas and the Chicago Tribune to identify and assist manufacturers interested in expanding, modernizing, relocating, training, retraining or developing new technologies.<p>    

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a pro-active effort that specifically targets manufacturers in Northern Illinois.  Initially, businesses are contacted with an outreach letter from Gov. Jim Edgar, which is followed up by a phone call from Illinois F.I.R.S.T.  After an initial screening, a Client Summary Sheet is filled out that establishes the position of the company and the problems and challenges it faces.  Resources and information are then provided to assist with the client's needs, with all activities tracked and recorded, and files monitored constantly.  In addition, a follow-up survey is sent to each client to provide Illinois F.I.R.S.T. with client satisfaction information.<p>  
 
The response of the manufacturing community to this pilot effort has been gratifying.  Using both marketing efforts and a direct mail campaign, Illinois F.I.R.S.T. has contacted 320 manufacturers.  To date, 70 of these businesses have received information or technical assistance with expansion support, environmental issues, integrated management support, production evaluation, relocation and site selection, training, workers compensation and turnaround services.<p>  

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. continues to work with the private sector to expand its efforts.  The partnership has engaged the Society of the Plastics Industry, American Plastics Industry, and the American Electronics Association to host industry summit meetings to discuss the needs of these specific industries.  It is working with the DuPage Area Association of Business and Industry to assist with client screening and intake.  And nearly two dozen additional professionals have agreed to provide pro bono services in their areas of expertise<p>.

For information about Illinois F.I.R.S.T., contact Peter W. Ramirez in DCCA's Bureau of Business Development at 312/814-5252 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TQM TEAMS MAKING A DIFFERENCE</h3>
<h4>by Karen Ruwe, DCCA Division of Fiscal Management</h4>

DCCA's efforts to incorporate the principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) into the agency's processes are beginning to show an impact that will benefit the agency's clients, as well as streamline DCCA's internal processes.  The efforts of the Grant Processing Team, for example, are expected to cut the time it takes for DCCA to process grants, thus improving the grants cycle for external clients.<p>

The Grant Processing Team set out last spring to review the manner in which DCCA processes and awards grants.  The Team conducted both cycle time and quality defect studies to determine where changes could be made.<p>

The Team's review resulted in the elimination of Financial Commitment Committee (FCC) approval for all grant programs that currently have an approved internal review process in place.  With the aid of the Chief Internal Auditor, quality review processes were documented and approved for most grant programs.  These steps are expected to cut grant processing time by approximately two weeks per grant.<p>

The Grant Processing Team also recommended standardizing the agency's grant boilerplates.  DCCA's Legal office, working with representatives from program and fiscal staff, has already completed work on standardizing boilerplate sections that are the same in all agency grants.  Meetings are currently being held to complete program-specific boilerplates.  It is expected that boilerplate standardization will lower the chances that incorrect boilerplate sections are used, and thus lessen the time needed for grant review and copying.<p>

The Grant Processing Team continues to look at new ways to streamline and improve DCCA's grant processes.  Areas now being considered for study include further automation of the review and approval process, and paperwork reduction efforts.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS BUSINESSES LEARNING TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS</h3>
<h4>by Don McGee, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling </h4>

Businesses are often large users of energy.  To help them identify energy conservation practices that can help them reduce energy usage, DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling and Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS), have joined with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIU-C) to establish a prototype energy educational project for regional businesses.<p>   

The new program, Creating Energy Management Opportunities for Industry (CEMOI), under direction of professor Manohar Kulkarni, PE, Ph.D., of the SIU-C Department of Mechanical Engineering and Energy Processes, provides businesses with on-site energy inspections conducted by the university's graduate and engineering students.  Each student receives specialized energy training from DCCA Energy staff and CIPS service representatives to teach ways to identify immediate, low-cost and no-cost dollar savings for businesses.<p>  

As part of the service, Illinois businesses receiving an energy inspection from CEMOI staff are provided an executive summary of the findings.  Participating businesses will receive an "Energy Analysis Report" identifying potential dollar-saving opportunities that require no financial investment or a small investment.  CEMOI also will develop and maintain, free of charge, an Energy Resources Directory, which will include information about private sector energy service providers in their region, as well as governmental and educational resources that are available to assist area businesses.<p>  

This fall, CIPS sponsored a CEMOI kick-off luncheon at the SIU-C Incubator.   Professor Kulkarni reported that in just the preliminary phases of the program, eight businesses receiving services have already realized an average savings of $1500 per business or 10 percent of their annual costs, with a maximum of a five-month payback on investment.<p>   

It is hoped that, with DCCA's assistance and regional support from the private sector, the CEMOI program will eventually become a self-sustaining business assistance program in Southern Illinois.<p>

The CEMOI office is located in the SIU-C Incubator facility at 150 East Pleasant Hill Road, Carbondale, IL  62901-6890, phone 618/453-2067.  Or, for further information, contact Don McGee at DCCA at 217/785-2862 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA WINS 1996 "WEB WARRIOR" AWARD</h3>

DCCA's Internet home page is winning recognition for its business savvy.  The page recently was named as the Sixth Place Winner of the "1996 Web Warrior Award" by Fuld & Company Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a pioneer in the field of competitive and regional intelligence that provides assistance to economic development organizations and utility companies to help them define their competitive advantages.<p>

Fuld & Company selected DCCA's site after a review of more than 100 Websites from around the world.  Using as its criteria Clarity, Strategic Focus, Business Climate, Depth of Resources, and Access to Information, company officials examined the sites from the corporate CEO's perspective and what that individual would need to know when considering relocating or expanding a facility in a region.  The company noted that, "With more than 50 million worldwide users and over 600,000 businesses on-line, the World Wide Web is today's global marketplace.  To effectively compete in this new arena, economic development agencies need to provide relevant, timely and targeted information to business leaders and investors."<p>

In reviewing DCCA's Website, Fuld & Company noted, "The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs wants your business in Illinois and they have the professional staff, relevant information, and assistance programs to help make your decision an easy one.   This is a no-frills, hands-on site that provides good, detailed information and access to individual assistance to help you find the right location."<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS DISLOCATED WORKER PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO WIN RECOGNITION</h3>

Illinois continues to lead the way in promoting excellence in its services to dislocated workers.  Recently, six more of Illinois' 26 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) were certified as members of the Enterprise, joining nine of their Illinois counterparts as members of this prestigious organization.  Today, nearly 58 percent of Illinois' SDAs are Enterprise members; nationally the average is only 25 percent.  The only states even close to Illinois in membership are Florida, where 48 percent of the state's organizations have won recognition, and Texas, where 34 percent of organizations are members.<p>

What is so important about Enterprise membership?  Selection to the Enterprise signals that a dislocated worker organization is dedicated to providing excellent services to its clients.  To receive membership in the Enterprise, an organization has to achieve at least an 80 percent placement rate for those enrolled in dislocated worker programs, meet or exceed the employment standard for Governor's reserve and national discretionary projects, achieve a rate of at least 75 percent on a standard customer satisfaction survey administered by an independent research firm, and demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in 10 quality management dimensions.<p>

Enterprise membership also is rewarding for those organizations that achieve it.  Members benefit from advanced training and assistance provided by nationally-recognized experts and their peers.  In fact, even the process of applying for membership has benefits because the organizations can get important feedback from the independent customer satisfaction survey.<p>

Illinois' leadership is nothing new.  Illinois has long been recognized as a leader in administering the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program.  Between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1996, 30,588 dislocated workers were served by Illinois' dislocated worker programs.  Of the 17,577 who completed the program, 8,623 re-entered the labor force at an average wage of $10.48 per hour.<p>  

Last year, nine Illinois organizations were named as Charter Members of the Enterprise -- more than any other state.  Equally significant, although only about 4 percent of the nation's SDAs are in Illinois, Illinois SDAs account for nearly one-tenth of the nation's Enterprise members -- a significant measure of the quality of Illinois' services.<p>

<h3>DCCA TARGETS "ORPHAN WASTES"</h3>
<h4>by Angie Adkins, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling</h4>

DCCA's Technology and Practices Demonstration Program (TPDP) has taken on the issue of so-called "orphan wastes" in Illinois.  Orphan wastes -- discarded materials other than conventional recyclables, such as aluminum and tin cans, glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and paper -- often have the potential to be recycled, but face obstacles due to collection and processing problems.<p>  

The Bureau of Energy and Recycling recently awarded grants to the DuPage County Solid Waste Department and a Springfield paint store as part of its effort to encourage more recycling of orphan wastes.<p>

Studies have shown that construction and demolition wastes may contribute up to one-third of the wastes disposed in landfills.  At present, only clean sources of concrete and asphalt rubble from highway construction are routinely recycled as aggregate.  The DuPage County Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Project will identify quantities and types of debris generated in the construction and demolition process, and identify and implement opportunities for recycling.  <p>

DuPage County will contract for waste audits of a number of selected construction sites that volunteer to participate in the project.  Each contractor will receive the results of the audit, educational materials on methods to separate and prepare wastes for recycling, a directory of recycling service providers, and an analysis of the potential savings in waste disposal costs.  The contractors also will be surveyed at a later date to determine whether recycling activities have increased, and by what amount.<p>

The $64,488 grant will pay for subcontractor costs to conduct the waste audits and to develop educational materials for construction and demolition contractors.  Project results will be used to create two documents -- a Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Manual, and a Directory of Construction and Demolition recycling service providers in the Chicagoland area.  The USEPA has agreed to pay for costs associated with publishing the manual and directory.<p>

A $15,474 grant to Friedman's Wallpaper and Paints in Springfield will enable the firm to purchase a Mobile Earth Safe Paint Can Crusher.  Up to 90 percent of the waste collected at IEPA's household hazardous waste collection events has been leftover paint.  A mobile can crusher can promote recycling by eliminating hand scraping, paint fume inhalation, drying time and storage consideration.  <p>

Under the project, citizens may bring leftover paint cans to Friedman's or other participating drop-off locations.  The cans are placed in the mobile can crusher, which can crush up to 15 cans at a time.  Excess paints, as well as the cans, are retrieved for recycling, with the cans sent to a local recycler for further processing.<p>

Because the equipment is mobile, it can easily be transported to other Springfield-area communities for paint can recycling drives.<p>

For further information about the Technology and Practices Demonstration Program, contact Angie Adkins in DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling, at 217/785-2808 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>HENDERSON, COIL NAMED "ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS OF THE YEAR"</h3>

Two DCCA staffers were recently singled out for special awards for their efforts to promote the state's economic development.<p>

Craig Coil, Manager of DCCA's Industry Development Division, was named "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Development Council (IDC) during its fall conference held in Chicago.  Tom Henderson, who manages several DCCA programs including the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program, was selected as "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA) at the organization's conference, which was held in conjunction with the IDC conference.<p>

Coil, who joined DCCA in 1988, heads a staff of 18 project managers and regional representatives who work to help businesses locate, expand and prosper in Illinois.  During Fiscal Year 1996, projects undertaken by the Industry Development staff culminated in a capital investment in Illinois totaling more than $1.2 billion that will create nearly 9,000 jobs and retain more than 14,000 jobs.<p>

IDC President Lori Healey said Coil was nominated by several colleagues.  "Craig works hard and has earned the respect of his peers across the state.  We felt he demonstrated the qualities we look for in an exemplary professional in the economic development field."<p>

The IDC has presented the award annually for more than a decade.<p>

IEZA President Jeanne Gustafson said the organization unanimously chose Henderson as the first recipient of its new award.  "Tom has served as an excellent ambassador for the State of Illinois and has initiated and coordinated several partnerships between local and state levels," she said.  As examples, she cited a contract between DCCA and the IEZA for training of local enterprise zone administrators, a joint effort to place an ad in Expansion Management magazine and an Industrial Park survey. <p>   

Henderson, an small business owner who served as an internal auditor for the Illinois Department of Transportation and in numerous private banking positions before joining DCCA,  is an active member of the IEZA, the American Enterprise Zone Association, the Illinois Tax Increment Association and the IDC.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF ILLINOIS' ECONOMY</h3>

Exporting continues to grow in its importance to the Illinois economy.  Every dollar of exports generates four cents in state tax revenue.  Equally impressive, one in eight jobs in Illinois (and one in four manufacturing jobs) is dependent on exporting.  In  1995, more than 453,000 Illinoisans were employed in jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.<p>

For the most part, these are both high-paying and permanent jobs.  Exporting companies tend to pay employees higher wages than plants that produce only for the domestic marketplace.  Exporting companies also tend to be larger than others; on average they are four times as large in employment and six times as large in sales.  Companies that export experience high worker productivity, estimated at 30 to 50 percent higher than in non-exporting companies.  Further, value-added per employee is up to 33 percent greater in exporting plants than in non-exporting plants, and sales per employee tend to be 50 percent greater in exporting companies than in non-exporting firms.  <p>

Export-related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois.  Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, substantially exceed the U.S. average.<p>

In addition, exporting companies are more innovative.  Exporters adopt new technologies far more frequently than non-exporters and report more significant benefits from doing so.  This tendency is especially strong in fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and transportation equipment -- key industrial sectors in Illinois.<p>

DCCA is serious about its efforts to help Illinois businesses expand their exporting opportunities.  With five International Trade Centers located throughout the state, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, and foreign trade offices in Brussels, Belgium; Hong Kong; Tokyo, Japan; Mexico City, Mexico; Warsaw, Poland; and Budapest, Hungary, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and seasoned companies alike enter the export marketplace and build upon their exporting potential.<p>  

The efforts are working.  Illinois ranked fifth in the nation among the top 10 exporting states in 1995 -- the second consecutive year our state improved its ranking.  Illinois' export growth is evidenced by double-digit export increases in 1993, 1994, and 1995  (24.6 percent, 20.2 percent and 23.6 percent respectively.)  Illinois exports reached an all-time high of $32.6 billion in 1995, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1994 and nearly double the 13.8 percent increase of all U.S. exports for the same period. <p>

<h3>BIDC WINS NATIONAL HONORS</h3>

As part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, the National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA) recently created two new awards recognizing researchers' contributions to the success of state economic development programs.  The  Illinois Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) program, administered by DCCA, won an Honorable Mention in the national competition.<p>

The Illinois Business and Industry Data Center is an innovative way to use an existing program to make it easier for small businesses, independent contractors, and entrepreneurs to access the statistical data they need to make critical business decisions.  Modeled after the U.S. Census Bureau's State Data Center and Business and Industry Data Center, the BIDC is a network of 28 local and regional affiliates, many from colleges and universities, regional planning commissions, public libraries, and small business development centers.<p>  

Local affiliates deal directly with small businesses and other end users of data.  Regional affiliates collect and disseminate information to both end users and local affiliates.  Regional affiliates also prepare quarterly regional analyses that can be distributed to businesses and development offices statewide.<p>  

The BIDC program magnifies DCCA's ability to serve the research needs of entrepreneurs and the Illinois small business community by enabling users to get information locally and tap the resources of a multitude of organizations throughout the state.<p>

NASDA selected the BIDC for recognition from 21 applicants.  In naming BIDC for the Honorable Mention, NASDA said the project demonstrated a key contribution to state economic development efforts, a unique approach to utilizing researchers as part of the economic development team, a potential for applicability in other states, support for economic development across program areas, and the ability to measure success for the research component of the activity, as well as the activity itself.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS COAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD AWARDS <br>
COAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FUNDING</h3>

Illinois continues to advance clean-coal technologies that allow for the environmentally sound, cost-effective use of our state's high-sulfur coal.  Most recently, the Illinois Coal Development Board awarded more than $3 million for the performance of 34 laboratory-scale research projects and two development-scale, clean-coal technology projects.  DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) will issue grants for these projects which will be monitored by the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI).<p>

Research into clean-coal technologies is essential to the future of Illinois coal because without these technologies, the market for Illinois' high-sulfur coal will erode.  Most of the basic and applied research is performed at universities, private research institutions and national laboratories.  The research is divided into five categories: coal preparation (cleaning), gas cleanup, coal-related wastes (by-products) management, conversion and combustion.<p>  

Two of the recently awarded projects are development, or proof-of-concept, projects.  The first will test a coal/water slurry in cyclone boilers at the SIPCO power plant in Marion, Illinois.  This technology will help to reduce nitrogen oxide levels (NOx), as well as some sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate in the flue gas.  NOx and SO2 are considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency as major contributors to acid rain.  The second development project will test high-sulfur coal in a flue-gas scrubber that will remove SO2, NOx , and very fine, respirable particulate.  Both projects are highly leveraged, so the Illinois Coal Development Board receives a significant "bang for its buck."<p>

Both projects are in step with the goals of the Board, which is chaired by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  The Board believes the time is now to build on existing markets and open new markets for Illinois coal, particularly since more stringent Clean Air Act emission limitations for SO2 will be enforceable in 2000 and 2005, and projected NOx-emission reductions loom on the horizon.  Illinois coal has many advantages, such as a high Btu rating, or heating value, but the high sulfur content is a clear disadvantage.  And, although many current, coal-fired, power company compliance strategies include use of clean-coal technologies, they also include switching to low-sulfur Western coal, which leads to a significant loss in Illinois coal sales contracts and related jobs.<p>  

This makes clean-coal technology research even more important.  The Board, the OCDM and the ICCI are faced with difficult decisions in determining which types of clean-coal technologies and marketing strategies to advance.  But, thanks to grants such as these, new technologies are being tested and, as technologies are advanced, more companies are projected to put them in place, thus rejuvenating the Illinois coal industry in the post-2005 period.<p>  

For more information about the funding of the research and development projects, contact Michael Purnell of DCCA's Office of Coal Development & Marketing at 217-785-0010 (TDD: 217-785-0211).<p>

<h3>LINCOLN FOUNDATION AWARDS PROMOTE ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE</h3>

Continuous improvement -- both in products and services -- is the key to organizational success in today's competitive global economy.  The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, which is privately supported, is helping encourage Illinois organizations to undertake continuous improvement programs and quality excellence by means of self-assessment tools, best practice workshops, conferences, and the relatively new Award for Business Excellence (ABE).<p>  

Similar to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, but adapted to the needs of Illinois, the ABE focuses on seven areas deemed essential for organizational success:  leadership; information and analysis; strategic planning; human resource development and management; process management; business results; customer focus and satisfaction.  The award is accessible to both small and large organizations in industry, service, health care and education.  Starting in 1997, the Award will also be available to state and local units of government.<p>

Participation in The Lincoln Foundation program provides a number of important benefits to organizations.  First, by using the Foundation's self-assessment guidelines, organizations can assess their operations against the Foundation's criterial of excellence.  Second, by attending best practice workshops put on by the Foundation, organizations can benchmark their performance with Lincoln Award winners, who share their experience with others.  Third, should an organization decide to apply for a Lincoln Award, it will receive valuable feedback about its operations from more than 60 leading experts from corporations and academia who serve as Lincoln Award examiners and judges -- at a nominal cost to the applicant.  And finally, participation in a continuous improvement program sends a strong signal to employees, customers and competitors that an organization is committed to excellence.  <p>

The actual process for applying for the ABE is explained in an Application Guidelines Book, available from The Lincoln Foundation.  At least five examiners review each application.  A panel of trained judges reviews the examiners' findings and determines finalists, who receive site visits.  Judges then determine if there are winners; winners receive awards at a formal ceremony in December.  Throughout this process, all application information is kept strictly confidential; only the names of Award winners are ever made public.<p>  

All organizations who apply for a Lincoln Award benefit, even if they do not receive an award.  This is because each organization submitting an application receives a detailed written feedback report that assesses its strengths and identifies areas for possible improvement.<p>  

Honeywell's Micro Switch Division in Freeport, and Cash Management Services at The First National Bank of Chicago, were last year's inaugural winners of the Industry and Services Awards.  Two new sectors -- Education and Health Care -- have been added this year, and Government Sector Awards will be added in 1997.<p>

The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence is currently reviewing applications for the 1996 Awards, which will be announced in November.  For further information, contact The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, 820 W. Jackson Boulevard, Suite #525, Chicago, IL  60607.<p>

<h3>NEW ORGANIZATION WILL ADVOCATE FOR ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESSES</h3>
<h4>by Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Saying, "Small business is big business in Illinois," Gov. Jim Edgar recently joined with many of the state's leading entrepreneurs to publicly announce the formation of the Illinois Small Business 100 (ISB100), a new advocacy group designed to provide insight, direction and guidance to the Illinois small business community.<p>

Their job is an important one.  Illinois has more than 617,000 small business owners, representing a diverse range of industries and services.  In fact, 85 percent of Illinois companies employ less than 100 people and, therefore, are classified as small businesses.<p>  

The ISB100 has targeted Internet services as an important way to communicate with Illinois small businesses. DCCA is facilitating the creation of the ISB 100's home page on the Internet, which will include a statement of purpose, as well as hotlinks to ISB 100 members' E-mail addresses, chambers of commerce and trade organizations.  Plans also call for creation of an ISB 100 newsgroup on the Internet to poll members about regulatory and business issues.  In addition, the ISB 100 plans to meet annually to discuss long-term plans and programs to assist in business development.<p>
 
Members of the group were selected from nominees submitted by trade associations, professional organizations, the Illinois Small Business Development Network, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and others.<p>

<h3>CAMP ENTREPRENEUR COMES TO ILLINOIS</h3>
<h4>by Susan Nicol, Office of Women's Business Development</h4>

Encouraging young women to pursue their dreams of entrepreneurship is one of the driving forces behind Camp Entrepreneur, an award-winning residential camp held each summer at Seton Hill College in Pennsylvania.  This year, DCCA's Office of Women's Business Development, in partnership with DePaul University's Department of Management, successfully coordinated Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago in Illinois.<p> 

In recent years, the original Camp Entrepreneur has provided comprehensive exposure to the principles of business ownership to more than 100 young women graduates.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago was designed as a week-long commuter day camp for young women in Cook County entering their junior or senior year in high school who have expressed interest in owning their own businesses.<p>

During the week, Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago campers participated in hands-on seminars presented by local business professionals who volunteered to work with the students in areas such as marketing, financing, management and effective decision making skills, business communications and technologies, utilization of resources, and creating a professional image.<p>

A highlight of the week was a full day devoted to site visits to Chicago area businesses that are owned and operated by women. The campers benefited from the presentations and discussions from a diverse group of women business owners who shared their experiences, and offered information and insight campers will reflect upon for the rest of their lives.  Another highlight was the campers' development of their own business plans, which were presented to a panel of business experts on graduation day.  Drawing upon newly acquired inspiration, their plans reflected the cumulative knowledge and skills they gained throughout the week, as well as true entrepreneurial approaches.  The panelists were unqualifiably impressed! <p>  

Historically, young women have not been exposed to entrepreneurship as a viable career option, nor have they been introduced to business skills.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago graduated 16 future leaders who are now positioned to recognize that they have the ability to run their own businesses, and they are equipped with the tools necessary to visualize their own futures and to create their own opportunities.<p>

With rave reviews from this year's graduates, sponsors, staff, and Chicagoland media, the Office of Women's Business Development and DePaul University are already talking about next year's program.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING CENTERS <br>
PROVIDE "ONE-STOP" ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS</h3>

All over Illinois, a quiet revolution is taking place in the way our state delivers employment and training services.  In March 1994, the first Illinois Employment and Training Center (IETC) opened, bringing together Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) services with those administered by the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES).  Within a few months, four more centers opened, and more than a dozen  centers were added during 1995.  The timetable is moving even faster today, thanks to a special grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to spur development of additional IETCs throughout the state to help both workers and employers easily access the employment, training and related social services information they need.<p>

IETCs are truly "one-stop" shops.  In the past, a dislocated or disadvantaged individual might have to travel all over town or between several different communities to access needed services.  He or she might need to visit an IDES office to register for unemployment insurance, a Service Delivery Area office to sign up for training and other services under JTPA, a Community College to register for classroom coursework, and to various other agencies to sign up for other services.  Likewise, some employers found it necessary to go to more than one location to obtain the kind of statistical information they needed to find skilled workers, and to access a pool of qualified potential employees.<p>

The IETC concept has changed all that.  IETCs consolidate these services under one roof.  For example, within a few minutes after walking into the IETC, a displaced worker can register for unemployment insurance, access computer job banks, sign up for JTPA programs, review a community college catalog, and receive the kind of detailed, one-on-one assistance needed to help get back into productive work.  At the same time, employers have access to qualified applicants, using Illinois' largest applicant database.  Staff at the IETC can identify individuals who meet a business' specific needs, from managerial to high-tech, to administrative support, and refer the best qualified candidates for the job.  Professional staff in the IETC also can help with specialized services, such as staff recruitment for mass hiring, customized training, and outplacement assistance.  The latest in statistics on the workforce and its skills is available, enabling businesses to locate potential employees.  In addition, employers can work closely with the local IETC to ensure that, as training programs are developed, they are tailored to meet the needs of the local employment community, creating a bank of potential employees armed with the skills local companies need.<p>

IETCs will also be a source of the latest labor market information (LMI) for schools, libraries and students.  LMI products will be available on-site and will be distributed by the IETC in hard copy and via computer.  Students and dropouts may also use the IETC to obtain career counseling and to learn about "second chance" education programs.<p>

IETCs offer an ambitious array of services.  They can provide career counseling to help workers assess their skills and research areas where those skills are needed.  They can help workers analyze their interests and pinpoint training that can help them learn the skills they need to follow their dreams.  They can even help students identify internship and apprenticeship opportunities that can lead to potential employment.<p>
 
Already, more than 40 IETCs are providing services to clients around the state.  <p>

More than 120 other agencies also are located in the IETCs, helping provide a truly comprehensive range of services.  Plans call for 55 full-service centers in Illinois by 1997, with more than 90 additional satellite facilities. <p>

It's easy to locate the IETC nearest you.  Check the IETC section on DCCA's home page on the Internet at http://www.ilcommerce.com/.   You'll find detailed information on the various centers, including addresses, hours of operation and telephone numbers, plus a detailed listing of services available to both employers and employees. <p> 

If you don't have Internet access, you can call 888/FOR-IETC (TDD users call 312/793-3184) to learn the location of the IETC nearest you.<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR<br>
Dennis Whetstone</h3>

Economic development is clearly a priority in most communities.  Knowing successful economic development techniques, however, may not always be so clear.   That's why, in October, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), along with the Illinois Development Council (IDC), will again sponsor the Basic Economic Development Course, designed to help economic development practitioners and community leaders help their communities become more competitive in the process of economic development. <p>

The Basic Economic Development Course is an intensive five-day course, directed by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and coordinated by DCCA's Rich Funderburk and Mary Renner.  Among sessions to be taught are building the foundation of a competitive community, influencing investment location, supporting existing business, stimulating international trade and entrepreneurship.  On Thursday, October 24, a special session will be held on "Servicing the Prospect."  That session is open to anyone interested in attending, even those who cannot attend the other sessions.  All sessions are taught by well-respected economic development professionals from throughout the United States, including Certified Economic Developers David Richmond of Shelbyville, Indiana; M. L. DuBrow of St. Louis; and Dean Whitaker of Holland, Michigan; consultants Kate McEnroe of McEnroe Consulting, Atlanta, Georgia; David Kolzow of Fluor Daniel Consulting, Greenville, South Carolina; and Eric Canada of Blane, Canada Ltd., Wheaton; John Quinn of the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, Carbondale; Doug Dougherty, executive director of the Governor's Rural Affairs Council; Michael Boer of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce; and Jeff Markland of DCCA's Office of Local Initiatives.<p>  

Participation in the Basic Economic Development Course provides graduates with a basic education that they can take back home and use in helping their communities become more successful in the economic development competition.  It also is the first step toward accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC), because graduates become eligible to attend the Economic Development Institute through the University of Oklahoma, where they can earn the coveted Certified Economic Developer accreditation.<p>

The October course will be the third Basic Economic Development Course DCCA has co-sponsored this year.  Already, nearly 100 DCCA staff people have completed the course, as well as staff people from many of our economic development partners, such as Small Business Development Centers, Community Action Agencies and others.  I feel that the course has been instrumental in helping DCCA staff to better serve you.<p>  

I heartily encourage economic development practitioners, local officials, chamber of commerce executives and others interested in making their communities more competitive to attend the next Basic Economic Development Course.  The course will be held October 21-25 on the campus of the University of Illinois-Springfield.  Registration should be made through the Office of Continuing Education, Campus Box 1084, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL  62026.  For further information, contact Dr. Robert Koepke at SIU-Edwardsville, telephone 618/692-2142, or Mary Renner at DCCA, 217/785-6097 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>SMALL BUSINESSES RECEIVE A "CLEAN BREAK"</h3>
<h4>by Annette Lingleo, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Nearly 300 Illinois auto body, auto repair and printing businesses have found it easier to comply with environmental laws, thanks to the Clean Break program, an initiative undertaken by DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).<p>

Clean Break is a program that gives auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts, while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties for environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program is based on the belief that most small business owners sincerely want to comply with environmental regulations, but need help in determining what the requirements are.  <p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program has served as the initial contact for the program, allowing business people to ask confidential questions while remaining anonymous to the enforcement agency.  Once a business owner feels comfortable in coming forward with environmental concerns, on-site technical assistance visits are arranged with the IEPA experts, who walk through a facility with its owner, discussing the business' specific requirements.  At that point, the owner can choose to go forward with the amnesty compliance agreement, working with the IEPA to set up a reasonable period of time in which to make corrections and achieve compliance with environmental rules.<p>

The Clean Break program was enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, which studied the challenges faced by small businesses in complying with federal clean air standards and other environmental rules.  To date, the program has received overwhelmingly positive response, and plans are now being made to expand it to serve other business segments.<p>

Clean Break also has had another benefit.  Working directly with small business owners gave IEPA officials a first-hand look at the impacts of various rules on businesses.  For example, many wastes from auto body and auto repair shops, such as oil filters and paint filters, are classified as "special waste," subject to additional disposal rules and regulations.  The IEPA discovered that the waste still ended up in the same place, but only after the business filled out mounds of paperwork.  The agency is now using the information it gathered to examine and correct rules that placed extra burdens on businesses while adding no protection to the environment.<p>	

To learn more about Clean Break, contact DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance helpline at 800/252-3998.<p>

<h3>STATE CLEARINGHOUSE NOW LOCATED AT DCCA'S CHICAGO OFFICE</h3>

Illinois organizations that receive federal funding are familiar with the State Clearinghouse.  Also known as the State Single Point of Contact, the State Clearinghouse must review all applications for federal funds before an organization may be eligible to receive those funds. <p> 

What organizations may not know, is that the State Clearinghouse is now a part of DCCA.  Administered by the staff of the Office of Policy Development, Planning and Research, the State Clearinghouse has recently moved to DCCA's Chicago Office.<p>

All correspondence with the State Clearinghouse should now be directed to:<p>

Virginia Bova, Single Point of Contact, DCCA, James R. Thompson Center, 100 W. Randolph, Suite 3-400, Chicago, IL  60601, phone 312/814-6028, fax 312/814-1800 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<hr>
<h3>WHAT IS THE STATE CLEARINGHOUSE?</h3>

Each year, the federal government awards billions of dollars in grants to fund a myriad of projects.  To ensure that state and local governments have a say in those projects, Executive Order 12372 was enacted in 1983, requiring federal agencies to designate certain programs and projects to be eligible for review by the states.  The Executive Order allowed each state to design a process to simplify giving state and local elected officials an opportunity to review and comment on these proposed projects.  Illinois created the Illinois State Clearinghouse, housed at the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), to handle this process.<p>

The process has several steps.  First, local grant applicants are encouraged to contact the State Clearinghouse prior to submitting an application to determine whether the grant they seek has been selected for review.  If so, the grant applicant submits the project proposal to the federal government, and sends the State Clearinghouse a standard form that includes basic project and program information.<p>

While federal officials begin reviewing the project, the State Clearinghouse assigns a State Application Identifier (SAI) number and distributes the project to reviewers representing 19 Regional Planning Commissions and 23 other organizations located throughout the state.<p>

Reviewers have 30 days in which to comment.  Any comments are submitted to both the State Clearinghouse and the applicant.  If no unfavorable comments are received, the State Clearinghouse issues a sign-off letter to the applicant, the applicable Regional Clearinghouse and the federal agency, noting the proposal's compatibility with state, regional and local development plans.  If negative comments are received, the sign-off letter will include suggestions on ways to address the compatibility defects.  Negative comments do not, however, prohibit an applicant from continuing the application process.<p>

The Illinois State Clearinghouse keeps on file a list of current grant applications submitted by various state agencies.  The State Clearinghouse also provides review for Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental assessments.<p>

<h3>NEW REPORT ANALYZES UTILITY RESTRUCTURING; EFFECT ON COAL</h3>

<em>by Dan Keefe, DCCA Division of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

As the electric utility industry moves away from regulated service and closer to a competitive marketplace, the Illinois coal industry faces an uncertain future, according to a new report from DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).  The report, "Illinois Coal Industry White Paper:  Understanding Electric Utility Restructuring," prepared by the Center for Regulatory Studies at Illinois State University, has been well-received by both coal and utility industry professionals as a thorough analysis of restructuring issues and their potential impact on coal markets.<p>

Just as telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking and natural gas industries have undergone deregulation, the electric utility industry is now being targeted by free-market policymakers whose primary objective is to bring down the cost of electric services by allowing market forces, rather than government regulators, to set the price of these services.  Federal and state governments are working to accomplish the goal by considering various scenarios for replacing regulation with competition.<p>

The OCDM White Paper discusses several possible outcomes of the various restructuring efforts.  First, there likely will be consolidation of electric utilities as they seek more efficient operating structures (for example, the proposed merger between Central Illinois Public Service Company and Union Electric.)  Second, most jurisdictions will move from the traditional rate-of-return regulation (cost plus profit), to a performance-based regulatory system where costs are separated from revenues, thus giving utilities incentive to reduce costs.  Third, many expect development of regional power pools, where spot market transactions, administered by an Independent System Operator (ISO) are prevalent.  Fourth, due to separation of electric utility generation, transmission and distribution functions, consumers will have greater choice in both the type of service they receive and from whom they receive it.  Finally, the generation sector of the electricity market is likely to become competitive first, since federal policy decisions over the last 20 years have largely negated the monopoly characteristics of power production, wholesale power transactions and resource additions.<p>

It is difficult to predict what these changes will bring to the Illinois coal industry; however, in the near term, some observers predict that with an emphasis on efficiency, existing coal-fired power plants will increase production because of their lower marginal generation costs.  This would trigger an increase in coal sales.  Still, over the long-term, it is likely that older, less efficient coal-fired generating plants could be retired or converted to natural gas.<p>

Thus, the newest challenge facing Illinois coal is to retain as much existing market share as possible, while seeking out new markets for this efficient fuel.  Nearly all electric utility restructuring analyses project a near-term gain, mid-term loss, and long-term benefit for coal as the cost-effective fuel of choice for baseload electricity generation.  OCDM will continue to work with the Illinois coal industry to ensure that this valuable commodity plays a prominent role in a restructured electric utility marketplace.<p>

<h3>MEXICAN COMPANY OPENS SHUTTERED SPARTA PLANT</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar awarded a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to Sparta Mayor Greg Aitken, as representatives Pedro Booth and Sergio Guarneros of Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. looked on.  The grant is part of an $860,000 package of state assistance to assist Grupo Serla in renovating the former Spartan Printing plant.  The plant, which had been shuttered since February, is expected to employ at least 300 workers when it opens early next year.  Grupo Serla, Mexico's leading producer of Spanish-language textbooks, intends to target the U.S. market and also will pursue contracts with customers of the former Spartan plant. <p>

<h3>CONFERENCE HELPS SMALL AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES <br>
BECOME SUCCESSFUL EXPORTERS</h3>
<em>by Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio, DCCA International Business Division</em><p>

More than 650 business people learned valuable information to help them become successful exporters during the second annual Crossing International Borders conference, recently held in Chicago.  The conference, cosponsored by DCCA and Arthur Andersen, in collaboration with 22 international associations and agencies, provided exporters with the best and latest information on becoming effective exporters.  It also featured presentations by the managing directors of Illinois' foreign offices, who provided market updates on the Far East, North Asia, the Americas, Western Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as presentations by professionals from Arthur Andersen and other companies.<p>

Participants in the conference were greeted by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone, who spoke on the challenges and rewards of doing business overseas.  Luncheon featured remarks from Casey Cowell, co-founder of U.S. Robotics, a leader in the manufacture of information access products, who discussed his company's international strategy.  Participants had their choice of 36 concurrent workshops which covered the current status of trade agreements, export financing, legal concerns, customs issues, the human resource factor, reducing taxes, finding overseas distributors, protecting intellectual property, foreign sales corporations and international franchising.  The conference concluded with an International Export Forum, which featured the opportunity for one-on-one consultation with the experts.<p>

A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Governor's Export Awards.  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra presented the awards to 15 Illinois companies and associations, representing four categories.  Winners of the "New to Export" award included Westell International, Sabratek Corporation, Total Process Corp. and Visiontek.  "Continuing Export Excellence" awards went to Prince Castle, Inc.; The Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Fluid Management L.P.; Frasca International, Inc.; and DICKEY-john.  Awards for "Export Awareness and Development" were presented to the Automotive Exporters' Council, the National Housewares Manufacturers Association; Central Illinois Exporters' Association and the Illinois Wheat Association.  Winners of the "Community Service Recognition Award" were the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and JETRO Chicago.<p>

Illinois is the fifth-largest exporting state in the nation, with nearly 500,000 jobs linked to exporting.  The "Crossing International Borders" conference can help even more Illinois businesses become better exporters.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS OPENS PUBLIC E-85 REFUELING FACILITIES </h3>

DCCA's Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy works closely with Illinois agricultural organizations and automobile manufacturers to promote and expand the use of ethanol as a clean-burning, renewable transportation fuel.  The recent opening of the three public E-85 refueling stations will play an important role in that effort.<p>

In June, Mitch Beaver, Deputy Director of DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling,   participated in grand opening ceremonies at the E-85 station in Dwight at Exit 220 on Interstate 55.  With remarks from U.S. Congressman Tom Ewing, state Sen. John Maitland, Chet Boruff of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, Mike Lockhart of Growmark, Inc., Vic Riddle of the Illinois Corn Growers, and Beaver, the ceremonies highlighted the partnership that has helped to encourage expansion of ethanol usage.<p>

Ethanol is important to Illinois.  Our state leads the nation in the production of ethanol, and ranks first or second in the production of corn each year.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling assists this industry by managing numerous ethanol test and demonstration projects, and sponsoring the research and development of new and innovative technologies to help reduce ethanol production costs.  Among its projects are partnerships with General Motors and Ford Motor Company to field-test flexible-fuel vehicles designed to operate on either traditional gasoline or E-85 fuel -- a mixture of 85 percent denatured ethanol with 15 percent natural gasoline added to aid in fuel combustion.<p>

The new Dwight station, owned and operated by Livingston County FS and supplied by Growmark, is one of three E-85 stations now open to the public in Illinois.  Others include a SuperAmerica E-85 station in Des Plaines and a Mobil station in Springfield.  Plans call for up to 40 E-85 stations in Chicago, Rockford, Peoria, the Quad Cities and other communities in Illinois and throughout the Midwest.<p>

<h3>IEZA CONFERENCE OFFERS VALUABLE TRAINING</h3>
       
DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone joined Jeanne Gustafson, President of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA), and Tom Henderson, DCCA's Enterprise Zone program manager, at the Illinois Enterprise Zone Administrators' Training Session, held in June in Springfield.   More than 150 communities were represented at the conference, which featured sessions on incentives, zone marketing, reporting requirements, zone alterations and use of the Internet.<p>

<h3>DCCA IMPLEMENTING "TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT"</h3>

Total Quality Management, or TQM, is a philosophy being embraced in many industries today.  TQM involves the entire workforce, tapping the knowledge and expertise of individual workers at all levels of responsibility to help find better, faster and more efficient ways of doing a job, whether it be manufacturing widgets or providing a service.<p>

Over the past year, DCCA has been incorporating the TQM philosophy into its programs and services.  Since June 1995, 120 DCCA employees have completed TQM training to help them understand the philosophy and procedures involved in the TQM process.  This training has helped 15 TQM "teams" begin work on studying various DCCA processes and procedures, researching and developing recommendations to streamline these activities while improving quality of the services provided to both internal and external customers.  For example, teams have studied the contracting process, grant processing, payroll procedures, policy letters and other processes and procedures undertaken daily within the department.  Ten teams have already submitted their recommendations for change to Director Dennis Whetstone and top management for their approval, and steps toward implementation of their recommendations have begun.<p>

TQM is expected to have many benefits for DCCA.  The philosophy brings DCCA's employees directly into the front line to help identify barriers to quality service and uses their expertise to develop ways to break down those barriers.  In addition, by improving the quality of its processes, DCCA will be able to serve its customers in a more timely and less cumbersome manner.  Finally, TQM gives DCCA's employees a sense that they are important members of a team working together to make the agency a better place.<p>

<h3>FORUM ADDRESSES RURAL POVERTY</h3>

<em>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</em><p>

Poverty is a problem that knows no geographic boundaries.  According to the 1990 census, poverty is particularly growing in non-metropolitan areas of Illinois.  As populations age and economic opportunities decline, rural communities need assistance to reverse the problem.  Phyllis "Phib" Bell of DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity is one of those actively working to help.  Saying, "We often forget that poverty also occurs in rural areas," Bell recently helped organize the "Pathways From Poverty Forum," held in Collinsville.<p>

The forum, co-sponsored by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the Farm Foundation, and the Rural Sociological Society Task Force on Rural Poverty, attracted more than 120 leaders from state and local organizations in 12 Midwestern states.  Some states sent as many as 15 people to participate in the conference, which was designed to increase understanding and awareness of both the individual and social aspects of poverty and stimulate thinking about steps that can be taken to create "pathways" from poverty.  Another primary objective was to build stronger relationships and facilitate communication among organizations involved in rural poverty.<p>

Forum participants developed a vision statement and action plan to stimulate more job opportunities, involve the disadvantaged in the political process, and increase access to more meaningful educational opportunities in rural areas.  The W. K. Kellogg Foundation has already committed seed funds of $1,500 to support a statewide rural poverty conference in November 1996 to continue advancing rural poverty initiatives.<p>

Members of the Illinois team participating in the forum included Ted Aggen, Mayor of Sterling; Doug Dougherty, Executive Director of the Rural Affairs Council, Lt. Gov. Kustra's office; Betty Green, Director, RIDES Mass Transit District, Rosiclare; Jack Halstead, Senior Editor, Association of Illinois Electric Cooperatives, Springfield; Sue Mahoney, retired teacher, Rosiclare; Jane Pfeiffer, Mayor of Elsah; Jane Poertner, Director, Central Illinois Economic Development Corporation, Lincoln; Ann Heinz-Silvis, Extension Specialist, University of Illinois Laboratory for Community and Economic Development, Urbana; and Randy Sumner, Vice President of Community Affairs, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.   <p>

<h3>GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS</h3>

Although large corporations grab the headlines, small businesses are the driving force behind America's economy.  Obtaining financing for business start-up or expansion, however, can be one of the largest hurdles for entrepreneurs.  DCCA's Small Business Division within the Bureau of Business Development is working to make sure that Illinois small business people know about the many programs available to help them achieve success.<p>

In April, the Division underwrote the costs associated with airing the public television series, "Small Business 2000," on the Convocom network (WMEC-Macomb, WQEC-Quincy and WSEC-Springfield/Jacksonville).  Each of the half-hour programs included news stories and regular features on marketing, law and technology, as well as special presentations on home offices, professional practices, book reviews and reviews of the latest in computer software.  <p>

Throughout May and June, the Division hosted a series of Lenders' Forums at locations throughout the state.  The forums featured officials from several government lending agencies, including DCCA, the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA), the U.S. Export Assistance Center (USEAC) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The forums gave bankers and other commercial lenders insight into DCCA's Participation Loan Program, the USEAC's Export Working Capital Loan Program, SBA's Low-Doc program, and IDFA's Direct Loan, Microloan and Industrial Revenue Bonds.  Participants got a look at upcoming changes and forecasts about the financing programs, as well as an opportunity for one-on-one discussions.<p>

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has provided more than $500 million in business financing, helping small businesses retain more than 35,000 Illinos jobs and retain nearly 48,000 jobs.<p>

<H3>WOODFORD COUNTY SHELTER <BR>WINS 1996 GOVERNOR'S CUP</H3>

The 1996 Governor's Home Town Awards are now history, and Woodford County has taken home the coveted Governor's Cup as the project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism this year in Illinois.<P>

At the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards banquet on June 13 in Springfield, more than 70 projects from nearly 90 communities received awards thanking them for their efforts to improve their communities and make Illinois a better place to live, work and do business.  Of those, Woodford County's project, "Heart House," was judged as the outstanding volunteer effort of the year.<P>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a shelter for homeless people in Woodford County.  They realized that the problems of homelessness and domestic violence  exist in small towns as well as large cities.  Using donated funds, the volunteers opened Heart House in a former fraternity house located near the Eureka College campus.  But problems soon developed.  The national fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter at the college, forcing Heart House to seek new quarters.  After assessing its options, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  Their efforts resulted in a new shelter facility valued at more than twice its cost that provides services to its clients without any tax support.<P>

In the 15 years since its inception, the Governor's Home Town Awards program has rewarded many Illinois volunteers like those from Woodford County.  Awards are presented in categories based on population, so that projects compete against activities undertaken in communities of similar size.  Four sub-categories of awards are presented in each population category:  general awards, awards for projects for or by youths, awards for projects for or by senior citizens, and economic development awards.  First place winners in each category receive commemorative road signs and plaques noting their achievements; other winners receive plaques.  All first place winners are eligible to compete for the Governor's Cup.<P>

Judging also is done by volunteers.  This year's judges were all volunteers who had participated in projects that won awards in the 1995 Governor's Home Town Awards competition.  The judges review all applications, then make site visits to finalist communities.  Following the site visits, the judges reconvene to make their final selections and determine the winner of the Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy.  <P>

Applications for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards will be available in late fall.  For further information, contact Lou Ann Ladage at 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<P>

<H3>JOB TRAINING LOSES AN ICON</H3>


The Illinois job training community lost an icon with the May 7 death of Samuel C. Bernstein, often called the "father" of the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act.<P>

Bernstein was working for the Legislative Reference Bureau when he accepted a challenge from then Gov. Henry Horner to develop legislation required by the federal Social Security Act.  In 1937, Bernstein's legislation was enacted, giving Illinois an unemployment compensation law.  <P>

In subsequent years, Bernstein served in numerous state roles, including labor director and commissioner of Illinois employment security.  During the 1970s, he served as assistant to the mayor of Chicago for manpower.  He was a labor adviser to three U.S. presidents, and, until his death, was a consultant for Kane, McKenna and Associates and Target Group, Inc.  He also had been an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois - Chicago.<P>

Bernstein is survived by his wife, Dena, two daughters, one son, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.<P>

<H3>COAL CALENDAR CONTEST WINNERS NAMED</H3>

About two dozen Illinois school children and their families gathered at the Executive Mansion in Springfield in April to receive their awards as winners in the eighth annual Illinois Coal Calendar Contest.<P>

"This contest was established to highlight the rich heritage and tremendous importance of Illinois coal and coal mining," said John S. Moore, chief of DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  "Through this program, young people learn that Illinois' most abundant natural resource -- coal -- can be a safe and environmentally friendly energy source for the future."<P>

Moore joined Taylor Pensoneau, vice president of the Illinois Coal Association, in presenting the winning students with their prizes.  Each winner received a $50.00 U.S. Savings Bond and a certificate of achievement signed by Gov. Jim Edgar.  The winning posters and essays will be included in the 1997 Words and Pictures About Illinois Coal Calendar, which will be available in the fall.<P>

More than 1,200 fifth and sixth grade students from across the state entered this year's competition.  Essay winners included Katie Bochenska, Wood Dale; Kira Essmann, Earlville; Sarah Hamel, Earlville; Katie Kelly, Wheaton; Kyle Ostendorf, Savanna; Bret Owsley, LaHarpe; Shannen Painter, Lomax; Mattie Pesavento, Staunton; Anna Jo Ristow, Cissna Park; Amy Swanson, Savanna; Sarah Talkington, Minooka; and Clint Worley, Staunton.  Poster winners included Courtney Beattie, Mark; Allison Campbell, Ewing; Luke Cloud, Gillespie; Kristen Czarnecki, Wheaton; Mark Dimalanta, Lockport; Ross Frye, Shumway; Steven Isaacson, Carman; Kevin Kamien, Lockport; Leslie Kearby, LaPrairie; Laura Mahrt, Morton; Pat Naurecki, Wood Dale; Sarah Sisterson, Lockport; and Jayna Williams, Harrisburg.<P>

<H3>AMERITECH OPENS FACILITY IN RANTOUL</H3>

Gov. Jim Edgar joined Ameritech officials and workers at ceremonies marking the official opening of the company's $2 million Ameritech Cellular Services call center in Rantoul.  The center, which is expected to create approximately 200 new jobs, is located in a fully renovated facility that formerly housed a Chanute Air Force Base weather training facility.  DCCA is providing up to $210,000 in Industrial Training Program funds to assist in training workers at the center.<P>

<H3>ILLINOIS FILM BUSINESS EXPERIENCING STRONG REBOUND</H3>
<EM>by Ron VerKuilen, Manager, Illinois Film Office</EM><P>


1996 has been a strong rebounding year for the Illinois film business!  January started off with a bang (literally!) when director and native son Andy Davis ("The Fugitive," "The Package," "Code of Silence," Above the Law") returned to Illinois to film "Chain Reaction" starring Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.  The film opens in late August and features Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory and Barrington Hills.  Chicago also doubles for Washington D.C. (see if you can spot the Field Museum or the Museum of Science and Industry!)<P>

In March and April, two television series -- "EZ Streets" and "Early Edition" -- were shot here.  Scenes were shot for a new series produced by Chris Columbus ("Home Alone", "Only the Lonely" director), as well as for "ER" and "Chicago Hope," which regularly return to film scenes.<P>

A sizeable chunk of the movie "Michael," starring John Travolta, Andie MacDowell and William Hurt is being filmed in Illinois.  The latter two play tabloid journalists in search of the archangel Michael, played by Travolta.  Also this spring, the adaptation of the John Grisham novel, "The Chamber," has filmed in Chicago with local actor Chris O'Donnell and Gene Hackman.   In addition to these high-profile stars, Larenz Tate and Nia Long star in an independent film, "Love Jones," directed by Chicagoan Ted Wicher.<P>

During the summer, filming will begin on "My Best Friend's Wedding," starring Julia Roberts, Dermott Mulroney and Carmen Diaz; "Gangsters," set in 1930s Harlem, directed by Bill Duke and starring Lawrence Fishburne; and the Miramax feature, "Stepping in the Dog Water," directed by and starring David Schwimmer of "Friends."<P>

That's not all!  John Hughes Productions, in conjunction with Universal Pictures, will be filming a small town movie in Illinois called "Reach the Rock."  Robert Altman will direct a feature film, "The Wild Card," for MGM Studios that stars Woody Harrelson.  Scouting is underway for a feature film, "The Good Guys," starring Don Johnson as a con man who joins the FBI to expose the mob!<P>

Meanwhile, the Film Office staff is working with a number of projects that have a distinct possibility of filming in Illinois.  We take the calls, make the scouts, pass on information, and plead Illinois' case with crews, talent, labor, hotel managers, etc. to welcome the film and television business to Illinois.  This, along with a full plate of steady business with local independent filmmakers, commercial makers, documentary films, educational films, music videos and other projects, keeps the Illinois Film Office hopping!<P>

The film business is cyclical.  Local labor has made adjustments to appeal to Hollywood.  Market forces seem to be smiling on Illinois right now.  And luck always plays a part.  But the Illinois Film Office continues to work hard to attract the film dollar to Illinois.  We're having fun!  The nights and weekends get a bit full at times, but it's worth it to have the film business back strong in Illinois.  <P>

<H3>STUDENTS WIN ILEED YOUTH AWARDS </H3>


DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone presented a plaque to teachers Terry Bachenheimer and Dawn Drost and their students from Hunting Ridge Elementary and Energy Club in Palatine during the ILEED Youth Awards for Energy Achievement Program luncheon in Springfield.  More than 250 students and teachers from 60 Illinois schools received recognition this year for their outstanding efforts toward furthering energy and environmental education.  Of the 25 schools that won special State Awards, four advanced to the National Youth Awards program for Energy Achievement held in Washington D.C.  Hunting Ridge advanced to the national program for its project studying wetlands and the effects of tampering with the environment. <P>

ILEED (Illinois Energy Eduction Development) is an energy/environmental education program designed to teach and motivate students to learn more about energy and environmental concerns through school and community projects.<P>

<H3>DCCA GRANTS HELP IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC SERVICES</H3>
<EM>by Amy Zachary, Bureau of Community Development</EM><P>


Passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a giant step forward in raising public awareness of the needs of those with disabilities.  But for many small governments, the cost to remodel and retrofit public buildings can be prohibitive.  The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) Removal of Architectural Barriers component can make such improvements affordable.<P>

Each year, DCCA solicits CDAP applications from local units of government -- cities, villages, townships and counties -- in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive their funds directly from the federal government.  Removal of Architectural Barriers grants of up to $150,000 are available annually to assist local governments in paying for efforts to remove physical barriers that restrict accessibility to basic and essential local government services.  For example, a local unit of government might undertake ramp construction, restroom renovation, elevator or chairlift installation, or designate parking for those with disabilities.  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis, with projects such as improvements to courthouses; city, village or town halls; municipal centers; local government annex buildings; libraries and health departments given top priority.<P>

Since the program began in 1993, 162 units of local government have shared $7 million in CDAP grant funds.  An example is Effingham County, which submitted an application on behalf of projects in the county courthouse, county building, and health department, as well as projects in Mound Township, Douglas Township, the Village of Beecher City, the Town of Mason, the City of Altamont and the Village of Watson.  Effingham County received a $48,000 CDAP grant, which it leveraged with nearly $625,000 in local funds to undertake various improvements, including parking, door hardware, signage, door openers and buzzers, audible/visual alarms, grab bars, restroom renovation, new controls on drinking fountains, and audible controls and tactile instructions for an elevator.<P>

Thirty-three communities have submitted applications for $1 million in CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants this year.  DCCA expects to award the grants later this summer.<P>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS:  ANOTHER TOOL<br>
FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<em>by Dale Fesser, DCCA Division of Loan Administration</em><p>

Construction of a new "spec" building in an industrial park.  Financing for a grocery store in a small town.  A business expansion loan to a participant in a "Create Your Own Business" contest.<p>

What do these have in common?  They all are projects completed by various Development Corporations -- regionally-based organizations capitalized partially through DCCA grants -- that provide financing to supplement commercial lending and support economic development in Illinois.<p>

Development Corporations are as varied as their clients.  They may specialize in development and rehabilitation of real estate, investment in or lending to businesses, or related activities.  Most often, Development Corporations are public and bank sponsored and funded financial institutions.  They serve as a source of supplemental business capital for small businesses whose credit requirements cannot be adequately served by conventional lending institutions.<p>

Of the 43 Development Corporations in Illinois, 34 have received DCCA assistance totaling approximately $2.24 million matched by more than $7.5 million in private investment.  Those 34 Development Corporations already have financed more than 89 projects.  Their loans and investments have leveraged private sector loans and investments of more than $59.1 million with total investment of more than $71 million.  Projects funded through state-assisted Development Corporations have resulted in the creation and retention of more than 3,600 Illinois jobs.  The impact will continue to grow as the original loans are repaid and the recaptured funds are used for new loans for future economic development projects.<p>

The Development Corporation program is particularly important to DCCA's strategy to help strengthen regional economic development efforts in rural areas.  Development Corporations are financial intermediary organizations.  By creating new "extra market" institutions, DCCA helps to eliminate the traditional gaps found in asset-based lending at the local level.  At the same time, DCCA itself is taken out of the direct lending business, resulting in more effective delivery of services, greater local access to capital for small and medium-sized Illinois firms, better lending decisions and a better match between the individual needs of businesses and communities.<p>

To learn more about the Development Corporation program or obtain the name of a Development Corporation serving your area, contact Dale Fesser, Development Corporation program manager, at 217/524-0165 (TDD:  800/785-6055) or by E-mail at dale.fesser@accessil.com.<p>

<h3>GREAT PRINTERS PROJECT EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES; PROTECTS ENVIRONMENT</h3>

Protecting the environment is an important concern for everyone.  Today, more than ever, businesses and government must work together to make pollution prevention a key consideration within the nation's industries.  DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program is part of a team working on a major initiative to help establish pollution prevention as a standard business practice within the lithographic printing industry -- the Illinois Great Printers Project.<p>

Lithographic printing uses a variety of materials and potentially hazardous chemicals, generates wastes and consumes energy.  Although the average small print shop is not a major pollution source, the impact of hundreds of such businesses is substantial.  The Illinois Great Printers Project is researching ways to help printers prevent pollution at the source by focusing on customer demands, regulatory requirements, and access to technology and financial resources.  <p>

A steering committee, which includes representatives from DCCA, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Printing Industry of Illinois and Indiana (PII), and the Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center has identified five groups integral to the project:  printers, customers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, and technical assistance.  <p>

Over the past year, each group has been working to develop programs and policies that can help incorporate pollution prevention into the standard business practices of the lithographic printing industry.  For example, activities undertaken by the Customers group include working with the printing industry to develop environmentally sound printing specifications.  The Suppliers group is working with the printing industry to identify environmentally-friendly materials and equipment, promote and disseminate information concerning environmentally sound alternatives, develop a standard form containing product information and environmental benefits, and adopt a standard protocol to identify potentially hazardous chemicals.  Among its activities, the Regulatory Agencies group is trying to revise existing environmental assessment policies to ensure they support and provide incentives for voluntary auditing and pollution prevention.  The Technical Assistance group is working to establish a Resource Center that would provide pollution prevention information to the lithographic printing industry.<p>

Assisting with the efforts is an Advisory Committee of representatives from the printing industry, printing supply industry, printing customers, financial institutions, citizens groups, relevant government agencies and environmental organizations.  This committee provides a sounding board for exploring relevant issues and reviewing the activities being undertaken.<p>

Although much work remains to be done, educating the public is seen as a key to the project's ultimate success.  Criteria are now being developed under which printers may be designated as "Great Printers."   Efforts will be undertaken to publicize the meaning behind the Great Printers designation and encourage consumers to seek out these printers for their printing services.  It is hoped that the educational effort will reward Great Printers by increasing their customer base.<p>

Illinois is one of four states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, designing pilot programs to standardize pollution prevention as a business practice in the lithographic printing industry.  It's all part of a larger effort started in 1992 by the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Printing Industries of America.  Called the Great Printers Project, this effort aims to create a business environment conducive to pollution prevention for an entire industry sector, thereby helping to expand a strong regional printing industry while retaining a clean Great Lakes ecosystem.<p>

<h3>TOURISM ADS WIN AWARDS, GET RESULTS</h3>

It's summer and time to get away for a weekend or that badly needed vacation.  DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism is out to help you find the perfect getaway in Illinois.  An aggressive television advertising campaign hit the airwaves April 1 reminding tourists that they can travel a "Million Miles from Monday" right in our state.<p>  

The television campaign already has earned both critical acclaim and impressive tourism gains.  The 1995 "Million Miles from Monday" campaign was named the best tourism campaign of the year in a worldwide competition at the New York Festival -- the only U.S. campaign to make the finals.  It also won acclaim as the Best Creative of the Year at the Chicago International Film Festival, and won the 1996 ATLAS Award from the Association of Travel Marketing Executives.<p>

Even more important, the ads have been an integral part of Illinois' success in attracting tourists.  Over the past nine months, calls to the Illinois Travel Counseling System (ITCS) have increased 22 percent compared to the same period a year ago.  Follow-up studies show that 62 percent of callers end up traveling to one or more Illinois destinations.  Since September 1995, calls to the 800 number have broken monthly totals.<p>   

The television ads are part of a $10 million domestic tourism campaign that includes print ads, direct response television and showings of the ads at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.  All of the print ads and several direct response television spots feature the benefits of calling ITCS, which puts callers on the line with an expert travel counselor who can use one of the largest tourism databases in the U.S. to help them with their Illinois tourism plans.<p>

Are you ready for a getaway?  Call 1-800-2-CONNECT and go a "Million Miles from Monday" in Illinois.<p>

<h3>BASIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COURSE<br>
HELPS EXPAND STAFF KNOWLEDGE </h3>

Forty-two DCCA staffers and colleagues from other economic development organizations learned more about the foundations of successful economic development as participants in the Basic Economic Development Course, sponsored by DCCA in March.  The intensive five-day course, presented by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, provided the graduates with accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC) and is the first step toward accreditation as a Certified Economic Developer.<p>

The course included presentations by a wide range of economic development experts from throughout the United States.  Bill Browning, president and CEO of the Heartland Partnership in Peoria, described how to build an effective economic development organization, while Kate McEnroe, a location consultant from Atlanta, Georgia, discussed the use of incentives and tips for working with consultants.  David Richmond, a veteran economic developer from Richmond, Indiana, shared his insight into innovative financing programs.  A highlight of the program was an address by Rick Thrasher, president and CEO of WI/SE Partnership for Growth in Wichita, Kansas.  Thrasher, who serves as first vice chair of the American Economic Development Council, and Lori Healey, president of the Illinois Development Council, joined DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone in awarding certificates of completion to the 42 graduates.<p>

Response to the course was so enthusiastic that DCCA plans to sponsor a second BEDC class in June.  Typical of the comments:  "The BEDC was excellent.  I learned a lot about economic development that I really didn't know.  In addition, it helped me to better understand the overall mission of the agency better than anything I had previously read or heard."<p>

All graduates of the course become eligible to attend further training through the University of Oklahoma toward earning the Certified Economic Developer designation.<p>

<h3>DCCA SUPPORTS RESEARCH USING COAL BY-PRODUCTS<br> 
TO PRODUCE ARTIFICIAL MINE ROOF SUPPORTS</h3>

Research, supported by DCCA through the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI), could soon lead to recycling fly ash, a by-product produced when coal is burned, into artificial timbers to support the roofs of coal mines.<p>

Mining engineering Professor Yoginder P. "Paul" Chugh of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale recently demonstrated the strength of two-foot timbers made of fly ash and other fluidized-bed combustion by-products.  The demonstrations were the first step toward receiving approval from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration to use the new timbers as mine roof supports.<p>

Chugh, chairman of SIUC's mining engineering department, and a team of scientists spent two years developing the timbers.  The timbers are made with about 65 percent fly ash, cement and fibers which are added to give the timbers characteristics similar to wood.  Like ordinary wood timbers, the fibers will "splinter" when the artificial post exceeds its design load capacity, signaling that the timber needs to be replaced.<p>

Chugh says the timbers weigh significantly less than concrete and are as strong as traditional wood timbers.  An economic analysis shows the cost of making the six foot timbers is about the same as making them from wood.  The real benefit comes from conserving trees while using a product that currently goes to landfills.<p>

"Coal-burning utilities from Illinois put more than 3 million tons of fly ash and other coal combustion by-products into landfills each year," Chugh said.  "In addition, more than 60 million cubic feet of wood are used every year as timbers in U.S. coal mines."  Chugh estimates that 2.5 million tons of fly ash would be used each year if every U.S. coal mine switched to artificial timbers.<p>

The study is just one in a series of coal-related by-products management studies being sponsored by the ICCI.  Other projects include using coal combustion by-products in road beds and surfaces, automotive brake shoes and body panels, patio bricks, sewer tiles and flower pots.<p>

<h3>DCCA WORKING TO REDUCE COAL-GENERATED AIR POLLUTANTS</h3>

<em>by Gary Philo, DCCA Office of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) is actively working to help encourage the development and use of new technologies that reduce hazardous emissions from burning Illinois coal.  As part of that effort, the OCDM recently held a workshop on sulfur dioxide and air toxics control, bringing together representatives from many of the state's electric power generating companies with those from state government and the air pollution control industry to discuss the role of advanced scrubber technologies.  <p>

Illinois coal has a high sulfur content, which has caused the state to lose market share in recent years as many coal-burning companies turned to low-sulfur western coal.  OCDM is working to encourage development and use of technologies that can  make Illinois coal environmentally safe to use.  It also is seeking out new international markets that can utilize these technologies to safely burn Illinois coal.<p>
  
The workshop, held in Springfield, particularly focused on various technologies that can help companies meet sweeping emission limitations on sulfur dioxide that will become effective in the year 2000.  Participants also looked at control strategies for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants that may face future regulation.  <p>

Representatives from Central Illinois Public Service Company, Springfield City Water, Light and Power, Illinois Power Company, the Environmental Element Corporation, the Illinois Clean Coal Institute, and OCDM participated in the workshop.<p>

<h3>Small Businesses Drive the Illinois Economy</h3>

<h4>By Roberta Janis and Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Small business is the real muscle of the Illinois economy.  Recent data shows that 85  percent of the new jobs in Illinois were created by small businesses, and nearly 4.4 million Illinois workers depend on small business for their livelihood.<p> 

To achieve business success, today's small business owners have to wear many hats -- that of a banker to secure financing, a marketing expert to reach potential clientele, an accountant to file a myriad of tax returns, and the list goes on.<p>

Fortunately for Illinois' 617,000 small business owners, assistance is readily available. Whether shopping for a marketplace, investigating financial sources or trying to make sense of tax requirements, DCCA's Small Business Division can help.  <p>

The Small Business Division includes 40 Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), 13 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, five International Trade Centers, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, 20 Incubators, an Office of Minority Business Development, an Office of Women's Business Development, an Office of Small Business Environmental Assistance and the First-Stop Business Information Center.<p>

SBDCs counsel, conduct research, and train business people in a wide variety of business topics.  They provide comprehensive information services and access to experts in many fields.  Centers develop and maintain partnerships among community organizations and local, state and federal agencies, providing a focal point for broad networks of public and private resources at the community level.  These partnership programs and activities serve small business and contribute significantly to the economic growth in Illinois.<p>

An example is the new Super 8 Motel in Greenville, Illinois.  Although they had been involved in other successful business ventures, 32-year-old Vicki Ellsworth and her associates turned to the SBDC at Kaskaskia College in Centralia for help in opening the new motel.  The SBDC not only helped develop a business plan and compiled three- and five-year projections, but also helped compile a financial package that included an $800,000 loan guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and $150,000 from the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  After only a few months of operation, the Greenville Super 8 has already exceeded its projections.<p>

Vern Carlsen is another example.  Carlsen worked for 25 years at a Chicago area industrial company, working his way up to corporate vice president.  After the company was sold in 1988, he worked as a salesman for a few years, then became a manager and contract administrator for a Rockford firm.  In that job, he discovered that, although many companies were interested in doing business with the government, they did not want to deal with the paperwork involved.  Carlsen started Sales Assistance Service in 1993 to fill this void.  Sales Assistance Service used the services of the Procurement Technical Assistance Center at Rock Valley College in Rockford, particularly the automated bid service and the specification library.  The company also has begun to use Electronic Data Interchange to receive bids daily.  It is now a successful business that continues to expand. <p> 

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has compiled impressive statistics.  To find out if the Small Business Division can help you, call 800/252-2923 (TDD:  800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>From the Director</h3>

<h4>What is Economic Development?</h4>

DCCA's new mission statement says that DCCA is the "lead state agency responsible for improving the competitiveness of Illinois in the global economy resulting in prosperous, growing industries, rising real incomes and high quality jobs."<p>

But the agency's programs and services encompass a wide range of activities -- tourism, help for local governments, workforce training programs, assistance to low-income people, technology assistance, site and building location assistance, small business assistance, and many more.  How do all these programs fit the definition of economic development?<p>

Think like a mayor.  As mayor, you are vitally interested in the future of your community.  You want it to be a great place for families to live and visit, with prosperous businesses, plentiful jobs, convenient services and a healthy environment.  <p>

You're interested in infrastructure because you know that without access to safe and adequate water supplies and waste treatment, safe roads and other foundations, people and businesses will not want to live in and locate in your community.  You're interested in workforce development because you want to ensure that businesses in your community have the skilled workers they need to stay competitive in a global marketplace.  You also know that the future of your current businesses, as well as your ability to attract more businesses and jobs, depends on a continued supply of skilled workers and adequate infrastructure.<p>

You're interested in maintaining and improving the quality of life for residents in your community.  You want to ensure that low-income families have decent, energy efficient homes in which to live and the ability to pay their winter energy bills.  You want to provide services to homeless people to help them get back on their feet.  And you want to help low-income and disadvantaged people find employment opportunities and learn the skills they need to be productive employees.<p>

You know that if your community is to grow, you need to encourage existing businesses to expand and attract new businesses and jobs.  That's not just large factories -- it's also encouraging entrepreneurs to start new businesses, like the corner cafe, the dry cleaning shop and others that provide the services your citizens need.  <p>

You have a nice community.  You want others to enjoy it.  You're interested in promoting your community and its resources to tourists who will spend their dollars in your hotels and motels, restaurants and shops while enjoying the sights.<p>

If all of these things are beginning to sound familiar, it's because they are all addressed by the programs DCCA administers.  The Bureau of Community Development, for example, helps smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and housing needs through the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs and the Industrial Training Program (ITP) help train people in the skills they need to be productive employees.  Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) programs provide loans to help start businesses that provide jobs to disadvantaged workers, as well as many services to help low-income people break out of poverty.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income families pay a portion of their winter energy bills, while the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) helps low-income families make their dwellings more energy-efficient.<p>  

DCCA's Business Development Bureau provides site selection and technical assistance to help attract new businesses to Illinois, as well as services to help existing businesses grow, such as export assistance.  Through the First-Stop Business Information Center and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and small business owners find answers to their questions, locate business capital, start new businesses and expand existing ones.  <p>

The Bureau of Tourism promotes Illinois and provides assistance to help local communities and regions market themselves in this fast-growing industry, and also promotes Illinois as a site for film and television production.  Coal Development and Marketing programs work to find and market new, environmentally-safe methods of using Illinois' greatest resource.  The Bureau of Energy and Recycling promotes sustainable economic development by encouraging alternative energy resource development such as ethanol; improving energy efficiency in residences, buildings and factories which also helps reduce costs; and by supporting recycling and waste reduction programs, including the expansion of markets for recycled materials.  These programs facilitate the efficient use of natural resources while helping to minimize negative impacts on the environment. <p>
 
What is economic development?  A mayor knows.  He or she knows that a community that looks to the future and addresses its needs will be a competitive community that attracts and keeps prosperous, growing industries.  Those industries will provide high quality jobs that pay the kind of rising real incomes that can fund the parks, schools, infrastructure and other public services that make others want to visit and make the community their home.  With the right help, a mayor can close the circle into a continuous cycle of development.<p>

DCCA was created in 1979 to be Illinois' lead economic development agency.  The various community, workforce and business development programs were merged under the DCCA umbrella for a reason -- because they all are essential components of our state's ability to improve its competitiveness in a global economy.  Today, more than ever, DCCA must recognize its unique ability to be the state's "one-stop" economic development agency.  Understanding that role, and the ways our various programs fit into the overall mission, is the first step toward fulfilling that mission.<p>

<h3>Illinois Ventures for Community Action Provides Crucial Resources</h3>

<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

More than $3.6 million in loans, 616 new jobs and the lowest loan default rate in the nation.  That's a great record, and one the people at Illinois Ventures for Community Action (IVCA) are proud of.<p>

IVCA is a private 501c(3) not-for-profit corporation located in Springfield that works with the 34 local Community Action Agencies (CAAs) in Illinois and other public and private enterprises to facilitate economic development within the state.  In particular, IVCA helps ensure that CAAs have the training and knowledge they need to develop loans to businesses that can create jobs for low-income Illinoisans -- a key component of the federally-funded Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program, administered in Illinois by DCCA.<p>

Formed in 1985, IVCA is administered by a Board composed of representatives from 16 CAAs.  It is directed by CEO Michael Chew, a financial professional and former bank president.  Working closely with DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunities and the CAAs, IVCA helps the CAAs market their loans and loan services, provides lending consultation training and technical assistance with the lending function, and helps maintain coordination with lead lenders in the communities.  Through these services, IVCA is helping CAAs improve the quality of their loan portfolios.  IVCA also explores new sources of capital and tools for economic development activities, such as equity and ownership positions in Illinois businesses, to generate sustainable revenue streams that can be used to support anti-poverty efforts.<p>

For example, IVCA has assisted five CAAs in purchasing their own office buildings, thus enabling them to build a capital asset for the agency while improving creditability in the community through real estate ownership.  Chew considers the building acquisition program for Community Action Agencies to be one of the most important services IVCA performs, saying "The fiscal benefit of real estate ownership equates to immeasurable benefit to the community."<p>

Since its inception, IVCA has closed more than $3.6 million in loans, created 616 jobs, and has the distinctive record of never having a job default loan in its portfolio.  Its loan default ratio is 3.49 percent.  Since 1989, the loan default ratio has been less than one percent.  In fact, according to the Federal Office of Community Services, IVCA has the lowest loan default rate of any loan program it monitors.<p>

DCCA's partnership with Illinois Ventures for Community Action is one way DCCA is working to find innovative ways to strengthen local efforts and provide communities access to resources for physical and social infrastructure improvements.<p>

<h3>
Workshops Help Illinois Businesses<br>
Explore Export Opportunities
</h3>

Illinois businesses that want to explore the export marketplace or need information about expanding their exporting potential can obtain valuable assistance at a series of regional workshops scheduled over the coming months in Illinois.<p>

The DCCA-sponsored workshops are geared toward export opportunities in six of the 10 Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) -- markets identified as being particularly receptive to goods and services offered by U.S. companies.  The six markets deemed particularly receptive to Illinois-made products and services include South Africa, Korea and the Pacific Rim, China, Poland and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Latin America, and Turkey.   The workshops are made possible through a Market Development Cooperator Program grant awarded to Illinois by the U.S. Department of Commerce -- one of only eight such grants awarded this year.<p>

Illinois' network of International Trade Centers (ITCs) and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, two components of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN), will coordinate the workshops.  Each workshop will offer participants a chance to learn about the specific export opportunities in each market and experiences of companies already exporting to that country.  In addition, representatives from DCCA's International Business Division will discuss export assistance services offered in various Illinois pavilions scheduled for BEM trade shows, as well as assistance offered in locating potential agents and distributors.<p>

Upcoming workshops include a May 29 seminar at Bradley University in Peoria to discuss strategies for success in Korea and the Pacific Rim, and a May 30 seminar at the College of Du Page in Glen Ellyn focusing on International Quality Standards as they relate to markets in Poland, Korea and China.  Other future workshops will be held at Bradley and College of DuPage, as well as at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and  NORBIC in Chicago.<p>

For further information about the workshops, contact Roberta Janis at DCCA at 312/814-7170 (TDD:  312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>DCCA Establishes Business & Industry Data Center Program</h3>

Small business people will be able to conveniently access census data and other usable information through a new service being established at DCCA.  The Business and Industry Data Center Program (BIDC), designed to enhance the BIDC program started by the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1988, will give small business people, independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois an easy way to obtain statistical data and other sources of practical information. <p>

Statistics can be very important to small business people in planning, marketing, managing and expanding their businesses.  The BIDC program will utilize a system of five regional affiliates in Illinois to collect and provide basic information to the small business community, complete complex analyses as needed and perform regional economic analyses.  A system of three to five local affiliates in each region will deal directly with small businesses and other data users, providing basic census, economic and demographic information; data prepared by the regional affiliates or the state; and technical assistance with basic data interpretation.  The BIDC program also is affiliated with DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, which offers services and products designed to help new and existing businesses determine regulations applicable to their business activity and general start-up information. <p>

A few examples of BIDC assistance include information on commonly-offered  employee benefits in selected industries; listings of office furniture manufacturers; county economic profiles; trade show listings; numbers of Illinois businesses in select SIC codes that have sales of more than $1 million; city population, income and growth projections; ACT scores by school district; and numbers and sizes of warehouses in a county.<p>

For more information about the BIDC program, contact one of the BIDCs or phone Ed Taft at DCCA, 217/785-7545 (TDD:  800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS KEEP COMMUNITIES GROWING</h3>
<h4>By Jay Bales, DCCA Bureau of Community Development</h4>

Over the past 14 years, DCCA has awarded $83 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to 177 local units of government throughout the state to help them provide low-interest loans to businesses locating or expanding within their boundaries.  Approximately $50 million of those funds are already back in circulation, helping more than 1,600 businesses obtain the capital they need to start or expand operations in the communities.  And that's just the beginning.  As those loans are repaid, their dollars also will be used for future business opportunities.<p>

It's all thanks to Revolving Loan Funds, administered by local communities, that are capitalized with moneys repaid by businesses that received the original loans funded through CDAP economic development component grants.<p>

Here's how it works:  DCCA receives Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The funds are used to provide a variety of grants to units of local government in communities with populations under 50,000 that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  CDAP grants range from public facilities grants, that help small communities meet their water and sewer needs, to economic development grants, that help communities attract and retain businesses and their jobs.<p>

When DCCA awards a CDAP economic development grant to a community, the community may use the funds to make infrastructure improvements needed by a business, such as extending water and sewer lines or access roads.  Or it may choose to use the grant funds to provide a low-interest loan to the business.  If a loan is made, the community creates a locally-administered Revolving Loan Fund, which is capitalized by the loan repayment funds.  These Revolving Loan Funds, or RLFs, provide a valuable source of business capital for future business development.<p>

There are many RLF success stories across the state.  For example, the City of Saint Elmo received a $375,000 CDAP economic development grant in 1982.  Since then, the city has made 33 loans totaling $601,811 with a minimal amount of defaults.  The City of Lacon has received two CDAP grants in the amount of $174,180.  From the "recaptured" funds it has made 20 loans totaling $184,172.68.  These "second generation" loans have resulted in 120 jobs being created or retained!<p>

A local government does not have to receive a large CDAP grant to have an effective RLF.  The City of Athens received a $40,000 CDAP grant in 1985.  In the decade since, the city has made six loans totaling $78,300 -- nearly twice the amount of the original CDAP grant.<p>

While most RLFs do not make large loans, their contributions often are an integral part of a business' overall financing package, leveraging larger amounts of private sector dollars.  In particular, CDAP RLF dollars can be an important source of "gap financing" for small, rural businesses.<p>

For more information on CDAP RLFs, or to learn which communities have an active RLF, contact Jay Bales at 217/785-6181 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR.....</h3>

A few weeks ago, Gov. Jim Edgar recommended a $774.6 million budget for DCCA for fiscal year 1997.  I'd like to tell you a little about that budget request and what it means for DCCA's customers.<p>

First, it's important to note that the bulk of our budget request -- $600.4 million -- is federal funds.  Those funds are essential to the training of our workers, the infrastructure of our communities, and the well-being of our citizens.  We're asking for $237.2 million for JTPA for next year as we continue to open new One-Stop Career Centers, and $376.7 million for community development programs like CDAP, LIHEAP, IHWAP and CSBG that help build our infrastructure, attract and retain businesses, and help improve the quality of life for low-income citizens.<p>

We're also asking for $40.2 million in state general revenue funds.   This includes $15 million for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) -- a $2.75 million increase that would enable DCCA to help upgrade the skills of nearly 5,000 more workers from 350 additional Illinois companies.<p>

We're looking at $39.2 million in funds for our business development programs.  Illinois has been very successful in recent years in attracting and retaining businesses and their jobs -- Motorola and McDonald's, for example, have announced projects that will create thousands of new Illinois jobs over the coming years.  But the fact is, Illinois is competing against other states every time a business looks to locate or expand.  We need to have the tools to win that competition.   This budget will enable DCCA to enhance its working relationships with local economic developers and improve our ability to respond to business inquiries.<p>

Our export potential is great.  We're asking for $3.5 million to promote exporting of Illinois' goods and services in the global marketplace.  Illinois is a leader in technology development.  We're asking for an additional $200,000 to help us continue our efforts to transfer these technologies to the workplace to help our businesses expand and modernize to meet the global challenge.<p>

Tourism, one of the fastest-growing industries, will continue to prosper under the $33.4 million budget we've outlined.  These funds will enable us to continue our successful tourism advertising campaign, "Illinois -- A Million Miles from Monday," as well as grant programs to help our communities promote tourism opportunities.<p>

We're working to promote the efficient and environmentally-safe use of Illinois' energy resources, and have allocated $13.6 million to that end.  Another $17.8 million is earmarked for projects designed to utilize and develop new markets for one of Illinois' greatest resources -- coal.<p>

Over the coming weeks, the General Assembly will be considering the Governor's budget request.  It is my hope that you will take a few moments to consider the importance of DCCA's programs and services to your businesses, jobs and communities.  We welcome your support as we work to secure the resources we need to make Illinois the best place to live, work and do business.<p>

<h3>FIRST-STOP MAKES GOVERNMENT ACCESSIBLE TO BUSINESS</h3>

Illinois has a new and exciting service to help entrepreneurs and business owners access the state regulatory and assistance information they need to achieve success.  It's DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, working to improve Illinois' business climate by making it easier for entrepreneurs to comply with state business requirements.<p>

First-Stop, established in 1994 under the Business Assistance and Regulatory Reform Act, includes a number of services and products designed to meet the needs of new and existing businesses.  For example, First-Stop offers the Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs to help new and existing businesses determine the regulations and services applicable to their business activity.  The Directory is a comprehensive resource with nearly 500 profiles from more than 40 state agencies that document virtually every business license, permit, certificate and registration required by the State of Illinois, as well as the various state assistance programs available to help businesses. <p>

First-Stop also offers Starting a Business In Illinois, a comprehensive handbook for those looking to start and do business in Illinois.  The handbook includes general local, state and federal business requirements, a feasibility checklist and a business plan outline. <p>

In the coming months, First-Stop will be improving and expanding its services. "Business Bios," which will give specific, detailed regulatory information for virtually every industry, are currently being updated and expanded.  Also in the works is a comprehensive database, which will inventory business licenses, permits, certificates and registrations required by the State of Illinois.  In addition, First-Stop, with the help of business owners, associations and state agencies, will embark on a new path to search out and identify existing state laws that are burdensome, duplicative or onerous.<p>

First-Stop's effectiveness lies not only in its ability to give start-up and regulatory information to Illinois' businesses, but also in its connections to other business assistance centers.  Local assistance for new or existing businesses is available through the Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN).  The BIDC works to enhance the ability of small business people to plan, market, manage and expand their businesses by providing them with access to statistical data and other sources of practical information. The ISBDCN seeks to increase the competitiveness, profitability and growth of Illinois businesses in a global market through Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, International Trade Centers, and NAFTA Opportunity Centers.<p>

First-Stop's Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs and Starting a Business in Illinois are available through the World Wide Web (http://ww.accessil.com/dcca/) or the Access Illinois electronic bulletin board (217/787-6255, settings ANSI, 8, N, 1).  Clients also may receive this information free of charge by contacting the First-Stop Business Information Center directly at 800/252-2923 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>ITP HELPS SUPPLIERS IMPROVE QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY</h3>

"We have to team in excellence to prevail."  Those were the words of Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, commenting on the firm's latest effort to help its Illinois suppliers improve their quality and productivity, in turn helping Deere maintain and improve its own competitiveness in the global economy.<p>

A driving force behind this partnership is Illinois' Industrial Training Program (ITP), administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Gov. Jim Edgar recently participated in ceremonies awarding a $574,709 ITP grant to Deere to assist the company in providing training to 4,065 workers from 136 Illinois Deere suppliers.<p>

In its early days, ITP provided state-funded grants to manufacturers like Deere to help them train new employees and upgrade the skills of current workers.  But it became increasingly apparent that a training void existed for small and medium-sized manufacturers.  Thanks to changes in the program enacted in 1992, ITP now provides grants to trade organizations, company consortia, and community colleges, as well as original equipment manufacturers that use the funds to offer training opportunities to workers from their Illinois suppliers.  Deere, for example, has received more than $2.2 million in ITP funds since fiscal year 1993, which it has used to help train nearly 14,000 workers from its Illinois supplier companies.<p>

The program has been a great success.  Everett "Bud" Pierce, President of McLaughlin Body Company in Moline, a Deere supplier that has participated in the training program since 1993, said, "Training is more important than at any time in our careers.  As suppliers, we need to reduce costs and improve productivity.   The fact that we as suppliers can find training that enables us to better service our customers makes the program very valuable."<p>

Jerry Norquist, Manager of Safety and Training for Rockford Products Corp. of Rockford, another Deere supplier, agreed.  "Feedback we're receiving from our customers throughout their quality audits confirms that progress is definitely being made in that direction.  Our quality costs and delivery measures are showing significant improvement trends.  We're gaining market shares.  The education and training made available to our workforce through this program is a major contributor to our organizational development."<p>

ITP grants provide up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  The remaining costs are leveraged with private investment.  Deere provides five categories of training to its suppliers:  supply management, financial; operations improvements; skilled-based; and employee development.<p>

Diana Bump, Education and Training Facilitator, from Reliable Power Products, Franklin Park, said ITP training provided through Deere allowed her company to maximize its training dollars and include more employees.  "During our first year of involvement with this training program, 141 employees participated in 26 different classes.  Benefits of the program that have already been realized and measured are improved customer satisfaction, with shipment compliance improving from 91.4 percent to 97.2 percent.  Job instruction time has been reduced by one-third.  Computer efficiency has improved by 30 percent as a result of the computer skills class, with stress levels being reduced about 70 percent.  In one product area, cycle time has been reduced by 30 percent and our work in process inventories have been reduced by 50 percent overall."<p>

Gov. Edgar said ITP is an important part of the state's effort to ensure job opportunities for its people by helping Illinois businesses improve their competitiveness in the global marketplace.  "It's particularly crucial that we assist small and medium-sized businesses, because that's where most of the job growth will be as we move into the 21st Century.  It's critical to Deere that they have businesses that supply them with the highest quality work products, and important to us in Illinois that our small and medium-sized businesses are able to improve their productivity.  These training dollars will help these suppliers do business with other international companies around the world."<p>

Becherer commended the Governor and the state for having the foresight and the wisdom to stand behind the Industrial Training Program.  "When there is something like this program that provides both an incentive for us and our suppliers to work together on programs to enhance capabilities of suppliers, it provides another competitive edge that is needed in the very competitive markets in which we operate today worldwide."<p>

<h3>
"CROSSING INTERNATIONAL BORDERS" CONFERENCE<br> 
FEATURES TIPS ON EFFECTIVE EXPORTING
</h3>

Exporters and companies interested in exploring the global marketplace can get valuable tips to help them achieve success at this year's "Crossing International Borders" Conference, to be held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers on May 16.<p>

The conference is co-sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division and Arthur Andersen.  Registration is $95 per person through May 9 or $125 per person following that date.  For conference information or registration, contact Arthur Andersen at 312/507-9664 or Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio at DCCA at 312/814-2325 (TDD 312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>SCRAP TIRES PROMOTE RECYCLING; PROVIDE SAFER PLAYGROUNDS</h3>

Every year, more than 12 million old tires are scrapped in Illinois, creating a breeding site for disease-carrying mosquitoes, providing a potential fire hazard with the possibility for dense fumes of toxic smoke, and filling up valuable landfill space.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling is working to encourage recycling of those old tires in ways that can end the hazards while providing useful products.<p>

One very successful effort is a program that utilizes chips made from recycled scrap tires as a loose playground cover.  The tire chips provide a safer playground surface  because their rubber content has a shock-absorbing quality.  They also help keep maintenance costs down.  Tire chips allow for fast drainage, last for years without rotting or decaying, plus they retard weed growth, reduce dust and mud, are clean and non-toxic, do not produce leachate, and do not attract animals or insects.<p> 

This year, the Used Tire Recovery Program provided $260,000 in grants to 106 public and private schools, day care facilities and park districts to help them purchase the scrap tire playground surfacing material.  Grants of up to $3,600 were provided, with grant recipients required to match at least 40 percent.  Grant funds are generated by a state surcharge on the retail purchase of new automotive tires in Illinois.  The funded projects will use more than six million pounds of scrap tire chips, which equates to recycling more than 300,000 automotive tires.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS TOURISM GOES ON-LINE</h3>

Wouldn't it be convenient if you could instantly access information on almost any Illinois tourism destination?  Wouldn't it be ideal to browse through this information any time of the day or night, any day of the week, from the comfort of your home? <p> 

Well, it's possible.  Thanks to the Internet and your computer, potential Illinois travelers can get the information they need conveniently and quickly.<p>

DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism, working closely with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising agency, has developed a new site on the World Wide Web that can help consumers learn about events, sites and activities, lodging, restaurants, sports, weather forecasts, what's on tap at theaters and museums, and just about anything else needed to plan a weekend getaway or a complete vacation.<p>

The tourism database is user-friendly and can be reached from two locations.  At the heart of the new site, accessible by clicking on the Illinois Tourism button on DCCA's home page (http://www.accessil.com/dcca/) or clicking directly to the Illinois Tourism homepage (http://www.enjoyillinois.com), is the Trip Planner.  It includes detailed trip planning information on food, shopping, golf, lodging, special events, outdoor recreation, packaged discounts, etc.  The information in this section is created through tourism's Illinois Travel Counseling System's toll-free hotline database (1-800-2-CONNECT).  The data will frequently be downloaded into the website, ensuring detailed, current travel information.<p>

There's also a What's New section to inform users of upcoming content; Inside Insights, providing first-hand suggestions from real people who have explored and traveled in Illinois; Maps, which includes maps of Illinois regions, biking and hiking trails and special interest maps; Front Lines, with up-to-the-minute data on weather, sports and theater; and a sophisticated Search Engine to easily sort through it all.<p>

No longer will potential travelers have to make separate calls to get information on golf courses and hotels, Cubs schedules, or whatever other activities they might choose.  One visit to the Illinois Tourism website will connect these travelers with all of the answers, enabling them to customize their vacation plans in Illinois.<p>

Future plans also call for development of special contests, meetings and convention information, and the opportunity to purchase Illinois merchandise through tourism's retail outlet, Illinois Marketplace, located at Chicago's Navy Pier.<p>

Obviously, offering these benefits through the Internet is a great convenience to travelers.  But it also is an important tool for the state.  In addition to bringing consumers closer to the information they need to travel in Illinois, the Internet helps Illinois develop a relationship with consumers and generate a customer database by gathering E-mail addresses.<p>

Tourism is big business in Illinois.  In 1994, travelers spent nearly $16 billion in Illinois, contributing more than $995 million in state and local taxes, $1.7 billion in federal taxes, and generating more than 241,000 jobs with a payroll of $4.8 billion.  The Internet can help make travel in Illinois even more convenient and accessible, and help this important industry continue to grow.<p>

<h3>ITP GRANT HELPS KEEP QUALITY AS "JOB ONE"</h3>

Nearly 3,000 workers at Ford Motor Company's Chicago Assembly plant and its Illinois supplier firms will learn new skills to help them be more productive employees, thanks to an $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant announced by Gov. Jim Edgar during a January visit to the plant.<p>

The grant, the latest in a series of ITP awards to Ford since Fiscal Year 1989,  highlights the important relationship between DCCA and Illinois companies in providing the training needed to keep Illinois worker skills among the best in the world.   ITP grants are an investment in Illinois workers that can help tip the scales in favor of Illinois when companies make location, expansion or modernization decisions.<p>

Ford, for example, has been manufacturing automobiles in Chicago since 1914, and started production at the Torrence Avenue facility in 1924.  Over the years, the plant has been expanded and modernized, currently producing the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles.  The Chicago Assembly plant supplies vehicles throughout the U.S. and exports vehicles to 17 countries.<p>

A commitment to quality has always been foremost.  In July 1995, Ford awarded the Chicago Assembly Plant its Ford Q1 (Quality 1) designation.  That commitment, coupled with exacting export requirements demanded by established international quality standards, makes it necessary for Ford to continuously provide training programs to upgrade the skills and knowledge of its workers.<p>

Using its latest ITP grant, Ford will work with equipment suppliers, Ford personnel, and local schools and universities to develop and conduct training activities.  Included in the training is problem solving, continuous improvement methods, statistical process control, communications techniques and leadership skills.  Preventive maintenance systems, quality operating systems, computer skills, technical equipment courses and online production operations training are also part of the total training plan.  A heavy emphasis will be placed on process improvement and international quality measurements, such as ISO 9002.<p>

In its quest to ensure that "Quality is Job One," Ford also is inviting many of its Illinois supplier companies to participate in the training program.  Those companies include the Ford Chicago Stamping Plant in Chicago Heights; Certified Tool of Elk Grove Village; ELCO Industries, Inc. of Rockford, ITW Deltar Insert Molded Products in Elk Grove Village; Littlefuse, Inc. in Des Plaines; and MacLean-Fogg Company of Mundelein.<p>

This supplier training is a relatively new aspect of ITP.  In its early years, the program was restricted to Illinois manufacturers to assist with training and retraining costs.  In 1992, the program was expanded to include multi-company and intermediary organizations -- community colleges, original equipment manufacturers like Ford providing training to workers from their Illinois supplier network, business and industry associations, labor organizations, and strategic business partnerships -- among those eligible for grant funding.  This new emphasis enables today's ITP to reach out to a broader segment of the Illinois business community, particularly small and medium-sized companies with similar training needs.<p>

Since its inception in Fiscal Year 1979, the Industrial Training Program has provided nearly $168.7 million to help train more than 287,000 Illinois workers.  Entirely funded through state General Revenue Funds, the grants reimburse companies or organizations up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  By providing grants to multi-company and intermediary organizations, ITP funds are training more workers than ever before while lowering per-worker training costs.<p>

In speaking of the Ford grant, Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, provided insight into the overall importance of ITP to the continued strength of the Illinois business community.  "The Edgar Administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge." <p>

<h3>TOP 10 TIPS FOR WRITING SUCCESSFUL CDAP APPLICATIONS</h3>

The Public Facilities component of DCCA's Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is one of the most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address infrastructure needs that pose potential threats to public health and safety.  Public Facilities grants are just one component of CDAP, a federally-funded program administered by DCCA's Bureau of Community Development, that provides grants to local units of government in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  But since CDAP Public Facilities grants are awarded on a competitive basis, it is crucial that communities submit the best possible application.  DCCA staffers often participate in workshops and seminars to help grantwriters refine their skills.  The following is a Top 10 List of their tips to help communities prepare more competitive applications:<p>

1.  Give your grantwriter sufficient time to prepare your CDAP application.  CDAP is a federally-funded program with complex requirements.  Make sure your grantwriter has enough time to thoroughly research and document the information in the application.<p>

2.  Know what you're sending.  Many communities hire grantwriters to prepare their applications, but ultimately the local government submitting the application is responsible for its contents and completeness.  For example, if other leverage is part of the project, be sure that leverage is in place before seeking the CDAP grant.  If it is not, your application will not be favorably reviewed.<p>

3.  At least 51 percent of the benefit from CDAP Public Facilities projects must be provided to low- and moderate-income (LMI) people.  Make sure the LMI documentation matches the actual project benefit area.  For example, if only a particular neighborhood of a community will be served by a project, income surveys or census data should only reflect that area, not the entire community.<p>

4.  Write a complete project summary narrative.  If you are proposing to extend water mains to serve a rural area, for example, include specific information about the condition of the private wells that are inadequately serving the area.  Survey the residents of the area -- are 20 of the 25 currently trucking in water or purchasing bottled water?  Include information about the age of an old city system that needs to be replaced.  How many breaks has it experienced in the past two years?  Does your community need a new water tower?  If so, include information about average daily water use or low water pressure and its effects on residents.<p>  

5.  Include a Project Location Map.  It doesn't have to be blueprint quality; it just needs to illustrate the entire project area and show the proposed improvements.<p>

6.  Document the existing threat to public health and safety.  Include "internal" reports, such as repair bills, citizen complaint records or letters, water quality test results, numbers of boil orders, data on breaks, engineering reports, as well as "external" documents, such as historical correspondence from the IEPA, or letters from the health department referencing test results and inspection results of the targeted area.<p> 

7.  Demonstrate financial need.  Why does your community need a grant?  What is your financial indebtedness?  Do you have bonding capacity?  What are current user rates for water and sewer services; could they be raised?  You must submit a copy of your most recent government audit with your CDAP application.  Be sure that if you have incurred additional debt since that audit was prepared, you inform us of that debt. (DCCA's Office of Local Government Services can conduct a financial analysis to help communities determine whether they need CDAP assistance.)<p>

8.  Demonstrate community effort.  What efforts has your community made to address the problem on its own?  Have you continually made repairs to an antiquated water treatment facility?  Have you exhausted local resources making sewer main repairs?  Have you contacted other funding sources, such as RECDS (FmHA), the Rural Bond Bank, the IEPA or local financial institutions?  If you have, and you've been turned down for help, indicate that in your application.  This tells us that you have taken the initiative and CDAP may be your only option.<p>

9.  Document project readiness.  CDAP guidelines now state that project readiness is a "project threshold."  In other words, if your application does not demonstrate that the proposed project is complete, appropriate and achievable, we may not review it further.  Be sure you review all of the project readiness guidelines and address them in your narrative:  a Preliminary Engineering Report that breaks down the project and its costs in detail; properly executed Agreements and Assurances, such as intergovernmental cooperation agreements; Firm Financial Commitments -- according to new CDAP guidelines, a minimum of 25 percent leverage must be "firmly" committed and documented according to the guidelines in the CDAP application; and Site Control, such as a signed commitment from a property owner for an easement or parcel of land and copies of any permits needed.<p>

10.  Document past CDAP performance, informing us of your timely and efficient completion of any past CDAP projects.  If your community experienced problems completing a past project on time, document circumstances beyond your control which might have delayed the project.<p> 

Every year, DCCA receives applications requesting nearly two times more in CDAP Public Facilities grants than funds available.  A complete, detailed application can increase your community's chances of success.  For further information, contact the CDAP staff at 217/785-6142 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>DCCA, REGIONAL PARTNERS, REPRESENT ILLINOIS AT SAE '96</h3>
<h4>by GeorgeAnn Madison, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>
	
This year's Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Exposition, held last month in Detroit, celebrated an important milestone:  the 100th Year Anniversary of the automotive industry.   Illinois, among the nation's leading automotive industry locations, was well-represented at the show through a booth manned by DCCA's local economic development partners and sponsored by DCCA's  Regional Economic Development Partnership Program (REDPP).<p>

REDPP provides funds that enable local and regional economic development professionals to attend various in-state and out-of-state trade shows to promote their communities and Illinois.  SAE '96 was one example of the kinds of expositions that are targeted for REDPP funding -- expositions that reach top prospects, both national and international, from Illinois' most important industries.<p>

Recognized worldwide as the leading exposition supporting a network of the automotive industry's top executives, engineers and company representatives, the SAE International Exposition is the oldest assembly of high-level industry personnel and suppliers and holds the honor of being the industry's largest and most prestigious automotive event.  Each year this event draws 850-plus supplier exhibits and includes more than 100 companies from outside North America showing their wares to an audience of more than 40,000 engineering professionals including 3,200 from overseas.<p>

A highlight of the Illinois booth was a Mitsubishi Eclipse convertible donated for the exhibit by Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America, Inc., Normal.   The flashy auto helped attract attendees to the Illinois booth, where they were able to meet one-on-one with economic development personnel.  The contacts are important for both sides -- they enable industry professionals to learn about Illinois and offer Illinois economic developers an excellent opportunity to develop a list of qualified industry contacts and meet with industry decision-makers.<p>

SAE '96 also showcased another feature of REDPP.  The program enables participants to use portions of their funding for pre-show promotional efforts.  Illinois' exhibit, for example, was featured in a pre-show issue of Automotive Engineering (an organized pre-show promotional manual), as well as the Exhibitor's Manual (an on-site show directory).  These advertising efforts also had a two-pronged benefit -- they encouraged exhibitors to visit the Illinois booth, while providing Illinois exhibitors with access to a mailing list of all registered attendees at the SAE'96 Expo for future contact.<p>

DCCA and its local and regional partners will follow through on the leads they received at the SAE '96 Expo by mailing letters to contacts, providing an overview of Illinois' resources and attributes.   It's just one example of ways DCCA is working with local economic developers to attract and retain key industries and their jobs.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS TO HOST AFFORDABLE COMFORT CONFERENCE</h3>
<h4>by Henry Kurth, Bureau of Energy and Recycling</h4>

DCCA's  Bureau of Energy and Recycling, in cooperation with Affordable Comfort, Inc., are leading sponsors of the 10th Annual Affordable Comfort Conference, coming up March 17 through March 22 at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago.<p>

The conference is designed to bolster the skills and knowledge of people who work on solutions to energy and housing problems, including problems faced by low-income households.  It features information on unique and cutting-edge technologies to help architects, builders, developers and other housing officials improve the energy efficiency of new and existing housing stock.<p>

The six-day conference will feature workshops, half- and full-day short courses, an energy exhibit area, participant-initiated sessions, special evening technical sessions, and an architect's forum.  Fourteen different technical tracks are featured, including Resource Efficient Construction, HVAC Systems, Marketing Comfort and Efficiency, and Energy Efficient Mortgages.  In addition, 90 different sessions conducted by some of the world's leading energy professionals will enable participants to choose workshops that meet their specific needs.  The Conference also will feature short courses with hands-on and in-field training, and an energy exhibit by more than 40 energy product, service, and equipment vendors.<p>

This is the first year that the Affordable Comfort Conference has been held in Illinois.  Chicago was chosen following a review of prospective sites by the Affordable Comfort Board, which selected the proposal submitted by the Bureau of Energy and Recycling with support from Gov. Jim Edgar.  The 1997 conference also will be held in Chicago.<p>

For more information or a conference brochure, contact Maureen Davlin or Chrissie Garrison of DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recyclinvg at 217/785-2800 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>ENERGY ASSISTANCE HOTLINE CAN BE A LIFELINE</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

To some, handling more than 40,000 calls annually on DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline would seem a tedious job.  But to the staff of the  Division of Economic Opportunity, particularly Support Services staffers, Esther Reed, John Ray, and Jan Stehlin, it's an important and rewarding service.<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline is an information and referral source for those individuals seeking assistance with their heating bills, home weatherization, and other emergency services offered through the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and Community Services Block Grant Programs.<p>

Established in 1979 near the same time as DCCA's creation, the Hotline started as two phones with headsets installed in a separate room at the Department's offices. Then as now, staffers took calls from individuals wanting to know what the energy assistance and weatherization programs were all about, program eligibility requirements, and information on where they could apply.<p>

Although some people call to express complaints, Reed says, "The rewards come when you can help people such as Mr. Jenkins who writes, "My blood level is monitored weekly being on blood thinner. I get cold. I am 60 years old...Right leg amputee up to hip...I am wheelchair bound. Please help." <p>

Besides answering questions about DCCA's programs, Hotline staffers also retain a listing of other agencies' toll-free numbers, including those of Public Aid, Mental Health, Aging, and the Department of Children and Family Services.  Well-established communication channels also are maintained with the state's electric and gas utilities, including Commonwealth Edison, People's Gas, CILCO, and Illinois Power.<p>

Reed is proud of the work she and other DCCA staffers do.  "We're a small operation with only one phone line, but we probably touch every segment of the state's social services network.  We are a lifeline for a lot of needy people across the state."<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline number is 800/252-8643 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<center>###</center>


Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra recently convened a "Coal Strategy Group" of leaders from the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies, including DCCA.  The group will discuss ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal thus ensuring a positive impact on local communities.<p>

<H3>NEW AND EXPANDING BUSINESSES CHOOSING ILLINOIS</H3>

More and more, Illinois is the location of choice for new and expanding
businesses.  Over the past few months, Gov. Jim Edgar has announced several
impressive projects that will create hundreds of new jobs for Illinois
workers.  Among the companies choosing to expand in Illinois are Motorola
and U.S. Robotics -- high technology companies that are contributing to
Illinois' emergence as the "silicon prairie."<P>
     
Motorola recently chose Elgin for the worldwide headquarters of its
Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS).  The $40 million plant is
expected to create 1,500 jobs.  At the official ceremonies announcing the
project, the Governor said, "Illinois is becoming known as the Silicon
Prairie because we deliver on our promise to provide the well-trained
workforce, infrastructure improvements and excellent transportation system
these companies require."<P>

MIMS is a world leader in the manufacture of cutting-edge communications
products associated with pagers and wireless communications.  The
headquarters will be built on a 130-acre parcel near I-90 in Elgin.  It is
slated for completion in 1997.<P>

U.S. Robotics is one of the world's leading suppliers of products and
systems that provide access to information.  The company designs,
manufacturers, markets and supports remote access servers, enterprise
communications systems, desktop/mobile client products and modems.  Gov. Edgar recently participated in
dedication ceremonies for the company's new $30 million manufacturing and
operations facility in Morton Grove, and announced that U.S. Robotics will
continue its investment in Illinois through expanding its Mt. Prospect
facility.<P>

The new Morton Grove plant employs more than 1,400 workers.  Constructed on
a 23-acre site, the 302,000 square-foot plant received a High Impact
Business designation from DCCA, enabling the company to realize an
estimated $1.3 million in business incentives, including an investment tax
credit and an exemption from state utility taxes.  DCCA also provided
$500,000 in job training assistance through the Industrial Training Program
(ITP).  The $40 million Mt. Prospect expansion, expected to create 1,500
jobs, also received a High Impact Business designation from DCCA, which
will provide an estimated $2.1 million in business incentives, as well as
commitment from DCCA to provide training assistance to workers.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser,
said, "As the world-wide demand for information access devices continued to
escalate, we will work with U.S. Robotics and other high technology firms
to ensure that Illinois is a place where these companies can thrive."<P>

Illinois is not only the choice for high-technology industries; it also is
attracting investment from global leaders like McDonald's Corporation,
which is undertaking one of the largest business retention and expansion
projects in the state's history.<P>

McDonald's, which operates 17,400 restaurants in more than 86 nations, will
expand its Oak Brook headquarters, adding as many as 7,000 new jobs over
the next 20 years to the 3,000 jobs currently at the facility.  Mike
Quinlan, McDonald's Chairman and CEO, said," With its excellent business
climate and emphasis on infrastructure improvements, Illinois provides us
with a strong foundation from which we can maximize our Oak Brook home
office support to our global food service business.  We appreciate state
and local government officials working together to support our investment
in Illinois."<P>

Three other recent announcements also solidified Illinois' strength as the
choice for business locations and expansions.<P>Menard, Inc. operates more than 100 retail stores in nine states, including
more than 30 stores in Illinois.  DCCA staff worked closely with company
officials for several months to settle on a location for a new distribution
facility to serve the company's needs.  That search ultimately led to
Plano, where the area's infrastructure (close proximity to rail, three
major interstates and an airport) made it an ideal location for a $20
million distribution center that will serve up to 80 Menard's Home
Improvement stores throughout the Midwest.   The new facility, which will
be completed in two phases, is expected to employ at least 300 people.
GE Lighting, a long-time corporate resident of Mattoon, announced plans in
December to invest $100 million in new production lines at the company's
lamp manufacturing plant.  The modernization project, which will be
assisted through $650,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds
provided by DCCA, is expected to create 50 new jobs during the next four
years.  An additional 150 jobs will be upgraded and 400 jobs will be
retained at the Mattoon plant, which will produce some of the company's
most sophisticated lighting products.<P>

And Moline's downtown area will benefit with John Deere Health Care's
announcement that it will undertake a $38 million development project,
including a 100,000 square-foot building to house John Deere Health Care's
corporate headquarters, a 15,000 square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion
and a new Community Transportation Center.  Plans also call for a new
first-class hotel to accommodate overnight visitors to the area.  Three-
hundred current John Deere Health Care employees and 100 new employees will
work in the new headquarters.  The Pavilion will feature displays and
historic exhibits and is expected to draw up to 400,000 visitors annually.
The Transportation Center will serve as an intercity bus transfer center
and staging area for bus tour groups.  The downtown development project is
being undertaken with more than $1 million in state assistance, including a
$600,000 loan to the City of Moline through DCCA's public infrastructure
program, up to $300,000 in job training funds to assist John Deere Health
Care with worker training, and a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant.
The Illinois Department of Transportation is also expected to provide
infrastructure assistance to help accommodate increased demand for parking
and increased traffic flow on the Arsenal Island Bridge.<P>

<H3>BRAZILIAN TRADE MISSION HIGHLIGHTS ETHANOL USE</H3>

As the nation's leading producer and consumer of ethanol, Illinois has a
vested interest in the development of ethanol-fueled vehicles for use both
here and abroad.  In keeping with that goal, Norm Marek of DCCA's Bureau of
Energy and Recycling recently participated in a Brazilian trade mission
designed to further efforts to develop and utilize more ethanol-fueled
vehicles in the U.S. and other nations.<P>

Marek joined Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Nebraska Gov. Benjamin Nelson
and 15 others, including representatives from two Illinois corporations
that are leading ethanol suppliers, on the six-day Brazilian trade mission.
Participants toured a giant sugar and alcohol production facility at Barra
Bonito and inspected new ethanol/gasahol/flexible fuel vehicles at the
General Motors do Brasil factory at Campanis.  They also attended a
conference on Brazil's experience using ethanol as a transportation fuel.<P>

"Brazil sees a great future for ethanol, especially with known petroleum
reserves dwindling," Marek said.  "Many of their thoughts echoed the
thoughts of those in the Governors' Ethanol Coalition."<P>

A highlight of the trade mission was the announcement by Gov. Thompson that
a cooperative work agreement has been reached between the Governors'
Ethanol Coalition and the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil on the worldwide
promotion of ethanol.<P>

Marek plans to regularly correspond with his Brazilian counterparts to
share information about current ethanol projects underway in Illinois and
keep up with new developments in Brazil.  "I was particularly impressed by
the discussions with the GM-Brazil engineers.  They're currently working on
a compressed natural gas (CNG)/ethanol flexible fuel vehicle.  This could
be an ideal project for Illinois, as it would help to bridge the gap
between ethanol and CNG factions."<P>

<H3>DCCA ANNOUNCES TENTATIVE 1996 CDAP DEADLINES</H3>

DCCA's Bureau of Community Development has set tentative deadlines for
communities to apply for the 1996 round of grants available through the
popular Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

CDAP is a federally-funded block grant program that provides funds to units
of local government, such as cities, villages, townships and counties, that
have  populations of 50,000 or less and are not located within one of the
seven urban counties (Cook, Lake, DuPage, Will, McHenry, Madison and St.
Clair) that receive funds directly from Washington.  Grants are available
for a wide range of projects that benefit low- and moderate-income people,
such as economic development projects that help create new jobs, public
facilities projects that address threats to public health and safety, and
housing rehabilitation.<P>

1996 programs and application deadlines include:<P>

<EM> Economic Development</EM> - Grant funds up to $500,000 are available.  Local
governments may use the funds to loan to a business locating or expanding
in the community to pay for machinery and equipment, working capital, or
building construction and renovation.  As loans are repaid, funds are
deposited into a locally-administered revolving loan fund to be used for
future economic development projects in the community.  Economic
Development grants may also be used to fund infrastructure improvements
directly related to the location or expansion of a business in a community.
These grants are awarded on an as-needed basis throughout the year.<P>

<EM> Planning Assistance</EM> - Local governments may seek grants up to $25,000 to
fund planning activities for future public facilities improvements,
including studies, analyses, data gathering, identification of
implementation actions and preparation of specific plans.  Applications are
judged on a competitive basis and are due on April 16, 1996.  A total of
$500,000 has been allocated for the 1996 round.<P>

<EM> Removal of Architectural Barriers</EM> - Grants up to $150,000 are available to
help local governments remove architectural barriers that restrict those
with disabilities from accessing publicly-owned buildings.  Applications
are judged on a competitive basis and are due on May 6, 1996.  A total of
$1 million is available in 1996.<P>

<EM> Public Facilities Construction/Design Engineering</EM> - Local governments may
compete for grants up to $50,000 for design engineering and up to $400,000
for public facilities construction projects needed to address threats to
public health and safety, such as inadequate water systems or unsafe sewage
treatment facilities.  In 1996, $1 million has been allocated for Design
Engineering grants and $20,860,570 has been earmarked for Public Facilities
Construction grants.  The deadline to apply is July 30, 1996.<P>

<EM> Housing Rehabilitation</EM> - To help ensure that safe, decent housing is
available for low- and moderate-income citizens, local governments may
compete for Housing Rehabilitation grants.  The grants, up to $400,000, are
used to upgrade and expand housing stock in the community.  Applications
are due on October 15, 1996.  A total of $7 million has been allocated for
this component.<P>

<EM> Emergency Public Facilities</EM> - Grants of up to $100,000 are available to
assist local governments when emergencies strike.  Grant funds may be used
to undertake projects that improve public infrastructure and eliminate
threats to public health and safety.  As emergencies may strike at any
time, grants are available on an as-needed basis.  DCCA has allocated $1
million for these grants during 1996.<P>
     
DCCA is also undertaking a three-year transition effort toward a goal of
starting the CDAP Program Year on January 1 of each calendar year.  This
effort is designed to enable DCCA to more expeditiously obligate and expend
CDAP funds.  Program years will be as follows:<P>

Program Year 1995 - June 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1996 - April 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1997 - January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997<BR>

To ease problems associated with compressing Program Year 1996 and the
early start of Program Year 1997, DCCA will use its unfunded, eligible
Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications as the projects to be
funded under Program Year 1997.  This means local governments that
submitted Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications will not have to
re-submit them in Program Year 1997.<P>

Local governments may contact DCCA to receive CDAP application materials
and guidelines.  Contact Kay Wallwork at DCCA, 620 E. Adams, Springfield,
IL  62701, phone 217/785-7546 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).  For further
information about the Community Development Assistance Program, contact
Jean Thomas at 217/782-6136 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<P>

<HR>
<H3>MACLEAN, VER KUILEN NAMED TO KEY POSTS</H3>

Two DCCA veterans have recently been appointed to management positions in
the agency.  Ron Ver Kuilen, whose 15 years at DCCA have included service
as a field scout and manager of the Film Production Unit, has been named
Director of the Illinois Film Office.  Margaret MacLean, who joined DCCA's
International Business Division in 1991 and served as an international
marketing specialist and export promotion officer, has assumed the post of
Division Manager.<P>

As Film Office Director, Ver Kuilen will oversee the state's efforts to
market locations, talent, labor and production expertise to the national
and international film industry.  It's a big job -- since the film office's
inception in 1975, 523 productions have filmed in Illinois contributing
more than $700 million direct cash to the state's economy.<P>

Ver Kuilen has already served as project coordinator for more than 200
productions, including "Home Alone,"  "Field of Dreams," and Groundhog
Day."  But his work is not all glamorous Hollywood lunches and escorting
movie stars.  Most of it involves working with labor, government, business
and community leaders to ensure that doors open for filmmakers, such as
convincing building superintendents to leave the lights on at the Wrigley
Building for a special nighttime shot.  Ver Kuilen has also worked nights,
weekends and even Christmas Day to help filmmakers achieve the effects they
want.<P>

A native of Milwaukee, Ver Kuilen holds bachelor's and master's degrees
from  Northeastern Illinois University.  He is a member of the Association
of Film Commissioners International, manager of his softball team, and was
named 1994's "Facilitator of the Year" by Screen Magazine.<P>

Margaret MacLean's background serves her well as Managing Director of the
International Business Division.  A graduate of Dartmouth College, MacLean
has studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong through a program
sponsored by Yale University, and at Scripps College in Claremont, CA.  She
also completed a year in Tokyo studying the Japanese language.  She is
conversant in Japanese, Chinese and French.<P>

MacLean comes to her post after five years with the Division, where she
advised Illinois manufacturers on export strategies for Asian markets,
researched and analyzed trade issues, developed and maintained contacts and
relations with government and business officials in the U.S. and Asia,
provided training for small business exporting under NAFTA, orchestrated
official visits for foreign dignitaries, and coordinated trade shows and
trade missions overseas.<P>

As Managing Director, she oversees operations of the state's six foreign
offices, and manages a staff of international trade professionals
headquartered in Chicago and Springfield.  Under her direction, the
Division also is administering a $450,000 grant awarded through the federal
government's Market Development Cooperator Program.  As one of only three
states to receive the grant, Illinois is using its funds to provide direct
financial assistance to enable Illinois companies to participate in trade
missions and trade shows overseas.<P>

<HR>
<H3>DCCA'S "ON THE WEB"</H3>

Internet users "surfing" on the World Wide Web can now access information
about DCCA's programs and services!<P>

Located at http://www.accessil.com/dcca/, or through the State Agencies
pick on the State of Illinois home page (http://www. state.il.us.), DCCA's
home page is designed to give Internet users quick, easy access to program
summaries; fact sheets detailing important statistics and information about
Illinois; community profiles; legislation affecting small businesses; and
calendars detailing program deadlines, workshops and other important
information.  In addition, users can access the First-Stop Business
Information Center of Illinois, a new DCCA service that offers valuable
assistance to start-up and small businesses.  First-Stop provides
businesses and individuals with access to information and referral
assistance to guide them through the permitting, licensing and regulatory
processes.  First-Stop also can link them to other available resources that
can help them comply with government regulations and enhance their
competitiveness.<P>

Over the coming months, DCCA will be making other additions and
improvements to its Web site.  One of the most exciting is the anticipated
February debut of a new Illinois Tourism pick specifically designed to help
users plan travel in Illinois.<P>

DCCA also continues to make information available through the Access
Illinois bulletin board system.  Anyone with a PC, modem and communications
software can utilize Access Illinois by calling 217/787-6255, settings
ANSI, 8, N, 1.  The only charge to bulletin board users is for the cost of
the telephone call.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Overview</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>

<p>
Fiscal Year 1995 was a year of new beginnings for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. <p> 

On January 10, 1995, Gov. Jim Edgar signaled his commitment to advancing economic development in Illinois by appointing Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra as his senior advisor on economic development and giving him responsibility to oversee DCCA's future direction.  In making the appointment, Edgar said, "To ensure the future prosperity of Illinois, state government needs a coordinated, effective and well-managed system of economic development programs.  Bob Kustra is uniquely qualified to lead such a coordinated approach."  The executive order specified that the Director of DCCA reports directly to the Lieutenant Governor and remains ultimately responsible to the Governor.  The order also created the Economic Development Coordinating Council, which includes the heads of more than a dozen state agencies, boards and commissions that impact economic development.  Kustra was named Chairman of the Council by the Governor.<p>

In accepting the new responsibilities, Kustra said, "Illinois, obviously, has what it takes to create and retain jobs.  That's one reason we have more Illinoisans in jobs today than at any point in history.  Yet, we face pressures from other regions of the country and global competition.  We must be ready to take advantage of all opportunities, protect our investment and plan for the future."<p>

A week later, on January 17, 1995, Gov. Edgar named Dennis R. Whetstone as DCCA Director, replacing Jan M. Grayson, who resigned to pursue opportunities in the private sector.<p>

Whetstone, who had served for two years as an Assistant to the Governor for Planning, returned to DCCA where he had honed his skills in economic development for more than 18 years.  Before joining the Governor's staff, Whetstone had served as Executive Deputy Director at DCCA, supervising and coordinating the functions of the Department's bureaus of Program Administration, Marketing, Small Business Assistance, Tourism and Operations.  He also had served as Deputy Director for the Bureau of Program Administration and as manager of Job Training Programs for that bureau.<p>

Gov. Edgar cited Whetstone's expertise in workforce preparation, in particular, when announcing his choice.  "As part of our efforts to retool and re-energize the state's economic development efforts, we have recognized it is crucial Illinois continues to offer highly skilled, strongly motivated workers who have helped make us an economic giant in the nation's heartland."  Kustra added, "Dennis knows the needs of the private sector and shares our goal of making Illinois an even better place to do business.  With his help, we'll make certain that DCCA responds swiftly to opportunities to create and retain jobs in Illinois."<p>

In May, the leadership team expanded with the appointment of Levi Moore as DCCA's Assistant Director.  Moore, who had earlier worked in DCCA's Business Development Bureau, returned to DCCA following two years as a senior associate in the Chicago office of Korn/Ferry International.<p>
  
With these new leaders at the helm, DCCA moved aggressively forward to further Illinois' leadership in the field of economic development.  Through its Industry Development Division, in Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA successfully worked with local economic development officials to offer assistance to companies seeking to locate or expand their facilities in Illinois.  Among companies announcing plans to locate, expand, modernize or renovate their facilities were DeMert & Dougherty, Inc.; Motorola; Independence Tube Corp.; MacLean-Fogg Company; Maytag Corporation; Knapheide Manufacturing Co.; National Steel Corporation; C. J. Vitner Company; U.S. Robotics, Inc.; Cotter & Co.; and IBP, Inc.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Development Center staff counseled 9,348 companies and helped to provide management training to more than 10,000 people.  This assistance helped businesses to create 534 new jobs, retain more than 1,700 jobs, start 379 new businesses, expand 219 businesses, and obtain more than $52 million in business financing.  The Procurement Technical Assistance Centers helped Illinois firms secure more than $164 million in government contracts, while more than 1,700 small businesses received exporting assistance through the International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers.<p>

DCCA continued with the development of the First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois, a statewide program designed to make it easier for entrepreneurs and business people to learn about and comply with state requirements.<p>  

The Office of Women's Business Development, created in Fiscal Year 1994, established a firm foundation during Fiscal Year 1995, working to promote greater understanding of the women's business community by helping women entrepreneurs tackle the wide range of challenges they confront, as well as providing administrative support to the Illinois Women's Business Ownership Council.<p>

The Loan Administration Division continued its important work consolidating DCCA's business loan programs, thus lessening confusion for loan applicants.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Division analyzed more than 100 applications totaling $36.8 million.  The Division also continued to administer the Participation Loan Program, funding 13 loans totaling $2.9 million, which leveraged approximately $15.3 million in private investment, and enabled businesses to create or retain nearly 1,500 jobs.<p>

DCCA expanded its efforts to make information readily available on the "Information Highway" through Access Illinois, a 24-hour on-line information bulletin board service that links government agencies with trade associations and business organizations.  As one of the charter subscribers to Access Illinois, DCCA provides interested people with access to agency publications, newsletters, program descriptions and other information.  During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA also began working with Access Illinois toward development of a Department "home page" on the Internet.<p>

DCCA also continued to fine-tune its efforts to help Illinois businesses achieve success in the global marketplace.  Through the International Business Division, DCCA provided assistance to 27 Illinois exhibitors at foreign trade shows; provided international marketing assistance to 600 Illinois companies; represented 534 companies at catalog shows; and co-sponsored more than 55 export development seminars, conferences or workshops. <p> 

Fiscal Year 1995 saw DCCA working closely with the business and labor communities to promote positive labor-management relations in Illinois.  In addition to providing 11 labor-management grants totaling $287,800 to support cooperative labor-management programs in the state, DCCA also worked with the Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee to promote and encourage adoption of cooperative workplace programs.  A special "Labor-Management Partners:  On the Road to High Performance" award was developed to highlight and recognize Illinois employer organizations that demonstrate positive labor-management relations and cooperative work strategies.<p>  

DCCA continued its efforts to assist Illinois businesses in finding and implementing new technologies and modern business practices that help them remain competitive.  After leading the successful effort to secure a $1.4 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, DCCA's Office of Policy Development, Planning and Research (PDPR) administered the contract until staff could be hired.  PDPR staff also developed and distributed Requests for Proposals for funding under the Technology Challenge Grant Program, resulting in the funding of 10 regional manufacturing extension centers.  These centers, the core of the state's Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) initiative, will play a crucial role in fostering future research and technology transfer.<p>

Fiscal Year 1995 saw DCCA take concrete steps toward an ambitious effort to change the way Illinois delivers job training services to its workers and businesses.  Working closely with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), DCCA awarded more than $1.1 million in grants to develop 16 regional "one stop" career centers designed to consolidate employment and training services under one roof, thus easing the path to employment for unemployed and economically-
disadvantaged Illinoisans.  The joint effort, for which planning began in 1991, is the foundation of an even more impressive network of one-stop centers which will eventually blanket the entire state.<p>

Meanwhile, DCCA's staff continued working with a network of local administering agencies to ensure that job training services were available to those needing them.  Under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), 21,200 dislocated workers received job training assistance.  JTPA's Title IIA programs, which address the needs of economically disadvantaged adults, served 15,010 individuals statewide; an additional 1,237 older adults were served through the JTPA Title IIA Set-Aside Program for older workers.  Title IIC programs served 10,957 economically disadvantaged youths.  DCCA also provided a $408,889 grant to continue planning of a comprehensive Education to Careers system for Illinois.<p>

DCCA staffers continued their work with businesses, colleges and universities, and intermediary organizations to provide training to help Illinois workers keep their skills consistent with changing technologies and business processes.  Through the Industrial Training Program (ITP), DCCA funded 58 projects that benefited 1,321 companies and 38,652 trainees.<p>

Smaller Illinois communities often need assistance to meet the housing, infrastructure and economic development needs of their citizens.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA provided nearly $6 million through the federally-funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) to assist with 14 economic development projects.  An additional $41.2 million in supplemental CDAP funds were allocated to assist local governments in their continuing efforts to repair damages inflicted by the Great Flood of 1993.<p>

DCCA staffers also worked closely with their counterparts from the Illinois Department of Public Aid to successfully help local communities compile application proposals for the federally-funded Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community programs.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the City of Chicago was designated as an Empowerment Zone and the cities of Springfield and East St. Louis received designation as Enterprise Communities.<p>

Local government officials also relied on DCCA to help them learn more about ways to effectively utilize their resources.  Through its Office of Local Government Management Services, DCCA conducted or participated in 51 training sessions, assisting more than 3,100 elected and appointed government officials.  The office also responded to more than 1,100 telephone calls from local officials, distributed more than 10,500 publications and conducted 82 direct technical assistance projects.  The Office of Local Government Initiatives, established in Fiscal Year 1994, worked with 19 communities designated to participate in the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI), a new effort designed to help communities enhance their competitiveness for business retention, expansion and attraction.  CCI received special recognition when a study team sent to Illinois by the Governor of Pennsylvania recommended CCI as a program that should be established in the Keystone State.<p>

Low-income Illinoisans received DCCA assistance to help them overcome many of the difficulties they face in everyday life.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA helped 201,582 households through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps pay a portion of the cost of winter energy bills.  In addition, the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) assisted 6,992 households.  The Community Services Block Grant Program (CSBG), which includes the CSBG Loan Program, a scholarship program and an emergency community services program to help the homeless, assisted 322,932 Illinoisans.<p>

Tourism, one of the state's fastest-growing industries, continued to thrive in Illinois during Fiscal Year 1995.  Domestic and international tourism revenues reached a record $15.9 billion during Calendar Year 1994 -- a 6.3 percent increase over the previous year.  Tourism contributed $995 million in local and state taxes, and supported 241,500 jobs in the state with a payroll of $4.8 billion.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism took the marketing of Illinois tourism to a new level, conducting an integrated marketing program designed to identify and reach the state's most likely tourism customers.  A new advertising campaign promoting the theme "Illinois:  A Million Miles from Monday" was launched to position Illinois as the ideal weekend getaway destination.  Advertising and public relations strategies also promoted the Bureau's new toll-free information number, 1-800-2CONNECT, which connects consumers to Illinois' state-of-the-art Illinois Travel Counseling System, enabling consumers to speak with a trained travel counselor.<p> 

DCCA also was affected by the reorganization of the state's natural resource agencies into one "super-agency."  The breakup of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) sent three major responsibilities -- energy conservation and alternative energy, recycling, and coal development and marketing -- to DCCA.  Although these programs did not become a part of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs until Fiscal Year 1996, their statistical and programmatic information for Fiscal Year 1995 is included in this report.<p> 

The foundations laid in Fiscal Year 1995 will continue to pay dividends as DCCA and the State of Illinois move confidently forward into Fiscal Year 1996 and beyond.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Director's Message</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<hr>
<p>
When I returned to DCCA in Fiscal 1995, I returned with a clear agenda.  One of my first goals was to do everything I could to again enhance the visibility and credibility of the agency, both within state government and in the eyes of our constituents and customers.<p>  

DCCA was created in 1979 to coordinate and run services and programs in an integrated way so as to best serve the needs of businesses, local governments and the recipients of human services programs.  In recent years, the agency lost some of that focus by trying to do too many things without a sufficient resource base.<p>  

It's time to get back to the basics.<p>  

Illinois and DCCA have many opportunities.  But, in the past, many of those opportunities have been overshadowed by unnecessary bureaucracy, unneeded paperwork, cumbersome procedures and processes, and onerous rules and regulations.  Although some of this is necessary to ensure the public's trust and our accountability, I challenged the DCCA staff to start thinking of ways to streamline and improve processes and procedures to achieve efficiencies, both internally and externally.<p>

DCCA today has begun the process of "market-testing" its programs to ensure that they are demand-driven and truly responsive to the needs of customers.  We are working closer than ever to forge new partnerships with major business and local government organizations and serve as an outspoken advocate for our mutual constituents.<p>  

We're working to build the foundations that can lead to prosperous industries, rising real incomes and more quality jobs for our workers.  That's economic development and that's what we do.<p>

On the cover of this Annual Report you will see DCCA's Mission Statement.  Although the language in this Mission Statement was finalized in Fiscal Year 1996, its seeds were planted in Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  

I pledge to you our continued dedication to this mission.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Bureau of Business Development continued its efforts to position Illinois as the location of choice for businesses looking to locate or expand, and to help smaller businesses achieve success.<p>

Late in the fiscal year, DCCA began work toward launching a Fiscal Year 1996 marketing effort built around the theme, "Illinois -- a great place for business keeps getting better."  The marketing effort included a special supplement to Area Development magazine, planning for a special advertising supplement in Business Week magazine, and advertising in magazines and Midwest newspapers, including Crain's Chicago Business, the Chicago Tribune, and the Wall Street Journal.  It was designed to highlight the Fiscal Year 1995 passage of tort reform legislation that made Illinois a more attractive location.  The reforms, enacted by the General Assembly and signed by Gov. Jim Edgar, abolished the antiquated Structural Work Act that was duplicative of workers' compensation.  They also abolished the doctrine of joint and several liability and reformed product liability litigation, capped punitive damages, limited non-economic damages and made other significant changes to underline Illinois' image as a business-friendly state.<p>

<h3>Division of Industry Development</h3>

DCCA's Division of Industry Development is the agency's central source of economic development information and assistance for businesses and local economic development organizations.

</ul>


<a name="Small Business"><hr></a>
<h3>Small Business Division</h3>

DCCA's Small Business Division, a part of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN), provides focused assistance to small and medium-sized Illinois businesses.  Through the ISBDCN, which functions in partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration, companies receive technical and management assistance to help them achieve success.<p>

Among services of the Small Business Division are:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Regulatory Flexibility Program, which reviews proposed rules affecting small businesses, including in-depth analyses into their impact on Illinois small businesses.<p>
<li> Illinois Business Energy and Environmental Technology Program, which provides information and referral assistance to firms looking to improve their profitability through efficiencies in their energy systems, as well as by reducing wastes in their production processes.  During Fiscal Year 1995, a clearinghouse of information was created containing more than 1,000 sources of assistance.  Information or assistance was provided to 1,100 businesses.  Program staff also co-sponsored the first Illinois Energy and Environmental Expo, slated to become an annual event.<p>
<li> Small Business Environmental Assistance Program, created in Fiscal Year 1995.  This program, federally mandated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, provides assistance to Illinois small businesses through a toll-free help line, an Environmental Clearinghouse containing 250 documents, an Environmental Services Directory of 272 firms with environmental expertise, and sponsorship of educational seminars.  The program provided 1,053 small businesses with compliance assistance and information during Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  
</ul>


<a name="SBDC"><hr></a>
<h3>Illinois Small Business Development Center Network</h3>

The Network is comprised of 40 Small Business Development Center (SBDC) locations, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Small Business Development Centers, which provide businesses with management, marketing and financial counseling.<p>
<li> Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, which assist existing businesses in contracting with state, federal and local governments by offering general procurement counseling and other services.<p>
<li> International Trade Centers (ITCs) at five locations around the state, including two NAFTA Opportunity Centers (NOCs).  The ITCs provide business owners with professional advice and resources to prepare them to enter the global marketplace.  The NAFTA Opportunity Centers offer specialized assistance to companies entering the Mexican and Canadian marketplaces.<p>  
<li> Small Business Innovative Research Center, which provides counseling, training and technical assistance to technology-oriented entrepreneurs to enhance their ability to compete for federal research and development awards.<p>
<li> Small Business Incubators, which provide businesses in the early stages of development with shared resources to help them achieve success.<p>
</ul>


In Fiscal Year 1995, the ISBDCN counseled 9,348 companies and assisted in the management training of 10,177 individuals, resulting in the creation of 1,534 new jobs, retention of 1,721 jobs, start-up of 379 new businesses, 219 business expansions and securing of more than $52.3 million in business financing.  The 15 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers conducted 7,643 counseling sessions, helping their clients obtain 2,656 government contracts totaling $164.4 million, create 330 new jobs and retain 1,709 jobs.  The ITCs and NOCs provided individual exporting advice and training to more than 1,700 small businesses entering the export marketplace.<p>

The ISBDCN played an important role during Fiscal Year 1995 in supporting the White House Conference on Small Business, held in Washington D.C. in June 1995.  The conference, which offered small business people an opportunity to voice their concerns and ideas for improving the strength of the nation's small business climate, was attended by a 67-member delegation from Illinois, which included 44 delegates elected at Illinois conferences held in August 1994 and April 1995, as well as 23 delegates appointed by Gov. Edgar and members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.<p>

Another major effort undertaken by the ISBDCN in Fiscal Year 1995 was a partnership with the QVC television shopping network.  Working with QVC's national campaign to showcase products from each of the 50 states, the ISBDCN and DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism organized a statewide competition to identify local and regional products to be featured on a special QVC program focusing on Illinois.  Nearly 500 Illinois vendors took part in the competition that resulted in selection of 20 products and five alternates to be featured on the nationally-televised program.<p>   


<a name="Women"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Women's Business Development</h3>

The Office of Women's Business Development sponsors and implements a wide range of programs for women business owners active in domestic and international markets.  Staffed by the Illinois Women's Business Advocate and the Women's Business Liaison, the office promotes greater understanding of the women's business community, with special emphasis on minority women's business issues and development of a comprehensive database on women business owners.  The Office works with individual companies, corporations and professional associations to help women entrepreneurs tackle the wide range of challenges they may encounter in their businesses.  The Office serves as a conduit to business resources throughout the state, providing information, referral and procurement assistance for women business owners in Illinois.  It also provides administrative support to the Illinois Women's Business Ownership Council.<p>


<a name="Minority"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Minority Business Development</h3>

The Office of Minority Business Development works to enhance the impact of minority business entrepreneurs by promoting greater understanding of business issues affecting minority businesses.  The Office is staffed by two minority business advocates, including a bilingual liaison to the Hispanic business community.  These advocates work closely with local minority business councils, as well as through a statewide mentoring program implemented through the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.<p>


<a name="First Stop"><hr></a>
<h3>First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois</h3>

Development of the ambitious First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois continued in Fiscal Year 1995.  The Center is being designed as a statewide program to enhance the state's business climate by making it easier for Illinois businesses to deal with state requirements.  The Center will provide businesses with easy access to the information and services they require to be more competitive, including information on permitting, licensing and regulatory procedures, as well as links to other resources.  Besides providing access to trained information specialists, the Center will provide information through hard-copy booklets, computerized services on the Access Illinois bulletin board and the World Wide Web, and a toll-free telephone service.<p>  


<a name="AI"><hr></a>
<h3>Access Illinois</h3>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued its efforts to make its products and services more accessible through communications technology.  As a charter subscriber to the Access Illinois computerized bulletin board, DCCA made its information available to any consumer with a telephone, computer, communications software and a modem.  Among services available on-line:  loan applications, calendars of events, international trade leads, general information on programs and services, a database of Illinois community profiles, and the ability to download or order hard-copies of many DCCA publications.  Access Illinois also includes a number of issue-related forums that allow the exchange of ideas, as well as electronic mail access to the Internet.  DCCA also began working with Access Illinois during Fiscal Year 1995 toward the Fiscal Year 1996 launch of an agency Home Page on the World Wide Web.<p>

<h3>Industrial Services Division</h3>

The Industrial Services Division assists Illinois businesses by performing on-site safety and health consultations that help firms identify and correct health and safety hazards in the workplace.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Division completed more than 735 consultations, responded to 4,700 calls for technical assistance, and trained more than 2,700 employers and employees on workplace safety and health.<p>  

In conjunction with the Office of the Governor and the private sector, the Industrial Services Division worked during Fiscal Year 1995 to help coordinate efforts of Project Safe Illinois, an outreach program directed toward the Illinois business community. The goal of Project Safe is to make employers aware of the benefits of workplace safety and health.  Plans were begun to establish a strategy for a 1996 Safety and Health Conference that will offer exhibits and training workshops of interest to the businesses of Illinois.<p>

The Division also has expanded its education and training section to reach out to additional industries with information on safety and health management, confined space entry, chemical exposure, ergonomics, machinery guarding, blood-borne pathogens, tuberculosis and many other related subjects of concern to Illinois industries.<p>  

The Division will continue to provide information and assistance on new regulations and workplace hazards to those industries that request, primarily concentrating on the Illinois small business community.<p>


<a name="Loan"><hr></a>
<h3>Loan Administration Division</h3>

DCCA's Loan Administration Division consolidates all agency business loan programs in one place, lessening confusion for loan applicants.  Division staffers also provide fiscal analyses for many of DCCA's grant programs.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the Division analyzed 105 applications totaling $36.8 million.  Included among the applications were 16 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) applications totaling $9.5 million, seven Business Development Public Infrastructure applications totaling $3.1 million, 61 applications for assistance through the Industrial Training Program (ITP) totaling $19.75 million, and 19 applications for assistance through the Small Business Development Program/Participation Loan Program totaling $4.26 million.<p>

Primarily, the Division focuses its efforts on management of the Participation Loan Program that provides assistance to Illinois small businesses through participation in loans made through financial intermediaries.  During Fiscal Year 1995, 13 Participation Loans were funded totaling $2.9 million.  The projects resulted in the creation and retention of more than 1,458 jobs and stimulated private sector investment of approximately $15.3 million.<p>

The Division also administers the Community Development Corporation Program through establishing bank-driven Community Development Corporations (CDCs).  These CDCs enable DCCA to provide matching-grant funding to help finance the establishment of initial lending pools.  DCCA is committed to the continued establishment of CDCs and makes financial assistance available to them through participation in their loans to qualified local businesses when that funding demonstrates a positive impact on the competitiveness of the firms and the number of jobs they create.  In Fiscal Year 1995, four new CDCs were formed with DCCA's assistance, bringing the total number of CDCs operating in Illinois to 39.  DCCA made 10 grants to CDCs totaling $583,000.  CDCs capitalized by DCCA financed 16 projects utilizing $294,000 in DCCA funds.  These loans stimulated private sector investment of approximately $8.2 million and resulted in the creation of 311 jobs and retention of 169 jobs. <p> 

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Division initiated the Contractor Bond Guaranty Program designed to assist small and disadvantaged Illinois contractors and subcontractors to obtain bid, payment and performance bonds through surety companies.  DCCA entered into a financial intermediary agreement with the First Illinois Development Credit Corporation to administer the program.  By the end of the fiscal year, the program was up and running with two contractors having successfully secured contracts totaling $740,000 that were guaranteed by $267,000 in DCCA funds.<p>


<a name="International"><hr></a>
<h3>International Business Division</h3>

DCCA's International Business Division (IBD) helps Illinois firms develop their export capabilities and assists foreign companies in expanding or locating in the state.  The IBD focuses its efforts on exploring and expanding opportunities for Illinois businesses in foreign markets, thus increasing the opportunities for their success in an increasingly global economy.<p>

DCCA's IBD provides assistance to Illinois exporters through a three-tiered export infrastructure that includes local, state and overseas resources.  Among those:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Five International Trade Centers (ITCs) located throughout the state that assist Illinois businesses in their efforts to achieve success in the export marketplace.  These centers, located at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Bradley University in Peoria, NORBIC in Chicago, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, provide one-on-one counseling to potential Illinois exporters and are a component of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.  The Centers at NORBIC and Bradley University are also NAFTA Opportunity Centers that specialize in assisting Illinois businesses to achieve success in the Canadian and Mexican marketplaces.<p>

 The IBD's Chicago headquarters, staffed by trade specialists with international expertise in regional markets, provides assistance to companies with specific needs related to doing business in Europe, the Far East, Canada and Latin America.  Regional marketing specialists in Chicago also coordinate a number of activities and programs to assist Illinois exporters, including international trade shows and missions, catalog shows, a trade lead program, and the Illinois Export Alliance.<p>

 International resources, including six foreign trade offices located in Brussels, Belgium; Hong Kong; Tokyo, Japan; Warsaw, Poland; Budapest, Hungary; and Mexico City, Mexico.  These offices assist Illinois companies in identifying and securing in-country business partners, distribution channels and market intelligence.  The foreign trade offices also assist foreign investors and buyers seeking Illinois products and services or site locations in Illinois.<p>
</dd></dl>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's International Business Division:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Assisted 27 Illinois exhibitors at foreign trade shows, generating $500,000 in immediate sales with projected 12-month increased sales of more than $9.3 million.<p>
<li> Provided international marketing assistance to 600 Illinois companies.<p>
<li> Represented 534 companies at catalog shows, identifying more than 5,272 foreign trade leads for Illinois companies.<p>
<li> Co-sponsored more than 55 export development seminars, conferences or workshops attended by more than 4,500 participants.<p>
</ul>


In Calendar Year 1994, Illinois exports grew from $21.9 billion to $26.4 billion.  Illinois' export growth rate of 20.2 percent between 1993 and 1994 was six times greater than the national export growth rate of 10.2 percent, and moved the state up to fifth place in direct exports, marking the second consecutive year the state's ranking has improved.<p>

Illinois' top six trading partners in 1994 and the dollar value of those exports:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Canada  - $6.3 billion<br>
 Japan   - $2.2 billion<br>
 Mexico  - $2.0 billion<br>
 United Kingdom - $1.3 billion<br>
 Germany - $1.3 billion<br>
 China   - $1.0 billion<p>
</dd></dl>

In Calendar Year 1994, Illinois' leading export categories and their dollar value included:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Industrial Machinery/Computer Equipment - $7.2 billion<br>
 Electric Machinery - $5.1 billion<br>
 Chemical Products - $3.7 billion<br>
 Transportation Equipment - $1.7 billion<br>
 Food Products - $1.3 billion<br>
 Agricultural Products - $1.2 billion<br>
 Instruments - $993 million<p>
</dd></dl>

The importance of the IBD's efforts is best illustrated by a look at the importance of exporting to the Illinois economy.  It is estimated that more than 668,000 Illinoisans are employed in jobs sustained by direct or indirect exports, with 248,000 Illinois workers employed by foreign-owned companies with locations in the state.  One in four manufacturing jobs and one in eight jobs in Illinois are dependent upon exports.  Additionally, every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 in state tax revenue.<p>

<p>

DCCA's Bureau of Community Development works with local governments and networks of local administering agencies to help enhance quality of life and create strong, vital communities that attract and retain businesses and their jobs.  Programs administered by the Bureau include the federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Industrial Training Program (ITP), and the Illinois Labor-Management Grant Program, that help to enhance workers' skills and the viability of the Illinois workforce; technology programs to help businesses benefit from advancements and become more competitive; programs to help local officials better serve their constituents; programs such as Enterprise Zones and the federally-funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP), which help communities improve their attractiveness to businesses and address infrastructure needs; and programs designed to improve economic opportunities for low-income residents of Illinois. <p>

<a name="JTPA"><hr></a>
<h3>Job Training Partnership Act</h3>

Through the federally-funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), jobless and disadvantaged Illinois workers are provided with retraining, readjustment and supportive services designed to provide them with opportunities to become productive members of society.  JTPA programs assist workers dislocated from their jobs, and help economically-disadvantaged youths and adults, older workers and others who face barriers to employment.<p>

As the state agency administering the JTPA programs in Illinois, DCCA works closely with a network of local administering agencies to operate a comprehensive system of services to respond to the changing work force development environment.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued its partnership with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) to develop new ways to deliver services more effectively.  In addition, the partnership expanded to include the Illinois Department of Public Aid and the Illinois Community College Board.  A primary component of that strategy is development of a network of One-Stop Career Centers (OSCCs) throughout the state, in which employment and training services will be consolidated under one roof.  These centers will allow clients to file for unemployment compensation benefits, register with the Job Service, and access JTPA-funded training and a variety of other services to help the individual enter or re-enter the labor force.  They also will provide business seeking qualified workers with streamlined services, and prepare specific training plans that tailor training, education and work force preparation programs to meet the needs of area employers.<p>  

In September 1994, Gov. Jim Edgar participated in ceremonies announcing more than $1.1 million in planning grants to develop 16 One-Stop Career Centers in Illinois.  By March 1995, when Director Dennis Whetstone participated in grand opening ceremonies at the Decatur Employment and Training Center, that number had grown to $1.7 million in planning grants, with projections for 40 regional OSCCs throughout the state.  In the later months of Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA submitted its application to the U. S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to fund a three-year project to speed up implementation of the network.  (In early Fiscal Year 1996, DCCA received word that the USDOL had selected Illinois as one of seven states chosen to implement the Network.  Illinois received a grant of nearly $6.7 million to fund activities during the first year of the three-year project, with a total of $16.7 million available over the three year period.  With the federal assistance, Illinois now plans to establish 55 full-service centers and 93 satellite centers around the state.)<p>

DCCA continued to serve as an active member of the state's Education-to-Careers Steering Committee during Fiscal Year 1995.  The Steering Committee membership was expanded to include not only representatives from state government, but also local educators at the secondary and postsecondary levels, business partners, and organized labor.  The Steering Committee is under the leadership of the office of Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, with a private sector facilitator.<p>

The Committee is coordinating the organization of local Education-to-Careers partnerships around community college boundaries.  It developed a marketing notebook that will be distributed to local partnerships, and members of the Steering Committee participated in numerous conferences and workshops on school-to-work initiatives.  The Committee is finalizing learner and system goals for the local partnerships to consider during their planning period.  Minimum planning grants will be issued to each partnership when it is appropriately constituted and an application is received.  The work of the Steering Committee will be summarized in a report and forwarded to the Human Resource Investment Council for subsequent action.<p>  

The Illinois Job Training Coordinating Council (IJTCC), a 50-member advisory body to the Governor and General Assembly on workforce preparation and development issues, continued a project to develop a long-term agenda for workforce preparation activities in Illinois.  The IJTCC has focused its efforts on assessing Illinois' future occupational needs and prospects, defining goals, establishing criteria and identifying and fostering the required information flows for policy coordination.  DCCA managed the project during Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  

For Fiscal Year 1995 Illinois received $46,291,769 to fund JTPA Title III programs.  These funds enabled DCCA to provide job training assistance to 23,339 dislocated workers.  Out of 9,731 dislocated workers terminated from the program, 7,350 re-entered the labor force at an average wage of $10.19 per hour after receiving Title III assistance.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, $25,205,560 was made available under JTPA Title IIC, the Year-Round Youth Program, to support programs and services for economically disadvantaged and at-risk young people ages 14 to 21.  Of these program participants, 2,701 became employed.<p>

DCCA continued its efforts to help economically disadvantaged adults.  In Fiscal Year 1995, JTPA Title IIA programs served 15,010 participants statewide.  An additional 1,237 older individuals were served through the JTPA Title IIA Set-Aside Program for this population.  Of the 8,929 adults who finished the Title IIA program, 4,946 entered employment with an average wage at placement of $7.50 per hour.  Underlining the importance of the program, 4,166 of Title IIA participants were public assistance recipients; out of 3,081 terminating from the program, 1,456 entered employment.<p>


<a name="Industrial Training"><hr></a>
<h3>Industrial Training Program</h3>

The state-funded Industrial Training Program (ITP) is recognized as a vital component of DCCA's overall effort to ensure that Illinois companies are competitive in a global economy and that the skills of Illinois' workforce remain among the highest in the world.  A skilled work force enables companies to respond to the productivity, cost and quality requirements demanded by its customers.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, ITP training funds were an integral component of many of the Industry Development projects outlined in this report, including DeMert & Dougherty, Motorola, SMF, Simonton Building Products, Knapheide Manufacturing Company, Honeywell's Micro Switch Division and Cotter & Company.  In addition, ITP training funds were used to assist with many previously-announced retention, expansion and location projects, including 3M Company, American Steel Foundries, General Tire, Kraft General Foods, Magnet, Nabisco, tesa tuck and Tootsie Roll.  As a result of these projects and others, ITP grants assisted with the training of 1,854 new employees and the retraining and/or skill upgrading of 9,384 existing workers.<p>

Since Fiscal Year 1992, DCCA has worked to develop partnerships with intermediary organizations to encourage the implementation and expansion of multi-company training projects.  These intermediary organizations include statewide business and industry organizations, original equipment manufacturers sponsoring training for employees of their Illinois-based supplier network companies, labor organizations, community colleges and universities.  These programs have proven to be especially beneficial to small and medium-sized companies which often do not have the internal resources -- financial, personnel, expertise and/or technology -- to cost-effectively provide these training programs individually for their employees.<p>  

In Fiscal Year 1995, ITP grants were awarded to the following intermediary organizations:  the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, Management Association of Illinois, Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Chemical Industry Council of Illinois, Deere & Company, Elgin Community College, Ford Motor Company, Highland Community College, Illinois Cast Metals Association, Society of Plastics Industry, South Suburban Community College, and Valley Industrial Association.  As a result of these grants, 243 new employees and 21,085 existing employees representing 1,278 Illinois companies benefited from training programs.  The type of training conducted varied considerably among the various organizations, ranging from specific technical training, to computerization, to total quality management systems and process reengineering.  There has been an increasing emphasis on training programs related to international and industry quality standards, especially ISO 9000 and QS 9000.<p>

ITP grants also are awarded to individual companies conducting retraining and/or skill upgrading programs for their employees, often in conjunction with the introduction of new equipment or technologies in the workplace.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 21 companies were awarded ITP grants to assist with their training programs benefiting 551 new employees and 5,535 existing employees.<p>

In summary, the $15 million ITP appropriation was used to fund 58 projects benefiting 1,321 companies and 38,652 trainees at an average cost of $310 per trainee.<p>  


<a name="Labor Management"><hr></a>
<h3>Labor-Management Cooperation Program</h3>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Program promotes positive relations between labor and management and encourages implementation of cooperative labor-management programs at the workplace, industry, regional and state levels.  Numerous studies have found that cooperative work practices have a positive impact on labor relations, productivity and company performance.  Implementation of innovative workplace strategies can contribute significantly to bottom-line profits and improved working conditions.  Based on that concept, increasing such programming in Illinois workplaces would improve labor-management relations and the overall business climate of the state.<p>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee during Fiscal Year 1995 continued efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of local labor-management committees supported by the Labor-Management Grant Program and to utilize available resources to increase the level of cooperative management programming in Illinois.  During the process, the State Committee found strong support from labor and management for the state's role in developing programs to improve Illinois' labor-management climate.  Steps were taken to expand and strengthen Illinois' local labor-management committee network, increase the visibility of the State Committee and raise awareness about the many benefits derived from cooperative workplace programs.  In its 1995 Report to the Governor and Members of the General Assembly, the State Committee detailed a number of program accomplishments and made recommendations to further enhance Illinois' labor-management climate. <p> 

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Labor-Management Grant Program provided grants totaling $287,800 to support 11 local labor-management councils statewide.  Programs provided by the local councils included educational conferences and workshops, special labor-management recognition and awards events, information dissemination services, specialized training to establish and maintain cooperative workplace initiatives, and various activities to improve communication between labor and management in the communities. <p> 

During Fiscal Year 1995, the State Committee initiated a special award program, Labor-Management Partners:  On the Road to High Performance.  The awards, which recognize labor and management for their efforts to work together toward outstanding workplace performance, were presented to Quaker Oats Company's Danville operations and the American Federation of Grain Millers Local 347; Black Hawk College and the American Federation of Teachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers AFL-CIO Local 1836 in Moline; Keystone Steel & Wire Company and the Independent Steel Workers Alliance in Bartonville; and Shapiro Developmental Center and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 29 in Kankakee.  Winners, who were evaluated using criteria for a High Performance Workplace developed by the U.S. Department of Labor Office of the American Workplace, were recognized with plaques during the statewide Labor-Management Conference held in March 1995.<p>


<a name="Technology">
</a><hr>
<h3>Illinois Technology Grant Program</h3>

Access to technology and modern business practices is one of the major foundations supporting economic growth and business competitiveness.  DCCA's Technology Program focuses on efforts to help businesses become more competitive through technology. <p> 
In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued to coordinate Illinois' business modernization efforts with the assistance of a number of Illinois partner organizations.  DCCA utilized a $1.4 million Technology Reinvestment Project grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in addition to funds from the Illinois Technology Challenge Grant Program to support the state's Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) initiative.  The mission of COMPETE, an initiative announced by Gov. Jim Edgar in 1994, is to improve the competitiveness of small and mid-sized Illinois manufacturing firms through a statewide network of Manufacturing Extension Centers (MECs) and other support organizations.<p>

Through local MECs and other partners, the state enables firms to directly receive technology advancement and modernization services that they need to increase their productivity and compete on a national and international level.  The regional MECs are staffed with engineers and professionals with practical experience in the manufacturing workplace.  These specialists work with companies to make confidential recommendations for improvements.  With access to a wide array of industry experts and the resources of universities, community colleges and private consultants, the MEC staffers can help companies implement improvement plans and projects they need to enhance their competitiveness.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the network of MECs provided numerous services to Illinois manufacturers, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> 1,055 initial field visits.<p>
<li> 768 firms enrolled for services.<p>
<li> 192 manufacturing assessments and performance benchmarks.<p>
<li> 93 formal service bids.<p>
<li> 100 engineering and technical consulting projects.<p>
</ul>

In directing the Fiscal Year 1995 Technology Challenge Grant Program, DCCA was assisted by The Illinois Coalition and the Governor's Science Advisory Committee.<p>


<a name="CDAP"><hr></a>
<h3>Community Development Assistance Program</h3>

The federally-funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is designed to help smaller Illinois communities meet their housing, infrastructure and economic development needs.  The program, funded through a block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides grants to local units of government in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA awarded $5.9 million in grants to assist with 14 CDAP economic development projects.  Public facilities projects -- engineering and construction projects associated with improvements to water and sewer systems -- were undertaken in 121 communities with the assistance of $25 million in CDAP grants.  Four emergency public facilities projects were funded with $436,825 in CDAP assistance, and 24 communities shared in $500,000 in CDAP planning grants to help them prepare plans for needed public facilities projects.  Thirty-seven communities were awarded $7 million in CDAP public housing grants to help local homeowners bring their dwellings up to code requirements.  DCCA also provided $4 million in CDAP grants to assist local units of government in removing barriers that limit accessibility to community buildings and services by those with disabilities.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA also received $41.2 million in CDAP Supplemental Flood Program assistance to continue to help local governments recover from the devastating effects of the Great Flood of 1993.  These funds, combined with other federal and state funds, have helped communities to develop flood recovery plans, acquire properties located in the floodplain, elevate homes and repair needed infrastructure.<p>  

The Community Development Assistance Program continues to be a chief source of assistance to ensure that the citizens of smaller Illinois communities have safe public water and sewer systems, quality housing stock and the infrastructure necessary to attract and retain businesses and their jobs.<p>   


<a name="Enterprise Zones"><hr></a>
<h3>Enterprise Zones</h3>

Enterprise Zones are designated areas in communities and regions throughout the state that offer a mix of state and local tax incentives, regulatory relief and enhanced government services that make the areas more attractive to businesses and residents.  Illinois currently has certified 91 Enterprise Zones.  In Fiscal Year 1995, companies located within the zones invested more than $1.5 billion.  The investments are projected to create more than 8,000 jobs.<p>


<a name="Public Infrastructure Programs"><hr></a>
<h3>Business Development Public Infrastructure Program</h3>

The Business Development Public Infrastructure Program provides low-interest loans or grants to local governments to make improvements to public infrastructure on behalf of business expansion or retention projects.  The projects must demonstrate job creation and retention potential.  Funds may be used for a variety of public infrastructure improvements, such as access roads, extending water and sewer lines, and water and sewage treatment facilities.  In Fiscal Year 1995, $1.3 million was provided to three communities to fund infrastructure improvements associated with projects expected to create and retain more than 700 jobs.<p>


<a name="Affordable Financing"><hr></a>
<h3>Affordable Financing of Public Infrastructure Program - Small Project Loan Component</h3>

This program brings together DCCA, the Illinois Rural Bond Bank, the Illinois Development Finance Authority, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to provide financial assistance to or on behalf of local governments, public entities, medical facilities and public health clinics for the purpose of making affordable the financing of infrastructure needed to ensure public health and safety and economic development.  The program's Small Project Loan Component can provide up to $100,000 for a maximum of 10 years at an attractive interest rate.  Funds may be used for acquisition, construction and improvements of public facilities and associated equipment.<p>  


<a name="Local Initiatives"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Local Initiatives</h3>

The Office of Local Initiatives often is the first point of contact for local officials seeking DCCA assistance.  Serving as the outreach arm for DCCA's Bureau of Community Development, the office helps local community leaders find the information, resources and technical assistance they need to find solutions to local problems. <p>

The Office of Local Initiatives administers the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI), a program designed to serve as a catalyst to teach communities to think and act strategically, ultimately resulting in improved competitiveness.  Based on the belief that communities are themselves in the best position to positively affect their own futures, CCI provides a format and the necessary technical assistance to complete the critical first step toward competitiveness -- a community self-assessment of the foundations of growth.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Local Initiatives worked with 19 CCI communities identified as being in the initial stages of development to help them undertake self-assessments and take steps to become more competitive.<p>  

The Office of Local Initiatives also oversees the mandates review process required by the General Assembly.<p>  
 

<a name="Local Govt Management"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Local Government Management Services</h3>

The Office of Local Government Management Services provides assistance to local governments by providing training to local officials on financial issues, responding to questions about the duties of local officials, and providing direct one-on-one technical assistance on matters of particular importance to local government officials.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office conducted or participated in 51 training sessions, meeting the training needs of more than 3,100 elected and appointed local government officials.  The training sessions are designed to address a broad range of financial management issues facing local governments, such as  revenue sources, property taxes, preparing and maintaining a balanced budget, statutory duties of local officials and ways local governments can plan and finance needed improvements to infrastructure.  Training sessions were conducted by DCCA staffers, as well as by DCCA staffers working with partners from the Illinois Municipal League, the Illinois Municipal Clerks Association, the Illinois Municipal Treasurers Institute, the University of Illinois, Governor's State University, Western Illinois University, Eastern Illinois University, Township Officials of Illinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau, and a number of county-based local government organizations.<p>

The Office also responded to more than 1,100 telephone calls from local officials on a variety of issues, and distributed nearly 10,500 publications on topics of interest to local officials, such as revenue sources, budgeting procedures, capital improvement planning and budgeting, computer information, local purchasing, and personnel procedures.  In addition, the Office conducted 82 direct technical assistance projects for local governments to help them enhance their financial stability.  Technical assistance was provided through one-on-one direction to improve accounting systems, budget procedures, revenue projections, preparation of revenue and expenditure reports, and water user rate studies.<p>  


<a name="Housing Office"><hr></a>
<h3>Housing Office</h3>

DCCA's Housing Office administers two programs designed to help low- and moderate-income families live in decent, affordable housing.  The Rental Rehab Program provides funds to eligible units of local government to help rehabilitate privately-owned units for occupation by income-eligible families.  The federally-funded Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program provides incentives to private property owners to upgrade their properties for use by eligible renters.  In Fiscal Year 1995, $282,383 in Rental Rehab funds leveraged with $401,268 in private funds resulted in the rehabilitation of 72 units serving 200 low-income people.  Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation funds provided $1,154,600 in rental assistance to 813 people living in units supported by the funds.<p>

DCCA's Housing Office also administers the federally-funded Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESGP), which assists homeless people to make the transition from poverty to productivity.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the ESGP served more than 50,075 homeless people.<p>  

The Housing Office also works closely with the Governor's Office and the Office of the Lieutenant Governor to administer the annual Governor's Home Town Awards Program.  The program, which promotes volunteerism in Illinois, awards road signs and plaques to communities and organizations that demonstrate outstanding volunteer efforts.  The 14th Annual Governor's Home Town Awards competition drew applications from more than 100 communities.  Awards were given to 65 communities, with Tamms receiving the Governor's Cup as the project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism.  The 1995 awards program also saw special plaques awarded to seven communities for volunteer efforts associated with re-enactments of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, which were televised on C-SPAN.<p>

<h3>Community Services Block Grant Program</h3>

Funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Community Services Block Grant Program (CSBG) is administered in Illinois by DCCA.  Funds are awarded to the state's network of 36 Community Action Agencies (CAAs) to help low-income people achieve self-sufficiency and to provide services designed to address the causes and conditions of poverty.  These services take many forms, from scholarships, to loans to businesses that employ low-income people, to providing emergency assistance to pay for food, shelter and clothing.<p>

The CSBG Loan Program provides long-term, fixed rate financing to new and expanding Illinois businesses.  The loans link federal, state and private financing by combining low-interest CSBG loans with bank funds.  Businesses receiving CSBG loans agree to create jobs for low-income individuals.  In Fiscal Year 1995, CSBG loans made to 57 small businesses resulted in the creation of 252 jobs and generated an additional $12.38 million in leveraged private investment.<p> 

The CSBG Scholarship Program assists low-income high school, vocational school or college students who show academic promise and potential in high technology or growth fields of study.  Preference is also given to low-income and disadvantaged racial or ethnic minorities who plan to enter either a two-year or four-year college, university or vocational school in Illinois.  Created in response to CSBG's mandate that funds be used to help low-income people receive adequate education, the scholarships can support tuition costs; textbooks, supplies and fees; room and board expenses; and transportation and child care.  The CSBG scholarship program is administered by the network of Community Action Agencies, the Illinois Migrant Council and the Illinois Community Action Association.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 417 scholarships totaling $464,355 were awarded.<p>

The CSBG Emergency Community Services Homeless Program is also administered by the Community Action Agencies.  The program funds such services as emergency shelter, counseling, food, clothing, medicine, rent and educational assistance needed by the homeless.  During Fiscal Year 1995, $960,931 in CSBG Emergency Community Services Homeless Program funds were allocated to serve 5,892 clients.<p>

<h3>Energy Assistance and Weatherization Programs</h3>

Economic development is more than business development.  It also means ensuring that all Illinois citizens share in the benefits of a strong economy.  Through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP), DCCA works to make sure that  low-income Illinoisans can live in safe, comfortable, energy-efficient homes.<p>

The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and provides funds to help low-income people pay a portion of their winter energy costs.  Administered throughout the state by a network of Community Action Agencies or community-based organizations, the funds are provided to energy vendors on behalf of households that pay for their energy directly, as well as to households whose energy costs are included in their rent.  Emergency assistance is also available to qualified households to help restore energy services that have been cut off.  In Fiscal Year 1995, LIHEAP served 201,582 Illinois households.<p>  

The Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) helps low-income Illinoisans reduce the costs of energy by helping to fund improvements such as insulation, caulking and weather-stripping, heating system repairs and retrofits.  Administered by DCCA and operated by Community Action Agencies or community-based organizations, IHWAP funds are targeted particularly toward senior citizens and people with disabilities who are often on fixed incomes and cannot afford high fuel costs nor the repairs needed to keep energy bills down.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 6,992 Illinois households were served by IHWAP assistance.<p>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>
<p>

DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism maximizes the state's competitive positioning as a destination for business and leisure travel by shaping public and private initiatives into an integrated marketing program that promotes the state with a unified strategy and a consistent message.  The Bureau's primary goal is to leverage travel revenues for the benefit of the travel industry, state and local government, the state economy and the citizens of Illinois.  The Bureau's marketing also produces secondary benefits in terms of Illinois' general public profile, including its desirability as a business and residential location.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism built on its past successes to take the marketing of Illinois as a tourism destination to new levels.  Strategic alliances with public and private-sector partners leveraged the Bureau's effectiveness in promoting Illinois tourism in both U.S. and international markets.<p>  

Domestic and international tourism revenues in Illinois reached a record $15.9 billion during Calendar Year 1994.  Visitors primarily spent their funds on transportation, lodging, food, entertainment, recreation and incidentals.  Calendar Year 1994 tourism revenues represented a 6.3 percent increase over the previous year, making it the tenth year in a row that Illinois tourism revenue growth has outpaced that of the U.S. as a whole.  During the same period, tourism growth for the United States was only 4.9 percent.  Illinois continued to rank fifth in domestic travel spending among the states.<p>

Growth was even stronger in terms of the number of trips taken to or within Illinois.  A total of 50.5 million domestic leisure trips represented a growth rate of 10 percent over Calendar Year 1993.  More than 1.4 million international visitors spent $1.1 billion.  Just under one million international arrivals originated overseas.  Tourism contributed $995 million in local and state taxes and generated a payroll of $4.8 billion, supporting 241,500 jobs in the state.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau conducted an integrated marketing program designed to identify and reach the state's most likely tourism customers.  The advertising component positioned Illinois as the ideal weekend getaway destination, promoting the new theme, "Illinois:  A Million Miles from Monday."  Advertising and public relations strategies also heavily promoted the Bureau's new toll-free information number, 1-800-2CONNECT.  Innovative use of television and print media built recognition and momentum during the prime summer season and paved the way for a major off-season campaign targeted for FY 1996.  International marketing efforts expanded, primarily targeting Canada and selected European markets.<p>

The Bureau launched a state-of-the-art Illinois Travel Counseling System, which enables consumers for the first time to call a toll-free number and speak with a trained tourism counselor, who answers questions and sends a customized itinerary to the customer via fax, on-line computer services or mail.  The system allows unprecedented flexibility and customization thanks to a multi-million-word database of statewide tourism information that is constantly updated to reflect new and changed attractions, seasonally-related events and other new data.  Monitoring of telephone inquiry statistics enables the Bureau to adapt its marketing to up-to-the-minute consumer demand trends and respond to advertising and public relations strategies.  When the system opened it was only the second such state travel information service in the U.S.  With the system, the Illinois tourism industry -- attractions, lodgings, restaurants, museums, recreational areas, as well as cities, towns, counties and regions -- has a new and powerful means to tell its stories to those consumers who are most likely to travel.<p>

The marketing program was launched by Gov. Jim Edgar at a high-profile news conference on April 21, 1995 in Chicago.  Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene called the new advertising campaign "as insightful as any I've ever seen."  Coverage by major media was pivotal in spreading the word about the advertising and introducing the Travel Counseling System to the traveling public.  The Fiscal Year 1995 marketing program also included special outreach to the African-American and Hispanic communities.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau multiplied its effectiveness by forming working partnerships with public and private tourism entities.  The Bureau provided public relations support to the Lincoln-Douglas debate reenactment series that was sponsored by the cable network C-SPAN and held live in seven Illinois towns.<p>

The Bureau expanded its partnership with the City of Chicago and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority in supporting Illinois Market Place at Navy Pier, a unique, self-supporting shop that sells Illinois products as it promotes statewide tourism.  The Bureau also lent its expertise and personnel to two vitally important tourism meetings, the Illinois White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and the Illinois Governor's Conference on Tourism, as well as preparations for the national White House Conference on Tourism, the first-ever national forum for the tourism industry.<p>

Another Bureau innovation was the Sports Marketing Program.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the Sports Marketing team held seminars for most of the convention and visitors bureaus in Illinois, leading them through the process of creating local and regional sports commissions, evaluating potential sports events sites, bringing in sporting events, and publicizing those events.  The Bureau created a "how-to" kit that is being used by regions, cities and towns to develop their own sports marketing efforts.<p>

The Bureau also targeted prime international markets by working with Hill & Knowlton public relations offices in London, Frankfort and Ontario, and representative firms in the United Kingdom and Germany who work with tourism representatives, the Bureau and Hill & Knowlton.<p>

A Bureau-sponsored series of tourism packaging seminars held across the state for members of the travel industry helped participants learn the secrets of cooperative tourism marketing through such topics as market identification, creative packaging techniques, pricing, packaging for groups and tour operations, value-added programming and development of balanced itineraries.  The seminars led to the development of 97 vacation packages in Illinois and were culminated by publishing of Great Getaways in Illinois, which lists those vacation packages.<p>    

Other Fiscal Year 1995 Bureau publications included a new and expanded Illinois Visitors Guide 1995 and the first year-round edition of the Illinois Calendar of Events.  Illinois Tourism by the Numbers, a summary of tourism's economic impact on the state, was distributed at the Illinois Governor's Conference on Tourism in January 1995, and provided to the media and legislators.  Bureau publications were enhanced with completion of a major photo shoot that generated more than 1,000 new color images of state tourism attractions and locations.  The photo library is made available to the media as a means of encouraging more press coverage for Illinois destinations.<p>  

To enhance its mission of communicating with the state tourism industry, the Bureau created a quarterly report, Illinois Tourism News, with a new design and editorial content that keeps the Bureau's partners in touch with the latest tourism developments.  The newsletter was slated for bi-monthly publication beginning in Fiscal Year 1996.<p>  

The Illinois Bureau of Tourism also continued to administer grant programs designed to help enhance tourism opportunities around the state.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau coordinated and awarded 151 Tourism Matching Grants totaling $1,450,000.  These grants pay a portion of the costs of promotional materials designed to attract tourists to various sites and events.  The Bureau also awarded 31 Tourism Attraction Development Grants totaling $1,063,443 to help renovate and develop tourist attractions; and eight Tourism Private Sector Grants totaling $1,840,000 which were matched by private sector contributions to help attract world-class tourism opportunities to Illinois.  In addition, the Bureau awarded $8 million to 35 local tourism and convention bureaus to help them coordinate tourism efforts in their areas.<p>

The Illinois Film Office, a part of the Illinois Bureau of Tourism, provides technical assistance to film, television and commercial production companies to help them scout locations and find production and support services in Illinois.  The Office also acts as a liaison for businesses, communities, government and labor.  In Fiscal Year 1995, it was estimated that a portion or all of 26 productions generated $21 million in direct cash revenues to the state.  Based on a state General Revenue Fund budget of $475,000, Illinois realized a $45 return on each dollar allocated to the Illinois Film Office.<p>

DCCA's Bureau of Administration is responsible for the agency's fiscal and
operational functions.  The Division of Fiscal Management includes the
Accounting Office, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office and the
Budget Office.  The Division of Agency Services includes the Office of
Human Resources, the Office of Management Operations and the Office of
Information Resource Management (OIRM).  The Deputy Director of
Administration is also responsible for the activities of the Financial
Commitment Committee, maintaining its master files, meeting minutes and
other paperwork.<p>

<h3>Division of Fiscal Management</h3>

The Division of Fiscal Management is responsible for DCCA's financial and
budgetary operations.  The Division's three offices include the Budget
Office, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office, and the Accounting
Office.  These offices provide vital links in serving the needs of DCCA's
bureaus and programs.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office
developed and implemented a pilot program at DCCA that is designed to save
the state thousands of dollars in interest liabilities each year while
reducing paperwork and speeding payments to those receiving state
assistance.  The program, developed by DCCA staffers in partnership with
staffers from the Office of the Comptroller, enables DCCA to send grant
vouchers electronically to the Comptroller's Office and have the payments
electronically deposited directly into grantees' bank accounts.<p>

This action was spurred by the federal Cash Management Improvement Act
(CMIA) that requires states to minimize federal cash on deposit.  Under
CMIA guidelines, the state must pay interest from the moment the federal
funds reach it until the check is cashed and actually clears the treasury.
By reducing the time these funds are kept on deposit, the state's CMIA
liability is reduced.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA realized related savings
of $15,340 by using the pilot electronic vouchering program for grants
subject to CMIA.  DCCA estimates a related savings of more than $150,000 in
Fiscal Year 1996.<p>

Another plus for the new electronic deposit process is an improvement in
the timeframe for processing cash payments.  It enables grantees to receive
funds in about one week as opposed to the three weeks averaged under the
prior manual system.  The success of the pilot program has led DCCA to
expand the process to all programs administered by the Department.  DCCA
staffers also are providing assistance to other state agencies interested
in adopting the process.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Budget Office was successful in its efforts to
help obtain increased levels of funding for the agency's Tourism,
International Business, Weatherization and Industrial Services programs for
Fiscal Year 1996.  The Budget Office also played a key role in preparing
for the July 1, 1995 transfer to DCCA of the duties and responsibilities of
the Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Offices of Energy
Conservation and Alternative Energy, and Coal Marketing and Development,
brought about through Executive Order Number Two.  Through the legislative
appropriation process, the Office of Recycling and Waste Management also
transferred from ENR to DCCA.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, electronic cost reporting and payment request
submissions became reality for DCCA subgrant administrators participating
in the pilot Grant Reporting System program.  The efforts were coordinated
by DCCA's Accounting Office.  The test was successfully completed and
support equipment was installed to enable dial-in communications via local
personal computers.  DCCA expects to begin expanding the system to other
subgrantee sites and to extend utilization to additional DCCA programs late
in Fiscal Year 1996.<p>


<a name="Agency Services"><hr></a>
<h3>Division of Agency Services</h3>

<a name="Human Resources"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Human Resources</h4>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Human Resources processed more than
650 transactions for agency employees.  Office staff reviewed more than 165
files to ensure compliance with the Rutan decision in agency hiring
practices.  The files were found to be in good order when pre-audited by
staff from the Illinois Department of Central Management Services.  The
Office also was involved in ensuring a smooth transition for staffers of
the former Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources who became
DCCA employees as a result of the agency consolidation ordered by Gov.
Edgar.<p>

Ongoing services provided by the Office of Human Resources during Fiscal
Year 1995 included announcements of training available to employees,
assistance with insurance and payroll concerns, and services provided to
citizens of Illinois and surrounding states regarding employment
opportunities with the State of Illinois.<p>

<a name="Management Operations"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Management Operations</h4>

The Office of Management Operations provides support to DCCA, including
facility management, printing and graphic services, publication management
and distribution, the Illinois Business Hotline, property control,
purchasing and mail/messenger services.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, Management Operations facilitated the upgrading of
several agency motor pool vehicles, thus ensuring access to safe,
reasonably-priced transportation for DCCA personnel operating in the field.
The Office processed 3,197 purchase requisitions for DCCA's goods and
negotiated and maintained more than 50 service and maintenance agreements.
Mail and messenger services processed in excess of 400,000 pieces of mail
and completed more than 2,821 special deliveries in and around Springfield.<p>

Management Operations also upgraded its in-house printing plant.  The new
equipment will enable the printshop to meet the growing demand for
professionally prepared brochures and publications that support the
agency's programs and projects.  The Graphics Unit processed more than 435
work orders including complete in-house development and production of
program reports and the agency's Annual Report.  The in-house printing
plant produced nearly nine million impressions in response to 663 work
orders.  The unit also prepared more than 11 customized presentation
booklets for use in response to inquiries from various businesses and
industries.<p>

The Information and Distribution Center handled more than 180 work orders
involving more than 340,000 pieces of material for distribution.  Although
approximately 90,000 pieces were handled by in-house staff, handling
250,000 pieces as bulk mail through a contract mail house saved thousands
of dollars in postage.  The Information and Distribution Center provided
more than 10,000 labels and listings to partners from outside the agency,
responded to more than 15,000 school children from around the world who
requested information on Illinois, and prepared and mailed more than 3,600
general tourism packets in response to written requests.<p>

The warehouse rebuilt shelving and restructured record storage allowing for
more effective utilization of space.<p>

<a name="Information Resource Management"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Information Resource Management</h4>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA entered the world of E-mail and automation via
the Local Area Network (LAN) arena.  Implementation of the LAN-based
environment began early in Fiscal 1994 and, by the conclusion of Fiscal
Year 1995, approximately half of DCCA's staff were part of the new
environment.<p>

DCCA's shift during Fiscal Year 1995 into technological high gear has led
to consideration of the productivity gains possible from utilizing office
suite packages, the Internet, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS),
enhanced communications and information exchange, geographical presentation
of information and to transient computing and communications.<p>

During the fiscal year, OIRM completed projects providing computer support
for Fiscal Management systems, provided the general computer support for
the CMS host mainframe system, including IHWAP and LIHEAP energy systems,
and was involved in the planning of JTPA system changes.<p>

OIRM continues to focus on:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> providing an improved level of responsiveness and technical support for
the DCCA LAN and CMS host-based environments.<p>
<li> providing timely development and maintenance of the computer systems and
applications.<p>
<li> providing recommendations for future products, projects and directions for
DCCA.<p>
</ul>


The solid foundation has now been built that should allow for continued
technological growth, with plans underway to complete the LAN
implementation and move forward to LAN-based applications and systems.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Policy Development, Planning & Research</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>
<p>

DCCA's Division of Policy Development, Planning and Research (PDPR) operates within the Director's Office to identify issues, barriers and opportunities facing the state's economic development efforts; analyze the various alternatives available to address these issues; and assess the results of DCCA's programs and activities.  These services help agency staffers to make informed decisions and assess the future implications of agency decisions, policies and strategies.<p>

Among PDPR's functions:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Research, which helps develop and maintain DCCA's information base and conducts various analyses to apply this information to issues faced by DCCA and the state.<p>
<li> Policy Analysis, analyzing programs and policies that impact Illinois economic development.<p>
<li> Planning and Assessment, providing an integrated system of agency management, including implementation of goals, program objectives, operational strategies and evaluation of progress.<p>
<li> Program Development, identifying possible strategies and courses of action to best pursue an opportunity or overcome a barrier.<p>
</ul>

During Fiscal Year 1995, PDPR staff continued many of the efforts begun in Fiscal Year 1994, including flood relief, community development and technology development.  PDPR maintained DCCA's presence in the state's ongoing efforts to help communities and citizens recover from the devastation of the Great Flood of 1993.  PDPR prepared a publication, Proposal Writing:  The Basic Steps in Planning and Writing a Successful Grant Application, and distributed more than 3,000 copies to DCCA constituents.  Staffers also helped prepare an application to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for a grant to augment the state's Labor-Management program, and developed and distributed the Request for Proposals for Fiscal Year 1995 and Fiscal Year 1996 funding for the Technology Challenge Grant Program.  PDPR conducted best-of-practice analyses on department budget initiative topics, including multi-company networks, local government training, place marketing, brownfields, and tax credit incentives.  PDPR also promulgated rulemakings in nine program areas which were formally adopted through the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules process.<p>

PDPR completed development of the Illinois Industry Analysis System and began preliminary testing of the system.  This system is designed to allow economic development officials to answer commonly asked questions about their most important industries, their largest employers, the types of businesses moving into their regions, the name of the CEO of a local company, etc.  The system also is organized to improve targeting of specific firms for business retention or attraction.  It is based upon Dun & Bradstreet's profile of establishments with a minimum of 10 employees that ever operated within Illinois between 1987 and the present.  Target release of the system is planned for calendar year 1996.<p>

PDPR also provided support to many boards and task forces, serving as DCCA's primary representatives to The Illinois Coalition, a public/private partnership pursuing a coherent, coordinated strategy of economic development through technology; the Illinois Coalition Technology and Jobs Agenda, a blue-ribbon committee charged with laying out a strategic plan to position the state's economy to grow through use of technology; and an interagency task force that wrote administrative rules to implement the Interagency Wetland Policy Act and administers the development of an Illinois Wetlands Comprehensive Strategy.<p>
 
PDPR in Fiscal Year 1995 began work to develop benchmarks to compare Illinois' economic development with other states' efforts.  This was a recommendation of the Illinois Economic Development Board, chaired by Samuel K. Skinner.  In January 1995, Skinner and his 21-member board completed their year-long study of the state's climate for job creation and retention, presenting their report to Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra.  The report made 17 recommendations to help the state refine policies and programs to help businesses grow and prosper, thus providing jobs and improving overall quality of life.<p>

PDPR continued to provide valuable economic information and statistics through the quarterly Illinois Economic Summary and the monthly Illinois Economic Bulletin.  The publications were also made available on-line through the Access Illinois bulletin board system.<p>

<h3>Coal Research</h3>

Illinois administers the largest state-sponsored coal research program in the United States.  The Coal Research Program, administered by OCDM, and under the technical oversight of the Illinois Clean Coal Institute, is considered to be in the forefront of state coal research programs, nationally and internationally.  In Fiscal Year 1995, OCDM awarded $2,762,947 in state funds and $1,000,000 in federal funds for the completion of 44 coal research projects.<p>

Building on recent research findings, Gov. Jim Edgar signed Senate Bill 327 (Public Act 89-93) into law allowing the beneficial use of coal combustion by-products.  As more clean coal technologies become operational, more potentially useful by-products are generated.  This Act builds on state efforts to remove unnecessary barriers to the use of Illinois coal by providing numerous alternatives for by-product utilization.<p>


<a name="Coal Development"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Development</h3>

The Coal Development Program provides funds to advance promising new coal research technologies through the proof-of-concept stage to the commercial demonstration stage.  Development processes include technology maturation, technology transfer and related studies.  Priorities for the Development Program are established by tracking key market issues and projecting how technology can take advantage of these issues to increase new markets for Illinois coal.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, OCDM awarded $864,655 in state funds for the completion of four development projects.  One project examined the technical and economic feasibility of wheeling electricity from Illinois to neighboring states.  Another provided for a test burn of Illinois coal in an pressurized fluidized bed boiler pilot plant in Finland, paving the way for future demonstration of this technology in Illinois.<p>  


<a name="Coal Demonstration"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Demonstration</h3>

The State of Illinois has committed nearly $139 million from the Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund for 18 projects over the past 13 years.  To date, this program has attracted $191 million in additional funds from the U.S. Department of Energy and $462 million in public and private investments.  Each of these projects provides near- and long-term benefits to the State of Illinois that include economic growth, cleaner air and energy conservation.<p>

One such significant clean coal technology project is the City of Rochelle micronized coal project.  Coal is micronized by pulverizing it to the consistency of talcum powder.  Micronized coal burned with micronized limestone at Rochelle effectively reduced sulfur emissions by 50 percent and NOx by 40 percent.  The $18 million clean coal technology project was partially funded by a $3.6 million grant from OCDM.<p>

Although coal micronization technology has been used on a smaller scale in the past, the Rochelle demonstration marks its first application as a fuel source for electrical generation by a utility.  Selection of this technology by the U.S. Department of Energy as an outreach project for the Krakow, Poland Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program advances this technology into the next step of commercialization and paves the way for Illinois to participate in an expanding export market for coal and clean coal technologies.<p>


<a name="Coal Awareness & Education"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Awareness and Education</h3>

Coal education continued to be a priority for OCDM in Fiscal Year 1995 with the development of an educational activity book, Coal is Cool, for kindergarten through fourth-grade students.  This book and Illinois Coal, the newly-revised guide for teachers in fifth through eighth grades, are now available to educators throughout the state and nation.<p>

OCDM held the annual Energy and the Environment "Words and Pictures About Illinois Coal" art and essay calendar contest to raise coal awareness in schools and homes.  More than 650 fifth- and sixth-grade students throughout the state participated.  Winning pictures and essays were included in 7,000 calendars and posters distributed throughout the state.<p>

As a part of state coal education efforts, Gov. Edgar proclaimed the month of October as "Coal Awareness Month."  Throughout October, OCDM sponsored coal awareness activities that included day-long educational events in Springfield and DuQuoin, distribution of tray liners with coal facts and word puzzles at Wendy's restaurants in central Illinois, and numerous radio and television interviews on the importance of the coal industry to the Illinois economy.<p>

In its everyday activities throughout the year, OCDM responded to numerous requests for information on the Illinois coal industry, coal consumption and uses, and a wide range of miscellaneous energy topics.  To aid in these requests, OCDM maintains databases on the characteristics of Illinois coal, coal production and consumption, industry contacts and many other aspects of the coal industry.<p>


<a name="Coal Development Board"><hr></a>
<h3>Illinois Coal Development Board</h3>

OCDM worked to fulfill many of the legislative mandates of the Illinois Coal Development Board during Fiscal Year 1995.  The Board, appointed by the Governor, reviewed and approved all coal research, development and demonstration projects, and provided oversight of the Coal Technology Development Assistance Fund and Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund.<p>

OCDM prepared and distributed the Illinois Coal Development Board's annual report, Outlook for the Illinois Coal Industry.  Delivered to Gov. Edgar, members of the General Assembly and interested citizens, the report identified strategies to preserve existing markets, develop new markets and uses for high-sulfur coal and to minimize the adverse impact of national environmental policies on the Illinois coal industry and its workers.<p>

<h3>OFFICE OF RECYCLING AND WASTE REDUCTION</h3>


<a name="Materials Recycling"><br></a>
<h4>Materials Recycling Unit</h4>

The goal of the Materials Recycling Unit is to increase the quantity of materials recycled in Illinois and to establish self-sufficiency in the recycling industry.  Since its inception in 1987, the Materials Recycling Unit and Recycling Grants Program have awarded more than $12 million in recycling collection and processing grants to more than 300 applicants.  These grants have leveraged well over $50 million in matching investments.<p>

More than $1 million in state funds were awarded to 22 grant applicants in Fiscal Year 1995.  Funded projects included:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $100,000 grant to help Laidlaw Waste Systems in Rockford develop a modern primary processing recycling facility to service more than 400,000 citizens.  Grant funds are being used to purchase a high-technology baler.  This facility will incorporate state-of-the-art technology, including co-mingled sort lines and a pneumatic baler feed stream to convey sorted plastics and metals to densification equipment.  Five different material streams will be processed at the facility.<p>
<li> A $50,000 grant to the U.S. Postal Service to implement a commercial collection recycling project in its Northern Illinois district.  This project will collect materials from approximately 200 U.S. Post Offices in Northern Illinois.  It is projected that 56 tons will be diverted from landfills each day.<p>
<li> A $44,000 grant to the City of Mattoon to implement a city-wide drop-off project.  Funds were used for the purchase of compartmentalized collection containers and educational materials.  The project features three controlled drop-off sites for the citizens of Mattoon and the surrounding areas.  The City contributed more than $86,000 in matching funds.<p>
</ul>


<a name="Market Development"><br></a>
<h4>Market Development</h4>

The Recycling Market Development Program encourages private-sector investment in the development, manufacture and marketing of products containing recycled materials.  Through this program, more than $1 million in grants and loans were awarded during Fiscal Year 1995, matched by more than $4.5 million in private investment.<p>

Projects funded in Fiscal Year 1995 included:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $90,000 grant to the J. M. Hoffman Company of Joliet.  The grant will help purchase specialized equipment to be used to re-mill salvageable lumber from industrial and commercial buildings being demolished.  The company remanufactures the lumber into high quality decorative paneling and flooring for residential and commercial construction.<p>
<li> Five new projects totaling $130,365 were funded under a legislatively-mandated market development program promoting the use of recycled materials by businesses located in economically depressed areas.  Future Generations in Taylor Springs, Molten Glass in Chicago, Laser Smart in Mt. Carmel, Innovative Components in Arlington Heights, and The Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind were the companies that received grants in Fiscal Year 1995.<p>
<li> The Container Recycling Alliance in Chicago received a $150,000 grant to assist with the purchase of specialized sorting equipment that will be able to optically separate container glass by color.  This new technology, believed to be the first of its type to be used in Illinois, will help eliminate the problem of mixed color broken glass.  The color-sorted glass will be easier to use in the remanufacture of glass containers.<p>
</ul>


<a name="ICAP"><br></a>
<h4>Illinois College Assistance Program (ICAP)</h4>

This program provides Illinois public colleges with technical and financial assistance to support waste education and recycling activities. <p> 

In Fiscal Year 1995, ICAP provided $104,000 to various colleges for planning and implementation grants.  Approximately $1.45 million has been earmarked for grants to these institutions to implement waste reduction plans during Fiscal Year 1996 and Fiscal Year 1997.<p>


<a name="Used Tire Recovery"><br></a>
<h4>Used Tire Recovery</h4>

The Used Tire Recovery Program provides financial assistance to units of government and private industry to identify innovative and cost-effective alternatives to stockpiling and/or landfilling scrap tires.  Grants and loans totaling more than $2.2 million were awarded in Fiscal Year 1995 to projects reusing, processing and recycling discarded tires into new products, such as retreaded and remanufactured tires, tire chip playground material, rubber-modified asphalt and tire-derived fuel.  These funds leveraged an additional $2.39 million for project costs.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the program:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> Awarded a $457,380 grant to Illinois Power Company to assist in the purchase and installation of tire-derived fuel handling and metering equipment, as well as slag cleaning equipment.  Waste Recovery - Illinois will be providing Illinois Power with 60,000 tons of tire-derived fuel per year, or the equivalent of 7.5 million passenger tire equivalents.  Waste Recovery - Illinois received a $500,000 grant from the Used Tire Recovery Program in Fiscal Year 1994 for tire-derived fuel processing equipment.<p>
<li> Provided a $500,000 grant to Pace-Mat, Inc. of Genoa to assist in the purchase and installation of crumb rubber processing equipment and recycled tire-derived rubber mat production equipment.  Products that will eventually be produced include anti-fatigue mats, gymnasium mats, anti-corrosive liners, highway culvert liners, animal mats, floor protection mats, and noise reduction flooring.  At full production, an estimated 665,000 passenger tire equivalents will be used annually.<p>
<li> Awarded a $210,000 grant to Achievor Tire, L.P. of Chicago to expand the existing manufacturer of used tires.  Remanufacturing differs from normal retreading in that new rubber is placed not only on the tread portion, but the shoulder and sidewall as well.  The tire casing is then put in a mold similar to how a new tire is produced.  The funds provided assisted in the purchase of new molds and sidewall plates for tire sizes that Achievor could not produce.  With the tire industry constantly producing new tire sizes and creating a demand for replacement tires, Achievor must buy new molds to remain competitive.  Achievor Tire has predicted that as many as 500,000 remanufactured tires could be produced over a five-year period by the equipment that was purchased with this grant.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Solid Waste Management"><br></a>
<h4>Solid Waste Management Research</h4>

The Solid Waste Management Research Program provides the foundation for future developments and improvements in solid waste management.  Funded research projects not only extend to the basic scientific, engineering, economic and sociological information available to planners, but also provide training and education for today's graduate students who will become tomorrow's solid waste experts.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the University of Illinois Institute for Environmental Studies received a $400,000 grant to continue its competitive solid waste research grants.  This program offers two grant rounds annually.  Research programs may span the entire spectrum of solid waste management from reducing the environmental impact of landfilling and incineration, to expanding the uses of recycled materials, to understanding the public response to waste reduction education.<p>

The research program also provides funding for the Illinois State Geological Survey's (ISGS) landfill siting assistance program.  The Fiscal Year 1995 grant of $188,897 will allow ISGS to use its experts in Illinois Geology and computer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist counties in locating geologically-capable sites for landfills.<p>

The Solid Waste Management Research Program provided a $127,342 grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health to publish a technical newsletter intended to transfer information and research results to the government and industry planners who can put it to use.  An in-depth report on the conflicts and compatibilities of recycling and incineration is currently in preparation.<p>  

<a name="Tech Demonstration"><br></a>
<h4>Technology Demonstration</h4>

The Technology and Practices Demonstration Program supports the development and application of technologies and practices that minimize the land disposal of solid waste.  During Fiscal Year 1995, approximately $735,000 was awarded, which was matched by more than $1.1 million in private investment.<p>

Among projects awarded were:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $150,000 grant to Eaglebrook Products, Inc. for the purchase of a twin extruder system to determine effective methods of compounding mixtures of high-melt, post-consumer, non-bottle plastic packaging waste with softwood fibers.  The intended end-market uses for the composite products include, but are not limited to, door and window substrata, millwork, agricultural and playground equipment, transportation equipment, and industrial flooring.<p>
<li> A $149,991 grant to Brookfield Zoo for the demonstration of an enclosed, aerated static pile composting system to control odor in the composting of animal wastes and bedding.<p>
<li> A $99,000 grant to the City of Streator for testing of "glasphalt" as an alternative aggregate for use as a durable road material.<p>
</ul>

<a name="School Education"><br></a>
<h4>School Education Program</h4>

The School Education Program provides financial and technical assistance to Illinois schools to implement recycling and waste reduction activities in the schools.<p>

The 1995-96 School Grant program awarded more than $220,000 to 20 projects involving 531 Illinois schools with approximately 250,000 students.  The grant money is used to purchase collection containers, implement source reduction activities, provide teachers and classroom training, and for trips and assemblies for the students to learn about the "3Rs" -- Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.  Vermi composting for classrooms at the elementary level was the most popular source reduction activity during the year.  Nearly 200 composting bins were purchased with funds from the grant, and several schools received grants to purchase reusable cafeteria dishes and serviceware, as well as slates for individual use, thus reducing waste at their schools.  In addition, grantees will spend a minimum of $22,000 toward the purchase of products with recycled content.<p>

The School Education Program also develops educational materials for teachers to help them address the 3Rs, provides teacher training on the 3Rs at various locations around the state, and publishes a quarterly newsletter.<p>

A program offered to all public and private Illinois schools is the Earth Flag program.  To earn an Earth Flag, schools must:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> Recycle white paper.<br>
<li> Provide teacher training on the 3Rs.<br>
<li> Implement one schoolwide source reduction activity.<br>
<li> Implement at least one schoolwide reuse activity.<br>
<li> Instruct at least one grade level or science class or ecology club on the 3Rs.<br>
</ul>

More than 350 schools have registered to receive an Earth Flag.<p>

<h3>OFFICE OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY</h3>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy continued to promote the efficient and economic use of Illinois' energy resources.  The Office tests and demonstrates energy technologies, identifies innovative means of financing energy efficiency improvements, and uses a variety of educational programs to transfer these cost effective technologies and information to both the private and public sectors of the Illinois economy.<p>


<h4><a name="Affordable Housing">Affordable Housing Programs</a></h4>

The Office has conducted a number of programs designed to demonstrate the vital role of energy efficiency in the design, construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing units.  During Fiscal Year 1995, in cooperation with not-for-profit developers, the Office provided grants and technical assistance for the energy efficient rehab of 53 multi-unit structures with more than 1,000 dwelling units.  The grants upgraded this low-and moderate-income housing to ensure that it is truly affordable by producing savings averaging 60 percent and lowering annual utility bills to under $200. <p>

The Office also demonstrated energy efficient building technologies in newly constructed homes.  More than 200 new homes were designed and constructed in cooperation with the City of Chicago under the "New Homes for Chicago Program."  These homes were developed and marketed to moderate income families in the city.  The energy efficiency improvements dramatically lowered annual utility costs, which greatly enhances the affordability of the homes.<p>

In cooperation with the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Office provided grants and technical assistance to homeless shelter providers.  Grants of up to $20,000 per shelter were given to enable shelter providers to reduce their utility costs by up to 40 percent and utilize the savings for supplementing budgets to provide actual services to the homeless.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office also disseminated information and efficiency technology demonstrated by the Affordable Housing projects to the homebuilding industry and other housing providers through seminars, conferences and housing-related workshops.  For example, a major homebuilding conference was held in the Greater Chicago area in February 1995, and the Office will sponsor the nation's largest weatherization conference, the "Affordable Housing Conference," in March 1996.<p>


<h4><a name="Ethanol Programs">Ethanol Programs</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy worked with Illinois agricultural organizations during Fiscal Year 1995 to actively promote and expand the use of ethanol as a clean burning, renewable transportation fuel.  Illinois leads the nation in the annual production of ethanol, and ranks first or second in the production of corn each year.<p>

The Office manages numerous ethanol test and demonstration projects designed to encourage economic growth in industrial manufacturing and rural communities.  The agency also sponsors the research and development of new and innovative technologies to help reduce ethanol production costs.  A few milestones during Fiscal Year 1995:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> The state continued to promote E-85 flexible-fuel vehicles by purchasing 71 1995 Ford Taurus sedans for use in the state fleet.  These vehicles were manufactured at Ford's south Chicago assembly plant.  Illinois operates the largest E-85 fleet in the nation.<p>
<li>  The number of state E-85 refueling facilities in Illinois was expanded and plans were completed for the first public E-85 refueling facility at Dwight.<p>
<li> Plans were announced for the state to begin testing three of the first flexible fuel E-85 Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks for General Motors Corporation.  GM has announced that, beginning in 1997, all Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma trucks equipped with the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine will be flexible fuel vehicles optimized for ethanol fuel.<p>
<li> Office staff laid plans for the organization and sponsorship of the Ethanol Exposition at the 1995 Illinois State Fair.<p>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Assist to Agriculture">Assistance to Agriculture</a></h4>

Through the Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy, direct energy conservation, energy management, environment and renewable resource information was provided to more than 17,000 Illinois farmers and agricultural professionals through a series of 140 conferences, seminars and meetings.
Staffers worked closely with the Illinois Cooperative Extension Service and more than 30 Illinois farm organizations and groups to provide Illinois farmers with sound environmental practices and proven, practical methods of reducing energy costs on the farm.<p>

The Office also provides incentives to farmers to conduct on-farm sustainable agriculture research to demonstrate methods to maintain farm profits while reducing the environmental impact of conventional farming practices.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Wise Homes">Energy Wise Homes of Illinois</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy promotes a residential energy rating system called "Energy Wise Homes of Illinois."  The ratings help builders and homeowners understand the overall energy costs associated with a home.  Letting people know where their energy dollars are being spent helps them make financial decisions concerning energy products during new construction or in retrofitting their homes.  The rating is an essential tool when applying for energy efficient mortgages.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Performance">Energy Performance Contracting</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy promotes energy performance contracting for larger institutional or industrial energy users.  Performance contracting is an innovative arrangement for financing and installing energy improvement projects where the savings generated are guaranteed to amortize the project over the life of the agreement.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, the office staff initiated a $20 million investment in energy efficiency capital improvements in state facilities.  Gov. Edgar's Energy Efficiency Pilot Initiative demonstrated the cost effectiveness of utilizing energy performance contracts in state buildings.  The pilot program utilized private certificates of participation to finance the projects, which will produce energy savings of more than $21 million annually in seven state agency and university facilities.<p>  

In addition, staffers continued to provide technical assistance and information transfer to other units of federal, state and local government, as well as school districts which are interested in exploring energy performance contracting arrangements.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Efficiency">Energy Efficiency in State Buildings</a></h4>

Operators of state facilities were provided energy engineering assistance and ongoing energy efficiency training during Fiscal Year 1995.  These efforts resulted in documented savings of $6 million in operation and maintenance costs at 38 participating facilities.<p>  

Development of databases involving refrigerants and electronically transferred utility information continued.  This information will aid facilities in tracking their energy use.<p>


<h4><a name="ICP">Institutional Conservation Program (ICP)</a></h4>

ICP is a grant program for schools and hospitals to help them reduce energy consumption.  The program has completed 17 grant cycles totaling $56.4 million, and provides two types of energy grants:  Technical Assistance Grants and Energy Conservation Measures Grants.  Technical Assistance grants are available to institutions to hire Illinois registered architects or engineers to complete a detailed energy study.  Energy Conservation Measures grants provide funds for the actual retrofits.  Both types of grants require matching funds.<p>


<h4><a name="Telecommuting">Telecommuting and Transportation Programs</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy actively worked with Chicago area agencies during Fiscal Year 1995 to reduce motor fuel consumption and air emissions through distribution of an office-produced video on vanpooling, as well as technical assistance provided to the Chicago Area Transportation Study.  Office staffers actively worked to organize and provide leadership to the Metro Chicago Telecommuting Advisory Council, an organization of telecommuters, employers, vendors and other agencies that see telecommuting as a strategy for air quality improvement, as well as motor fuel conservation.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Emergency Preparedness">Energy Emergency Preparedness</a></h4>

The Office provides direct energy emergency preparedness support to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) during emergency and disaster situations.  Provided under the requirements of the Illinois Emergency Operations Plan, the Office coordinates information and communications regarding the availability and distribution of energy resources within Illinois and throughout the region.  This support is guided by national program objectives established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Energy.<p>


<h4><a name="ILEED">Illinois Energy Education Development (ILEED)</a></h4>

ILEED is an effective energy and environmental education program for students in kindergarten through grade 12 that incorporates all disciplines and learning styles and promotes leadership and organizational skills.  More than 2,500 members are active in student-developed energy and environmental projects that benefit students, their schools and communities.<p>

Student and teacher representatives from more than 40 Illinois junior high and high schools participate in EnergyNet.  EnergyNet provides a real life context for teaching math, science, business and telecommunications skills.  Students and teachers are provided in-depth, hands-on energy management training, as well as up-to-date information on telecommunications.  These skills are used to train other students to work in programs that save their schools energy and money.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Office and Ameritech's EnergyNet program provided a computer networking system for all participating schools.  Students shared energy auditing data through the EnergyNet system.<p>


<h4><a name="PIE">Partners in Environmental Education (PIE)</a></h4>

The Illinois Chamber of Commerce and the Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy have established a partnership between businesses and schools to promote environmental education.  Partners in Environmental Education (PIE) links schools with companies and businesses that offer equipment, internships, training, instructional materials, facility tours or expertise in natural resource conservation and environmental protection.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, PIE provided: <p>
<ul type=square>
<li> Outdoor classrooms on Illinois Power property where students learned to create prairies and protect wetlands.<p>
<li> Funding for biodegradable plastic bags by Abbott Labs to be used in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Conservation's "Kids for Conservation" program.<p>
<li> Preparation of a solid waste curriculum supported by Kraft General Foods Environmental Institute.<p>
</ul>

<strong>
* Programs of the Bureau of Energy and Recycling were under the direction of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources during Fiscal Year 1995.  The programs became a part of DCCA in Fiscal Year 1996.

                          <p align=center>      By Bob Blaszczak<br>
                              CTC CO-Chair, OAQPS</p>

  Yes, the CTC is still around.  A little leaner and not necessarily firing
on all cylinders, but still functional.  I ve lost track of which continuing resolution (CR) we re being funded under - I think it s number 5 or 6.  What ever the case, we are pleased to be here and proud to serve.  This year s Federal budget process has certainly kept us focussed on the here and now. CRs that last one to six weeks tend to do that to you.  Program planning, even within the current fiscal year, has become an abstract concept. <P>

  TO PRINT OR NOT TO PRINT?  That s really not a question, because we really don t have a choice.  I hope you are enjoying this electronic version of the CTC NEWS. If not, I hope it will grow on you.  Printing of newsletters is out during the CRs, and maybe forever, depending on what the final budget numbers look like.  So, check the CTCHOME PAGE on the World-Wide Web or the CTC BBS on the Technology Transfer Network periodically for the latest copy of the NEWS.  New editions are scheduled quarterly (January, April, July and October).<P>

  PROJECT IDEAS?  The CTC still offers technical and engineering assistance
projects (i.e., projects requested by staff at state and local agencies and
funded, all or in part, by the CTC).  Times are lean but some funding may
still be available for critical projects.  Don t procrastinate!  Don t let
the budget situation stop you from thinking ahead.  Be an optimist!  Get
your request in now!!!  If more money becomes available, the CTC will have
to put funds on appropriate contracts in June 1996!<P>

  WHAT S IN A NAME?  Well, we think our name should reflect what we do and
the organizations that support us.  Our name, CTC, may be changing to the
CP2TC - Control and Pollution Prevention Technology Center.  The CTC has
traditionally looked at both add-on controls and pollution prevention
measures in assisting you, and it s time that the CTC got full recognition
for what it does. Also, one of the CTC s prime sponsors has reorganized.
The Air and Energy Engineering Research Laboratory,   Office of Research and Development (ORD) is now the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD) of the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, ORD.  This change significantly strengthens and expands the CTC s ability to provide pollution prevention assistance.  So what do you think of CP2TC?  It s not chiseled in granite yet, but could be soon. If you have a better option, please let us know by BBS message, FAX or E-MAIL (see page 7).<P>

  HAVE YOU TRIED THE CTC HOME PAGE?  The CTC now has a HOME PAGE on the
World-Wide Web.  You can access the CTC from the OAQPS HOME PAGE.  Our
address is <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/ctc.html">http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/ctc.html</a>.  This initial CTC HOME
PAGE is kind of basic.  We will upgrade this page in July, shortly after
TTN-2000 becomes operational. TTN-2000 will give the Technology Transfer
Network (TTN) a fully operational World-Wide Web site.  As a result, all
of the CTC BBS functions now available on the TTN BBS will be available
on the World-Wide Web through TTN-2000. Check out the July edition of the
CTC NEWS for an update on CTC HOME PAGE improvements and TTN- 2000.<P>

  You can also access the Centro de Informacin sobre Contaminacin de Aire
(CICA) HOME PAGE from the CTC s HOME PAGE.  CICA is the CTC sponsored
program to help resolve air pollution problems along the U.S.-Mexico border. <P>

The direct address for CICA is <a href="http//www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/cica.html">http//www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/cica.html</a>.<P>

  Enjoy the NEWS! <P>

                                ISEG/AQSSD/OAQPS<P>

  Anyone familiar with the OAQPS Control Cost Manual (Manual) knows that
air pollution control costs depend upon a variety of emission stream, control device, and financial parameters.  Often this dependency is quite complex.1  For that reason, it is cumbersome and time-consuming if not downright painful to make these sizing and costing calculations by hand, especially if costs are needed for a range of input parameters (e.g., waste gas flowrate). <P>

  To enable the thousands of Manual users to make these calculations more
efficiently, we developed 20 spreadsheet programs, collectively named "CO$T-AIR," to cover twelve control devices and one category of auxiliary equipment (ductwork).  Because the spreadsheets allow for the escalation of equipment costs, they bridge the gap between the Manual and the VAPCCI (Vatavuk Air Pollution Control Cost Indexes), the latter being documented in a recent EPA report.2  The CO$T-AIR rograms are written in Lotus 1-2-3  (version 2.0). Each program outputs itemized total capital investment and total annual costs for a given set of input parameters.  The devices and auxiliary for which we wrote spreadsheets are listed in the table (See page 2), alongside the Lotus  file names and the Manual chapters that correspond to them. <P>

  In each of these file names, "TCI" denotes "total capital investment,"
while "WK1" is simply the Lotus  version 2.0 file extension.  Those file
names containing "2" are second versions of the spreadsheets in question.
The character "-L" signifies that the spreadsheet is for "large" units i.e., those devices whose sizes exceed the upper limits of the cost correlations. As the list indicates, we wrote "large" spreadsheets for thermal and catalytic incinerators, regenerative thermal oxidizers, flares, mechanical collectors, and wet impingement scrubbers.<P>

  Finally, for the refrigeration systems, "-C" and "-P" denote the spreadsheets for "custom" and "packaged" units, respectively.<P>

  Most of the programs were based on design and cost data and procedures in
the OAQPS Control Cost Manual (Fourth Edition, 1990) and its supplements.
The exceptions were the programs for mechanical collectors, venturi scrubbers, and wet impingement scrubbers.  Spreadsheets for these three devices were based on information in the book Estimating Costs of Air Pollution Control (ECAPC).5<P>

                             <STRONG>Spreadsheet Components</STRONG><P>

    Although there are significant differences among the various spreadsheets, some components are common to all.  First, each spreadsheet consists of six sections: (1)"Cost Base Date"/"VAPCCI," (2) "Input Parameters," (3) "Design Parameters," (4) "Capital Costs," (5) "Annual Cost Inputs," and (6) "Annual Costs". In the first section, the "Cost Base Date" is the date corresponding to the equipment costs ("base costs") in the Manual or ECAPC.  This date ranges from third quarter 1986 (fabric filters) to second quarter 1993 (ductwork).<P>

  Next, the "VAPCCI" is used by the spreadsheet to escalate the equipment
costs from the base date to the quarter and year selected by the user.6
Eleven VAPCCI have been developed, one for each of the control devices listed above.7  (The sole exceptions are the "venturi scrubbers" and "wet impingement scrubbers" categories, which have been combined into one index: "wet scrubbers".)  Each spreadsheet is written so that once the user inputs the latest VAPCCI available, the total capital investment cost and capital
cost-dependent annual costs will automatically be escalated.<P>

  The second section, "Input Parameters," contains technical data that, in
nearly all cases, must be entered by the user. Because these input parameters vary so much according to control device designs and applications, there are no "default" values for them.  Input parameters include standard stream parameters  (e.g., waste gas volumetric flowrate) and data specific to a device (e.g., gas absorber packing parameters).  The spreadsheet needs these data to compute the design parameters, the costs, or both.<P>

  The "Design Parameters" section lists data (such as ESP collecting area)
that are primarily calculated by the spreadsheet based on the input
parameters.  The "Capital Costs" section displays the control device total
equipment cost (itemized), the purchased equipment cost, and the total
capital investment (TCI). Two values are given for the total equipment cost. The first corresponds to the base date of the costs (e.g., second quarter 1987); the second, to the VAPCCI escalation date.<P>

  The fifth section, "Annual Cost Inputs," lists nearly all of the parameters needed for the program to calculate the various annual costs.  These include the "operating factor" (the hours per year the control device operates), operating and maintenance labor rates, utility prices, the interest rate, and the control system life.  As with the "Input Parameters" section, the user must provide all of these inputs.  Nevertheless, typical values for the parameters are given in the Manual chapter covering the device in question. <P>

  Given in dollars/year, the "Annual Costs" are listed in the last section of the program.   These are itemized according to: (1) direct annual costs
(operating, maintenance, and supervisory labor; maintenance materials;
utilities; operating materials (e.g., caustic soda); replacement parts; and
waste treatment/disposal), (2) indirect annual costs (overhead; capital
recovery; and taxes, insurance, and administrative charges), and (3) recovery credits (if any).<P>

  The CO$T-AIR spreadsheets are installed on the OAQPS TTN, where it is
posted on both the Control Technology Center (CTC) and the Clean Air Act
Amendments (CAAA) bulletin board systems.  Because the spreadsheets are
written in Lotus  (version 2.0), they are in a format that is importable to
later versions of Lotus , as well as to such programs as Excel  and
Quatro-Pro .  Accompanying the spreadsheets is an Introduction (in WordPerfect 5.1), which provides background on the programs, describing their general and specific features.  Those with questions or comments about CO$T-AIR should contact William M. Vatavuk, at (919)-541-5309 (fax: 919/541-0839).

                             CONDENSERS IN HAP-PRO</H3>
                                        
                                 Lyndon S. Cox<BR>
                         Senior Environmental Employee<P>

  There are two types of condensers: the surface type and the contact type.
The Control Cost Manual (CCM) and HAP-PRO (type 1) calculate only the surface type. HAP-PRO defines a type 2 unit as one in which the area of the heat exchanger is defined, not calculated.<P>

  In a contact condenser (not addressed in either CCM or HAP-PRO) a
refrigeration unit chills volatile organic compounds (VOCs), similar to those being removed. Chilled VOCs are sprayed into the emission stream to condense the vapors.  Again, the CCM and HAP-PRO do not address this type of condenser.<P>

  The CCM and HAP-PRO do address the surface type of condenser, also known as the shell-and-tube type. This type of condenser has the emission stream
directed into a shell.  Within the shell, there are tubes which are maintained at a low enough temperature to reduce the vapor pressure of the VOCs. Condensation of VOC vapor reduces the concentration.  The emission stream is then exhausted.  Part of the design data is the level of VOC which is acceptable in the exhaust.<P>

  The refrigeration system must be capable of handling the heat load given up by the VOCs as heat of condensation. And, if there is too much moisture in the air, the ice on the tubes can impair heat transfer, and the condenser will have a lower control efficiency than calculated. Therefore, in emission streams that are known to have a high moisture content, a precooler is necessary.  The precooler operates at about 35 F to condense most of the water.<P>

  The input data for the design of this refrigeration unit is in Table 1:
HAP-PRO erroneously calls for the specific heat of the coolant to be in
Btu/hr-ft2- F; it should be in Btu/lb- F. However, as long as the correct
numerical value is given, it will compute properly.<P>

  The air is considered to be noncondensible, which is true at these
temperatures. Since the partial pressure of the VOC can be raised by either
compression or cooling, it is a given in the calculations that the condenser operates at atmospheric pressure.  We must calculate the temperature at which condensation occurs.<P>

  First we use the equation:<P>

HAP-PRO uses the less obvious, but equivalent, calculation: where<BR><blockquote>
  RE = Removal Efficiency<BR>
  HAPe = HAP concentration in the emission stream, ppm<BR>
  delta Hcon =   enthalpy change of condensed VOC<BR>
  delta Huncon= enthalpy change of uncondensed VOC<P>
</blockquote>
  This assumes that at the outlet the gas stream is at equilibrium with the VOC condensate.  <P>

  In the CCM, this leads to the equation :<P>
<pre>
        Tcon  =  (B  -C)
                  ---------
            A-log[(base 10)^P]voc
</pre>
  Now we know the temperatures we must obtain.  The heat load is then equal to:    <P>

     Hload = delta Hcon + delta Huncon + delta Hnoncon<P>

where:<P>

     delta Hcon = Mvoc,con[(delta Hvoc+Cp,voc)(Tin-Tcon)]<P>

     Mvoc,con = Mvoc,in - Mvoc,out<P>

     Mvoc,out = Mvoc,in (1-n)<P>

     delta Huncon = (Mvoc,out)(Cp,voc)(Tin-Tcon)<P>

     delta Hnoncon = [(60Qin/392) - Mvoc,in](Cp,air)(Tin-Tcon)<P>

HAP-PRO computes the number of moles in the inlet stream: <P>
<pre>
     HAPem = ((Qe)(HAPe*10)^-6)(60)
             ----------------------
                      392
</pre>
  Then the number of moles in the outlet stream:<P>
<pre>
     HAPom = (HAPem)[1 - RE]
                    --------
                      100
</pre>
  Then the number of moles condensed is:<P>

     HAPcon = HAPem - HAPom<P>

  Then HAP-PRO computes the heat load just as the CCM does it, but
erroneously uses the Cp,air instead of the Cp,voc in computation of the
enthalpy change in the uncondensed VOC.  This minor error was not previously discovered because it is negligible.<P>

  Next, the CCM addresses the heat exchanger or condenser.  The Chemical
Engineers Handbook gives values of 20 to 60 Btu/hr-ft2- F for examples of
brine cooled tubes condensing VOC.  The CCM uses a conservative heat transfer estimate of U = 20 Btu/hr-ft2- F.  HAP-PRO uses this as the default value, but allows other values to be entered.<P>

  The coolant is brine, which must be chilled to about 15  F below the
condensation temperature.  The temperature of the brine will rise to 25  F
above the condensation temperature in a properly sized counterflow heat
exchanger.  These values must be used in the following equations.<P>

  The condenser then becomes defined by:<P>

     Acon = Hload/U delta Tlm<P>

The coolant flow rate is given by:<P>

     Wcool = Hload/Cp,cool(Tcool,out-Tcool,in)<P>

And the refrigeration capacity is defined as:<P>
     R = Hload/12,000  tons<P>

  The flaws that have been detected will be corrected.<P>

<H3 align=center>NEW LANDFILL AIR EMISSIONS MODEL </H3>

By Bob Blaszczak,<BR>
CTC/OAQPS<P>

     The Landfill Air Emission Model is now available on the CTC BBS and HOME PAGE.  It provides an automated estimation tool for quantifying emissions from municipal waste landfills. The model estimates emissions of methane, carbon dioxide, nonmethane organic compounds, and toxic air pollutants. Information on the assumptions used in the model can be found in the background information document (NTIS # PB91-197061) written to support the Municipal Landfill New Stationary Performance Standards (NSPS), 40CFR60 Subpart WWW, and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources, 40CFR60 Subpart CC, and in the public docket, Docket A-88-09.  This article contains information on the beta release versions of the Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model for DOS (Version 2.0) and Microsoft Windows (Version 1.0).<P>

     The Landfill Air Emissions Model is regarded as a screening tool.  It
can be used with site-specific data, or it can be used with two different
sets of default values.  The CAA (Clean Air Act) default values reflect the
expected maximum emissions and generally would be used only for determining
the applicability of the landfill regulations and guidelines.  To estimate
actual emissions in the absence of site-specific data, a second set of default values (the AP-42 defaults) is provided in the model.  The AP-42 default values are based on emission factors from the EPA s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Fifth Edition, AP-42 (EPA 1995).  The AP-42
default values provide emission estimates that should reflect typical landfill emissions and are the values suggested for use in developing estimates for state inventories.<P>
     An IBM-compatible personal computer with at least one floppy disk drive and 4 megabytes of memory is recommended for this program.  The Windows version requires Windows 3.1 or better.  The DOS version requires DOS 2.0 or better.  All software components of the models for this beta release are fully functional.   As of this writing, the AP-42 values have been revised and are available for public comment.  The beta version of this software includes the revised AP-42 suggested defaults. Once the AP-42 revisions are published as final, the defaults in these models will be revised to reflect any changes.<P>

     The CTC BBS and HOME PAGE have versions of the Landfill Air Emissions
Estimation Model for DOS and Windows.  Each model is provided in a separate
self-expanding ZIP file (LAND_DOS.EXE for the DOS version and LAND_WIN.EXE
for the Windows version).  Just download the appropriate version and put it
in its own directory. To extract the files, either double-click on the file
name in the Windows File Manager or type the file name in DOS and hit enter. (NOTE: All software components for each version should be located in the same directory prior to execution.)<P>

     For the DOS MODEL, go to the directory that contains the expanded files and type LANDFILL. to execute the model.   (SPECIAL NOTE:  Hercules graphics card users should execute the MSHERC.COM program prior to running the model. This component is required to view graphical output with these cards).<P>

     For the WINDOWS MODEL, use the FILE-RUN selections from the File Manager menu to execute the LANDWIN.EXE file to start the model.  (Additional Note: This program will make a modification to your WIN.INI file to save setup information about the model.)<P>

     More details about the design and use of both the DOS and Windows versions of the landfill model are provided in the "User s Manual, Landfill Air Emissions Model."  This manual is also available on the CTC BBS and HOME PAGE.<P>

REPORTING PROBLEMS<BR>
     If in the process of using the model you have a question or problem,
please feel free to contact us.  In the event of a problem, please include

                             <H3 align=center>What s New on the RBLC</H3>
                               By Jo Ann Kerrick<BR>
                                     VGYAN<P>

  Information in the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) is updated nearly
every month as users submit new control technology determinations to the data base.  In addition to this information, the RBLC support staff continues to make changes to keep the system current.  If you haven t been on the RBLC BBS lately, check the TTN now for the updates described below.<P>
 
New RBLC Data Fields in Standalone Editor<BR>

  As you may have noticed, we recently changed the RBLC data base structure
by removing extraneous dates at the facility level and adding new fields for notes about compliance verification at the process level.  In addition, the cost fields at the pollutant level were expanded to accommodate larger
numbers.  In September we released a new version of the RBLC standalone editor designed to be compatible with these changes.<P>
  The standalone editor is an alternative to online entry of new control
technology information.  You can input new determinations locally on your PC and then transfer the data to the RBLC system administrator for inclusion in the online data base. While we were changing the system to be compatible with the new data base, we made some more changes to simplify the editor.  We removed the edit menu and moved its functions to the facility list screen. Now you can make all updates to your determinations, including adding new ones, from a single screen.  Another new option at the facility list screen lets you delete all of your old determinations and start with a blank data base.  (You would use this option after you have sent your data to the RBLC). We hope these changes make the system easier and quicker to use.  If you are responsible for submitting your agency s determinations, you might want to try the standalone editor.  All the files you need and installation instructions can be downloaded from the RBLC BBS.<P>

Ranking Reports Updated<BR>

  The RBLC ranking report compares pollutant emissions for a single process
type and one pollutant.  Typically you perform a search for the target
information, and then download your results using the ranking report format. Based on standard emission limits for each applicable determination, the report presents statistics based on these limits and then reports them in rank order listing from most to least stringent.<P>

  Because the RBLC Ranking report can be a valuable reference for users
making RACT, BACT, or LAER determinations, the RBLC staff has generated
ranking reports for specific process type and pollutant combinations.  The
reports are available for downloading to your PC without doing a query.  In
October all of these reports were updated to reflect the latest information
in the then current RBLC data base.  If you want quick access to ranking
information, look for these reports in the Download section of the RBLC BBS.<P>

Regulation Data Base Updated<BR>

  When it became available in late 1994, the regulation data base contained
summaries of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) rules then in effect.
Subsequently, we expanded the data base to include entries for Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards.  As of November 1995, the
data base contained 105 rules, with 21 of them updated to reflect rules
proposed or promulgated in 1995.  Starting in 1996, we plan to add summaries of Control Technology Guidance (CTG) documents.  If you need summary information about current federal rules, the regulation data base is a good place to start.<P>

Help Rearranged for Process Type Codes<BR>

  The RBLC uses numeric codes to group processes by category, such as
combustion, surface coating, mineral processing, etc.  In fact, searching for the appropriate process type code can  be the quickest way to get the control technology information you need.  Performing these searches with the menu-driven search just became a little easier.  You still choose a major category from a two-page display of 2-digit process type codes from 10 to 99. Now, however, the system displays the list of available detail codes in alphabetical order by the process ame, rather than in numeric order.  You can quickly scan the list for the process you want and find the appropriate code for it.  We hope this improvement makes the RBLC easier to use.<P>

printers and agency personnel, at which the group identified both environmental concerns in the printing industry and a set of environmental criteria which would indicate that best environmental management practices were being followed.<P>
  MP2 allows printers to come into compliance with the new protocols simply, inexpensively and in multi-media fashion.  It imposes some additional requirements, both in photo wastewater discharge and in air emissions, which will assure industry-wide emissions reductions based on pollution prevention (P2).  Program elements follow:<P>

  Aggressive outreach, including the development of a "plain language workbook" or printers, which will detail compliance requirements to which printers are subject and closely coordinated program materials which will lead the individual printing plant manager in a step-by-step self-certification process. OTA is hosting a series of six half-day workshops and clinics at convenient sites across the state, jointly funded by DEP, EPA-New England and OTA.<P>

  Regulatory Reform, the Partnership enrollment will replace virtually all
environmental permits typically required of small and midsize printers and a six month enforcement moratorium to allow Partnership members to come into compliance.<P>

  Pre and post-program sampling to determine level of improved environmental performance, according to established measures of success and a carefully selected statistical sample.  EPA has placed a high priority on demonstration projects which validate the concept of improving environmental performance by creating incentives for voluntary compliance.  There was resistance to the concept of beginning a cooperative program with inspections, but this was deemed essential to establish a baseline.  Fifty inspections were agreed upon and conducted under enforcement discretion, there would be no penalty except in extreme situations.<P>

  Strong public relations efforts, involving key state officials and
representatives of the printing industry, working with statewide media to
tout the program and encourage consumers to atronize printers who display
the MP2 logo.<P>

                                    SUCCESS!</H3>

  The 1996 "State Small Business Ombudsman and Small Business Assistance
Program Conference," co-sponsored by the Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards (OAQPS) Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) and EPA s Small
Business Ombudsman s Office, was held February 28 - March 1, 1996, in San
Diego, California. This annual event provides an opportunity for the State
programs to share information with each other, and with EPA.  The conference attracted 150 attendees, representing 44 States and 2 territories; quite a good turn-out in this era of downsizing and budget cuts.<P>

  This year, planning of the conference "content" was carried out primarily
by a group of State program representatives.  The first day was devoted to
industry sector presentations (printing, metal finishing, automotive service, and painting & coatings), with  many of the speakers representing trade associations or actual small businesses.  The second day had 16 different breakout sessions related to more operational issues of the State programs (policy and process), with the vast majority of speakers from within the State programs themselves.  This combination of planning and presentation by the target audience proved to be amazingly successful; we literally had more volunteers to chair sessions or make presentations than we could use. The response to "learning from your peers" was very enthusiastic.<P>

  OAQPS had a small, but visible, presence.  In addition to serving as the
Conference Co-Organizer, I introduced several recent OAQPS small business
assistance accomplishments, including the new SBAP BBS on the OAQPS Technology Transfer Network (TTN), as well as the SBAP Home Page on the World Wide Web. Janyce Riess lead an excellent discussion on the series of small business satellite seminars put on by OAQPS s Education and Outreach Group (EOG) in cooperation with the University of Tennessee.  In fact, the session that Janyce participated in was one of the most popular in the whole conference.<P>

  Organizing a national meeting can be an extremely time consuming and
frustrating experience.  The rewards, however, can be very satisfying.  Some comments we received on the evaluation forms include:<P>

-"Great meeting"<BR>
-"This was my first meeting and Ienjoyed every aspect"<BR>
-"I learned a lot and I am very grateful for this experience"<BR>
-"We plan on using OAQPS resources much more"<BR>
-"Annual conference should be considered as part of training for all States".<P>

Somehow, in the end, it all seems worth while!<P>

<h2 align=center>Executive Summary</h2>


The Illinois coal industry experienced limited recovery in 1994 from the depressed production levels of 1993.  The 1993 United Mine Workers strike and RAIL curtailment from flooding resulted in an 18.5 million ton drop in production and deliveries that year.  Annual coal production rebounded to 54 million tones in 1994, ten percent off the 1970-1990 historical average of 60 million tons.  A declining market for Illinois coal is projected through 2000, as a result of strict limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) placed on utilities by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).  After 2000, implementation of Phase II of the CAAA, as well as growing demand for electric capacity should help to reverse this trend.  Even so, Illinois coal production is not likely to approach 60 million tons per year within the foreseeable future to satisfy the domestic market.  A penetration of off-shore markets could mitigate the downward trend.<p>

Utility sales in the U.S. account for 90 percent of coal sales.  Near-term forecasts for domestic utility purchases during Phase I of the CAAA (1995-1999) are not encouraging.  Under there present scenario, utility purchases of Illinois coal are projected to drop to 36 million tons in 1995 and 29 million tons in 2000.  During Phase II, Illinois coal should rebound somewhat based on projected growth in coal-fired generation, although these gains are not expected to return Illinois coal to pre-1990 utility consumption levels unless non-traditional markets are accessed.  Furthermore, as spot purchases become more common and log-term contracts dwindle, the economic foundation for many Illinois coal producers will erode.<p>

Several companies announced mine closures during 1994 and 1995.  Peabody Coal closed its No. 10 Mine on August 5, 1994, ending 43 years of operation.  Three hundred forty miners were released.  Peabody cited its inability to find new customers for the high-sulfur coal.  Old Ben No. 24 and Zeigler No. 11 will be idled in the first quarter of 1996 while Old Ben No.26 will be idled in the third quarter of 1996.  Freeman said the suspension was the result of weak demand caused by environmental restrictions on the use of Illinois high-sulfur coal.<p>

Mine employment for the year continued a historical decline that began in the early 1970s.  Illinois coal mines employed 10,129, 9,667 and 8,831 miners in 1990. 1991 and 1992, respectively.  Illinois mine employment in 1993 dropped to a low of 4,257 at the peak of the UMWA strike, but ended with 7,389 miner employed.  By the end of 1994, total mine employment dropped to 6,663 miners, reflecting two trends in the Illinois coal industry - shrinking employment due to increased productivity and a declining number of mine operations as a consequence of the CAAA.  Projection estimate that mine employment will drop to 5,800 miner by 1995 and 5,250 miner by 2000 (roughly half the 1990 level).<p>

As a result of shrinking number of mine operations and employed miners, annual personal income for Illinois is expected to fall from 1994 levels by $183 million in 1995 and $309 million in 2000.  Consequently, annual state tax revenues are projected to decline from 1994 levels by as much as $13 million in 1995 and $22 million by 2000.  Reductions in coal operator contributions to the state unemployment insurance program show a similar pattern.  At the same time as these contribution fall, benefits paid out by the state for displaced mining jobs will increase and could potentially reach a cumulative total of $135 million for the 1990-2000 period.<p>

<p>
The CAAA will be a dominant factor shaping utility fuel decisions over the next five to ten years.  Phase I of Title IV of the CAAA, which took effect in 1995, covers 110 generating stations; 263 units nationwide.  affected utilities have largely implemented their phase I compliance plans for SO2; and NOx compliance will be required in 1996.  Phase I (and Phase II) SO2 compliance can be accomplished through fuel-based controls, post-combustion emission controls, reduced emission generation technology or strategic compliance planning (incorporating a combination of strategies).<p>

Phase I compliance choice across the nation is dominated by fuel switching/blending have chosen to completely eliminate the use of high-sulfur interior coals.  twenty-seven units have or will install flue gas desulfurization equipment (fgds), 31 units switched fuels completely to comply with prior state regulations, one unit has been repowered, seven will be retired and the remainder (52) of phase I units will employ allowance-based compliance strategies exclusively.<p>

Phase II of the CAAA affects 958 fossil fuel-fired generating stations (2,913 units) beginning January 1, 2000.  Preliminary Phase II compliance plans on file generally indicate a preference for further fuel switching/blending with lower sulfur coals or potential co- or seasonal-firing with natural gas.  use of banked phase I SO2 allowances appears to be a popular Phase II compliance strategy while repowering and FGD installation are not prominently featured.<p>


<center><img src="/dcca/graph/coal3.gif" alt="Utility Purchases of Illinois Coal" width=475 height=323></center>
<p>

Other environmental issues linger for Phase II compliance beyond SO2 control.  Title IV of the CAAA established a national standard for annual SO2 emissions.  CAAA NOx regulations, on the other hand, are contained in both Title IV and Title I.  Although implemented at a later date, no control decisions will have an impact on SO2 compliance decisions.  Similarly, Title III hazardous air pollutant (HAP) standards may impact Phase II units using Illinois coal,  depending on the type of HAP regulated and the level of HAP emission control required.  Regional haze or visibility controls and greenhouse gas emission standards (CO2 regulation) could also impact Phase II compliance strategies and subsequently, Illinois coal sales.<p>

As electric utilities move through Phase I and into Phase II, restructuring will emerge as the major issue.  Any changes in the structure of the electric utility industry will affect Phase II compliance decisions.  Competition between utilities, capacity decisions and stranded investment rulings are projected to force generators to minimize generating costs.  There may be opportunities for Illinois coal to penetrate these evolving electricity markets.  A competitive electric utility industry, driven by the need for efficient generation and Phase II compliance decisions, may place a premium on an efficient fuel source such as Illinois coal in conjunction with emission control technology.  However, if utilities are uncertain that the capital cost of fuel or technology can be recovered, there may be a reluctance to employ this strategy in favor of switching to a low cost, low emission fuel source.<p>

While the trends in Illinois coal production have been negative, there are occasional sign of hope.  Catlin Coal Company has initiated efforts to open a new mine in Vermillion county.  Initial permitting for the Riola Mine began with approval by the Illinois Mining Board in August, 1995.  The first coal from this operation is expected in mid-1996.  Lauhoff Grain Company of Danville will be the principal customer for the riola coal.<p>

Other opportunities to mitigate market losses do exist.  Phase II will affect practically all coal fired units nationwide.  utilities which use their so2 emission allowances for Phase I compliance can delay a fuel choice decision until Phase II.  At that point, these units may be persuaded to retrofit or repower in order to continue using illinois coal.  an innovative so2 emission allowance policy could be developed by the state as an incentive for purchasers of illinois coal.. international marketing opportunities are also being explored.  Many nations are in desperate need of new electric generating capacity.  Illinois coal should be poised to take advantage of these expanding markets.<p>

Illinois must make sacrifices to preserve its coal industry and the socioeconomic stability of its mining communities.  Economic incentives to stimulate illinois coal sales should be explored to maintain illinois coal markets for illinois coal while generating jobs and revenues for the state.<p>

Consideration should be given to the increased us of SO2 allowances to encourage Illinois coal use.  The State of Illinois should assess SO2 allowance alternatives to determine whether they can become a component of incentive packages for current and potential domestic consumers of Illinois coal.  Allowances are a unique financial instrument created by the CAAA to regulate compliance with emission reduction requirements.  They can be purchased in several ways, sold, traded or baked for future use, and there are no ownership restriction.  One option which has been discussed in the past is "Bundling" allowances with coal at the point of sale to offset resulting SO2 emissions.  Another option would have the state purchase, hold and distribute allowances to encourage the use of Illinois coal.  There are many potential scenarios worth investigating for using SO2 allowances as incentives for marketing Illinois coal.<p>



<center><img src="/dcca/graph/coal4.gif" alt="Growth in World Coal Consumption, 1992-2005" width=369 height=298></center>


Preserving market share is an important objective of the state's coal policy.  Another equally important objective should be to seek out new international markets for Illinois coal.  According to the Energy Information Administration, worldwide demand for electricity is projected to increase by six trillion kilowatt-hours by the year 2010, with coal retaining the primary share of the generating market (>35 percent).  Additionally, the United States Department of Energy projects that by 2010, worldwide demand for power generating technologies and services will create a $200 billion export market.  The Office of Coal Development and Marketing, now associated with the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, is ideally positioned to collaborate on a coal export initiative.  Increasing Illinois coal exports and international market share will be a critical factor in the preservation of the industry.<p>

The state should continue to support development of markets through research on high-sulfur coal, development of promising techniques and processes and commercial demonstration of proven clean coal technologies.  State programs should be modified to: accelerate refinement and commercialization of advanced coal combustion technology; broaden the scope of potential clean coal demonstration projects for state participation to include those which serve to promote or preserve the use of Illinois coal and coal byproducts; support Illin ois industries involved in the design, engineering, manufacture and installation of clean coal technologies.<p>

The CAAA are proving costly for the Illinois coal industry.  This federal legislation gained widespread support due in large part to emotional arguments rather than scientific facts.  The lessons for Illinois to learn is the importance of closely monitoring national environmental initiatives that could further threaten the Illinois coal industry.  Where feasible, the state should actively participate in the development of federal legislative and regulatory proposals that are favorable to the producers and consumers of Illinois coal.  The state should continue to discourage an incremental approach to pollutant regulation which could disproportionately impact Illinois and further deteriorate its already weakened competitive position.<p>

One important national policy debate currently underway centers on reform of the electric utility industry.  Whatever reforms eventually emerge will affect the coal industry.  The state should closely monitor electric utility regulatory reform efforts at both the federal and state levels.  New opportunities for Illinois coal will appear in a competitive electricity market, where fuel choice decision will be made based on long -term efficiency instead of short-term cost advantage.  The overriding concern of Illinois coal interests must be to ensure that reform in the name of a more competitive electric utility sector does not come at the expense of coal.<p>

Illinois coal producers are major consumer of electric power.  Existing and new mine operations in the state should be eligible for favorable rate structures.  The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) should encourage Illinois electric utility companies to adopt flexible contract terms for Illinois coal producers who have been adversely impacted by the Clean Air Act Amendments.  Flexible contracts will benefit coal producer through lower costs, as well as utility companies who will be securing a prime revenue source.<p>

Likewise, electric generators should be granted additional flexibility in long-term planning to achieve the most cost-effective compliance strategies for all pollutants regulated under the CAAA.  When analyzing long-range energy forecasts and compliance plans, the ICC should take into account that clean coal technologies do provide several benefits to the state, including multiple pollutant control, demonstration opportunities for corporations engaged in clean coal technology research, positive short- and long-term employment opportunities for Illinois worker, and market opportunities for the Illinois coal industry.<p>

Finally, the Office of Coal Development and Marketing should continue to enhance its Coal Education Program.  This program distributes valuable, factual information regarding the production and utilization of coal to classrooms around the state.  It helps to foster an awareness and understanding of coal, such as formation, historical growth of the industry, coal mining and safety, as well as environmental issues.  Because the education program demonstrates the relationship between coal and everyday life, the Board strongly encourages the Office of Coal Development and Marketing to maintain and enhance its efforts in this regard.<p>

The growth of the information highway offers unique opportunities for education and information sharing.  Business information important to the mining and utility industries can be made readily available through electronic media.  For instance, international marketing would be facilitated by on-line assistance through a number of market analysis systems.  Additional information of interest to coal industry analysts could be made readily available through Access Illinois network and the Internet.  The state should explore various options for information sharing that are now available through electronic media.<p>

<h3>Illinois History</h3>

Indians hunted in Illinois as far back as 5000 B.C. and today you can still view the remains of their civilization at places such as Cahokia Mounds - North America's largest and most valuable prehistoric earthenwork relic. Dickson Mounds Indian Museum near Lewistown features special exhibits which chronicle the Indian's valuable place in Illinois history.<p>

The first European explorers in Illinois were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet, Frenchmen who paddled by birchbark canoe along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. They traveled the length of the state - from what is now Chicago to the southernmost reaches of Illinois.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/fortdech.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/fortdechs.jpg" width=75 height=59 align=right></a>
More French explorers followed, building military outposts and establishing a fur trading empire with local Indians. In 1763, at the close of the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris ceded to England all lands France had claimed east of the Mississippi River, except for New Orleans in Louisiana.<p>


The British continued to control what is now Illinois until 1778 when George Rogers Clark, a Revolutionary War hero, and his band of American colonists captured Fort Kaskaskia. The Illinois country became a possession of Virginia until 1787 when it joined the Northwest Territory under the government of the United States. Kaskaskia became Illinois' first capital in 1818. Two years later the seat of Illinois government was moved to Vandalia. In 1839, largely through the efforts of a young legislator named Abraham Lincoln, the capital was again moved - this time to Springfield, where it is now open to the public as an historic site. The Capitol in use today dates back to 1868, when ground was broken for its construction. Although the General Assembly moved in eight years later in 1876, it took 20 years to complete the building at a cost of $4.5 million. During 1988, Illinois celebrated the centennial of the completion of the Statehouse.<p>

<h3>Geography</h3>

<a href="../../graph/kids/river.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/rivers.jpg" width=72 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right></a>
Illinois' total land area is about 56,400 square miles. There are 282,000 acres of ponds and lakes, not counting Lake Michigan. Among its 430 permanent rivers are 2,000 miles of navigable canoe routes. The state's largest inland water system is Carlyle Lake, which covers 26,000 acres in Southern Illinois. Major Illinois rivers include: the Mississippi, which forms the entire western border of the state, the Illinois, Ohio, Wabash, Rock, Vermilion, Fox, Des Plaines, Sangamon, Spoon, Embarras, Big Muddy, Kaskaskia, Kankakee, Pecatonica and the Kishwaukee.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/winter.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/winters.jpg" width=110 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left></a>
Illinois stretches 385 miles from north to south, and 218 miles from east to west at its widest point. The state is bordered by Indiana to the east, Wisconsin to the north, Iowa to the west, and Kentucky and Missouri to the south. Illinois has four distinct seasons which offer a variety of temperatures. The highest ever recorded was 117 degrees Fahrenheit; the lowest was 35 degrees below zero.<p>

There are over 100 state parks and conservation areas in Illinois, as well as federal wildlife areas and refuges. The Shawnee National Forest, which includes Illinois' dramatic Ozark Mountain foothills, covers 240,000 acres and offers some of the Midwest's best camping and fishing areas.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/coalman.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/coalmans.jpg" width=73 height=60 align=right></a>
Besides its rich farmland and recreational sites, Illinois' geography yields large amounts of limestone, silica clay, lead, zinc and fluorite along with valuable oil, coal and natural gas.<p>

<h3>Commerce</h3>

<a href="../../graph/kids/farmroad.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/farmroads.jpg" width=80 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left></a>
Miles of neatly planted farm fields are a  familiar sight in Illinois, even though the state's southern reaches include some of the Midwest's most rugged and rocky hills.<p>

This same geography of gently rolling prairie boasts some of the most productive and fertile soil on earth. Illinois is among the leading agricultural export centers of the nation and is a leading state in the production  of  corn, soybeans and hogs. Other important Illinois crops include alfalfa, peaches, apples and melons. Beef, dairy and poultry products also rank high.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/xway.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/xways.jpg" width=75 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right></a>
Some other facts about Illinois commerce:<p>

<ul type=square>

<li>Illinois ranks third in the nation in the number of interstate highway miles.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/coalshov.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/coalshovs.jpg" width=74 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right></a>
<li>Approximately three percent of U.S. exports come from Illinois.<p>

<h3>Chicago</h3>

<a href="../../graph/kids/chicago.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/chicagos.jpg" width=68 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=5 align=right></a>
Chicago is the nation's third largest  city and was first settled by the French in 1696. No lasting town, however, was formed until 1779 when  Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable arrived from Canada with his Indian wife to start a fur trading post at the mouth of what is today the Chicago River. The name "Chicago" is derived from the Indian word "Che-Cagou."<p>

Nudged against one of the world's largest fresh water systems, Lake Michigan, Chicago's 29-mile shoreline, is devoted mostly to public beaches, harbors, parks and some of the nation's best museums. Among the city's nearly 230 square miles lie 430 parks that cover 7,000 acres. Chicago's "forest preserve" system takes up 35,000 additional acres of public wooded landscape. Even more forest preserves (65,000 acres) surround Chicago with a ring of picnic and recreation areas.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/ohare.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/ohares.jpg" width=75 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left></a>
<a href="../../graph/kids/rail.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/rails.jpg" width=88 height=50 hspace=5 vspace=1 align=right></a>
Chicago is a "number one" city in many ways: convention business, commercial printing, mail order business, candy making, vending machines manufacturing, metal products and chemicals manufacturing. O'Hare International Airport is the world's busiest airport, and as the leading transportation center Illinois boasts over 20,000 miles of in-state railroad.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/picasso.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/picassos.jpg" width=57 height=75 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right></a>
Chicago's rise from the ashes of the Great Fire of 1871 also saw the birth of American modern architecture. The city today mirrors the efforts of great master builders such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, and Sullivan and Adler. Skyscrapers line Chicago's shore. Sears Tower, its 110 stories soaring 1,454 feet above the city, is the world's tallest building. The Standard Oil Building at 80 stories and the John Hancock Center with 100 stories are other significant giants. The First National Bank, its plaza graced with an original mosaic by Russian artist Marc Chagall, is the tallest bank building on earth.<p>

The Chicago area is visited by twenty million people each year, many of them convention and trade show delegates and tourists who flock to lakeside museums and such cultural attractions as the Art Institute of Chicago, Field Museum, Alder Planetarium and John G. Shedd Aquarium.<p>

Here are more facts about Chicago which might surprise you:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Western Avenue, extending for 24.5 miles, is the longest continuous city roadway in the world.<p>
<li>The Chicago area accounts for a majority of the Illinois Gross State Product of $283 billion.<p>
<li>The Chicago area is the corporate home to 48 of the nation's Fortune 500 companies. As a financial center it boasts the Chicago Board of Trade, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the Mid-America Commodity Exchange, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.<p>
<li>Chicago has 3,679 miles of streets, and the busiest stretch of road in the world is on the Dan Ryan Expressway. If you stood at its 59th Street juncture you could count 250,000 vehicles as they passed you during one day.<p>
<li>O'Hare International Airport handles more than 160,000 passengers every day. Two flights depart or arrive every minute.<p>

Illinois' most famous past resident was Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. Lincoln came to Illinois from Indiana when he was 20 years old. He worked here as a riverboat captain, store clerk, postmaster, county circuit lawyer, land surveyor, state legislator and U.S. Congressman. The towns where he lived and worked - New Salem Village, Springfield and others - are visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year. Lincoln's home, in which he lived with his family for 17 years, is located in Springfield. Abraham Lincoln is buried in a tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery just north of Springfield.<p>

<a href="../../graph/kids/reagan.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/reagans.jpg" width=81 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left></a>
Illinois was also the home of President Ulysses S. Grant, whose home is preserved in Galena. The 40th President, Ronald Reagan, was born in Tampico and spent his youth in Dixon.<p>

<h3>Abraham Lincoln</h3>


<a href="../../graph/kids/lincstat.jpg"> <img src="../../graph/kids/lincstats.jpg" width=47 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left></a>
Abraham Lincoln was a young man of 20 when he arrived in Illinois in 1830. A replica of the Lincoln family's first Illinois log cabin can be seen at Lincoln Homestead State Park near Decatur.<p>

After a hard winter, Lincoln's parents decided to settle in a new home in Coles County. The final home of Thomas and Sarah Lincoln is now the site of Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site.<p>

Young Abe, deciding not to stay at the Coles County farm, struck out on his own and settled in the tiny frontier village of New Salem. He lived here for six years, trying his hand at many trades - store clerk, steamboat pilot, postmaster - until he finally decided on a career as a lawyer. The old log cabin house where Lincoln first studied law books by the light of a hearth fire can still be seen today.<p>

Lincoln successfully campaigned for a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1834. He remained as a legislator from Sangamon County until 1841.<p>

During this time Lincoln joined a group of fellow statesmen who called themselves "the long nine" because each man measured well over six feet tall.<p>

Lincoln married Mary Todd in 1842. By 1844 they had settled into their first home, a frame house still located on 8th Street in Springfield.<p>

Following eight years as an Illinois State Representative, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1846. After serving his term, he returned to Illinois to become a traveling attorney and sometimes judge on the Eighth Judicial Circuit. He made many friends during his backcountry trips. One of the towns he frequented, Postville, was renamed "Lincoln" in his honor in 1853. Abe himself christened the new town with the juice of an Illinois watermelon.<p>

With the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed slavery in the new  western  frontier, Lincoln once again delved into politics. He began to speak out strongly against slavery and his views resulted in the formation of the Republican Party in Illinois.<p>

Lincoln challenged Stephen A. Douglas for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois during the state's Republican Convention of 1858. A series of famous debates between the two candidates followed. Lincoln lost the race, but his eloquence gained him a national reputation.<p>

Two years later Lincoln became a candidate for President. He received word of his nomination in the parlor of his Springfield home. As President-Elect, he left his Illinois hometown on February 11, 1861 - just one week before Jefferson Davis became President of the newly formed Confederate States of America. The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumpter.<p>

During his years in the White House Lincoln is credited most often for ending the Civil War and abolishing slavery in the United States with a document called The Emancipation Proclamation.<p>

Fifty months after leaving his beloved Springfield, Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth as he sat in Ford Theater. Returning to Illinois as a martyred president, Lincoln is buried in a massive monument in Oak Ridge Cemetery along with his wife and three of his four children.<p>

<a name="State Symbols"><hr></a>
<h3>State Symbols</h3>

The Official State Symbols of the State of Illinois are designated by acts of the General Assembly.<p>

<a name="State Flag"><hr></a>
<h3>State Flag</h3>

Illinois has had two official state flags since becoming the 21st state to join the union on December 3, 1818. The first flag was designed by Lucy Derwent of the Rockford Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution. She received a prize of $25 for her efforts. The flag was adopted on July 6, 1915.<p>

A move to design a new state flag came in the late 1960's by Chief Petty Officer Bruce McDaniel who requested that the new flag carry the  state's name. Mrs. Sanford Hutchison submitted a design for a new flag which was accepted. On July 1, 1970, her design became the official flag of Illinois.<p>

<a name="State Song"><hr></a>
<h3>State Song</h3>

By Act of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly the song "Illinois" became the official State song. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Florence Fifer Bohrer, daughter of the late Governor Joseph W. Fifer and the first woman to serve as member of the Illinois Senate. The bill passed both houses without opposition and became law by executive signature."Illinois" had long been the State song, but it had been given no official recognition prior to the passage of the bill. The song was written by Charles H. Chamberlin some time between 1890 and 1894, in connection with plans for securing the World's Columbian Exposition for Chicago. Many states were attempting to secure the exposition, Illinois making strong efforts herself with the able assistance of U. S. Senator Shelby M. Cullom and U. S. Senator John M. Palmer. Colonel O. B. Knight, a friend of Mr. Chamberlin, in the meantime, was singing throughout Illinois and in Washington, D. C. and so the song was written primarily for him to sing. The Iyric was composed by Mr. Chamberlin, but the music had been written by Archibald Johnston in 1870 with another Iyric by Charles Machay. In its original form the name of the song was "Baby Mine," under which title it won great popularity in the `70s.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Affordable Financing of Public Infrastructure Program</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<p>

The Affordable Financing of Public Infrastructure (AFPI) program authorizes the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to provide financial assistance to or on behalf of local governments, public entities, medical facilities and public health clinics for the purpose of making affordable the financing of a community's public infrastructure.  DCCA has recognized the importance of adequate infrastructure to the economic viability of communities.<p>

Under the Small Project Loan Component, up to $100,000 is available for a maximum of three years at an attractive interest rate for acquisition, construction and improvements of local public facilities and associated equipment.  Units of local government, local public entities, and medical facilities and public health clinics may apply for funding.<p>


<h3>Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs</h3>

DCCA has joined with the Illinois Rural Bond Bank, Illinois Development Finance Authority, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Department of Public Health to facilitate this project.  DCCA can provide financial assistance directly or through one of these intermediaries.  Depending upon the type of project, a community would apply to one of these agencies for AFPI assistance.  Applications are accepted on an on-going basis.  DCCA staff is available to work with a community to identify which agency is best suited to help with its financing needs.<p>


<h3>Illinois Environmental Protection Agency</h3>

IEPA provides loans to upgrade, expand or otherwise provide wastewater treatment and collection facilities.  AFPI funds are available for planning and design costs.  Also, IEPA has funds available for wastewater construction costs under the Illinois Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund.<p>


<h3>Illinois Rural Bond Bank</h3>

The Illinois Rural Bond Bank will provide loans up to $100,000 for infrastructure improvements and related public purpose projects outside the Chicago metropolitan area.  Eligible projects include water system improvements, school building repairs, fire protection district building improvements and equipment purchases, road improvements, ADA building improvements, and other public use projects.<p>


<h3>Illinois Development Finance Authority</h3>

The Illinois Development Finance Authority will make loans of up to $100,000 to a community for infrastructure improvements necessary to attract, retain or expand a business;  the business must be located within the borrowing community and must need the infrastructure improvements to operate.  Loans are also available to non-rural communities for projects where public purpose financing is not available.<p>

<a name="What is CSBG?"><hr></a>
<h3>What is the Community Services Block Grant Program?</h3>

The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program created by the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.  The CSBG program is designed to provide a range of services which assist low-income people to attain skills, knowledge and motivation necessary to achieve self-sufficiency.  The program also may provide low-income people immediate life necessities such as food, shelter, medicine, etc.<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs administers the CSBG program in accordance with federal rules and the Illinois Economic Opportunity Act.  In its administration, the department places an equal emphasis on self-sufficiency efforts and providing relief for the immediate needs of low-income people.  The state receives approximately $16 million  annually in CSBG funding to provide employment, education, housing and emergency services to the eligible population.<p>

<a name="How are funds distributed?"><hr></a>
<h3>How are CSBG Fund Distributed?</h3>

Federal law mandates that states distribute their CSBG funds in the following manner:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>90 percent to the State's network of Community Action Agencies (CAAs) that provide antipoverty services in Illinois' 102 counties and in the City of Chicago.  The funds are allocated among the CAAs according to a poverty population-based formula.<p>
<li>5 percent to CAAs or other eligible public or private organizations for discretionary antipoverty programs.<p>
<li>5 percent for state administration and technical assistance activities.<p>
</ul>

<a name="What are Community Action Agencies?"><hr></a>
<h3>What are Community Action Agencies?</h3>

Community Action Agencies (CAAs) are created by their local governments as public or private entities to serve two primary purposes: to provide essential antipoverty programs, and to advocate for the needs of the poor in their communities.  A CAA's required three-part board of directors is unique, comprised of an equal number of local government officials, private sector representatives and representatives of the low-income population.  Examples of programs administered locally by CAAs include:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Anti-Drug Abuse
<li>Economic Development
<li>Energy Assistance
<li>Foster Grandparents
<li>Head Start
<li>Homeless Assistance
<li>Housing
<li>Job Counseling & Training
<li>Literacy Training and Basic Education
<li>Outreach & Referral
<li>Senior Assistance
<li>Surplus Food Distribution
<li>Transportation
<li>Weatherization
<li>Women, Infants & Children (WIC)
</ul>

<a name="What other Organizations Receive Funds?"><hr></a>
<h3>What Other Organizations Receive Funds?</h3>

Though distribution may vary from year to year, the department currently provides its five percent discretionary funds to such organizations as:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Illinois Community Action Association - for statewide coordination, training and technical assistance relating to antipoverty programs.<p>
<li>Illinois Migrant Council - for services to migrant farm workers.<p>
<li>Community Action Agencies - for operation of a scholarship program which enables low-income   students to attain additional academic or vocational education resulting in high employment potential.<p>
<li>Community Action Agencies - for such purposes as emergency assistance, disaster recovery, self-sufficiency programs and economic development.<p>
</ul>

<a name="What Services are Provided?"><hr></a>
<h3>What Services are Provided Under CSBG?</h3>

Illinois' Community Action Agencies (CAAs) serve approximately 1 million individuals annually with programs addressing the needs of low-income citizens.  Typically, CSBG funds are being used for the following types of programs:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Education<p>

A broad spectrum of educational assistance is provided through the CSBG program.  Specific examples include: workplace orientation, vocational skills training, family planning education, cultural opportunities for disadvantaged children, energy conservation education, post-secondary education scholarships, GED assistance for high school dropout, adult and youth literacy training and nutrition education for single parents and the elderly.<p>

<li>Employment<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs has placed a high CSBG priority on job creating economic development programs which result in the employment and self-sufficiency of low-income persons.  Each CAA designs and operates an individualized economic development program.  Ten to fifteen percent of each CAA's annual CSBG funding is allocated for economic  development/job creation activities.  Most CAAs operate a loan program through which below market rate loans are made for business expansion and start-up which results in the hiring of low-income persons.<p>

<li>Emergency Services<p>

Most CAAs maintain clothes closets and food pantries, many of them in conjunction with other community groups and local churches.  Some agencies provide redeemable vouchers or grants to clients that enable them to meet immediate and urgent family needs such as health services, nutritious food, housing, employment-related assistance, day care, medical services and transportation.<p>

<li>Health<p>

CAAs provide many health related activities in the form of transportation to medical services, medical dental screening, immunization, drug and alcohol prevention and other services which promote good health.<p>

<li>Housing<p>

The primary housing activities include aid to renters seeking a residence, landlord/tenant rights education and arbitration, information about purchasing/financing a home, packaging housing and housing rehabilitation loans and providing for minor energy efficiency or health and safety related home repair.<p>

<li>Income Management<p>

Many CAAs offer programs to encourage better use of available income.  A majority of this assistance is in the form of family budget counseling.  Information also is provided through workshops or brochures on such topics as financial management, credit, income taxes and social security.<p>

<li>Linkages<p>

CSBG funding regularly supports extensive outreach, information and referral services, transportation services, youth recreation and self-sufficiency programs for low-income citizens. <p>

<li>Nutrition<p>

CSBG funding is a primary resource for leveraging and providing nutritional assistance.  Typical programs include: federal surplus food distribution, community gardening projects, food banks, senior citizen and youth feeding projects, Christmas food packages and assistance in accessing food stamps, WIC and other nutrition-related programs.<p>

<li>Self-Sufficiency<p>

Many CAAs provide for comprehensive family case management programs that promote, empower and nurture family members toward self-sufficiency.<p>

<li>Homeless<p>

All CAAs administer the Emergency Community Services Homeless Grant Program.  This CSBG-related funding is used to assist homeless clients to access needed social and maintenance services, to provide emergency housing, food an medical assistance, and to help provide long-term services that enable the homeless to become self-sufficient and make the transition out of poverty.  Up to 25 percent of this funding can be used to prevent homelessness.<p>

CAAs have forged working linkages with local governments, community based organizations and the private sector to provide critical human services.  These linkages are furthered by the CAA's unique board structure and continuous local coordinative efforts.<p>

<h4>How Can I Obtain More Information?</h4>

To locate the Community Services Block Grant funded agency serving your county, refer to the map in this document.<p>

<a name="Who is Eligible?"><hr></a>
<h3>Who is Eligible?</h3>

Client eligibility for the Illinois Community Services Block Grant program is based on a "poverty" income threshold that is established and annually adjusted (for changes in the Consumer Price Index) by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  In addition to the poverty income eligibility, citizens whose income is within 125 percent of the poverty threshold are determined to be "low-income" and are also eligible for CSBG services.  Illinois' CSBG regulations also make provision for CSBG services to citizens above these income levels who are victims of natural or man-made disasters which cause swift and temporary poverty.  Information on CSBG eligibility provisions can be obtained by calling any listed CAA or the department.<p>

<H3>Industrial Training Program (ITP)</H3>

Administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs 
(DCCA), the Industrial Training Program (ITP) is a streamlined, cost-
effective program to help Illinois workers keep their skills consistent 
with changing technologies and business processes.  Businesses benefit 
through increased productivity, reduced costs, improved quality and 
competitiveness.<P>

ITP provides grants that can reimburse companies for up to 50 percent 
of the cost of training their employees.  Employers may select the workers 
that will participate in the training; however, the trainees must have been 
employed by the company before implementation of the training program.  
Instructors may be plant workers, public education employees, private 
consultants or others who possess the required instructional expertise.<P>

ITP grants may be awarded to individual businesses, as well as multi-
company employee training projects sponsored by original equipment 
manufacturers for their Illinois suppliers, and multi-company training 
projects sponsored by intermediary organizations, such as statewide 
business and industry associations, labor organizations, community colleges 
and universities.  Small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, 
benefit from the multi-company training efforts.  <P>

<h4>
The Office of Minority Business Development (OMBD) serves to advocate for and enhance the growth, organizational links and policy impacts of Illinois' minority entrepreneurs. Minorities are, as defined by state law, persons of African-American, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian backgrounds. These business owners are one of Illinois' important and growing business segments and are assisted by the Office through referral counseling resources for technical, management and financial assistance programs and by promotion of greater understanding and action on minority business issues. There are two minority business advocates including a bi-lingual liaison to the Hispanic business community, serving minority business populations and organizations throughout the state.<p> 

OMBD program activities include the implementation of various advocacy functions of representation and education on legislative matters, development of policy and inter-governmental advocacy activities and assistance with minority business and organizational self-help skills. The office also offers specific programs for the development of local minority business councils, mentor-proteg matches and linkages of potential and established minority entrepreneurs to the Small Business Development Center Network. Minority business state contracting interests and goals are represented on the Illinois Business Enterprise Program for Minorities, Females and Persons with Disabilities.<p> 

For more information on OMBD programs call 312/814-3540 or 312/814-2331.<p>

<h3>MESSAGE FROM GOV. JIM EDGAR...</h3>

Everyday throughout Illinois, citizens are working voluntarily to improve the communities in which they live.  In doing so, they are combining talents and forming effective partnerships with local governments, businesses, labor, voluntary organizations and individual citizens.<p>

Our Home Town Awards Program, in its fifteenth year, honors communities and volunteers which have planned and implemented successful projects to meet community needs.<p>

The following information tells more about the programs and how to apply for a Home Town Award.<p>

I am proud of our Illinois hometowns.  I encourage you to participate in this year's Home Town Award Program.<p>

<hr>
<h3>GOVERNOR'S HOME TOWN AWARDS PROGRAM</h3>

In many Illinois communities, citizens have been organizing to contribute to their town's economic progress and quality of life.  By taking the initiative on a project, mobilizing volunteers and raising funds, they have successfully addressed local needs in a time of reduced public resources.  These volunteer projects often have the collective involvement of many such as local governments, business and industry, private, civic and community based organizations and individuals that donate time, materials, funds and expertise.<p>

<hr>
<h3>WHY HOME TOWN AWARDS?</h3>

The Governor's Home Town Awards Program gives formal recognition to outstanding community volunteer projects.  This program is administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs in close cooperation with the Lieutenant Governor's Office.<p>

The application can be submitted by a variety of community representatives such as a local government, a community organization, a local chamber of commerce, a community action agency, an area agency on aging, a local job training agency, etc. Applications are submitted between November and February.<p>

Once the department receives the completed application, the projects will be divided into population categories.  Impartial teams of judges will then evaluate the projects.<p>

The Governor's Home Town Awards Banquet held in June will recognize the winners in each program category, along with the grand prize Governor's Cup winner.<p>

<hr>

<H3>Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)</H3>

The federally-funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program is a 
statewide local delivery system designed to provide job training for 
economically-disadvantaged  adults, older adults and youths, workers 
dislocated from their jobs due to plant closings or mass layoffs, and 
others who face serious barriers to employment.  The program is 
administered in Illinois by the Department of Commerce and Community 
Affairs (DCCA) through a network of 26 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) around 
the state.  Each SDA is overseen by a Private Industry Council of local 
business leaders and public officials, who work together to develop plans 
and programs to meet the needs of local businesses and the local labor 
market.<P>


<h3>Program Descriptions</h3>

<strong>Title 2A - Year Round Adult Program</strong> - This program prepares adults for participation in the labor force by increasing their occupational and educational skills, resulting in improved long-term employability, increased employment and earnings, and reduced welfare dependency.  <p>

<strong>Title 2B - Summer Youth Program</strong> - This program enhances the basic educational skills of youth, encourages school completion or enrollment in supplementary or alternative school programs, provides eligible youth with exposure to the world of work, and enhances their citizenship skills.<p>

<strong>Title 2C - Year Round Youth Program </strong>- This program improves the long-term employability of youth, enhances their educational, occupational, and citizenship skills, encourages school completion or enrollment in alternative school programs, increases their employment and earnings, reduces welfare dependency, and assists youth in addressing problems that impair their ability to make successful transitions from school to work, apprenticeship, the military, or postsecondary education and training.<p>

<strong>Title 3 - Dislocated Worker Program</strong> - This program assists eligible workers who are dislocated due to plant or facility closings, layoffs, or technological changes in their occupation or industry.  Available services include counseling, vocational assessment, case management, occupational training, basic and remedial education, on-the-job training, job search assistance, and placement.<p>

<strong>Illinois Employment & Training Centers (IETCs)</strong> -  An IETC (formerly known as a One-Stop Career Center) is a location where the public can easily access a broad array of employment, training and related services.  One or more IETCs will be located in each of Illinois' 26 service delivery areas designated under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  Some services will be available through satellite offices and through computer technology in areas of the state where location of an IETC is not practical.  Consolidation of program access will be key.  At a minimum, IETCs will consolidate access to unemployment insurance, job service and veterans employment programs administered by the Department of Employment Security and the JTPA programs described above and administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Other programs may also be consolidated including programs offered by:  the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department on Aging and the Department of Rehabilitation Services.  Community  Colleges will also be involved.  Some services will be "self-accessed" through computers.  Access to informational services will also be extended to other sites through LANs and use of Internet.<p>

<strong><em>What is an Illinois Employment & Training Center (IETC)?</em></strong>  An IETC (formerly known as a One-Stop Career Center) is an office where the public can easily access a broad array of employment, training and related services.  One or more IETCs will be located in each of Illinois' 26 service delivery areas designated under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  Some services will be available through satellite offices and through computer technology in areas of the state where location of an IETC is not practical.<p>

<strong><em>Who will be served by IETCs?</em></strong>  Centers will provide services to:  (1) dislocated workers, (2) the economically disadvantaged, (3) unemployment insurance claimants, (4) unemployed workers, (5) employed workers wishing to find new jobs, (6) new entrants to the labor force, (7) students, (8) schools and (9) employers.<p>

<strong><em>What services will be available to workers?</em></strong>  Centers will provide informational services to everyone.  Services that will be available to the public include:  labor market information, career information, information and referral to community services, eligibility screening for state and federal training programs, qualitative information about alternative training providers, referral to education and training programs, registration with the Illinois Job Service and registration for unemployment insurance.  Additional services will be available to workers determined to be eligible for them under various categorical programs (e.g., JTPA).  More intensive services will include:  vocational testing, career counseling and planning, ongoing case management, intensive job search assistance and training and financial assistance for training.<p>

<strong><em>What services will be available for employers?</em> </strong> Employers can use the local IETC to:  access a "skills bank" of workers looking for jobs, learn about sources of financial assistance to support worker training, access useful business information products and have job applicants prescreened to meet their requirements.<p>

<strong><em>What services will be available to students and schools? </em></strong>  IETCs will be a source of the latest labor market information (LMI) for schools, libraries and students.  LMI products will be available on-site and will be distributed by the IETC in hard copy and via computer (e.g., distribution of software and LANs).  IETCs will also be a source of in-service training for career counseling personnel regarding the use of LMI products.  Students and dropouts may also use the IETC to obtain career counseling and to learn about "second chance" education programs.<p>

<strong>Consolidation of program access will be key.</strong>  At a minimum, IETCs will consolidate access to programs available through the Department of Employment Security (IDES) and programs administered through the  Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Programs to be consolidated include:  unemployment insurance, the Illinois job service, veterans employment programs, JTPA dislocated worker programs, JTPA youth and adult programs and LMI services.   Other programs may also be consolidated including programs offered by:  the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department on Aging and the Department of Rehabilitation Services.<p>

<strong>Technology will also be key.</strong>  Some services will be "self-accessed" through computers.  Access to informational services will also be extended to other sites through LANs and use of Internet.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Emergency Shelter Grants Program</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<p>

The Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESGP) is designed to help improve the quality of existing emergency shelters for the homeless, to help make available additional emergency shelters, to help meet the cost of operating emergency shelters and to provide certain essential social services to homeless individuals in order to provide access to not only safe and sanitary shelter, but also to the supportive services and other kinds of assistance needed to improve their situations.  The program is also intended to restrict the increase of homelessness through the funding of preventive programs and activities.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Eligible Applicants</h3>

Under this program, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has been authorized by Congress to provide these funds.  As a result, the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) anticipates a funding allocation which will be made available to units of general local government on behalf of not-for-profit organizations providing homeless assistance, and/or directly to not-for-profit organizations located outside the corporate limits of the City of Chicago and Cook County.  A not-for-profit organization is defined as a secular or religious organization described in Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, making it exempt from taxation, assuring it has an accounting system and voluntary governing board, and practices non-discrimination in the provision of services.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Eligible Activities</h3>

Emergency Shelter Grants Program funds may be used to implement one or more of the following activities:<p>

<strong>Rehabilitation, renovation or conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters</strong> - These activities can include, but are not limited to, expenses for labor, materials, tools and other associated costs of building improvements such as the replacement of principal fixtures, installation of security or handicapped access devices, and alterations designed to improve energy efficiency.<p>

<strong>New or expanded essential services</strong> - These activities must be provided in connection with such direct services by the shelter as job training, substance abuse counseling, health and educational services, or mileage expenses related to the provision of shelter services.<p>

<strong>Homeless Prevention</strong> - These activities or programs must be designed to prevent the incidence of homelessness, such as short-term subsidies to defray rent and utility arrearages  for families that have received eviction or utility termination notices, security deposits or first month's rent, or other innovative programs an activities designed to prevent homelessness.<p>

<strong>Operation or maintenance expenses directly related to the operation of the shelter</strong> - These activities can include costs for the purchase of shelter supplies, equipment and furnishings, insurance premiums, utility payments, and overall maintenance costs such as minor repairs or painting.  Additionally, a small percentage of ESGP funds may be used to pay staff costs related to the operation of the emergency shelter.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Available Funding</h3>

All proposals received will undergo a highly-competitive review.  Priority for funding will be given to projects which clearly complement existing homeless activities, demonstrate the ability to utilize program funds immediately and address a clear need for funds.  The minimum grant award will be $10,000, the maximum grant award will be $75,000.  Proposals will be funded based upon negotiations and will be subject to the availability of funds for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  It should be noted that each recipient of grant funds must supplement ESGP funds, or demonstrate an attempt to supplement funds, with an equal amount of funds from other sources.<p>

<a name="Program Description"><hr></a>
<p>
The Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) is designed to help low income residents save fuel and money, while increasing the comfort of their homes.<p>

The IHWAP is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The program is administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Weatherization services are provided by local community action or not-for-profit agencies throughout the state.  The local agency that provides weatherization services in your area is listed on the back of this brochure.  By contacting the agency provider in your area, you can apply for weatherization services.<p>

Although most dwellings waste energy, different types of houses and apartments have different energy problems.  Depending on the circumstances and condition of your dwelling, some of the following weatherization work may be done:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Sealing cracks with weatherstrip and caulk;<p>
<li>Insulating attics and walls;<p>
<li>Repairing windows and doors; and<p>
<li>Replacing windows.<p>
</ul>

Weatherization services include having an experienced heating contractor examine your heating system.  This contractor will make sure the heating system is safe and in good working order.  Work on your furnace may include one or more of the following:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Clean and tune;<p>
<li>Repair;<p>
<li>Retrofit; or<p>
<li>In some cases, Replacement of the unit.<p>
</ul>

<a name="How Does the Program Work"><hr></a>
<h3>How Does The Program Work?</h3>

1. A person contacts the appropriate local agency listed below.<p>

2. The agency determines if the household is income eligible and notifies them within 30 days after all the required documentation has been received.<p>

3. If the household is eligible, one of the trained agency staff will assess the home and conduct an energy audit (survey) that will determine what work can be done to save the most energy.<p>

4. The work to be done on your home will be scheduled and the agency will contact you to arrange a time for the weatherization work to begin.<p>

5. Experienced workers using the work order generated from a computerized audit will apply the appropriate materials to your home.<p>

6. The home is inspected to make sure the work is complete and correct.<p>

<a name="Who is Eligible?"><hr></a>
<h3>Who Is Eligible?</h3>


Eligibility is determined by family size and household income in accordance with federal guidelines.  Weatherization services are free to households that:<p>

1. Are eligible for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)<p>

2. Have an occupant receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Aid to Aged Blind and Disabled (AABD); or<p>

(For a household with more than four, add $3,275 for each additional person.)<p>

Renters may be assisted if they are eligible and the landlord agrees to the program terms. A fifty percent (50%) landlord contribution for weatherization work is required for rental property.<p>

<a name="How Do I Apply?"><hr></a>
<h3>How Do I Apply?</h3>

Use the following list to find the local agency that serves your area.  The county names are listed under each agency name to assist you in locating the correct one.  When you apply, take proof of you household's income and proof of mortage/home ownership.  If you rent, the agency will give you a form for your landlord to sign.<p>

Do not delay applying for weatherization assistance until the cold weather arrives.  Putting it off could mean not getting served.  Funding is limited and the program operates on a "first-come, first-serve" basis.<p>

<a name="Program Description"><hr></a>
<p>
For many Illinois households, energy costs place a severe and continuing stress on the family's budget.  In some instances, the household is forced to make painful decisions regarding which bills to pay and which necessities to survive without.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is designed to assist eligible low-income households pay for winter energy services.  LIHEAP will provide a one-time benefit to eligible households to be used for energy bills.  The amount of payment is determined by income, household size, fuel type, and geographic location.<p>

An overdue bill or cut-off notice is not required.  You do not have to own your home or pay energy bills directly to be eligible for assistance.  Your source of fuel does not have to be natural gas or electricity in order to receive assistance.<p>

Emergency Assistance may be available if your household is disconnected from an energy source needed for heating and/or a delivered-fuel supplier has refused to deliver and the tank contains 10% or less.<p>

Assistance for reconnection will only be provided to households that have made a good faith effort to maintain their energy services, or can pay a portion of the amount owed for reconnection.<p>

<a name="How Does It Work?"><hr></a>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

<h4>First Step: Application</h4>

Use the listing in this brochure to find the local agency that serves your area.  Contact the agency and tell them you want to apply for the Energy Program.  If you are home-bound, special accommodations can be made to assist you in applying. <p>

The worker who takes your application will help you to understand:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>The program requirements;<p>
<li>The type of assistance available; and<p>
<li>Your rights under the program.<p>
</ul>

When you apply for assistance bring the following with you:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Proof of gross income from all household members for the 30-day period prior to application date;<p>
<li>A copy of your current heat and electric bills (if you pay for your home energy directly);<p>
<li>Proof of social security numbers of all household members;<p>
<li>If a member of your household receives AFDC, you must bring their "Medical Eligibility Card"; and<p>
<li>If you rent, bring proof of your rental agreement that must state your monthly rent amount.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Second Step: Notification</h4>

The agency will determine if you are eligible based on the information provided.  You will be notified of eligibility status within 30 days.  If you are eligible, you will be informed of the amount of assistance you can receive.<p>

The agency will also notify your energy provider of your participation in the program if you have an energy bill.<p>

<h4>Third Step: Payment</h4>

If you are eligible, the local agency will make the appropriate payment to your energy provider(s) on your behalf or, in some cases, directly to you.<p>


<a name="Who is eligible?"><hr></a>
<h3>Who Is Eligible?</h3>

You may be eligible to receive assistance under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program if your household's combined income is at or below the following levels shown on the chart below.  If you rent, and your heat and/or electric is included in the rent, then your rent must be greater than 30% of your income in order to be eligible to receive benefits.<p>

<h4>1. Ethanol Powered State of Illinois Car Fleet</h4>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), formerly the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR), is part of an extensive test and demonstration program ethanol-powered, flexible-fuel and variable fuel vehicles incorporated into the state fleet.  The Illinois Department of Central Management Services (CMS) is responsible for operating and maintaining the state fleet.  The state E-85 fleet is being operated and maintained through CMS facilities in Springfield and throughout the state.<p>

In 1992, General Motors produced fifty (50) Chevrolet Luminas optimized for ethanol fuel.  This fuel is composed of 85% denatured ethanol and 15 % light hydrocarbon, to ensure easy starting.  The petroleum denaturant used by the fuel producer (Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in Peoria, Illinois), commonly called "natural gasoline" (a blend of c4-c6 hydrocarbons), can be used for the light hydrocarbons fraction.  The final blend, then, is 80% anhydrous ethanol and 20% natural gasoline.  This fuel is seasonally blended (down to 70% ethanol/30% natural gasoline in winter) to enhance cold weather starting.<p>

Illinois, Wisconsin and the federal government purchased the original 50 E-85 GM vehicles in late April 1992 at a cost $2000 more each than the standard gasoline versions.  The original 12 E-85 Luminas arrived in Springfield in July 1992.<p>

In the 1993 model year, the state purchased 55 additional E-85 Luminas.  Included in this order were vehicles purchased by Illinois State University, Southern Illinois University and the cities of Bloomington, Champaign, Chicago, Decatur, Normal and Peoria through a joint-purchasing agreement with the state.  Another 14 ethanol Luminas were purchased by the University of Illinois (5 cars) and private fleets such as the Illinois Corn Growers, DeKalb Genetics and Growmark, incorporated, through their Country Companies Leasing division.  The 1993 E-85 Lumina was priced the same as the gasoline version.<p>

In March 1994, the State of Illinois and General Services Administration (GSA) each purchased 25 of first 50 Flexible Fuel 1994 Ford Tauruses manufactured and warranted for use with E-85 fuel.  These "Ethanol-Ready" Tauruses were built by Ford Motor Company at their South Chicago Assembly Plant and are covered by a full factory warranty.  This is significant in that it is the first Illinois-made vehicle operating on Illinois-produced ethanol made from Illinois corn.  The state purchased an additional 71 Flexible Fuel Tauruses in 1995 for use in the state fleet and several state agencies.<p>

Beginning in 1996, the E-85 version of the Flexible Fuel Ford Taurus will be fully optimized for E-85 fuel.  The 1994 and 1995 versions were actually optimized for M-85 fuel, but Ford sold a limited number each year that were fully warranted for the use of E-85.  Illinois has ordered 100 of the 1996 Flexible Fuel Tauruses which will be produced this month at Ford's South Chicago Assembly Plant.<p>

A total of 13 refueling facilities are currently located throughout the state.  They are located at Argonne National Laboratory (southwest suburbs of Chicago), Bloomington/Normal (private), Carbondale, Champaign, Chicago, Collinsville, Decatur, DeKalb (private ), 2 sites in Peoria and 2 sites in Springfield.  The first commercial E-85 station opened in 1995 at the FS - Fuel 24 facility in Dwight, Illinois.  Dwight is situated about half way between Springfield and Chicago at the 220 Exit on Interstate 55.<p>

In mixed city and highway driving, the E-85 Luminas get about 20 miles per gallon on the ethanol fuel, which is slightly better than expected.  The E-85 Ford Taurus cars have been getting about 23 miles per gallon on E-85 fuel (do, in part, to a lower gear ratio), but do not have the acceleration or performance characteristics of the Chevrolet Luminas.  There have no significant mechanical problems with the any of the E-85 vehicles, including the 1992 Luminas, some of which have already been driven over 100,000 miles.  In November 1995, GM inspected, removed and analyzed key engine and fuel system components in four of the highest mileage 1992 Luminas.  Although the final report is not yet available, the initial reaction from GM was that they were extremely pleased with the results and that several of the key components showed significantly less wear in the ethanol vehicles that in conventional gasoline vehicles.<p>

Including the federal fleet, over 340 E-85 vehicles are currently in operation in the state.  GSA purchased 250 E-85 vehicles in the 1995 model year and has located 125 of these vehicles in the Chicago area.  Between state and federal purchase of E-85 vehicles in 1996, the number of E-85 vehicles opening in Illinois is expected to increase dramatically.<p>

In May 1995, General Motors announced that, beginning in the 1997 model year, all Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma light-duty pick-up trucks equipped with the 2.2 liter 4 cylinder engine will be flexible fuel vehicles optimized for E-85 fuel.  Recently, however, a "glitch" was discovered in the  2.2 liter engine (both in the gasoline and E-85 versions) that has delayed the introduction of the flexible fuel pick-up trucks until the 1998 model year.  The state of Illinois is currently testing three of these pre-production vehicles for GM in the CMS messenger mail vehicle fleet.  Similar vehicles are also being tested in Minnesota, Texas, Florida, and Colorado.<p>

<h4><a href="truck.htm"> 2. Ethanol-Powered Heavy Truck Fleet Program</a></h4>

Illinois, through DCCA, is working with the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) on a three year test and demonstration program for ethanol fuel in heavy duty, over-the-road trucks.<p>

The ethanol truck fleet is owned and operated by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of Decatur.  ADM purchased four (4) new White-GMC tractors powered by the DDC 6V-92TA dedicated ethanol engines and one (1) new White-GMC tractor using the conventional DDC 6V-92 diesel engine.<p>

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is providing about $368,000 in funding for the program.  DCCA is providing additional funding and personnel time towards the project.<p>

The four ethanol trucks are being used to carry liquefied carbon dioxide on routes that allow the trucks to return to the plant every night.  The engines are accumulating high number of usage hours and high mileage since they will be driven on interstate highways.  Over 1,000,000 miles have been accumulated on the four ethanol trucks to date.<p>

Overall, the operation of the four ethanol trucks has been comparable, or slightly better than, a comparable diesel equipped truck.  However, a few major mechanical problems have  occurred with the ADM ethanol trucks, especially with increasing mileage.  Three of the engines have been partially rebuilt with cylinder kits, two cylinder heads have been replaced, and fuel injector life is still considered a problem.  On a positive note, through, this program has led to the development of several new parts, such as titanium plunger injectors, that are now standard on all of their engines.<p>

The ethanol engine from ADM unit #92002 was removed and was shipped to Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas for transient emissions tests.  Emissions testing, and an engine tear-down and wear analysis, has just been completed.  This information will provide us with an idea as to the effects of engine degradation on emissions in ethanol fueled engines.  Preliminary results indicate that the ethanol engine showed minimal signs of wear and its' emissions, even after 300,000 miles of actual use were very low.<p>

DCCA has received support from Pekin Energy Company, Detroit Diesel Corporation, the Iowa Energy Office, the National Corn Growers, the Illinois Corn Growers and the Illinois Corn Marketing Board for this program.<p>


<a name="#3"><hr></a>
<h4><a href="bus.htm"> 3. Peoria Bus Demonstration Project</a></h4>

The Greater Peoria Mass Transit District (GPMTD) is conducting a comprehensive study on the sue of dedicated ethanol-powered bus engines.  Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) has developed a heavy-duty engine (Model 6V-92TA) which can run on 200 proof denatured ethanol.  This six cylinder, vee-configuration engine that produces 253 horsepower.  The engine was developed based on the design of the methanol engine which has been tested and demonstrated extensively in California and New York.  The changes of the engines include modifying the electronic control system, fuel injectors and glow plugs.<p>

Fourteen (14) buses are being operated on ethanol in Peoria where they have accumulated well over 1,000,000 miles total.  The emissions from these engines are being extensively monitored.  The USDOE/University of West Virginia Transportable Emissions Testing Center started testing the ethanol and several of Peoria's diesel buses in August 1992 for emission levels.  Emissions testing continues with the lab being in Peoria at least once a year.<p>

The performance of the engines is being continuously monitored and oil testing and wear evaluations are being performed.  Surveys of driver, riders and non-riders have been taken to determine driveability of the buses and public opinion of the project.  This is the largest ethanol bus demonstration project in the country and currently the only one using these new, dedicated ethanol engines.  DCCA has a contract with DDC to provide an additional on-site service and maintenance for the buses.<p>

DCCA worked with GPMTD, Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC), Pekin Energy Company, and Growmark to develop a new ethanol fuel formulation for the ethanol buses that has reduced the cost of operation.  The new fuel is composed of 93% anhydrous ethanol, 5% anhydrous methanol (a qualified special fuel) and 2% kerosene (denaturant).  This formulation enables Growmark, the company delivering the fuel, to take advantage of the Ethanol Blender's Tax Credit and pass most of the Savings on to GPMTD.  The first shipment of E-93 fuel was delivered in march 1994.  Operational cost have been reduced from $0.58 per mile to about $0.35 per mile as a result of this.  The DDC engineers working on this projected approved the use of this fuel in the 6V-92TA ethanol engines being used in Peoria.<p>

DCCA has been working with, and providing information to, the Los Angeles mass transit districts on converting their methanol buses to ethanol fuel.  The methanol buses get about 1.1 miles per gallon opposed to the 2.1 miles per gallon for the ethanol buses.  Additionally, application of the Tax Credit has brought the price of ethanol down to the point where it can readily compete with methanol.  L.A. has converted 70 buses to ethanol and is considering converting the entire 333 bus methanol fleet to ethanol.  Both buses use the DDC 6V-92TA engine, so the engines can be converted to ethanol by simply reprogramming the DDEC II unit.<p>

The total project costs for Peoria are over $4 million with the Urban mass Transit Administration providing over $2 million.  Other contributing participants include the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Illinois Department of Commerce and community Affairs (formerly ENR), Pekin Energy Company, Detroit Diesel Corporation, the Illinois Corn Marketing Board, the Iowa corn Promotion Board, Illinois Central College and the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District.<p>

<h4>4. Ethanol Fuel-Cell Research Project</h4>

This is a research project aimed at the development, testing and demonstration of an ethanol fuel cell/battery bus in the Chicago area.  A fuel cell is a device with no moving parts that electrochemically generates electricity from hydrogen gas (derived from a base fuel through a chemical reformer) and oxygen gas.  A fuel cell bus powered by  methanol has already been developed by this project is designed to develop and test a reformer which will convert ethanol to hydrogen gas to be used in the fuel cell to produce electricity.  This new ethanol reformer will be installed and tested in a test-bed bus operated by PACE and located in the Chicago area.  The fuel cell bus is expected to be operating in Chicago by late 1997.<p>

The advantages of this system are obvious.  The primary source of fuel is low-grade ethanol, a readily renewable fuel derived from corn.  low-grade (150-170 proof) ethanol can be used since water is necessary for the reforming process.  Also, the low-grade ethanol is significantly less expensive than using gasoline quality, 200 proof ethanol.  The use of a reformer greatly reduces emissions and the use of electricity to power the bus means a very quiet bus with no additional emissions to the atmosphere.<p>

The USDOE and UMTA have already contributed over $6 million for the development of the methanol fuel cell/battery bus.  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (former ENR has provided $325,000 to match with USDOE funds) to develop the ethanol reformer and will be a full partner in the project.  Additional funds will be needed after the reformer is fully developed scaled-up to a commercial size.<p>

USDOE has selected the consulting firm of A.D. Little as the subcontractor that will develop the reformer for the program.  A.D. Little successfully completed the feasibility study on the ethanol reformer, the 25kw laboratory scale-reformer, and along with Allied Chemical, has scaling-up the reformer for actual use in the fuel cell bus.<p>

<h4>5. Advanced Membrane Technology Project</h4>

Work on the initial University of Illinois continuous Reactor System has been successfully completed.  Testing of the laboratory-scale system proved so successful that a commercial-scale membrane reactor was installed and is being tested at Pekin Energy Company in Pekin, Illinois.<p>

Briefly, the membrane reactor system at Pekin Energy Company is being used in the saccharification stage of ethanol production.  Saccharification normally takes 20 to 21 hours to complete in a batch tank.  The membrane reactor selectively and continuously separates desired products (glucose and water) out of the system more efficiently than by conventional methods, thereby effectively increasing the rate of production.  The remaining starch and enzymes is retained to continue the saccharification process.  Further, the membrane reactor system is modular in design, and can be fitted to any production capacity or flow rate required by adding additional units.<p>

The Continuous Membrane Reactor at Pekin Energy has proven so successful that plans for a Continuous Membrane Fermenter (CMF) are being made.  This new membrane system will use advanced high-efficieny ceramic membranes to continuously remove ethanol from the fermentation process to increase production efficiency and reduce production costs.<p>

The Great Lakes REgional Biomass Energy Program awarded a $50,000 grant to the U of I for this project.  DCCA is contributing $220,000 to this new project with funds form the Illinois Alternative Energy Bond Fund.<p>

<a name="#6"><hr></a>
<h4>6. The Hydrated Ethanol Heavy Engine Development Project</h4>

This study is designed to reduce the cost of operation of ethanol fuel heavy-duty engines used in large trucks and urban transit buses by using less expensive, lower proof (5% water content) hydrated ethanol.<p>

Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) and the University of Illinois (U of I) will each perform endurance tests and monitor emissions on the heavy engines.  The engine being used for this study is the ethanol version of the DDC 6V-92TA engine.  DDC has successfully run a 100 hour performance test and monitor emissions using 190 proof ethanol fuel.  The U of I is currently performing a 500 hour endurance test and to optimize the engine emissions using the 190 proof ethanol fuel.<p>

<a name="#7"><hr></a>
<h4>7. The National Ethanol Production Research Facility</h4>

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded $500,000 to Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for a feasibility study to assess the need for a major ethanol production research facility that would be located in Illinois.<p>

Phase One of the feasibility study includes: Part 1 - A study identifying and outlining all of the recently completed and on-going ethanol research throughout the world completed by Western Reserve Associates, Part 2 - A study performed by Bryan & Bryan, Inc. that identified the top ten (10) research priority areas with the input of the ethanol industry, and Part 3 - A comprehensive evaluation of the ten (10) research priority areas, currently being performed by Stanley Consultants of Iowa.<p>

Phase Two of the project is the physical design and cost analysis for the actual research pilot plant facility.  This phase is currently underway and was awarded to Fluor Daniel of Chicago.<p>

Phase Three of the feasibility study will be the development of a business plan for the facility.<p>

If the facility study is positive and the facility is eventually constructed, the ethanol research facility would have a production capacity of 50,000 gallon per year and would be modular in design so that several different ethanol production technologies can be tested and developed at the same time.  It is anticipated that both university and industry research project would be scheduled to use the facility.<p>

<a name="#8"><hr></a>
<h4>8. Waste Sugar to Ethanol Project</h4>

DCCA staff has been working with the Illinois Department of Corrections and Vienna Correctional Center on a project that will use waste sugar form candy and soft drinks to supplement ethanol production from corn.  Vienna is currently receiving about 26,000 pounds of waste Pepsi from the local Pepsi bottler in Marion, Illinois.  The waste soft drink contains about 10% sugar and is being mixed with corn to produce ethanol.  Vienna wants to expand the research by mixing waste candy with corn to produce ethanol.<p>

This project will generate a regional directory of sugar producers/users, a regional assessment of waste sugar potential, an economic assessment of the project, and the results of actual production runs using waste sugar to produce ethanol.<p>

DCCA is providing $8,480 towards this innovative research project.  Vienna is also receiving $30,000 in funding from the Great Lakes Regional Biomass Energy Program for the project and $5,000 from the Illinois Corn Growers Association.<p>

"EnergyWise Homes of Illinois"<br>
A Service to Benefit Homeowners, Home Buyers, Builders and Lenders
</h3>
<HR>

<ul type=square>
<li>Reduce utility bill expenditures
<li>Enjoy a more comfortable home
<li>Finance energy improvements through savings
<li>Help sell your home
<li>Qualify for first or larger mortgage
</ul>

<h3>What is EnergyWise Homes of Illinois?</h3>

EnergyWise Homes of Illinois is a Home Energy Rating System (HERS) that is a voluntary, market driven program developed by a coalition of housing industry professionals, lenders, utilities and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  The goal is to promote residential energy efficiency thereby making all housing more affordable.  The HERS assigns a numerical rating to existing houses or planned construction.<p>

The rating a house achieves results from a comparison to the Model Energy Code (MEC).  That value is placed on a scale of 0 to 100 with a score of 80 representing the MEC house and 100 being most energy-efficient.  The rating system also categorizes houses according to a star system (five stars being the most efficient, one star the least efficient).  Another important feature of the rating system is to provide an estimate of utility costs and provide recommendations for energy improvements.<p>

<h3>How is Energy Efficiency Determined?</h3>

The level of energy efficiency is determined by on-site inspections and testing of three major components of construction characteristics:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Building materials, insulation levels, window types<p>
<li>Efficiency levels of the heating, cooling and water heating equipment<p>
<li>Infiltration levels<p>
</ul>

Proposed construction is rated from plans.<p>

The HERS may be used by:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Homeowners or contractors to determine the cost-effectiveness of various energy-efficient measures<p>
<li>Builders or prospective homebuyers to determine annual energy costs for a new home<p>
<li>Lenders to verify energy costs fro EnergyEdge mortgages.<p>
</ul>

<h3>A Standard Mortgage vs. the Energy Edge Mortgage</h3>

If a buyer has:<p>
<pre>
* Monthly income of $2,500
* Down payment of 10%
* Mortgage rate of 8.5% 30 year term
</pre>

Standard Mortgage:<p>
<pre>
* Maximum monthly payment at 28% debt-to-income-ratios:     $700
* Maximum mortgage (90% appraised value):                $82,350
* Maximum house price                                    $91,500
</pre>

EnergyEdge Mortgage<p>
<pre>
* Maximum monthly payment at 30% debt-to-income-ratio:      $700
* Maximum mortgage (90% appraised value):                $88,200
* Maximum house price                                    $98,000

<h3>Can an Energy Rating Help Homeowners Obtain a Mortgage?</h3>

Homes that rate as energy efficient are eligible for an EnergyEdge mortgage which is a special loan adjustment that allows a purchaser to stretch their debt-to-income ratio.  The premise is that an efficient home will require less for utilities thereby freeing more money for mortgage payments.  The homeowner wins.  An Energy Improvement Mortgage allows owner of existing homes to include the cost of energy improvements in the mortgage.  The homeowner wins again.  These mortgages allow more people to get larger or more expensive homes while freeing up more cash to pay off the loan.<p>

<h3>How Can This Rating Help the Homeowner?</h3>

The rating a home achieves will allow for comparisons between structures and allow consumers to make informed decisions regarding energy costs associated with construction.  For the first time, a consumer will have access to energy cost savings data that supports the additional costs associated with energy-efficient building construction techniques.<p>

The rating will help consumer understand the overall energy costs associated with their most valuable asset, their home.  Letting people know where their energy dollars are being spent can help them make financial decisions regarding energy conservation products during construction and energy retrofit options in existing homes.<p>

<h3>What Will the Rater Do at my House?</h3>

A rater will make a site visit to obtain the data necessary to do the calculations. (New construction can be evaluated in the plan stage.)  A rater will measure the house, determine types, sizes and orientations of windows and doors, record information on the types and sizes of heating and cooling equipment and assess  infiltration rates by conducting a "blower door" test.<p>

The information gathered at the site is processed and computer generated reports and rating are produced.  The rating can be sued by owners or builders to help sell the property and the reports are used by owners and lenders to determine cost effective ways to improve the house.<p>

<h3>Take Action</h3>

Homes that are energy-efficient are more affordable, safer and more comfortable to live in, making homeowners happier people.<p>

To take advantage of these benefits, contact EnergyWise Homes of Illinois at the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs 217/785-2007; TDD 217/785-0211.<p>

<h3 align=center>Illinois Used Tire Recovery Program</h3>
<HR>

Illinois citizens discard 10 to 12 million scrap tires every year, which equates to almost one scrap tire generated per person.<p>

Discarded used and waste tires pose a serious health and environmental threat for three main reasons:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Scrap tires take up valuable landfill space;<p>
<li>Open burning of scrap tire piles create toxic oils and hazardous air emission problems;<p>
<li>Disease-carrying vermin and mosquitoes thrive in water that accumulates in tires.<p>
</ul>

<img src="../../graph/enr/tires.jpg" width=241 height=170 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
As of July 1, 1992, new regulations were established regarding scrap tires in Illinois.  They require:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>tire retailers to collect a $1 tire fee from their customers;<p>
<li>tire retailers to accept from customers one tire for every new tire sold;<p>
<li>all tire haulers who transport scrap tires within Illinois be registered with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA);<p>
<li>individuals who have over 50 scrap tires accumulated on their property to notify the IEPA.<p>
</ul>

The money generated by the $1 tire fee is used by the following agencies:<p>

<h4>Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs</h4>

The primary goal of the department's Used Tire Recovery Program is to develop self-sustaining markets for Illinois scarp tires.  The program offers financial incentives for projects which reuse, recycle or recover energy from scrap tires.  Examples of projects funded by the programs are:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>The program has provided funding to Waste Recovery - Illinois for the purchase of equipment to process scrap tires into tire-derived fuel.  The company sells the fuel to power generating facilities.  Waste Recovery - Illinois has the capacity to process 15 million tires annually at their two Illinois locations.  Illinois Power Company received funds to purchase tire-derived fuel handling and feeding equipment at their Baldwin power plant.  The utility is capable of utilizing 7.5 million tires annually.  Tests have shown that scrap tires can improve air emissions when burned with Illinois coal.<p>

<li>The program has funded Pace-Mat, Inc. a tire recycling company, to purchase equipment to manufacture rubber mats.  Mats are made from recycled scrap tire-derived crumb rubber.  At full production, the facility will recycle 665,000 scrap tires annually.<p>

<li>The program has funded 150 schools, park districts and day-care facilities to purchase scrap tire-derived loose-fill tire chips for playground cover.  The department also has funded projects to recycle rubber into athletic fields, horse arenas and railroad crossings.<p>

<li>The program awarded funds to Illinois Cement Company to purchase a feeding system to introduce whole tire-derived fuel into their cement kiln.  Only true scrap tires which cannot be recycled at Lakin General's part stamping operation in Chicago will be utilized as fuel by Illinois Cement Company.  Illinois Cement will use over one million tires annually.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Illinois Environmental Protection Agency</h4>
<ul type=square>
<li>The agency sponsors individual and county-wide waste tire cleanups through the consensual Removal Agreement Program.  In the first five years of the program, 775 cleanups have been completed removing five million tires form open dumps.  The tires were used as tire-derived fuel.<p>
<li>The agency has finished cleanup of the state's largest scrap tire pile near Kankakee, which contained 650,000 tires.  The tires were shipped to a grain processing facility and used as tire-derived fuel.<p>
<li>The agency continually enforces and regulates scrap tire hauling, storage and processing sites to ensure that tires are not illegally dumped.  Individuals can call IEPA at 217/785-8604; TDD 217/782-9143 for information about the program.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Illinois Department of Public Health</h4>

The department uses its funds for surveillance of the Asian tiger mosquito and the LaCrosse and St. Louis encephalitis virus.  The department also gives grants to local health departments for surveillance and control of the Asian tiger mosquito and other vectors.<p>

<h4>Illinois Natural History Survey</h4>


Funds are provided to study tire-breeding mosquitoes and the diseases they spread.<p>

Tires are designed and manufactured to provide thousands of miles of service.  With proper maintenance, tires will wear longer, save fuel and help prevent accidents.  You can obtain the maximum amount of miles from your tires by following these suggestions:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Check the tire inflation pressure at least once a month and before long trips.  Also, do not overload the vehicle since this can lead to tire failure.<p>
<li>Inspect tires for irregular wear every month.  Proper inspection and maintenance of the wheels, brakes, shock absorbers, drive train, steering and suspension systems will also ensure good tire mileage.<p>
<li>Establish good driving habits such as avoiding fast starts, stops and turns.<p>
<li>Rotate tires every 6,000 miles to achieve more uniform wear.<p>
<li>Check tire pressures frequently during cold weather and never reduce tire pressure to increase traction or snow or ice.<p>
<li>Consult a local tire dealer for more information on proper tire care.<p>
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Introduction</h2>

The selection of a site for a new facility is among the most complex and challenging of business decision. <p> 

For one thing, the planning for a new facility requires not only consideration of virtually all of the factors that affect a business today, but also calls for taking into account the factors that are likely to become important during the expected life span of the facility.<p>
                
Nor is the process made any easier by the manifold social, economic and technological changes that are redrawing today's business maps and further complicating the site selection process.  Considerations that once were of prime importance have declined; new factors have emerged and become paramount.  Moreover, even after the important factors - current and future - are identified, it is the rare facility location problem that can be solved entirely through a formal analysis.  Inevitably, the final decision requires the balancing of a combination of quantifiable and non-quantifiable factors.<p>

And, to top it off, site selection is a relatively rare event at most companies, with only the largest of firms able to retain a full-time specialist to oversee its facility location tasks.  Few executives have been trained in "economic geography," and, at most companies, the manager who is given responsibility for guiding the company to this important decision never has selected a site before and most likely never will again.<p>

This guidebook has been prepared as a natural extension of what we see as an important part of our mission at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs: to assist companies in their site selection efforts involving our state.  We have helped hundreds of firms expand their facilities or settle here for nearly two decades.  With this guidebook, we hope to share some of the lessons that we have learned and to help companies become better prepared to undertake the daunting task of site selection.<p>

There are no hard-and-fast rules, no easy universally applicable answers.  Every site selection project is distinct and involves a different balance of factors and consideration - and this uniqueness is especially accentuated in today's increasingly competitive environment in which strategies call for firms to differentiate themselves from their competitors as much as possible.  Our aim is not to provide a blueprint, but rather to present a set of guidelines that firms can adapt to their own particular needs, as well as to give tips regarding common mistakes that companies should try to avoid.<p>

Some of the information here will apply to your project, some will not.  Nevertheless, by sharing what we have learned from the many site selection projects with which we have been involved, we expect this guidebook will help you be better prepared to undertake the particular task that faces you.<p>

Our guidebook is divided into four distinct sections.  First, is an executive briefing that provides an overview of past trends in site selection, as well as a discussion of issues that are likely to rise in importance in the future and that might play an important role in your location decision.<p>

The second section - and the heart of the guidebook - presents a step-by-step framework for the site selection process, an outline that you can tailor to the special needs of your particular search.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss1.jpg" width=194 height=117 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>
Section three discusses some common misconceptions about site selection and some common mistakes to avoid.<p>

And, at the very end of the guidebook, we have included a site selection "scoresheet" that you can use to help organize the evaluation of the sites under consideration.<p>

Real estate is generally a company's longest-term asset, and, as a result, identification of the most advantageous sites for new facilities can be done only by projecting future corporate needs.  Unfortunately, trying to extrapolate future physical and operational requirements directly from past experience can be a dangerous effort.  Significant changes are virtually certain - for example, many forecasters predict that much of the technology that will be used at the turn of the century is still being invented-and future plants most likely will bear little resemblance to present operations. <p>

Nevertheless, it is possible to disconcern signs of some of the more important changes ahead and some of the factors that should be kept in mind when making site selection decisions today.  A quick look at the way that site selection patterns have shifted in the past can help us get a perspective on some of the changes underway today and can help us develop a better sense of what the future is likely to hold in store.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss2.jpg" width=260 height=189 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

In the late 19th century, for example, the development of the nation's railroad network encouraged corporations to move to major financial, communications and transportation centers like Chicago and New York.  After World War II, the development of the interstate highway system and the growth of the suburbs helped convince many companies to move from central cities to suburban areas.  During the 1970s, many companies took advantage of further advances in transportation and in communication technologies to pursue lower-cost labor.  First, they moved their operations to less expensive areas of the United States.  Ultimately, many companies went so far as to move their manufacturing operations overseas.<p>

During the 1980s, site selection trends became much more complex.  consider, for example, the impact of low-wage competition from overseas that has made it very difficult for assembly type operations to remain viable in the higher-wage U.S. environment.  In response, increasing number of U.S. manufacturers abandoned emphasis on purely cost-based competition and turned to strategies that emphasize flexibility and the ability to be the first to produce new, specialized products.<p>

One result of the embrace of these strategies is that in the 1990s, a site is more attractive if it seems likely to be able to adapt to the changing needs of the future.  For example, many strategies involve application of advanced computer and telecommunications technologies, and this new level of factory automation has begun to change the nature of the labor component of much manufacturing.  In particular, the implementation of robotics, flexible manufacturing, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing technologies has greatly increased the need for highly skilled technical worker.  In turn, these changes already are beginning to have discernible effects on location requirements.  For instance, many low-wage communities might be excellent for staffing unskilled and semi-skilled positions, but finding technical and skilled talent in these areas can be more problematic.  Recruiting professionals and managers for such locales can be especially difficult.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss3.jpg" width=329 height=223 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=left>

As a result, the increasingly sophisticated us of computers at most organizations has resulted in greater site selection emphasis.  This is especially so in areas in which companies feel confident that they will be able to find the kinds of highly skilled labor and specialized maintenance support services that they expect they will need in their new plants.<p>

The growing emphasis on flexibility also has prompted an increasing number of companies to consider the quality of the educational system offered by a community under site consideration.  Today it is important that a community has not only a well trained labor force, but one that is also retrainable and that will be able to satisfy anticipated, as well as existing, labor needs.  Yet another consequence has been an increased interest in proximity to colleges and universities.  As manufacturers shift from labor-intensive production to sophisticated automation that requires almost constant education and retraining, businesses are increasingly attracted to communities in which they can find tailored training courses that can meet the growing need to bring together classroom and workplace.<p>

Generally, site selection interest is virtually certain to shift toward communities with cooperative government authorities who understand the needs of the business community and who are prepared to move quickly to help the members of its business sector respond to the fast changing world.<p>

Other factors to keep in mind during the site selection process include:<p>

<strong>ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) and JUST-IN-TIME (JIT) strategies:</strong><p>

Many suppliers are letting their most important customers plug into their inventory information systems and place orders via EDI.  The embrace of JIT by many organizations-especially those in the auto industry-has influenced location decisions by fostering closer ties and increasing the importance of customer and supplier proximity.  Every site selection effort needs to consider the importance of these developments in the company's line of business.  In particular, all firms should be sure to inquire as to whether the sites they are considering are in an area served by trucks and rail on the EDI program.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss4.jpg" width=167 height=174 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<strong>WATER:</strong><p>

Spot shortages of water occasionally arise, and it seems likely that water availability will take on increasing importance.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss5.jpg" width=134 height=172 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=left>
<strong>ELECTRIC UTILITIES:</strong><p>

It is important not to simply focus on today's electric power costs, but to look at future rates as well.  Many electric utilities have reached their peak capacities, and are likely to be forced to sharply increase their rates in order to make the necessary investments in new generating facilities.  As a result, any company considering a new site would be well advised to make at least a quick check of rate-hike requests that are pending with state regulatory commissions.  The increasing reliance on computers also has placed a greater value on reliability of electrical services.  Spikes and surges can have disastrous effects on sensitive instruments and computer controls, and the cost of power interruption can more than outweigh the payment of a slightly higher rate for a more reliable power source.<p>

<strong>DEMOGRAPHY:</strong><p>

Two career households and the aging of the workforce have had a growing impact on site selection decisions. Such families tend to be less willing to move to smaller, secondary communities in which career opportunities for either partner might be limited particularly as they get older and further into their careers.  Moreover, these households are not totally dependent on one income and are in a strong position to decline to move or to refuse to relocate.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss6.jpg" width=190 height=110 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=left>
<strong>GRIDLOCK IN FAST DEVELOPING AREAS:</strong><p>

Suburban transportation is expected to be an increasingly intractable problem, and there is a growing body of evidence that suggests the advantages enjoyed by many suburban fringe areas that do not currently suffer from traffic congestion will be shortlived.  The speed with which outlying areas become developed and congested can be astounding.<p>

<strong>TRANSPORTATION DEREGULATION:</strong><p>

Deregulation is rewriting many of the rules of site selection, with more changes likely.  The advent of multimodal services, for example, is making it increasingly advantageous to be near a site that is close to a full scale multimodal transportation hub.  There also has been a proliferation of short-line railroads, resulting in more railroads operating in the U.S. than ever before.  Deregulation also allows negotiations of individual rates and contracts, and diminishes the attractiveness of those communities that do not offer transportation services from a variety of competing vendors.<p>

<strong>TELECOMMUNICATIONS:</strong><p>

Telecommunications is playing an ever-increasing role in business operations and the availability of fiber optic lines and specialized telecom services is beginning to figure more significantly in corporate site selection decisions.<p>


<a name="Section 2"><hr></a>
<h2 align=center>Section 2: The Site Selection Process</h2>

As with any complex undertaking, advance planning is crucial to the successful search for and selection of the location for the new facility.  Some site selection efforts require more planning, others less.  This section sketches out the major steps that should be considered in formulating a site selection plan-of-action and provides a general framework that can be adapted to meet the needs of a particular situation.<p>

<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss7.jpg" alt="Step 1: Guidance from Top Management" width=190 height=46 align=left vspace=10 hspace=10>


The first step for any site selection project is to get a clear sense of the project mission from top management, and particularly to get explicit direction regarding the prime objectives for the new facility.  Is it intended:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>To address a need for more production space?<p>
<li>To facilitate movement into a new market?  Or to expand service to an existing market?<p>
<li>To escape high labor costs at existing facilities?<p>
<li>To introduce new production processes?  Or to fulfill some other strategic mission?<p>
</ul>

Top management particularly needs to make clear such parameters as the production capacity of the new facility, the markets it will serve, and the expected life span of the facility.  Moreover, these parameters must include not only the expectations regarding the facility's initial operation, but also how it is anticipated that they will change over time.  Often, there is a tendency to focus on the initial concerns and start-up projection, but the new facility must also be able to meet future needs, and it is crucial to take into account these long-term considerations as well.  Inevitably, discussion of the new facility will involve significant consideration of the company's long range strategic plans.<p>

The planning stage also should involve a general discussion of how the site selection plan is to proceed, including agreement on the general issues that will be considered, and how the preliminary and final evaluation will be made.<p>

<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss9.jpg" alt="Step 2: The Site Selection Team" width=187 height=44 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

In addition to getting input from the CEO and top management, it is also important to draw on the expertise of in-house specialists in finance, manufacturing and operations, sales and marketing, logistics and distribution and human resources.  Whether done formally or informally, it is crucial that all the company's operations be represented on a site selection team and in the site selection process.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss10.jpg" width=190 height=112 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>

The site selection team should be briefed on the project mission, and you need to make it clear that each team member is expected to identify, analyze and take into account the relevant economic and industry trends, technological changes and company plans that might have an impact on the site selection decision.  This stage in the process of planing a new facility provides an opportunity to consider a variety of new directions for the company, including: changes in manufacturing, marketing and administration; automation or introduction of a new production process; and development of new markets or ways to better serve old markets.  If top management concurs, you might well consider encouraging team members during this initial period of analysis to challenge the original top-management assumptions regarding the project.<p>


<img src="../../graph/business/ss11.jpg" width=184 height=120 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

In any case, make sure to promote discussion and interaction among the in-house experts.  For example, lack of communication can cause a company to make the mistake of basing a site selection decision on the belief that it will be hiring the same kinds of employees at the new facility as it employs at its existing plant, when, in fact, new technologies might well mean that the company will need a work force with new kinds of skills,  The existing plant might, for example, employ 200 people, 80% of whom are unskilled and 20% semi-skilled, whereas, in the new facility, the same amount of production might call for only 100 employees, 50% of whom are highly skilled, 30% of whom are semi-skilled and only 20% unskilled.  Such differences in the composition of the labor force could, for instance, have important implications regarding the kind of labor market, as well as the size and character of the community, in which the new facility might need to be located.<p>


<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss12.jpg" width=190 height=30 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

The key to a successful site selection effort is the translation of the insights of the team of in-house experts into a good set of requirements/criteria that can be used to screen site candidates and, ultimately, to choose the site for the new facility.<p>

The first thing to do is to tap the expertise of the location team and answer a number of important questions.  These might include:<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss13.jpg" width=189 height=191 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
<ul type=square>
<li><em>What size does the new facility need to be in order to handle the planned production capacity?</em>
<li><em>What kinds of raw material will be needed and how will these inbound material be delivered?  Are there key raw materials that might not be available at all locations?</em>  You might want to sit down with existing suppliers, tell them that you are considering opening a new plant, and ask them which markets they service.
<li><em>What will it need in the way of electrical power? Water? Gas? Telecom?</em>
<li><em>What about environment concerns and constraints?  Will you need to dispose of waste water into a municipal sewer system that might require pre-treatment?  Are there wastes that not all systems will be able to accept?  Are there air emission considerations?</em>
<li><em>What markets will it serve and how will the outbound products be delivered?</em>  The specific products to be produced and shipped; the markets to be served; and the   distribution pattern of products to be shipped from the new location all need to be taken into consideration.
<li><em>How many employees will the new facility require and what kinds of skills will they need to have?</em>
<li><em>What kinds of transportation facilities are particularly important?</em>  As we continue to move toward a global economy, for example, the need to serve far flung overseas markets might call for a location which has rail service to both and East Coast and a West Coast port.
<li><em>Is it important to be able to have face-to-face dialogue between employees and customers?</em>  If it is, then location near an airport or an interstate highway system might rise in importance.
<li><em>Are customer service, delivery times and reliability important site considerations?  Are there any vendors, suppliers or customer to whom it is particularly important to have good access?</em>
<li><em>What impact will just-in-time (JIT) strategies have on your site?</em>  If there are important customers whom you have to be able to reach within, say, three hours, this consideration should come into play early in the site search.
<li><em>Is the availability of intermodal transportation facilities important?</em>
<li><em>Are there any special telecommunications capabilities that will be needed, e.g. fiber optic cable or special digital transmission services?</em>
<li><em>How large and what kind of an employee population will be needed at the new facility?</em> This includes not only the number of employees in each job classification, but also their relative importance and how the employee population might change over time.
<li><em>What quality of life factors are important?  Are they an important consideration in you ability to recruit the kind of talent you will need?</em>
<li><em>How important is proximity to colleges and universities?</em>  Many companies are finding it increasingly valuable to make use of the research and educational facilities offered by    colleges and universities.
<li><em>What markets are you going to penetrate and what impact will the location of the new facility have on the way that sales will be divided up among your factories?</em>
<li><em>How much space for employee parking will be needed?  </em>
</ul>

Again, make sure to warn the team members against basing their projections for the future plant exclusively on information gathered from the existing facility.  Any new facility will differ significantly from the existing one, and while such projections might be helpful as rough first approximations, they run the risk of not sufficiently factoring in new technologies or production methods that are likely to introduced in the new facility.  For example, a common error is to extrapolate future electricity usage simply buy looking at electrical usage for the last 12 months in the existing plant rather than to try to develop projections for how much power will be needed for the new manufacturing process that is planned for the new facility. One good way to avoid this mistake and to develop better projections is to consult with the suppliers who will be providing the new equipment that you will be installing.<p>

There are many other factors that could be important to a company, depending on how it envisions its business.  The point of this effort is to clearly define the characteristics desired for the new facility and the community in which it will be located, so that those attributes can be sued to effectively screen site candidates and choose the appropriate site.<p>

<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss14.jpg" alt="Step 4: The Requirements Matrix" width=193 height=54 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>


The next step is to use the information about the site requirements to develop fairly well-defined set of site criteria, which then can be organized into a format that can e efficiently use to go out and begin the long process of systematic evaluation and screening of site candidates.<p>

Maybe the best way to organize the information provided by the in-house team of experts is to put it into a matrix of rows and columns, with site factors/requriements listed along the left-hand side and candidate sites listed across the top. (See the matrix we have provided in the back of this guidebook.)  Where possible, information regarding specific sites should be translated into financial terms, e.g. labor costs for a specific location for the types of labor that will be needed, current and projected electric power costs for the required power levels, expected transportation costs.<p>

The use of the matrix format will make it easier to score the sites and keep track of the particular considerations that are going to eliminate some locations and keep others in.  In this way, the matrix will provide a framework that will help clarify and organize the site selection process.<p>

Although each site selection project will develop its own set of criteria, we have provided a "generic" checklist at the end of this guidebook that has been designed so as to be easily tailored to your particular situation and needs.<p>


<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss15.jpg" alt="Step 5: The First Cut" width=196 height=31 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

Now comes the time to begin the actual search.<p>

The process of collecting the recommendations of the site team and of putting together the evaluation matrix should begin to provide a general sense of the kinds of sites that will be most appropriate for the facility in question.  Often, the general shape of the constraints that emerges makes it possible to quickly eliminate large portions of the country.  The next task is to narrow the search further by focusing on the most important requirements that are likely to be hardest to accommodate.<p>

In some cases, a single, highly restrictive requirement will serve this function, e.g. the need for particular special services or for exceptionally high levels of electric power will automatically narrow the search.  Most site searches, however, will not involve such obvious restrictions.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss16.jpg" width=217 height=185 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>

<em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> One common misconception is that tax considerations and government incentives should play an important role in steering the selection process at this point.  In fact, taxes and incentives generally affect businesses only marginally and should b, at most, secondary or even tertiary considerations.  Occasionally, up-front incentives can provide a short-term "hit" capable of making a very bad location look good for a year or two.  Ultimately, however, there is a price to be paid for distorting the traditional economies that should be sued for the site selection decision.  Incentives are something to keep in mind- particularly in the final stage of the site selection effort-but they shouldn't drive the process.<p>

In most cases, the key drivers in site selection are transportation and labor costs, which taken together, generally represent roughly 80% of operating cost.  Often, the best approach is to begin with a set of preliminary transportation analyses in which in-house transportation experts generate rough calculations for a handful of location scenarios.  This might, for example, involve:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>assuming that the new facility will be located somewhere in the proximity of Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Dallas or Denver
<li>then, for each of those cases, splitting up the company's existing facilities
<li>and, finally, calculating the transportation costs for each of the scenarios.
</ul>

What makes this approach particularly useful is that transportation costs tend to vary in a stable, continuous manner.  As a result, it is possible, for example, to produce rough computations of shipping costs from one metro area to another and to create transportation cost "isobars."  By running through such computations, isobar patterns will begin to emerge, e.g. it may turn out that transportation costs for a particular facility will be the same for any point in a region stretching between Cleveland and Milwaukee.  The subsequent search then can be narrowed to the low transportation cost isobar areas revealed by these calculations.  One caveat: Avoid the mistake of restricting the search too severely at this point.,  Just because a computation shows, for example, that the lowest transportation cost point is Columbus, Ohio, does not necessarily mean that the site search should be restricted to locations within 50 miles of Columbus, since even a $50,000 higher cost of transportation could easily be mad up by an area in which labor costs were significantly lower.<p>

At this point, the site selection process probably has gone as far as it effectively can go without outside help.  The problems is that the other major site selection driver-labor cost and availability-is much less easily calculated and evaluated than is transportation cost.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss17.jpg" width=237 height=155 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>
Regional labor cost generalizations have been unraveling for quite some time, and , by the end of the 1980s, the few regional partners that had persisted finally had disappeared as a result of the economic turmoil and dislocations of the preceding decade.  Today, the geographic variation in wage rates has become much more complex, with, for example, an increasing number of situations in which labor cost and availability actually vary significantly within a single metropolitan area.<p>

At the same time, a national market now exists for some of the most sophisticated skills.  If you need to hire someone for a position requiring special computer programming skills for the particular applications that you use in you manufacturing plant, it is likely that the amount you pay will not vary significantly according to where you are located.  In fact, it very well could turn out to be harder and more expensive to fill skilled positions in what normally would be considered low-wage areas.<p>

<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss18.jpg" alt="Step 6: Outside Help" width=190 height=32 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

Having narrowed the site search-via transportation considerations-to an area that might stretch across parts of as many as half a dozen states, the time has come to go to outside sources to help you identify communities within that area that might have sites that would be appropriate for your needs.<p>

In the case of a facility with a unique requirement - e.g. special access to rail transportation or special electric power needs-a company might decide to turn to the industrial development operations of, say, railroads or electrical utilities for help.<p>

Generally speaking, however, the most appropriate outside sources to contact are the economic development agencies for the states which have areas which still remain under consideration for your potential site.  Though the level of sophistication of the agencies varies somewhat from state to state, most have a variety of resources that can greatly facilitate your site selection efforts.  For example, a number of economic development agencies have computerized data bases that quickly can provide-often within 24 hours-complete, current information about buildings and industrial sites that are available in their states, as well as detailed information about the utilities, labor forces, educational facilities, industries, tax structures and other community information that companies need to make site selection decisions.  Illinois, in fact, makes community profiles and many sites and available through this Internet web page.<p>

The most effective way to use our state agency staff is as an extension of the site search team.  Give them as much specific information a possible about what you are seeking.  This could include, for example, providing them with detailed information about labor needs, site acreage requirements, ranges of community size, any special training programs (e.g. a welding program in the community college), transportation requirements and tax information.  It is especially important to fully inform these professional about the factors that will be key in your site selection decision-and particularly to give them clear and complete information about the "knock-out factors" that you will be using.  Armed with such information, the specialists are the agencies will be in a good position to come up with site candidates that will come closest to meeting your needs.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss20.jpg" width=209 height=132 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>

There also is another way that state economic development agencies can help companies that are involved in site selection.  Once word gets out that a company is planning a new facility, the floodgates open, and the organization inevitably is deluged with glossy brochures and beseiged by officials from communities interested in landing the new plant.  Some companies actually find that the attention becomes so intense that it interferes with the day-to-day operations at their existing location.  In this kind of situation, many firms have found it helpful to use the sate economic development agencies as ab buffer and to tell anyone who contacts the m directly that the firm is working with the state and that nay information should be submitted though the agency.  You even can try to preempt the attention by contacting the state agencies anonymously and concealing your identity during the early stages of your site search.<p>

<br>
<img src="../../graph/business/ss19.jpg" alt="Step 7: Visitation Rights and Wrongs" width=190 height=50 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

When the information about the most appropriate communities and sites begins to come in from the state agencies, use of the evaluation matrix can be a big help in organizing the material.  Unfortunately, no matter how detailed the set of criteria and how extensive the site selection planning, there is no easy way to proceed on the site evaluations.  The process of eliminating sites and narrowing the field of candidates inevitable involves the weighing of complicated trade-offs and the balancing of hard to compare considerations.<p>

From the communities and site candidates that the state agencies nominate, the site selection tam should choose a dozen or so prime contenders that qualify for visits by site team members.  Each member of the site selection team typically is assigned three to four communities to evaluate in the first round of community visits.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss21.jpg" width=181 height=98 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>

The in-person evaluations are important for several reasons.  For one thing, there is no substitute for direct, first hand examination of prospective sites,  The visits also are unsurpassed opportunities to find out about the community's business environment.  It can be particularly helpful to talk with executives at local businesses and to find out which kinds of companies have been moving into the community and which have been leaving.  This kind of information can provide extremely valuable insights into the community and can make it possible to learn a great deal from the experiences of the organizations already there.<p>

In-person visits can serve at least one other important function: to provide an opportunity to get a clearer sense of the "personality" of the community in which a prospective site is located.  There is a surprising amount of variation among communities that, at least on paper, might seem very similar, and the best way to learn about a community is to visit it.<p>

After the visits, the dozen or so candidates should be narrowed to three or four finalists, which then would receive another round of visits.  At this time, it generally facilitates the process to have team, rather than individual, visits.  It is at this point that the issue of incentives is best raised.  If the process has gone as it should, all the finalists should offer attractive sites and locations, and incentives might well tip the balance.<p>

<a name="Section 3"><hr></a>
<h2 align=center>Section 3: Common Mistakes and Misconceptions</h2>

Probably the most common mistake companies make is to focus exclusively on initial concerns and start-up considerations-and to not take into account the dynamic nature both of business needs and of the sites under consideration.  This can result in the selection of sites in communities that appear attractive today, but whose advantages will soon disappear.  Some of the ways this can occur-and tips for avoiding such mistakes-already have been mentioned in earlier portions of the text.<p>

Other common errors include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Excessive concern with avoiding unions.<p>
Unionism has declined as an issue over the last decade, with most management/labor relationships having advanced far beyond the simplistic adversarial approaches of the past.  In addition, technological changes are making it feasible to operate smaller facilities than in the past and will permit more personal, hands-on management, a development which diminishes the importance of unionization.<p>
<li>Placement of too much emphasis on state and local taxes.<p>

There is a large body of evidence that indicates that the magnitude of other costs dwarfs the impact of sate and local taxes.  Moreover, companies located in higher tax communities could very well benefit from the physical and educational infrastructure, as well as the governmental services that those taxes pay for.  Studies suggest that, overall, state and local business taxes generally do not seem to have a significant impact on after-tax rates of return, and that they usually should be of secondary consideration in site selection decisions.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss22.jpg" width=155 height=121 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>

<li>Use of "business climate" rankings.<p>

Though business climates studies often get a lot of publicity, the methodologies used to determine "business climate" ranking are controversial, and the results are often of dubious value.  For one thing, the rankings generally are done on a state-by-state basis.  As a result, they are usually so general as to be, at best, of little use, and, at worst, misleading.
</ul>

In the end, companies planning a new facility should always remember that they are looking for a site, not for a state.<p>


<a name="The Illinois Advantage"><hr></a>
<h2 align=center>The Illinois Advantage</h2>

At the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) we are proud of our record of responding to the needs of businesses engaged in the search for sites for new facilities and plant expansions.<p>

Take our computerized database, one of the first in the nation to provide site seeking firms with complete, up-to-date and accurate information about currently available industrial sites and the communities in which they are located.  Today, our computerized Site and Buildings Inventory can help you located and identify appropriate sites and buildings by providing almost instantaneous access to such information as the size of building and site, ceiling height, rail access, shipping and receiving facilities, crane availability, acreage, utilities, waterway access, zoning, rail access, highway access, EPA attainment and ownership.  Similarly, our computerized Community Profile Inventory provides access to data about community assets, including information about such things as municipal services, climate, population, utilities, local industry, tax structure, commercial services, transportation, health facilities, education facilities, labor force and location services.  Community Profiles and information on many sites and buildings are accessible via this Internet page.<p>

Or consider how our recognition of the growing importance of advanced telecommunication services has enabled us to identify locations where companies can get access to fiber optic transmission, digital switching and other telecommunications services.<p>

<img src="../../graph/business/ss23.jpg" width=299 height=213 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>

Moreover, the site selection resources we offer go far beyond just our data bases.  In fact, our most important resource is the depth and breadth of our experience with site selection efforts.<p>

For well over three decades, DCCA and its predecessors have helped businesses with their site selection efforts.  We have helped hundreds of businesses find sites for new facilities or for expansions in Illinois.  This experience has enabled our DCCA professionals to gain an understanding of the site selection process and has enabled us to design and implement programs that can help organizations looking for industrial sites.  We think of ourselves as an extension of your site selection team, and we are confident that our experience enables us to make suggestions, anticipate problems and generally facilitate your site selection efforts.<p>


<a name="The Site Selection Scorecard"><hr></a>
<h2 align=center>The Site Selection Scorecard</h2>

Because of the complexity of the site selection process, it can be extra helpful to have a convenient way to organize the mass of information you will be collecting about sites and to keep track of the criteria that are going to eliminate some locations and keep others in.<p>

Based on our experience with numerous site selection projects, we have put together a "scorecard" that is designed to fit the needs of most site selection efforts and that you can use to help you navigate through the systematic evaluation and screening of site candidates.  Needless to say, every site selection project is distinct and involves a different balance of factors and considerations, and this scorecard is intended to be easily tailored to meet the special needs of your particular search.<p>

The basic organization of the scorecard is quite straightforward.  A list of requirements and criteria that commonly arise in site selection runs down the scorecard, while room has been left across the top of the scorecard for the listing of site candidates.<p>

The criteria are, for the most part, self-explanatory.  The first column, right of the criterion/requirement, is intended for description of the ideal site.  Each of the subsequent columns are intended for information about sites under consideration.  Most of the criteria are easily quantified, but the last section of the scorecard also includes a number of factors that, although important, are harder to measure.  One way to handle these types of considerations is to try to "rate" each candidate site on a scale of 1-10 (worst to best) according to how well you feel that site fits your needs with respect to that factor.<p>

We also have included a column of boxes on the far left of the scorecard to be used to rate each of the criteria according to its importance, e.g.:<p>

A--essential<br>
B--important<br>
C--nice to have<br>

<h4>
Small business is the real muscle of the Illinois economy. Eighty-five percent of the new jobs in Illinois were created by small businesses. Think about it. Nearly 4.4 million Illinoisans depend on small business for their livelihood. <p>

To succeed in business today, small business owners have to wear many hats - that of a banker to secure financing, a marketing expert to reach potential clientele, an accountant to file a myriad of tax returns, an attorney comply with the many laws regulating them  and the list goes on.<p>

Fortunately for Illinois' 442,757 small business owners, assistance is readily available. Whether shopping for a marketplace, investigating financial sources or trying to make sense of tax requirements, the State of Illinois' Department of Commerce and Community Affairs can help.<p>

Forget your preconceived notions about government. Shake off that I-don't-need-anybody's -help-especially-the-government's-help attitude. Take a few minutes out of what has to be a busy schedule and read on. The information that follows could change your company's future.<p>

<h4>
Doing business in the 1990s and into the 21st century will mean doing
business in a global marketplace. The increased saturation of domestic
markets and the size of the world market, which is four times larger than
America's, underscore the need for local firms to investigate new markets.
According to a study by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community
Affairs (DCCA) and the Center for Economic Competitiveness, SRI
International and DRI/McGraw Hill, "international markets will provide the
greatest opportunity for Illinois manufacturing-based industries in the
1990s." Clearly, the best way for the Illinois economy to grow and prosper
is through exports.<p>

While Illinois businesses have made impressive inroads in exporting,
opportunities exist for increased export activity. These include more firms
becoming exporters and expanded markets for current exporters.<p>

<BODY>
<p>
<strong>
DCCA's research shows that many midsize companies lack an understanding of
their international market opportunities as well as their capability and
readiness to export.<p>

The first step in exporting is determining a firm's readiness to export.
Exporting may not be right for every business, and requirements will vary
depending on market demands and competitive trading opportunities. While
there is no one test for export readiness, companies interested in
successfully penetrating foreign markets should give careful consideration
to the following criteria:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Is there a commitment from senior management to export?<p>
<li>Does the firm possess the appropriate management structure and
resources (i.e., personnel who will be responsible for international
trade), and the financial capability to export?<p>
<li>Does the product have a technical or price advantage that will
enhance its export competitiveness?<p>
</ul>

DCCA's studies also show that the greatest export potential lies with
midsize businesses in the following targeted industries:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>industrial machinery<p>
<li>chemicals and plastics<p>
<li>electrical equipment<p>
<li>medical and scientific equipment products<p>
<li>food processing<p>
</ul>

<p>
Illinois is a national leader in making export assistance available to its
business community. It was first among the states to organize a network of
foreign trade offices and in providing regional export assistance centers
across the state.<p>

In 1965, DCCA's IBD was established for the purpose of providing needed
export assistance to Illinois companies. Today, the IBD maintains six
operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, including its first foreign
office established in 1968 in Belgium. DCCA's IBD, headquartered in
Chicago, provides Illinois companies with a variety of export programs and
services through a three-level export infrastructure comprised of Local-
Level, State-Level and Overseas assistance resources.<p>

<h3>Local-Level Export Assistance</h3>

<h4>International Trade Centers</h4>

<a href="/dcca/menus/businessassistance/itcmap.htm"> International Trade Centers (ITCs)</a>, members of the Illinois Small Business
Development Center Network, provide one-on-one counseling on international
services for potential Illinois exporters. Funded by DCCA, the U.S. Small
Business Administration and a local host institution, ITCs, including two
NAFTA Opportunity Centers* which specialize in trade with Canada and
Mexico, are strategically located throughout Illinois at:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn
<li>Bradley University in Peoria*
<li>Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville
<li>North Business and Industrial Council (NORBIC) in Chicago*
<li>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
</ul>


<h3>State-Level Export Assistance</h3>

<h4>The Chicago Office</h4>

The IBD Chicago Office is staffed by trade specialists with international
expertise in regional markets. They provide assistance to companies with
specific needs related to doing business in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin
America. Regional marketing specialists in Chicago also coordinate a number
of activities and programs to assist Illinois exporters, including
international trade shows and missions, catalog shows, a trade lead
program, and the Illinois Export Alliance.<p>

<h3>Overseas Export Assistance</h3>

<h4>Foreign Trade Offices</h4>

Foreign Trade Offices assist Illinois companies in their overseas marketing
efforts by providing a competitive edge in pursuing export markets.
Illinois Foreign Trade Offices, listed below in order of year founded, are
located in:<p>

<ul>
<li>Brussels, Belgium, established in 1968
<li>Hong Kong, established in 1973
<li>Tokyo, Japan, established in 1987
<li>Mexico City, Mexico, established in 1989
<li>Budapest, Hungary, established in 1990
<li>Warsaw, Poland, established in 1990
</ul>

<p>
To help Illinois firms compete and succeed in global markets, DCCA and the
IBD have developed programs that address the demands of every phase of the
export process. These programs have been designed in conjunction with
DCCA's "mixed country/ product" export strategy, which has identified the
large and growing global markets most open to imports. The strategy also
identifies target markets with the most demand and/or potential receptivity
to the products of Illinois' targeted industries. Each program is
structured to help companies understand and move through the stages of the
export process and levels of export maturity.<p>

<h3>New-to-Export</h3>

Companies currently focused on domestic markets with little or no export
experience.<p>

However, because of the growth and opportunities available
in international trade, these firms have expressed an initial interest in exporting.
They need support and assistance to position themselves for exporting, as well as basic market
intelligence and information on market opportunities.<p>

<h3>Export-Ready</h3>

Companies ready to begin exporting.<p>

These firms have sufficient resources to purchase material, produce the
product and market their goods abroad. They have received initial training
through the International Trade Centers or other export resources and now need step-by-step
assistance in the export marketplace.<p>

<h3>New-to-Market</h3>

Companies with some export experience seeking expanded markets for their
products.<p>

These firms need specialized information related to new markets, foreign
business partners, sales contacts or leads.<p>

Both Export-Ready and New-to-Market firms can access State-Level and
Overseas assistance through the IBD's Chicago and Foreign Trade Offices.<p>

<h3>State-Level Export Assistance</h3>

<h4>International Trade Shows and Missions</h4>

Each year the IBD identifies international trade shows and missions that
develop foreign sales and best serve Illinois' export strategy. Through its
Chicago Office and Foreign Trade Offices, IBD experts identify specific
export opportunities and provide Illinois exporters participating in trade
shows and missions with a full range of services, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>Pre-show publicity, counseling and coordination of follow-up activities.
<li>Contacting buyers and distributors in host countries in advance of events.
<li>Researching key distribution channels.
<li>Arranging in-country appointments with potential customers.
<li>Handling trade show exhibit logistics such as space rental, stand assembly, furniture rental and lighting.
</ul>

Trade missions offer specific access to a market by providing opportunities
for establishing new export contacts. In planning trade missions, the IBD
arranges individual appointments for groups of Illinois businesses with
potential agents, distributors and government officials according to the
needs of the business groups and the nature of the marketplace.<p>


<h4>Catalog Shows</h4>

Catalog shows highlight the products of targeted Illinois companies via
catalog presentations by IBD staff to potential international buyers.<p>

Exporters themselves need not be present. Held annually across the world,
catalog shows provide Illinois companies with a cost-effective means of
gaining market exposure to foreign agents and distributors interested in
representing U.S. manufacturers. DCCA's catalog shows focus on specific
geographic regions overseas and the products with high market potential in
those areas.<p>


<h4>Trade Lead Program</h4>

Trade leads are made available to Illinois businesses by the IBD's Chicago
and Foreign Trade Offices through several sources, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>"Trade Leader," the IBD's quarterly newsletter.
<li>An automated trade-lead matching computer program which utilizes U.S.  Department of Commerce databases and other
resources to identify trade leads.
</ul>


<h4>Illinois Export Alliance</h4>

DCCA's IBD has formed alliances with various private sector service
providers whose fields of specialization range from management consulting
to freight-forwarding. Working on a pro bono basis, these service firms
provide Illinois companies with technical information as well as answers to
specific questions about exporting their products.<p>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>
<BODY>

The International Business Division of the Illinois Department of Commerce
and Community Affairs (DCCA-IBD) is comprised of individuals with regional
expertise in worldwide markets.<p>

The Chicago team provides assistance to companies with specific questions
related to doing business in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, Canada and
Latin America.  In addition, the Chicago staff coordinates a number of
programs to assist Illinois exporters including:  international trade shows
and missions; catalog shows; a trade leads program; and referrals to
various companies that provide pro bono information to new Illinois
exporters.<p>

DCCA-IBD also maintains an extensive network of foreign offices to assist
Illinois companies in their overseas marketing efforts.  These are located
in Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, and Mexico.<p>

While many of the Division's services are offered at no charge, (trade
leads, regional specific market inquiries, and on-site assistance by
foreign offices) reduced resources have required the DCCA-IBD to implement
a partial cost recovery program for specific individualized company
assistance regarding agent and distributor searches, foreign market
research reports, catalog shows, trade shows and trade missions.  Because
these service requests are company specific and of a more individualized
nature, this partial cost recovery will enable DCCA-IBD to leverage its
funding and personnel resources to service the maximum amount of committed
Illinois firms seeking these export marketing assistance.<p>

Illinois is not alone in implementing a fee schedule for selected services
as many other states, as well as the federal government, have adopted user
fees for export marketing services.<p>

<hr>
<h3>AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR SEARCH (one country, one product)</h3>

DCCA-IBD services are provided to companies requesting a foreign agent/
distributor search:<p>

1.   An agent/distributor search is undertaken by one of DCCA's foreign
     offices to find a foreign partner to represent a specific Illinois
     company product line.<p>

2.   Upon receipt of a company's brochures, a direct mailing will be
     initiated under cover letter from the appropriate DCCA-IBD foreign
     office to targeted agents/distributors in the specific industry and
     country.<p>

3.   DCCA-IBD's foreign office will collect all responses indicating an
     interest in representing the Illinois firm and will forward the
     responses with a results report and listing of agents/distributors who
     received this solicitation to the requesting Illinois firm.<p>


A reduced fee will apply to Illinois firms who request only the agent/distributor contact list for their specific industry and country and do not wish a direct mail campaign.<p>

<ul>
<li>List, direct mailing of a company supplied brochure (50 max.) and a response report. $250.00

country and product.  These are published reports from many different
services and not based on original research.<p>

3.  DCCA-IBD staff will meet personally with interested agents and
    distributors overseas and provide a report after the events detailing
    foreign firms interested in a business relationship with you.<p>

Catalog shows are an inexpensive way for Illinois firms to obtain market
research and prospective new agents and distributors in foreign markets
without the travel expense of sending company representatives.<p>
