<hr><center><h2>                  I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

The operations management major is designed to teach the Student the skills required to perform the
production function in both the manufacturing and service industries.  Among the many opportunities
awaiting the successful graduate are positions in process planning and scheduling, purchasing, expediting,
quality management, inventory control, and advanced study in graduate business schools, if desired.



<hr><center><h2>                         II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--
<P>
     Principles of Management  In this introductory course you will develop an understanding
     of how a manager functions.  The many principles covered include planning, organizing,
     leadership, communication, and control procedures with a project simulating the
     management process using a computer-based simulation environment.
<P>
     Introductory Cost Accounting  This elective course provides an important foundation for
     operations management.  Here you will learn the nature and concepts of cost allocation,
     standard cost systems, budgeting procedures, performance measurement and human
     resource accounting.
<P>
     Production/Operations Management  This descriptive course covers a broad range of
     operations principles with a decision-based approach.  The entire operations management
     major centers on the topics presented here which include forecasting, scheduling, facility
     design, quality control, and much more!
<P>
     Quantitative Production Methods  An extension of the POM course outlined above, QPM
     applies the concepts learned to case problems using computer-based decision support tools
     to make the "number crunching" easier.  Most modern manufacturing facilities rely
     heavily on computers and this course gives valuable experience in that area.
     <hr><center><h2>                 III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to (1) secure the equivalent of a double major by adding additional courses to your
selected minor field of study, (2) add a third field of interest to your program of study which is almost
the same as having two minors, or (3) broaden your program by selecting individual courses you would
like to take to help you in your future ministry or for your own personal enjoyment.

<hr><center><h2>             IV. FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES </h2></center><BR>

Two separate computer laboratories are maintained for the use of business Students.  These laboratories
are dedicated to word processing and office automation and are equipped with 48 IBM-compatible
computers, 3 laser printers, 42 electronic typewriters, and 12 dictaphone/transcribers.
<P>
Two completely equipped computer laboratories are available for your use.  There are 32 386 SXs,
33 IBM AT (286) compatibles, 24 IBM PCs, one AT&T 3B2/600 UNIX computer with 10 access
terminals linked to a Burroughs 6800 mainframe computer, as well as 5 laser printers.  We also have 30
Apple Macintosh SEs and a wide variety of software packages including Quattro Pro, Microsoft Works,
WordPerfect, Turbo Pascal, and many others that are currently in use in the business world.
<P>
As a part of the University Business Association, a Campus organization comprised of Students in the
various business majors, you will have an opportunity to become Acquainted with successful Christian
business people who speak at the regular meetings.  The emphasis of UBA is to help prepare you to be
an effective testimony for Christ in the business world.  In addition, this organization operates an
Investment Club that manages a portfolio of real stocks.  Also, special office-related forums are held so
office administration majors will have the opportunity to meet business people who have special expertise
in their particular area of interest.
<P>
One of the most important opportunities available in the operations management major is the broad
coverage given to the entire field of management.  If you were to decide that marketing management or
financial management was more suited to your needs or if you just cannot make up your mind, this will
create no problem.  You have two full years to make a final decision on your major area while taking
more generalized business courses which will help you determine where your interests and abilities lie.
<P>
<a href="/whatsnew/chapel/">Chapel services are held every morning</A>, Monday through Friday.  These services are a source of great
inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>
when on the Campus, and in their absence by selected speakers.  One day each week the Chapel period
is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/library/">The modern Mack Library</A>, with 90,000 square feet of floor space and seating for over 1400 Students,

recordings.  An interlibrary loan program is available through OCLC, a national database, for books not
held in our library.
<P>
The annual spring <a href="/special/bibleconf/">Bible Conference</a> is one of the outstanding features of the University and Academy
year.  Your regular academic work will be suspended for the Conference, during which you will hear
messages from outstanding Bible teachers, pastors, and evangelists.
<P>
All Students have opportunity to participate in the University's athletic program.  Through a well-
integrated program of intramural athletic competition, a very high percentage of Student participation is
possible.  You will have the opportunity to compete in a wide variety of both team and individual sports
including soccer, speedball, basketball, softball, track, volleyball, tennis, swimming, badminton, judo,
table tennis, racquetball, archery, wrestling, and indoor soccer.
<P>
The productions of the University Classic Players and Opera Association will enable you in four years
to see several Shakespearean plays and grand operas performed on Campus.  Every year there are also
frequent recitals and student performances in theater, speech, and music.<a href="/aboutbju/places/fitness/">The Fremont Fitness Center gives you</A> the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a health club right on
Campus at no additional cost to you.  You can keep yourself in top-notch physical condition through the
use of its state-of-the-art exercise equipment, racquetball courts, spa, and sauna.
<P>
If you are planning to live on Campus, you will be glad to know that <a href="/studentlife/dorm/">all of our Dormitories are</A>air-
conditioned, have wall-to-wall carpeting, and have a phone in each room.  You will be able to make long-
distance calls home directly from your room and have them automatically placed on your school bill.
<P>
All of our classrooms are air-conditioned, and there are awnings over the sidewalks to keep you dry when
it is raining.  <a href="/whatsnew/menu/">The Dining Common serves 8,500 delicious meals</A> a day, and the Snack Shop and
Bookstore <a href="/aboutbju/places/stucenter/">in the Student Center</a> carry just about anything you'll need.
<P>
You will find the finest Christian young people in the country are your fellow Students, and without
trying too hard, you may end up marrying one of them!

rehearsal/classrooms, a music education laboratory/classroom, a piano pedagogy lab, a class piano lab
equipped with 15 Roland electronic pianos, 2 beautiful recital halls, and 2 large auditoriums for major
concerts and oratorio and opera performances.

<hr><center><h2>                       I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

The major in pastoral studies is primarily intended to prepare Students to serve in pastoral and associate
pastoral Ministries which support the preaching ministry of the senior pastor of a large church.


<hr><center><h2>                              II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<br>
<P>
       The Corinthian Epistles  In this class you will study Paul's instructions concerning church
       divisions, practical Christian living, Christian liberty, marriage and divorce, the gifts of
       the Spirit, and the place of Christian love; and his testimony and exhortations concerning
       the Christian ministry.
<P>
       Church and Home  This course will provide you with a study of the family life cycle
       (love, dating, courtship, engagement, marriage, postmarital adjustments, and children and
       youth in the home).  You will study with special attention the role of the church in
       meeting the needs of the family and those preparing for marriage.
<P>
       Biblical Themes  This is a course in which you will deal with the fundamental doctrines
       of Christianity as they are unfolded in Scripture, with attention given to the relationship
       of these doctrines to the central theme and messages of the Bible.  You will particularly
       study timely doctrinal questions such as ecclesiastical and personal separation; the
       inspiration, preservation, inerrancy, and authentiCity of the Word of God; and marriage
       and divorce.
<P>


<hr><center><h2>                      III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to (1) secure the equivalent of a double major by adding additional courses to your
selected minor field of study, (2) add a third field of interest to your program of study which is almost
the same as having two minors, or (3) broaden your program by selecting individual courses you would
like to take to help you in your future ministry or for your own personal enjoyment.

<hr><h2><center> IV. FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES </h2></center>
<P>
<b>Local Church Extension Ministries:</b>
<p>
   The church internship program will place you under the leadership of an experienced, Fundamental
   pastor.  You will receive practical experience and instruction in all phases of the local church ministry.
<P>
   The extension program provides for the development of Student leadership and experience in various
   types of Christian Ministries, such as church visitation, jail services, retirement home Ministries, youth
   work, and child evangelism.
<P>
   Through the church planting outreach, you may apply for assistance to help plant a Fundamental
   church.  When you have completed Methods of Church Planting and have graduated, the program will
   provide you with professional guidance and partial financial support during your first two years of
   establishing an independent, Fundamental church.
<P>
   <a href="/ministries/missions/">Evangelistic and Mission teams go out</A> from the University each year, especially during the summer
   months.  These outreaches provide opportunities for students to gain valuable and rewarding
   experience.  Some of these groups are the Minutemen Evangelistic Team, the Church Planting
   Outreach Evangelistic Team, and summer missionary teams.
<P>
   Through the summer extension program, you will continue to receive guidance and practical experience
   in Christian service throughout the summer months.  These courses carry two hours credit each
   summer, and you may take them wherever you may reside during the summer.
<P>
Each week approximately 500 ministerial Students and those interested in the ministry receive instruction
and inspiration about various aspects of the Christian ministry from the University <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>, Chancellor,
and other experienced men of God.  Twice each week the ministerial Students meet separately by
classification and receive specialized instruction in soulwinning, preaching, the music ministry, the youth
ministry, Missions, cults and trends, the church educational program, church finance, the family, and
pastoral counseling.  Each school year at least 24 pastors are brought in at regular intervals to teach
sections of ministerial classes and to participate in question-answer forums.
<P>
In the Church Ministries Resource Laboratory, you will find a Christian periodical and tape library,
duplicating equipment, complete topical files, and a wide variety of audiovisual materials and equipment.
This laboratory is maintained for your class and extension use.
<P>
<a href="/studentlife/prayer/">Mission Prayer Band is an organization</A> designed to stimulate Missionary zeal and vision on the Campus.
The organization is divided into two groups, one for men Students and one for women Students.  These
groups hold regular prayer meetings in which the needs of the Missionary cause around the world are
made a matter of systematic prayer.
<P>
<a href="/whatsnew/chapel/">Chapel services are held every morning</A>, Monday through Friday.  These services are a source of great
inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>
when on the Campus, and in their absence by selected speakers.  One day each week the Chapel period
is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/fitness/">The Fremont Fitness Center gives you</A> the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a health club right on
Campus at no additional cost to you.  You can keep yourself in top-notch physical condition through the

<P>
If you are planning to live on Campus, you will be glad to know that <a href="/studentlife/dorm/">all of our Dormitories are</A>air-
conditioned, have wall-to-wall carpeting, and have a phone in each room.  You will be able to make long-
distance calls home directly from your room and have them automatically placed on your school bill.
<P>
All of our classrooms are air-conditioned, and there are awnings over the sidewalks to keep you dry when
it is raining.  <a href="/whatsnew/menu/">The Dining Common serves 8,500 delicious meals</A> a day, and the Snack Shop and
Bookstore <a href="/aboutbju/places/stucenter/">in the Student Center</a> carry just about anything you'll need.
<P>
You will find the finest Christian young people in the country are your fellow Students, and without
trying too hard, you may end up marrying one of them!

<hr><center><h2>                              V. ABOUT THE FACULTY</h2></center><BR>

All of our School of Religion faculty members have extensive preaching experience in local churches,
and over two-thirds of them have pastoral experience.  In fact, 14 of our faculty members have over 250
combined years of pastoral experience, an average of about 19 years per teacher.  Several are currently
serving as pastors of small (and some not so small) churches on the weekends.  They know the problems
of local churches, and they are sympathetic to the needs of pastors.  One of these faculty members will
be your advisor.
<P>
The faculty of the Bible department are highly qualified.  The combined teaching experience of the full-
time faculty is over 500 years--an average of 23 years per teacher.  All of the full-time faculty members
have master's degrees, and over 80 percent have earned doctorates.
<P>
The University employs two full-time evangelists.  Several members of the faculty are currently involved
in writing material for Christian school textbooks, religious periodicals, and journals, such as Biblical
Viewpoint.

<hr><center><h2>                     VI. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PLACEMENT</h2></center><BR>

The School of Religion extension office will assist you in finding positions for Christian service.  Pastors,
camp directors, Mission board directors, and other recruiters often visit the Campus to find personnel for
their Ministries.  Graduates can be found serving the Lord in a wide variety of fields--from teaching to
working on the Mission field.

<hr><center><h2>                                  IV. FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES</h2></center><BR>

You will have an opportunity to coach one of the Bob Jones Junior High or Academy intramural teams
for one or more seasons while you are here.  Some physical education majors enjoy this experience so
much that they try to work things out so they can continue working with the same group of young people
each year.
<P>
You will have many opportunities to participate in as many sports as you can squeeze into your
schedule, since the University has such a comprehensive intramural athletic program.  Approximately 50
percent of our Student body currently participates in our sports program.  This compares with 10 percent
Student involvement at schools with interscholastic competition.
<P>
You will also have many opportunities to gain experience officiating University and Academy games
in our active intramural program.  Each year the Elementary School holds a track meet at which you will
also have an opportunity to help officiate.  A number of our Students also officiate for games in
Greenville area High Schools and youth leagues.
<P>
Bob Jones University maintains the following facilities for your use:<BR>

<LI> 2 full-sized gymnasiums
<LI> A large (42' x 75'), heated, indoor swimming pool
<LI> 10 modern, well-lighted tennis courts
<LI> 6 athletic fields
<LI> 3 handball/racquet courts
<LI> A ¬-mile paved track
<LI> Equipment and/or facilities for weight training, gymnastics, wrestling, archery, table tennis, judo,
       karate, and fencing

The Academic excellence of our program is evident by how our physical education Students score on the
National Teacher Examinations.  Our physical education majors generally score higher than 75-85 percent
of the other physical education majors, and our education Students have received mean scores well above
the national average since 1951.
<P>
You will have the opportunity to serve an internship in a state-of-the-art fitness center.  The School
of Education operates the Fremont Fitness Center with a modern building, first occupied in February
1993, equipped with a full range of exercise equipment, spa, and sauna.Through the Men's and Women's Extension Ministries offices you will have many opportunities to
use your talents and skills in physical education as tools to reach others for Christ.  You may be able to
use a pickup game of basketball at a community center to reach some young people, or you may be able
to work with juvenile delinquents at a detention center.  There are also opportunities to participate in
Ministries working in youth camps and with the handicapped.  Another opportunity occurring each
semester is for a couple of upperclass physical education majors to travel to Christian schools to conduct
in-house sports clinics.
<P>
The Association of Christian Teachers is an integral part of the Education Department.  Films,
programs, and activities are correlated very closely to the emphasis of the individual classes.  This
organization will provide you with opportunities for leadership and training and professional contact.
Each of the 12 professional education departments elects representatives to serve as officers.  Prospective
teachers are urged to become members of the A.C.T.  The A.C.T. awards a medal annually to the best
elementary Student teacher and the best secondary Student teacher.  By doing your best while you are a
Student here, you might be able to win that award.
<P>
The Media Center contains all the audiovisual equipment you are likely to use in teaching, including
equipment for preparing transparencies, videotapes, laminated bulletin board figures, slide presentations,
signs, and duplicating equipment.  You will learn how to use these various machines under the guidance
of our trained and dedicated staff.  The Media Center is also equipped with various curriculum materials,
textbooks, and teaching materials for all grade levels and subjects.  In addition, as an education Student,
you will have access to the University's <a href="/academic/colleges/cas/math/cps/">Computer Science</a> lab.
<P>
You will have the opportunity to observe experienced Christian teachers right on our Campus in the
beautiful, air-conditioned buildings of Bob Jones Beginnings Center (kindergarten and first grade),
Elementary School, Junior High, and Academy.
<P>
The School of Education at Bob Jones University is approved in accordance with NASDTEC (National
Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification) standards.  Your graduation from
BJU with an education degree and your successful completion of the National Teacher Examination will
entitle you to teacher certification for the state of South Carolina.  South Carolina has a reciproCity
arrangement with several states, which will allow you to be certified in a number of different states.
<P>
<a href="/whatsnew/chapel/">Chapel services are held every morning</A>, Monday through Friday.  These services are a source of great
inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>
when on the Campus, and in their absence by selected speakers.  One day each week the Chapel period
is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
Because of our care and concern for the spiritual as well as the physical needs of the people in our
part of the country, Students are encouraged to be involved in outreach Ministries in our area.  While you
are here you will have the opportunity to participate in as many of these Ministries as you can fit into
your schedule.  These opportunities vary from work in nursing homes, jails, detention centers, and
churches, to visitation, Bible clubs, providing special music, martial arts teams, and mime teams.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/library/">The modern Mack Library</A>, with 90,000 square feet of floor space and seating for over 1400 Students,
will give you access to 231,000 volumes, 1100 current periodical subscriptions, and more than 10,500
recordings.  An interlibrary loan program is available through OCLC, a national database, for books not
held in our library.
<P>
If you are planning to live on Campus, you will be glad to know that <a href="/studentlife/dorm/">all of our Dormitories are</A>air-
conditioned, have wall-to-wall carpeting, and have a phone in each room.  You will be able to make long-
distance calls home directly from your room and have them automatically placed on your school bill.
<P>
All of our classrooms are air-conditioned, and there are awnings over the sidewalks to keep you dry when
it is raining.  <a href="/whatsnew/menu/">The Dining Common serves 8,500 delicious meals</A> a day, and the Snack Shop and
Bookstore <a href="/aboutbju/places/stucenter/">in the Student Center</a> carry just about anything you'll need.
<P>
You will find the finest Christian young people in the country are your fellow Students, and without
trying too hard, you may end up marrying one of them!

in community service.  These and the other faculty members in the physical education department have
over 200 combined years of experience in this field.

<hr><center><h2>             IV. FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES</h2></center><BR>

Our music facilities are the finest to be found in Fundamental Christian education today. In fact,
they are equal to and, in many cases, exceed what is found in the finest secular universities and
conservatories.  These include 30 faculty teaching studios, more than 60 Student practice studios (35
equipped and specially designated for music majors and minors and advanced Students), 5
rehearsal/classrooms, a music education laboratory/classroom, a piano pedagogy lab, a class piano lab
equipped with 15 Roland electronic pianos, 2 beautiful recital halls, and 2 large auditoriums for major
concerts and oratorio and opera performances.
<P>
In addition, our music library holds more than 9,000 records, tapes and CD's and is equipped with
modern equipment for your use.  It is a branch of our main library (the Mack Library), which has a
collection of more than 200,000 volumes, and it provides strong support in books, scores, and periodicals
for study and research.
<P>
The University seeks to provide the best equipment for the Division of Music and sees to it that this
equipment is in top condition.  There are over 160 pianos on Campus, including four concert grands, a
Bosendorfer Imperial Grand, and baby grands by Steinway, Chickering, Mason and Hamlin, Kawai,
and Yamaha.  The University also has a fine collection of string, woodwind, brass, and percussion
instruments--not only Student models for classroom and rental use but also a number of fine professional
model instruments to support advanced activities in the symphony orchestra, band, and in chamber music.
Organs include a 3-manual, 57-rank Zimmer pipe organ in Rodeheaver Auditorium; a 2-manual, 19-rank
Wicks pipe organ in the War Memorial Chapel; a 3-manual, 110-rank Allen computer organ in the
Founder's Memorial Amphitorium; and two smaller practice organs.  The University also owns a Tyre
and Goudzwaard harpsichord built in 1987.
<P>
Our piano Students have consistently performed well in various competitions.  For example, for a
number of years our students have won at the state level in the Collegiate Auditions sponsored by the
Music Teachers National Association.  Two of our Students then went on to win the Southern Division
title of this contest, and one was declared the national winner of this prestigious competition.  Our
Students have also successfully competed in the Collegiate Auditions of the South Carolina Federation
of Music Clubs.  We also have had a Student win the concerto competitions with the Savannah Symphony,
the Charleston Symphony, and the South Carolina Symphony Orchestra.  He then went on to perform
concertos with the Savannah Symphony and the South Carolina Philharmonic Orchestra.  One of our
graduates was one of the first recipients of the D.H. Baldwin Fellowship presented by the Baldwin Piano
and Organ Company to encourage excellence in the teaching of piano.  She has been a featured panelist
on two of the nationally-televised KTV (Keyboard television) Workshops.
<P>
The twice-monthly Sunday Vesper programs, sacred programs of music, speech, and drama, will
provide you opportunities for valuable performance experience.
<P>
The University Ministry Teams, which are made up of Students who are carefully selected for their
vocal, keyboard, instrumental, and speech abilities, travel throughout the United States for several months
each year ministering to local churches and Christian schools through unique presentations of sacred
music and Christian drama.
<P>
Modern Language Club is a trilingual organization composed of Students taking courses in French,
German, and Spanish.  You will be taking a modern language and will, therefore, have opportunity to
participate in this club.  It is the purpose of the club to stimulate an increased interest in the foreign
languages and culture.  In an informal atmosphere of entertainment, discussion, games, and reports, you
will gain valuable information and insight to further your knowledge and language skills.Fine Arts Contests in music, speech, art, and literature are held annually, and all Students have an
opportunity to compete in them.  Awards are given to winners in the field of piano, men's voice,
women's voice, organ, string, woodwind, brass, original oratory, dramatic reading, poetry, art,
photography, extemporaneous essay, and original hymn text writing.

teaching in a Christian school.  This program provides an excellent training ground for the pedagogy
internship in which you will have guided teaching experience in class piano and private piano at the
beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels.  You will learn to use computer technology in teaching in
the pedagogy laboratory which features a Roland digital piano, MT-100 Sequencer and Sound Module,

from the School of Business Administration.  Music instruction is offered without cost above the regular

</PRE>
<P>
You will give public recitals during your junior and senior years.
<hr><center><h2>             IV. FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES</h2></center><BR>

Our music facilities are the finest to be found in Fundamental Christian education today. In fact,
they are equal to and, in many cases, exceed what is found in the finest secular universities and
conservatories.  These include 30 faculty teaching studios, more than 60 Student practice studios (35
equipped and specially designated for music majors and minors and advanced Students), 5
rehearsal/classrooms, a music education laboratory/classroom, a piano pedagogy lab, a class piano lab
equipped with 15 Roland electronic pianos, 2 beautiful recital halls, and 2 large auditoriums for major
concerts and oratorio and opera performances.
<P>
In addition, our music library holds more than 9,000 records, tapes and CD's and is equipped with
modern equipment for your use.  It is a branch of our main library (the Mack Library), which has a
collection of more than 200,000 volumes, and it provides strong support in books, scores, and periodicals
for study and research.
<P>
The University seeks to provide the best equipment for the Division of Music and sees to it that this
equipment is in top condition.  There are over 160 pianos on Campus, including four concert grands, a
Bosendorfer Imperial Grand, and baby grands by Steinway, Chickering, Mason and Hamlin, Kawai,
and Yamaha.  The University also has a fine collection of string, woodwind, brass, and percussion
instruments--not only Student models for classroom and rental use but also a number of fine professional
model instruments to support advanced activities in the symphony orchestra, band, and in chamber music.
Organs include a 3-manual, 57-rank Zimmer pipe organ in Rodeheaver Auditorium; a 2-manual, 19-rank
Wicks pipe organ in the War Memorial Chapel; a 3-manual, 110-rank Allen computer organ in the
Founder's Memorial Amphitorium; and two smaller practice organs.  The University also owns a Tyre
and Goudzwaard harpsichord built in 1987.
<P>
Our piano Students have consistently performed well in various competitions.  For example, for four
of the past five years our students have won at the state level in the Collegiate Auditions sponsored by
the Music Teachers National Association.  Two of our Students then went on to win the Southern Division
title of this contest, and one was declared the national winner of this prestigious competition.  Our
Students have also successfully competed in the Collegiate Auditions of the South Carolina Federation
of Music Clubs.  We also have had a Student win the concerto competitions with the Savannah Symphony,
the Charleston Symphony, and the South Carolina Symphony Orchestra.  He then went on to perform
concertos with the Savannah Symphony and the South Carolina Philharmonic Orchestra.  One of our
graduates was one of the first recipients of the D.H. Baldwin Fellowship presented by the Baldwin Piano
and Organ Company to encourage excellence in the teaching of piano.  She has been a featured panelist
on two of the nationally-televised KTV (Keyboard Television) Workshops.
<P>
The twice-monthly Sunday Vesper programs, sacred programs of music, speech, and drama, will
provide you opportunities for valuable performance experience.
<P>
The University's precollege piano department teaches almost 300 young people in grades three through
twelve each semester.  This ready-made teaching laboratory provides an excellent training ground for the
pedagogy internship in which you will have guided teaching experience in class piano and private piano
at various levels.  You will gain valuable experience in working in a "real life" Christian school setting.
<P>
The University Ministry Teams, which are made up of Students who are carefully selected for their
vocal, keyboard, instrumental, and speech abilities, travel throughout the United States for several months
each year ministering to local churches and Christian schools through unique presentations of sacred
<P>
music and Christian drama.Fine Arts Contests in music, speech, art, and literature are held annually, and all Students have an
opportunity to compete in them.  Awards are given to winners in the field of piano, men's voice,
women's voice, organ, string, woodwind, brass, original oratory, dramatic reading, poetry, art,
photography, extemporaneous essay, and original hymn text writing.
<P>
Modern Language Club is a trilingual organization composed of Students taking courses in French,
German, and Spanish.  You will be taking a modern language and will, therefore, have opportunity to
participate in this club.  It is the purpose of the club to stimulate an increased interest in the foreign
languages and culture.  In an informal atmosphere of entertainment, discussion, games, and reports, you
will gain valuable information and insight to further your knowledge and language skills.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/fitness/">The Fremont Fitness Center gives you</A> the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a health club right on
Campus at no additional cost to you.  You can keep yourself in top-notch physical condition through the
use of its state-of-the-art exercise equipment, racquetball courts, spa, and sauna.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/library/">The modern Mack Library</A>, with 90,000 square feet of floor space and seating for over 1400 Students,
will give you access to 231,000 volumes, 1100 current periodical subscriptions, and more than 10,500
recordings.  An interlibrary loan program is available through OCLC, a national database, for books not
held in our library.
<P>
If you are planning to live on Campus, you will be glad to know that <a href="/studentlife/dorm/">all of our Dormitories are</A>air-

The faculty include several hymnplaying specialists, active church musicians who are skilled in
improvisation and who are also fine classical pianists.  They teach congregational playing and also hymn
transcription and arranging.


<hr><center><h2>                VI. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PLACEMENT</h2></center><BR>

Our piano pedagogy graduates have been very successful in setting up careers as private studio teachers
all across the country.  We also have graduates teaching in Christian schools.  There are usually more
requests for piano teachers in Christian schools than we have pedagogy graduates to fill.

<hr><center><h2>                      I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>
<P>
The prelaw major at BJU is designed to help you gain ready Admissions to law school and to be successful
in the pursuit of your law degree.  Beyond providing excellent Academic instruction, we want to help you
establish a strong spiritual and ethical basis on which to build your career in order that you might make
your influence felt in a contemporary society that gives increasing evidence of abandoning its Judeo-
Christian tradition in favor of a humanist-oriented philosophy.
<P>
Our prelaw curriculum was designed to reflect the broadly based undergraduate program recommended
by the Law School Admissions Council.  It emphasizes those Academically rigorous subjects which best
prepare an undergraduate Student for law school, featuring concentrations in English, writing, History,
political science, and economics.  Law school is about language--reading, writing, and speaking.  The
more essay tests and term papers you have to write during your college career, the greater are your
chances for success in law school.
<P>

<hr><center><h2>                             II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<BR>
<P>
      Principles of Accounting  In this class you will learn about the fundamental accounting
      procedures, journals, ledgers, financial statements, and uses made of accounting
      information.
<P>

      Principles of Economics  This course will give you an introduction to microeconomics
      necessary to an understanding of prices and markets, principles guiding individuals and
      firms making choices to maximize returns in a world of limited Resources, the structure
      of markets, and the factors of production.
<P>

      Critical Writing  This course teaches and provides techniques of analytical and evaluative
      writing with individual critiques of your own literary weaknesses by a published author.
      It is perhaps the most helpful course in the prelaw program in preparing you for law
      school.

<hr><center><h2>                             V. ABOUT THE FACULTY</h2></center><BR>

Because of its interdisciplinary nature, our prelaw program draws faculty from various University
departments.  These instructors, most of whom have graduate degrees in their field of specialty, enrich
the program through their variety of expertise and backgrounds.  You will thus be taught by experts in
writing, public speaking, constitutional History, government, etc., and you have the assurance that all
subject matter is taught from a Biblical perspective.  The coordinating prelaw advisor has a Ph.D. in
American legal History.



<hr><center><h2>                    VI. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PLACEMENT</h2></center><BR>

Although Admissions to law school is highly competitive, Academically qualified graduates of Bob Jones
University have had a 100 percent acceptance rate to law school over the last decade.  They have gone
to leading institutions in many states and have made outstanding records.  The top 1985 graduate from
Harvard Law School was a BJU alumnus.  Some years ago the Supreme Court of South Carolina
published guidelines for undergraduate prelaw curriculum, and we found that our program met every
specific suggestion.  Our graduates excel in law school because of our emphasis; and with our focus on
communication, our graduates excel in this critical area which tends to be a great difficulty for many law
Students.

<hr><center><h2>                  I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

Physical therapy as a profession is in a state of transition, and the pre-physical therapy major here at BJU
will put you on the cutting edge of the movement toward greater professionalism in this field.  The older
style hospital-type training programs are being phased out and a uniform program of preparation is being
put in their place.  This will consist of an undergraduate major in pre-physical therapy, and a master's
degree in physical therapy adding the final part of the preparation.  Because BJU's pre-physical therapy
major is built on the core of our highly successful and proven premed program, your chances of
successful entry into this exciting profession are excellent.

<hr><center><h2>                         II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<BR>
<P>
     Kinesiology  This course will give you the basic tools for analyzing the mechanical and
     anatomical fundamentals of human motion.  Muscular analysis of the movement of the
     human body is emphasized.
<P>
     Physiology of Exercise  What are the physiological principles of muscular action?  How
     can these principles be applied to practical use in therapy?  These and other areas will
     be explored by you as you participate in this course.
<P>
     Treatment and Care of Athletic Injuries  Athletic injuries are now a significant percentage
     of the patient needs seen by physical therapists.  You will learn how to prevent,
     recognize, refer, and provide follow-up care for most types of athletic injuries.
<P>

<hr><center><h2>                 III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to broaden your overall program by selecting courses you would like to take for your
own personal enjoyment.

including soccer, speedball, basketball, softball, track, volleyball, tennis, swimming, badminton, judo,
table tennis, racquetball, archery, wrestling, and indoor soccer.
<P>
The annual spring <a href="/special/bibleconf/">Bible Conference</a> is one of the outstanding features of the University and Academy
year.  Your regular academic work will be suspended for the Conference, during which you will hear
messages from outstanding Bible teachers, pastors, and evangelists.
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/library/">The modern Mack Library</A>, with 90,000 square feet of floor space and seating for over 1400 Students,
will give you access to 231,000 volumes, 1100 current periodical subscriptions, and more than 10,500
recordings.  An interlibrary loan program is available through OCLC, a national database, for books not
held in our library.
<P>
<a href="/whatsnew/chapel/">Chapel services are held every morning</A>, Monday through Friday.  These services are a source of great
inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>
when on the Campus, and in their absence by selected speakers.  One day each week the Chapel period
is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
If you are planning to live on Campus, you will be glad to know that <a href="/studentlife/dorm/">all of our Dormitories are</A>air-
conditioned, have wall-to-wall carpeting, and have a phone in each room.  You will be able to make long-
distance calls home directly from your room and have them automatically placed on your school bill.
<P>
All of our classrooms are air-conditioned, and there are awnings over the sidewalks to keep you dry when
it is raining.  <a href="/whatsnew/menu/">The Dining Common serves 8,500 delicious meals</A> a day, and the Snack Shop and
Bookstore <a href="/aboutbju/places/stucenter/">in the Student Center</a> carry just about anything you'll need.
<P>
You will find the finest Christian young people in the country are your fellow Students, and without
trying too hard, you may end up marrying one of them!
<P>
<a href="/aboutbju/places/fitness/">The Fremont Fitness Center gives you</A> the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a health club right on
Campus at no additional cost to you.  You can keep yourself in top-notch physical condition through the
use of its state-of-the-art exercise equipment, racquetball courts, spa, and sauna.                         V. ABOUT THE FACULTY
<P>
All instructors in the pre-physical therapy department have earned Ph.D. degrees in specific areas from
major universities around the country.  Various faculty members have specialized in microbiology,
genetics, zoology, parasitology, and anatomy.  Most of our pre-physical therapy faculty have 15 or more
years of college teaching experience.  They are highly qualified and vitally interested in the Academic as
well as the spiritual development of our Students.


<hr><center><h2>                VI. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PLACEMENT</h2></center><BR>

When you approach the conclusion of your bachelor's degree, you will begin to consider seriously where
you will pursue your graduate study.  BJU's enviable reputation for placing Students into advanced
medical studies (better than 50 percent in medical schools, for example) will be a great asset to you.  You
may choose to return to your home state, or you may prefer to remain in South Carolina for your
master's degree.  You will undoubtedly be interested to know that the Medical University of South
Carolina has indicated that our graduates will have the same admission status as S.C. residents since they
graduated from a S.C. postsecondary institution.  This fact alone increases greatly your opportunity for
acceptance.
<P>
What happens, however, if for some reason you decide not to continue with your plans toward physical
therapy?  Virtually all careers which are open to biology and/or chemistry majors would then be available
to you.  Of course, further study at the graduate level in biology or chemistry would be an option as well.


<hr><center><h2>                  VII. BJU:  AN AFFORDABLE EDUCATION</h2></center><BR>

Enclosed is an expense sheet detailing the cost of attending Bob Jones University.  When you compare
our charges to those of other private Colleges, we think you will be pleasantly surprised.  We believe we
offer a Student more value for his dollar than anyone else in America.  And to help you see how
affordable "the Opportunity Place" can be for you, we have enclosed a financial analysis form that you
can use to evaluate your own situation.  Your Admissions Counselor or the Director of Student Financial
Aid would be happy to discuss this with you if you have any questions.


<hr><center><h2>                    HOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. . .</h2></center><BR>

If you can see yourself in the career described in the profile, then a great opportunity awaits you at
Bob Jones University.  It is the opportunity for the premier Christian college experience in all the world.
It is the opportunity for learning, for fun, and for developing New Friendships.  It is the opportunity to
prepare for a lifetime of service for the Lord . . .

to enter your professional veterinary medicine study, but you will experience in addition some unique
advantages.  Since BJU owns and operates its own beef and dairy farm, you will have contact with
animals throughout your undergraduate program.  Independent study and "honest-to-goodness" individual
attention will round out what you will be sure to describe as ". . . the best program I could imagine."


<hr><center><h2>                         II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

     Principles of Animal Science  This course will acquaint you with the livestock industry
     and animal agriculture.  You will study individual species, the types, their purposes, and
     their products.
<P>
     Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy  This is a laboratory course which will teach you the
     various classes of vertebrate animals with an emphasis upon comparing the anatomy of
     various systems.  You will have the opportunity to dissect representative specimens of
     several classes of animals.
<P>
     Biochemistry  For two semesters you will be immersed in the world of proteins,
     enzymes, carbohydrates, lipids, bioenergetics, glycolysis, citric acid cycle, electron
     transport, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, molecular physiology, and
     molecular transMission of genetic information.
<P>

<hr><center><h2>                 III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

<hr><center><h2>                  I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

The print journalism major exists to meet the need for a vital, professionally enhanced Christian witness
through the print medium.  Christian young people who are verbally gifted and skilled in the means of
mass communication can offer the needed corrective to the current secular media.

<hr><center><h2>                         II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Lord in Missionary broadcasting and in domestic Christian radio and television stations as technicians,
performers, producers, writers, and managers.  Special emphasis is also given to the business aspects of
broadcasting and to broadcast journalism skills because those whom the Lord allows to rise to prominence
in the broadcast media have exceptional opportunity for public testimony and to be a positive influence
for righteousness in their communities.

<hr><center><h2>                      I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

The rhetoric and public address major is designed to prepare you for a career in teaching at either the
high school or college level.  You may also combine this program with a Bible program for use in a
dynamic pulpit ministry, or you may go into a field such as public relations, politics, law, etc.
<hr><center><h2>                             II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<BR>
<P>
      Fundamentals of Speech  This course will give you the basic principles of public speaking
      with special emphasis on platform techniques and a study of the different types of speech.
<P>
      Voice and Diction  In this course you will learn the practical application of the
      physiological backgrounds and diction with a view to improving your speaking voice.
      You will study the Application of phonetics in developing a General American standard
      of speech.
<P>
Persuasion  Here you will learn the theories of persuasion, and have an opportunity to
      apply them as you direct a persuasive campaign in your class.


<hr><center><h2>                     III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to (1) secure the equivalent of a double major by adding additional courses to your
selected minor field of study, (2) add a third field of interest to your program of study which is almost
the same as having two minors, or (3) broaden your program by selecting individual courses you would
like to take to help you in your future ministry or for your own personal enjoyment.

Performance Hall productions use the 140-seat thrust theatre in the Speech Building that provides for
four or five Student-directed performances each semester.  The repertoire includes sacred drama as well
as secular drama from the classics.  Through periodic auditions, many Students (including underclassmen)
are chosen for major and minor roles in these highly regarded, often sold-out productions.
<P>
Several major University productions are presented in the 2,600-seat Rodeheaver Auditorium, which
is one of the best equipped in the Southeast.  The mechanical equipment includes two electrically

photography, extemporaneous essay, and original hymn text writing.
<P>
The Classic Players is one of the outstanding college Shakespearean repertoire groups in the world.  If

productions are presented each year, including such great plays as HAMLET, JULIUS CAESAR,
MACBETH, THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, and THE MERCHANT OF VENICE.
<P>
The University Debate Association provides opportunity for you to compete in debate as a member of
your society.  Each society participates in several elimination contests throughout the school year to
determine the winner of the University cup which is awarded during Commencement week.  The
University also sponsors debate teams which compete in tournaments several times throughout the year.
Over the years our teams have established an outstanding record and an excellent reputation in
competition at the national and regional levels.
<P>
The University's drama ensemble, Truth in Action, travels for a semester or a summer, presenting the
Gospel in churches and schools across America.

in combination as a double major with Bible for a dynamic preaching ministry, or for a career in sales,
public relations, communications consulting, radio, or writing.  Of course, this major can also be used
to prepare you for a teaching ministry in either the public or private field at either the high school or
college level.  Graduates from our speech programs are on the faculties of most of the major Fundamental
Christian Colleges and universities.

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<br>
<P>
            General Teaching Methods  This course has been evaluated by our graduates as one of
            the most practical they have taken at BJU.  It will give you the opportunity to prepare
            lesson plans, teach lessons, and be videotaped and evaluated by an experienced instructor.
            You will also get "hands on" experience in the University's well-equipped media center,
            where you will learn how to operate and use state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment.

<P>
            History of Civilization  You will especially enjoy this class, which is taught by
            Dr. Edward Panosian.  This lecture class is supplemented by smaller, personal classes
            where you will have many opportunities to ask questions and gain insights you may have
            missed in the lectures.  In this class you will learn the complete History of civilization as
            "His Story," that is, the story of God's providential workings through nations and men.
<P>

            Directed Teaching  Here you will have a chance to "try your wings" by teaching under
            the supervision of an experienced teacher.  You will begin gradually and work into
            handling a teacher's normal load.

You will be eligible to apply for the Daniel J. Carrison Americanism Scholarship when you get here
as a student.  The recipient will be chosen on the basis of a paper written on Americanism.  (The specific

possible.  You will have the opportunity to compete in a wide variety of both team and individual sports
including soccer, speedball, basketball, softball, track, volleyball, tennis, swimming, badminton, judo,
table tennis, racquetball, archery, wrestling, and indoor soccer.
<P>
The Association of Christian Teachers is an integral part of the Education Department.  Films,
programs, and activities are correlated very closely to the emphasis of the individual classes.  This
organization will provide you with opportunities for leadership training and professional contact.  Each
of the 12 professional education departments elects representatives to serve as officers.  Prospective
teachers are urged to become members of the A.C.T.  The A.C.T. awards a medal annually to the best
elementary Student teacher and the best secondary Student teacher.  By doing your best while you are a
Student here, you might be able to win that award.
<P>
On the National Teacher Examinations, our education Students have received mean scores well above
the national average since 1951.
<P>
The Media Center contains all the audiovisual equipment you are likely to use in teaching, including
equipment for preparing transparencies, videotapes, laminated bulletin board figures, slide presentations,
signs, and duplicating equipment.  You will learn how to use these various machines under the guidance
of our trained and dedicated staff.  The Media Center is also equipped with various curriculum materials,

inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>
when on the Campus, and in their absence by selected speakers.  One day each week the Chapel period
is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
Because of our care and concern for the spiritual as well as the physical needs of the people in our
part of the country, Students are encouraged to be involved in outreach Ministries in our area.  While you
are here you will have the opportunity to participate in as many of these Ministries as you can fit into
your schedule.  These opportunities vary from work in nursing homes, jails, detention centers, and
churches, to visitation, Bible clubs, providing special music, martial arts teams, and mime teams.

<hr><center><h2>                  I. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR</h2></center><BR>

We offer a full major and minor in Spanish.  You may complete the program in residence without extra
requirements of study abroad or at a different college.  We offer beginning, intermediate, and advanced
courses as well as a full range of upper-level literature and culture courses.  Our instructional approach
emphasizes in equal proportion all four language skills:  i.e., listening, speaking, reading, and writing
on all levels.



<hr><center><h2>                         II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

     Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--
<P>
     Spanish Conversation and Composition  This course will help you to increase your
     fluency in speaking and writing Spanish.
<P>
     Civilization of Latin America  Here you will study the various social and cultural
     elements of contemporary Latin America as seen from sociological, historical, political,
     and literary points of views.

     literature from the earliest ballads to the modern period.



<hr><center><h2>                 III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to (1) secure the equivalent of a double major by adding additional courses to your
selected minor field of study, (2) add a third field of interest to your program of study which is almost
the same as having two minors, or (3) broaden your program by selecting individual courses you would
like to take to help you in your future ministry or for your own personal enjoyment.

You will have at least three good teaching opportunities to choose from as you look for a place to teach.

      are looking for in teaching positions.  As requests come in for our education graduates, this office
      attempts to match up requests with qualified seniors.  This could be the means the Lord uses to show
      you where He would have you serve Him.

<hr><center><h2>                                            II. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS</h2></center><BR>

Here are some of the courses in the program you will especially enjoy--<BR>
<P>
            General Teaching Methods  This course has been evaluated by our graduates as one of
            the most practical they have taken at BJU.  It will give you the opportunity to prepare
            lesson plans, teach lessons, and be videotaped and evaluated by an experienced instructor.
            You will also get "hands on" experience in the University's well-equipped media center,
            where you will learn how to operate and use state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment.
<P>
            Dramatic Production, Public Speaking, Oral Interpretation  You will be able to
            concentrate your studies in one of these areas, but you will get to take classes in all three.
            In your dramatic production courses, you will learn the fundamentals of stage production,
            culminating in a laboratory production.  In your accompanying classes you will learn
            stage makeup, lighting, costuming, scene construction, acting, and directing.  In public
            speaking you will learn how to organize, prepare, and deliver speeches for different
            occasions.  There will be an emphasis in this course on adapting your speech to your
            audience.  Parallel courses will cover parliamentary procedure, rhetoric, and debate.  In
            your oral interpretation classes you will learn how to effectively communicate poetry,
            dramatic and narrative literature, Scripture, and stories.
<P>
            Directed Teaching  Here you will have a chance to "try your wings" by teaching under
            the supervision of an experienced teacher.  You will begin gradually and work into
            handling a teacher's normal load.


<hr><center><h2>                                    III. A TYPICAL YEARLY COURSE SEQUENCE</h2></center><BR>

This is a suggested program of study for you.  You understand that other refinements to your program
can be made when you consult your faculty advisor at the time of your enrollment.
<P>
You will notice that some courses are listed as electives.  These electives give you the opportunity to
tailor your program to (1) secure the equivalent of a double major by adding additional courses to your
selected minor field of study, (2) add a third field of interest to your program of study which is almost
the same as having two minors, or (3) broaden your program by selecting individual courses you would
like to take to help you in your future ministry or for your own personal enjoyment.

Each year we send a team to intercollegiate forensics tournaments, and our teams have consistently
made a fine record in competition with other major schools in the Southeast.  You will have opportunities
to fine tune your interpretation and public speaking skills through preparation for these tournaments.
<P>
You will also have the opportunity to participate in our well-developed debate program in either our
intramural competition (featuring 52 teams) or our interscholastic teams which regularly compete in the
National Cross-Examination Debate Association (CEDA).  Our interscholastic team has consistently been
rated among the top 10 percent of the schools in the country and frequently achieves enviable
accomplishments.
<P>
We have semi-monthly Vesper services on Campus featuring a sacred program of drama, interpretation,
and music.  You will have opportunities to participate in these programs.  These services, both devotional
and cultural, attract many visitors from the community.
<P>
The Classic Players is one of the outstanding college Shakespearean repertoire groups in the world.  If
you are interested, you should try out for this group when tryouts are held in the fall.  Two major
productions are presented each year, including such great plays as HAMLET, JULIUS CAESAR,
MACBETH, THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, and THE MERCHANT OF VENICE.
<P>
If you are interested in interpretation, acting, or dramatic production, the Classic Players would afford
an excellent opportunity for you to get more experience working with one of the top acting groups in
existence.
<P>
Each year we sponsor Fine Arts Contests in original oratory, dramatic reading, poetry, and
extemporaneous essay.  You will be able to test your skills against your fellow Students in this exciting
competition.  The finals will be held Commencement week, and attendance will be open to the whole
University family.We have several official and unofficial speech teams which go out from the University on weekends
and minister in churches and Christian schools through their speaking talents (interpretative readings,
small dramas, etc.).  We also have a speech ensemble which travels across the U.S. presenting the Gospel
in churches through the medium of interpretative speech and drama.
<P>
Performance Hall Productions use the 140-seat thrust theatre in the Speech Building that provides for
four or five Student-directed performances each semester.  The repertoire includes sacred drama as well
as secular drama from the classics.  Through periodic auditions, many Students (including underclassmen)
are chosen for major and minor roles in these highly regarded, often sold-out productions.
<P>
In the various recital and performance halls around Campus you will be able to enjoy the on-Campus
programs (and/or participate in them).  These facilities include the 800-seat Concert Center, the 400-seat
Baroque style War Memorial Chapel, the 7,000-seat Founder's Memorial Amphitorium, similar in design
to an enclosed Greek amphitheater, and the 2,600-seat Rodeheaver Auditorium.  The Auditorium is one
of the best-equipped in the Southeast.  Its mechanical equipment includes two electronically controlled
contour curtains, a revolving stage, and orchestra and stage lifts.  It also has a scene shop, property
rooms, storage docks, dressing rooms, and an extensive wardrobe of about 2,500 costumes for
productions set in any era.  It has a 45-foot wide by 30-foot high proscenium and a 65-foot fly area from
the stage floor to the lighting grid.  It is equipped with numerous lighting instruments and has a five-
scene, preset dimmer control board.  It also has a 3,500-pipe organ.
<P>
<a href="/whatsnew/chapel/">Chapel services are held every morning</A>, Monday through Friday.  These services are a source of great
inspiration to Students.  Four days a week the Chapel message is brought by the Chancellor or <a href="/aboutbju/president/">President</a>

is devoted to the meetings of various literary societies.  Two meetings each month are devoted to
Missionary programs and speakers.
<P>
Because of our care and concern for the spiritual as well as the physical needs of the people in our
part of the country, Students are encouraged to be involved in outreach Ministries in our area.  While you

<LI>       Teaching English in third world countries.  This is one of the best opportunities for Missionary work
       available today.  Many countries that are closed to traditional Missionaries have an enormous demand
       for teachers of American English.  You can be self-supporting while using your teaching contacts to
       give the gospel.
<LI>       Teaching English to foreign Students in the U.S.
<LI>       Teaching English in public or Christian junior or senior High Schools
<LI>       Writing textbooks (especially after having some teaching experience)
<LI>       Freelance writing
<LI>       Writing for industry
<LI>       Graduate school
<LI>       Law school
</ol>
       The following placement services will be available to you:
<P>
       The University sponsors a Principals' Recruitment Conference each February.  Approximately 180
       administrators and principals from many states and some foreign countries gather to interview and hire
       New teachers for their schools.  This Conference will give you many opportunities to find a place of
       service after you graduate.
<P>
       The Office of the Dean of the School of Education maintains a file of graduating seniors and what they
       are looking for in teaching positions.  As requests come in for our education graduates, this office
       attempts to match up requests with qualified seniors.  This could be the means the Lord uses to show
       you where He would have you serve Him.
<P>
       The Media Center maintains a file of miscellaneous information about various Christian schools across
       the country.  This file, too, may provide you with the contact that could lead to many years of active
       service for the Lord.
<P>
       The Office of Career Development and Placement can help you find employment within industry.
       They can also put you in contact with organizations that can assist you in finding employment in
       foreign countries.

Bob Jones University is located in <a href="http://cybercity.piedmont.net/%7Egcc/">Greenville, South Carolina</a>. The city is situated in the northwestern part of the state in the foothills of the Great Smokey Mountains. It is in the heart of the swiftly growing "I-85" corridor, being 100 miles Southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina and 150 miles Northeast of Atlanta, Georgia. The city has a population of 60,000 while Greenville County now has well over 300,000 citizens.
<BR><BR>
While Greenville at one time was known primarily for its textile mills,
industry has diversified to include the North American Headquarters of
Michelin and the only <a href="http://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</a> assembly plant
in the U.S., as well as large manufacturing facilities for Texize, <a href="http://www.hii.hitachi.com/">Hitachi</a>,
Digital Electronics, and many other national and international companies.
The city has a large retail community, anchored by three major shopping malls.
Special attractions in the community include the Peace Center for the
Performing Arts and the Greenville Braves, the Double A affliate of the
<a href="http://www4.nando.net/SportServer/baseball/mlb/atl.html">Atlanta Braves</a>.
<BR><BR>
The area is served by the Greenville-Spartanburg Jetport, while major
connecting traffic arteries are Interstate 85, U.S. 29, and U.S. 25.
The costs of living and housing are below the national average, even with
the strong growth the area is experiencing. Greenville has a<a href="http://sercc.dnr.state.sc.us/sc/"> mild climate</A>,
with average temperatures of 78 in the summer and 48 in the winter.
Rainfall is moderate. If you would like to see a recent photo (within the last 5 minutes) of Greenville, <A HREF="http://www.xcelsoft.com/live.html">click here.</a>

 To view graphical illustrations of the below instructions, <a href="how_grph.html">click
here</a> (low speed connections beware!) <br> <br>
 1. At the home page of the Linked Word Project
 choose the book you wish to view. &nbsp;You may choose the book from the table by placing
your cursor over the book you wish to read and clicking. <br> <br>
 2. That will take you to the chapter index for the book you choose.
 Once there you click on the chapter you wish to read. <br> <br>
 3. Your hypertext options continue once you are viewing the text of
 the chapter you chose. &nbsp;Notice the <a HREF="what.html">asterisks</a>: they will take
you to a page listing the greek parsing for the verb preceding it. <br> <br>
 4. The options continue! You will notice that every word of the text
 has a link. &nbsp;By clicking on any word in the text you can learn its lexicon meaning. 
<br> <br>
 5. Once you have viewed the information you wish to see, the fastest
 way to get back to the chapter you were reading is to press the BACK button of your browser.
&nbsp;However, the <img src="pic/hom.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0  height=24 width =25
